punch<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.190> sport<00:01:59.460> setting<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.060> really

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
punch up the sport setting and it really

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.930 
punch up the sport setting and it really
handles<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.050> lot<00:02:01.200> better<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.789> couple<00:02:02.789> things

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
handles a lot better a couple things

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.870 
handles a lot better a couple things
about<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.450> Honda<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.679> I<00:02:04.710> came<00:02:05.069> away<00:02:05.190> medial

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
about the Honda that I came away medial

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.190 
about the Honda that I came away medial
impressed<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.479> beyond<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.440> engine

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.990 

some<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> best<00:02:11.130> brakes<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.790> seems

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
some of the best brakes and it seems

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.370 
some of the best brakes and it seems
like<00:02:12.150> we're<00:02:12.330> saying<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.660> all<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> time<00:02:13.140> but

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
like we're saying this all the time but

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.740 
like we're saying this all the time but
an<00:02:13.920> ikemen<00:02:14.220> will<00:02:14.459> probably<00:02:14.790> agree<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
an ikemen will probably agree that the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.070 
an ikemen will probably agree that the
braking<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.800> VFR<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.480> stellar<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.599> don't

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
braking on the VFR is stellar I don't

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.199 
braking on the VFR is stellar I don't
know<00:02:19.260> how<00:02:19.800> they<00:02:19.980> keep<00:02:20.190> doing<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.670> making<00:02:21.000> it

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
know how they keep doing it making it

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.390 
know how they keep doing it making it
better<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.720> even<00:02:22.349> more<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.860> same<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
better and even more so same with the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.440 
better and even more so same with the
transmission<00:02:25.069> it's<00:02:26.069> transparent<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
transmission it's transparent to the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.180 
transmission it's transparent to the
point<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:28.020> if<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.410> didn't<00:02:28.770> have<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> gear

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
point that if I didn't have a gear

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.130 
point that if I didn't have a gear
position<00:02:29.400> indicator<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.360> wouldn't<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:30.959> known

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
position indicator I wouldn't have known

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.729 
position indicator I wouldn't have known
I<00:02:31.260> changed<00:02:31.650> gears<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.670> virtually<00:02:33.390> flawless

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
I changed gears it's virtually flawless

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.800 
I changed gears it's virtually flawless
so<00:02:34.739> again<00:02:35.040> classic<00:02:35.610> Honda<00:02:35.940> they're<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.300> this

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
so again classic Honda they're in this

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.110 
so again classic Honda they're in this
day<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.019> ride<00:02:37.350> by<00:02:37.560> wire<00:02:37.590> throttle<00:02:38.030> there's<00:02:39.030> a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
day of ride by wire throttle there's a

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.400 
day of ride by wire throttle there's a
lot<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.330> good<00:02:39.480> things<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.930> said<00:02:40.110> about<00:02:40.140> them

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
lot of good things to be said about them

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.839 
lot of good things to be said about them
but<00:02:40.530> both<00:02:40.739> these<00:02:40.950> bikes<00:02:41.250> have<00:02:41.489> little

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
but both these bikes have little

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.660 
but both these bikes have little
glitchyness<00:02:42.660> as<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.989> them<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.590> BMW<00:02:44.220> when

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
glitchyness as to them the BMW when

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.520 
glitchyness as to them the BMW when
you're<00:02:44.819> sport<00:02:45.180> riding<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.870> get<00:02:45.989> back<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
you're sport riding you get back on the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.229 
you're sport riding you get back on the
throttle<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:47.010> seems<00:02:47.220> like<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.610> get<00:02:47.970> away<00:02:48.060> from

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
throttle it seems like to get away from

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.940 
throttle it seems like to get away from
the<00:02:48.540> abruptness<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.140> some<00:02:49.319> of<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.500> ride<00:02:49.769> by

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the abruptness of some of the ride by

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.520 
the abruptness of some of the ride by
wire<00:02:49.980> fuel<00:02:50.880> injection<00:02:51.299> systems<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:52.350> thing

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
wire fuel injection systems this thing

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.320 
wire fuel injection systems this thing
comes<00:02:52.739> on<00:02:52.890> rather<00:02:53.220> slow<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.150> it's

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
comes on rather slow kind of like it's

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.620 
comes on rather slow kind of like it's
got<00:02:54.510> richly<00:02:55.319> jetted<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.819> VFR<00:02:57.239> on<00:02:57.540> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
other hand it's can be abrupt when

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.410 
other hand it's can be abrupt when
you're<00:03:00.930> from<00:03:01.290> closed<00:03:01.530> throttle<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.160> open<00:03:02.519> it's

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
you're from closed throttle to open it's

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.630 
you're from closed throttle to open it's
not<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.630> major<00:03:03.870> deal<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.489> is

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
not a major deal but it is it is

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.699 
not a major deal but it is it is
something<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.150> walk<00:03:06.299> ride<00:03:06.510> around

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
something you have to walk ride around

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.140 
something you have to walk ride around
where<00:03:07.709> these<00:03:07.890> bikes<00:03:08.160> share<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> lot<00:03:08.970> of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
where these bikes share a lot of

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.900 
where these bikes share a lot of
similarity<00:03:09.840> they<00:03:10.080> both<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.560> about<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.700> same

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
similarity they both have about the same

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.240 
similarity they both have about the same
quality<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.450> wind<00:03:12.660> protection<00:03:13.010> you're<00:03:14.010> going

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
quality of wind protection you're going

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.740 
quality of wind protection you're going
to<00:03:14.310> get<00:03:14.459> quite<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.150> bit<00:03:15.329> of<00:03:15.420> wind<00:03:15.540> protection

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
to get quite a bit of wind protection

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.479 
to get quite a bit of wind protection
but<00:03:16.170> you're<00:03:16.290> still<00:03:16.530> out<00:03:16.799> there<00:03:16.829> in<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.310> wind

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
but you're still out there in the wind

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.150 
but you're still out there in the wind
like<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.790> sport<00:03:18.180> bike<00:03:18.359> -<00:03:18.660> if<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.320> want<00:03:19.730> also<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
like a sport bike - if you want also the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.740 
like a sport bike - if you want also the
comfort<00:03:23.160> level<00:03:23.280> between<00:03:23.940> these<00:03:24.269> two<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.570> terms

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
comfort level between these two in terms

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.280 
comfort level between these two in terms
of<00:03:24.930> rider<00:03:25.170> triangle<00:03:26.750> for<00:03:27.750> my<00:03:27.840> taste

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
of rider triangle for my taste

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
of rider triangle for my taste
I<00:03:28.380> think<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> Honda<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> little<00:03:29.220> more

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
I think the Honda is a little more

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.000 
I think the Honda is a little more
comfortable<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.209> more<00:03:30.450> Mariah's

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
comfortable and is more Mariah's

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.120 
comfortable and is more Mariah's

what are in essence clip-ons where the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.330 
what are in essence clip-ons where the
BMW<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.690> kind<00:03:37.109> of<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.260> one-piece<00:03:37.500> bar<00:03:38.070> system

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
BMW is kind of a one-piece bar system

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.960 
BMW is kind of a one-piece bar system
and<00:03:38.730> it's<00:03:39.030> much<00:03:39.239> flatter<00:03:39.799> lower<00:03:40.799> bar<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.400> found

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
and it's much flatter lower bar I found

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.540 
and it's much flatter lower bar I found

feel<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:53.660> everything<00:03:54.020> on<00:03:54.170> them<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.890> just

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
feel it and everything on them is just

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.840 
feel it and everything on them is just
smooth<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:55.850> well<00:03:56.810> sorted<00:03:57.370> like<00:03:58.370> Pete<00:03:58.610> says

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
smooth and well sorted like Pete says

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.940 
smooth and well sorted like Pete says
these<00:03:59.120> are<00:03:59.180> both<00:03:59.630> pretty<00:04:00.050> smooth<00:04:00.320> engines<00:04:00.740> but

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
these are both pretty smooth engines but

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.640 
these are both pretty smooth engines but
the<00:04:01.160> BMW<00:04:01.760> keeps<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:02.540> smooth<00:04:02.840> by<00:04:03.080> having<00:04:03.380> at<00:04:03.470> all

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
the BMW keeps it smooth by having at all

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.920 
the BMW keeps it smooth by having at all
six<00:04:04.010> gear<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.970> you're<00:04:05.210> revving<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.600> up<00:04:05.690> higher

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
six gear if you're revving it up higher

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.240 
six gear if you're revving it up higher
in<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.140> rev<00:04:06.290> range<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.740> actually<00:04:07.070> does

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
in the rev range it actually does

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.180 
in the rev range it actually does
produce<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:08.150> fair<00:04:08.360> bit<00:04:08.570> of<00:04:08.660> vibration<00:04:09.020> but<00:04:09.710> the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
produce a fair bit of vibration but the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.490 
produce a fair bit of vibration but the
gearing<00:04:10.430> can<00:04:10.700> compensate<00:04:11.120> whereas<00:04:11.990> the<00:04:12.080> Honda

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
gearing can compensate whereas the Honda

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.670 
gearing can compensate whereas the Honda
was<00:04:13.160> running<00:04:13.460> down<00:04:13.610> highway<00:04:13.940> 33<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.780> wasn't

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
was running down highway 33 and wasn't

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.080 
was running down highway 33 and wasn't
even<00:04:15.830> recognizing<00:04:16.430> what<00:04:16.549> gear<00:04:16.760> is<00:04:16.850> in<00:04:17.000> a

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
even recognizing what gear is in a

even recognizing what gear is in a
second<00:04:17.480> gear<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.930> then<00:04:18.080> on<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.500> straightaway

I'm<00:04:19.190> hitting<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.640> rev<00:04:19.790> limiter<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.299> felt<00:04:20.660> Legos

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
I'm hitting the rev limiter I felt Legos

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.050 
I'm hitting the rev limiter I felt Legos
around<00:04:21.200> five<00:04:21.530> or<00:04:21.560> six<00:04:21.739> thousand<00:04:22.250> rpm<00:04:22.670> it<00:04:22.970> was

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
around five or six thousand rpm it was

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.120 
around five or six thousand rpm it was
that<00:04:23.240> smooth<00:04:23.630> that's<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.350> really<00:04:24.620> sweet<00:04:24.770> motor

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
that smooth that's a really sweet motor

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.310 
that smooth that's a really sweet motor
in<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.430> Honda<00:04:25.750> so<00:04:26.750> at<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.960> end<00:04:27.080> of<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.200> day

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
in the Honda so at the end of the day

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.250 
in the Honda so at the end of the day
two<00:04:27.430> observations<00:04:28.430> one<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.510> Honda<00:04:29.900> is<00:04:29.960> really

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
two observations one the Honda is really

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.030 
two observations one the Honda is really
good<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:31.300> two<00:04:32.300> we<00:04:33.200> were<00:04:33.320> impressed<00:04:33.650> with<00:04:33.950> how

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
good and two we were impressed with how

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.340 
good and two we were impressed with how
well<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.520> BMW<00:04:35.090> stacked<00:04:35.480> up<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.020> brand<00:04:36.260> new

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
well the BMW stacked up to the brand new

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.040 
well the BMW stacked up to the brand new
Honda<00:04:36.590> but<00:04:37.520> really<00:04:37.880> in<00:04:38.150> your<00:04:38.660> refinement<00:04:39.350> and

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
Honda but really in your refinement and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.189 
Honda but really in your refinement and
views<00:04:40.849> it's<00:04:41.849> hard<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.120> beat<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.270> on<00:04:42.599> a<00:04:42.629> VFR

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
views it's hard to beat that on a VFR

00:04:43.199 --> 00:05:01.040 
views it's hard to beat that on a VFR
1200<00:04:43.770> M
