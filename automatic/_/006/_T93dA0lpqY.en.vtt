00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.770 

didn't<00:01:09.670> really<00:01:09.850> take<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.149> time<00:01:10.329> to<00:01:10.450> find<00:01:10.689> out

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
didn't really take the time to find out

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.239 
didn't really take the time to find out
exactly<00:01:10.929> what<00:01:11.319> any<00:01:11.499> of<00:01:11.590> these<00:01:11.770> things<00:01:11.979> were

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
exactly what any of these things were

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:15.419 
exactly what any of these things were
really<00:01:13.319> we<00:01:14.319> do<00:01:14.469> know<00:01:14.619> it's<00:01:14.799> a<00:01:14.920> snake<00:01:15.189> but<00:01:15.340> we

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
really we do know it's a snake but we

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:16.669 
really we do know it's a snake but we
don't<00:01:15.609> know<00:01:15.670> what<00:01:15.789> kind<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.119> is

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679

they're<00:01:17.679> pets<00:01:18.009> if<00:01:18.280> they're<00:01:18.460> out<00:01:18.549> in<00:01:18.579> the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
they're pets if they're out in the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.459 
they're pets if they're out in the
nature<00:01:18.939> we<00:01:19.359> would<00:01:19.780> probably<00:01:19.960> feel<00:01:20.229> more

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
nature we would probably feel more

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.109 
nature we would probably feel more
inclined<00:01:20.799> find<00:01:21.159> exactly<00:01:21.549> what<00:01:21.670> they<00:01:21.850> are<00:01:21.969> but

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
inclined find exactly what they are but

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.959 
inclined find exactly what they are but
when<00:01:22.299> they're<00:01:22.509> in<00:01:22.899> a<00:01:23.020> pet<00:01:23.200> shop
