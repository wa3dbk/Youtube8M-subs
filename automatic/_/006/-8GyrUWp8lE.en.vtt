these<00:00:12.809> stats<00:00:13.019> were<00:00:13.170> all<00:00:13.349> collected<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
these stats were all collected and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.250 
these stats were all collected and
calculated<00:00:14.639> by<00:00:14.790> me<00:00:14.969> personally<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:15.900> I'm<00:00:15.990> very

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
calculated by me personally so I'm very

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.660 
calculated by me personally so I'm very
confident<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.890> their<00:00:17.039> accuracy

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
confident in their accuracy

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.340 
confident in their accuracy
although<00:00:17.970> numbers<00:00:18.330> such<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.660> rate<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.109> fire

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
although numbers such as rate of fire

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.189 
although numbers such as rate of fire
may<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.740> rounded<00:00:20.310> slightly<00:00:20.779> also<00:00:21.779> these<00:00:21.930> stats

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
may be rounded slightly also these stats

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.170 
may be rounded slightly also these stats
were<00:00:22.380> collected<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:22.949> launch<00:00:23.279> day<00:00:23.400> they

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
were collected on launch day they

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.759 
were collected on launch day they
probably<00:00:24.449> will<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.960> patched<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> future

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
probably will be patched in the future

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.800 
probably will be patched in the future
but<00:00:26.130> stick<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.490> me<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.570> will

let you know about those patches when

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.269 
let you know about those patches when
they<00:00:29.550> happen<00:00:30.529> alright<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.830> let's<00:00:31.980> jump<00:00:32.189> right

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
they happen alright so let's jump right

different ranges the first number is the
number<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.379> bullets<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.800> takes<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.100> kill<00:00:50.280> at

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
number of bullets it takes to kill at

as you can see the scar-h comes out on

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.619 
as you can see the scar-h comes out on
top<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.980> category<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:03.030> kills<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.449> just

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
top in this category it kills in just

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
top in this category it kills in just
three<00:01:03.840> bullets<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:04.320> any<00:01:04.500> range<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.430> mtar<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
three bullets at any range the mtar and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
three bullets at any range the mtar and
the<00:01:06.060> an-94<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:07.020> also<00:01:07.200> considered<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.710> be<00:01:07.860> high

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the an-94 are also considered to be high

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.859 
the an-94 are also considered to be high
damage<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:08.850> kill<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.180> three<00:01:09.450> bullets<00:01:09.750> at

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
damage as they kill in three bullets at

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.830 
damage as they kill in three bullets at
close<00:01:09.900> range<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> four<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.040> long<00:01:11.220> range<00:01:11.840> so

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
close range and four at long range so

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.270 
close range and four at long range so
the<00:01:12.930> next<00:01:13.140> categories<00:01:13.680> we're<00:01:13.799> gonna<00:01:13.890> look<00:01:14.100> at

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the next categories we're gonna look at

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.700 
the next categories we're gonna look at
our<00:01:14.490> rate<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.820> fire<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> time<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.810> kill<00:01:15.990> time

our rate of fire and time to kill time

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
our rate of fire and time to kill time
to<00:01:16.860> kill<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> based<00:01:17.400> off<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> rate<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.119> fire<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
to kill is based off of rate of fire and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080 
to kill is based off of rate of fire and
bullet<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> kill<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.400> assumes<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.790> every

bullet to kill and it assumes that every

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.789 
bullet to kill and it assumes that every
bullet<00:01:21.270> hits<00:01:21.540> its<00:01:21.689> target<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> guns<00:01:22.650> would

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
bullet hits its target so the guns would

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.050 
bullet hits its target so the guns would
the<00:01:22.890> fastest<00:01:23.310> time<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.490> kill<00:01:23.759> don't

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the fastest time to kill don't

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
the fastest time to kill don't
necessarily<00:01:24.810> kill<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> fastest<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.830> reality

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
necessarily kill the fastest in reality

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
necessarily kill the fastest in reality
because<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:27.150> don't<00:01:27.330> always<00:01:27.540> land<00:01:28.170> every

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
because they don't always land every

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.980 
because they don't always land every
bullet<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.920> target<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:30.299> quick<00:01:30.509> thing<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.840> want

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
bullet on target one quick thing I want

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
bullet on target one quick thing I want
to<00:01:31.049> point<00:01:31.200> out<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.829> an-94<00:01:32.610> fires<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
to point out is that the an-94 fires a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.580 
to point out is that the an-94 fires a
two-round<00:01:33.479> burst<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> first<00:01:34.380> shot

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
two-round burst with the first shot

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.679 
two-round burst with the first shot
fired<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.520> realistically<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.479> kill<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
fired so realistically it can kill a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.050 
fired so realistically it can kill a

to<00:02:10.619> aim<00:02:10.739> down<00:02:10.770> sight<00:02:11.250> which<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.730> actually<00:02:12.120> only

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
to aim down sight which is actually only

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.970 
to aim down sight which is actually only
a<00:02:12.360> couple<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.750> hundreds<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.140> second

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
a couple of hundreds a second

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.070 
a couple of hundreds a second
slower<00:02:14.340> than<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> SMGs<00:02:15.209> but<00:02:15.660> we'll<00:02:15.930> cover

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
slower than the SMGs but we'll cover

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.259 
slower than the SMGs but we'll cover
that<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.470> later<00:02:16.590> video<00:02:16.830> now<00:02:17.730> let's<00:02:17.910> move<00:02:18.090> on

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
that in a later video now let's move on

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.300 
that in a later video now let's move on
to<00:02:18.390> reload<00:02:18.900> time<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.860> without<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.280> fast

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
to reload time this is without the fast

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.070 
to reload time this is without the fast
mag<00:02:20.700> attachment<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.780> time<00:02:21.959> it

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
mag attachment and this is the time it

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.050 
mag attachment and this is the time it
takes<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.379> reload<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:23.129> reload<00:02:23.580> cancelling

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
takes to reload with reload cancelling

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.940 
takes to reload with reload cancelling
so<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.870> isn't<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.170> time<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:25.470> takes<00:02:25.590> for<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
so this isn't the time it takes for the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.160 
so this isn't the time it takes for the
full<00:02:26.129> reload<00:02:26.519> animation<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.209> take<00:02:27.360> place<00:02:27.599> this

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
full reload animation to take place this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.780 
full reload animation to take place this
is<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.440> fastest<00:02:28.860> possible<00:02:29.069> time<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.730> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
is the fastest possible time that you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.610 
is the fastest possible time that you
can<00:02:29.940> reload<00:02:30.269> each<00:02:30.450> gun<00:02:30.750> because<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.349> want<00:02:31.530> to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
can reload each gun because we want to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.020 
can reload each gun because we want to
know<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.830> true<00:02:32.010> potential<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.610> each<00:02:32.760> gun

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
know the true potential of each gun

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.699 
know the true potential of each gun
rather<00:02:33.720> than<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.050> time<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.230> takes<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
rather than the time it takes the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.949 
rather than the time it takes the
average<00:02:34.830> newb<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.459> reload<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.910> if<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.780> don't

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
average newb to reload it if you don't

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.300 
average newb to reload it if you don't
already<00:02:37.110> know<00:02:37.260> what<00:02:37.470> reload<00:02:37.769> cancelling<00:02:38.160> is

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
already know what reload cancelling is

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.339 
already know what reload cancelling is
I'll<00:02:38.519> be<00:02:38.670> doing<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.940> video<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.480> soon<00:02:39.720> but

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
I'll be doing a video on it soon but

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.530 
I'll be doing a video on it soon but
basically<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.340> allows<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.819> use<00:02:42.299> your

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
basically it allows you to use your

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.380 
basically it allows you to use your
weapon<00:02:42.989> faster<00:02:43.379> after<00:02:43.560> reloading<00:02:44.220> also<00:02:45.209> this

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
weapon faster after reloading also this

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.970 
weapon faster after reloading also this
reload<00:02:45.720> time<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:45.959> not<00:02:46.349> from<00:02:46.650> an<00:02:46.739> empty

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
reload time is not from an empty

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.039 
reload time is not from an empty
magazine<00:02:47.459> since<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> majority<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> time

when<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.380> reload<00:02:49.769> there's<00:02:50.190> still<00:02:50.459> some<00:02:50.700> rounds

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
when we reload there's still some rounds

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.750 
when we reload there's still some rounds
on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.120> magazine<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.010> fastest<00:02:53.370> reloading

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
on the magazine so the fastest reloading

have<00:03:10.799> 30<00:03:11.130> rounds<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.640> each<00:03:11.790> magazine<00:03:12.709> so

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
have 30 rounds in each magazine so

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.020 
have 30 rounds in each magazine so
finally<00:03:14.160> we're<00:03:14.340> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.489> look<00:03:14.549> at<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:14.940> of

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
finally we're going to look at one of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.699 
finally we're going to look at one of
the<00:03:15.120> most<00:03:15.239> important<00:03:15.810> stats<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.319> gun<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
the most important stats of a gun and

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.830 
the most important stats of a gun and
that's<00:03:17.010> its<00:03:17.190> recoil<00:03:17.640> pattern<00:03:18.000> I'm<00:03:18.420> going<00:03:18.750> to

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
that's its recoil pattern I'm going to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.120 
that's its recoil pattern I'm going to
show<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.230> clips<00:03:19.440> with<00:03:19.590> me<00:03:19.680> testing<00:03:20.069> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
show you the clips with me testing the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.830 
show you the clips with me testing the
recoil<00:03:20.489> so<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.880> see<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.329> range<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.690> was

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
recoil so you can see the range I was

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.629 
recoil so you can see the range I was
shooting<00:03:22.109> from<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.190> everything<00:03:23.549> is

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
shooting from and see that everything is

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:29.440 
shooting from and see that everything is
kept<00:03:23.910> consistent

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.030 

so<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.569> Empire<00:03:30.900> has<00:03:31.080> quite<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.379> tight<00:03:31.620> grouping

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
so the Empire has quite a tight grouping

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.800 
so the Empire has quite a tight grouping
but<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.370> recoil<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.970> relatively<00:03:33.540> random

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
but the recoil is relatively random

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.140 
but the recoil is relatively random
within<00:03:34.379> that<00:03:34.560> grouping<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.550> longer<00:03:35.910> range

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
within that grouping so longer range

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.520 
within that grouping so longer range
shots<00:03:36.420> will<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.780> difficult<00:03:37.349> without

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
shots will be difficult without

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.020 
shots will be difficult without
peppering<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.160> trigger<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.879> don't

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
peppering the trigger because you don't

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.600 
peppering the trigger because you don't
know<00:03:39.180> which<00:03:39.450> way<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:39.780> gun<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.050> going<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.260> kick

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
know which way the gun is going to kick

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.089 
know which way the gun is going to kick
so<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.730> type<00:03:41.879> 25<00:03:42.300> has<00:03:42.599> quite<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.379> hard<00:03:43.680> recoil

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
so the type 25 has quite a hard recoil

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.400 
so the type 25 has quite a hard recoil
that<00:03:44.310> kicks<00:03:44.519> up<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.150> right<00:03:45.269> but<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.290> is

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
that kicks up and to the right but it is

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.380 
that kicks up and to the right but it is
very<00:03:46.680> predictable<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.489> can<00:03:47.760> control<00:03:48.209> it

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
very predictable so you can control it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.680 
very predictable so you can control it
the<00:03:49.379> m27<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.280> pretty<00:03:50.610> much<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.940> ACR<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.540> this

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
the m27 is pretty much the ACR of this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.110 
the m27 is pretty much the ACR of this
game<00:03:51.930> accuracy<00:03:52.680> wise<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:53.459> has<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.610> very<00:03:53.879> tight

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
game accuracy wise it has a very tight

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.059 
game accuracy wise it has a very tight
grouping<00:03:54.540> even<00:03:54.989> when<00:03:55.140> fired<00:03:55.379> full<00:03:55.650> auto<00:03:55.830> so

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
grouping even when fired full auto so

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.910 
grouping even when fired full auto so
it's<00:03:56.220> awesome<00:03:56.610> at<00:03:56.730> longer<00:03:57.239> range<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:58.650> scar-h

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
it's awesome at longer range the scar-h

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.490 
it's awesome at longer range the scar-h
kicks<00:03:59.489> upward<00:03:59.910> very<00:04:00.299> hard<00:04:00.599> one<00:04:01.290> good<00:04:01.470> thing

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
kicks upward very hard one good thing

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.259 
kicks upward very hard one good thing
about<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.980> recoil<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.579> though<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.970> the

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
about the recoil of this though is the

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.910 
about the recoil of this though is the
fact<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:03.720> kicks<00:04:03.989> pretty<00:04:04.319> much<00:04:04.500> straight

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
fact that it kicks pretty much straight

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.680 
fact that it kicks pretty much straight
up<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.430> doesn't<00:04:05.610> sway<00:04:05.910> left<00:04:06.120> or<00:04:06.329> right<00:04:06.510> too

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
up and it doesn't sway left or right too

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.360 
up and it doesn't sway left or right too
much<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.530> as<00:04:07.650> long<00:04:07.739> as<00:04:07.890> you're<00:04:07.980> able<00:04:08.160> to<00:04:08.190> manage

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
much so as long as you're able to manage

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.190 
much so as long as you're able to manage
the<00:04:08.670> upward<00:04:09.030> kick<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.599> can<00:04:09.750> still<00:04:09.989> remain

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
the upward kick you can still remain

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.259 
the upward kick you can still remain
quite<00:04:10.560> accurate<00:04:11.040> with<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:11.250> weapon<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.760> it

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
quite accurate with this weapon and it

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.199 
quite accurate with this weapon and it
might<00:04:12.510> even<00:04:12.780> result<00:04:13.079> in<00:04:13.290> extra<00:04:13.920> head<00:04:14.069> shots<00:04:14.340> so

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
might even result in extra head shots so

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.199 
might even result in extra head shots so
finally<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.900> an-94<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.340> recoil<00:04:17.729> pattern<00:04:17.790> on

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
finally the an-94 the recoil pattern on

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.060 
finally the an-94 the recoil pattern on
this<00:04:18.329> rifle<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.900> upwards<00:04:19.470> with<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.709> fairly

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
this rifle is upwards with a fairly

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.129 
this rifle is upwards with a fairly
large<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.669> random<00:04:21.150> side-to-side<00:04:21.570> sway

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
large and random side-to-side sway

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.110 
large and random side-to-side sway
I<00:04:22.410> wouldn't<00:04:23.310> recommend<00:04:23.430> firing<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.060> weapon

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
I wouldn't recommend firing this weapon

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.840 
I wouldn't recommend firing this weapon
full<00:04:24.750> auto<00:04:24.960> at<00:04:25.260> any<00:04:25.560> range<00:04:25.889> but<00:04:26.310> remember<00:04:26.760> it

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
full auto at any range but remember it

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.340 
full auto at any range but remember it
has<00:04:26.880> that<00:04:27.120> two<00:04:27.330> round<00:04:27.539> burst<00:04:27.780> for<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.139> first

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
has that two round burst for the first

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.200 
has that two round burst for the first
two<00:04:28.500> shots<00:04:28.740> so<00:04:29.460> if<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.639> pepper<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:30.000> trigger

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
two shots so if you pepper the trigger

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.360 
two shots so if you pepper the trigger
you<00:04:30.449> not<00:04:30.660> only<00:04:30.810> reduce<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.320> recoil<00:04:31.500> but<00:04:32.250> you

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
you not only reduce the recoil but you

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.450 
you not only reduce the recoil but you
also<00:04:32.550> increase<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.240> fire<00:04:33.419> rate<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:35.160> before<00:04:35.430> I

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
also increase the fire rate so before I

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.770 
also increase the fire rate so before I
show<00:04:35.639> you<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.820> complete<00:04:36.120> graph<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.570> all<00:04:36.720> the

show you the complete graph of all the

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.570 
show you the complete graph of all the
stats<00:04:37.169> I<00:04:37.440> just<00:04:37.710> want<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:37.889> quickly<00:04:38.039> remind<00:04:38.460> you

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
know it's a lot of information to sink

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.390 
know it's a lot of information to sink
in<00:04:45.660> all<00:04:45.900> at<00:04:46.169> once<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.680> you'll<00:04:46.950> probably<00:04:47.099> want

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
in all at once and you'll probably want
