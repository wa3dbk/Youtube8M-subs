so a great green craft you're starting

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
so a great green craft you're starting
with<00:00:26.970> cereal<00:00:27.420> box<00:00:27.660> upcycling<00:00:28.349> exactly<00:00:29.010> in

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
with cereal box upcycling exactly in

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.800 
with cereal box upcycling exactly in
each<00:00:29.250> cereal<00:00:29.580> box<00:00:29.760> depending<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> size

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
each cereal box depending on the size

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.370 
each cereal box depending on the size
can<00:00:31.230> get<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> four<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.520> six<00:00:32.790> covers<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.200> we

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
can get you a four to six covers so we

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.920 
can get you a four to six covers so we
cut<00:00:34.590> these<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:36.719> we're<00:00:36.840> going

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
cut these out and and then we're going

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.630 
cut these out and and then we're going
to<00:00:36.989> paint<00:00:37.200> them<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.590> I'm<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.129> too<00:00:38.430> concerned

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to paint them and I'm not too concerned

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.010 
to paint them and I'm not too concerned
about<00:00:38.850> some<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> background<00:00:39.750> showing

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
about some of the background showing

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
about some of the background showing
here<00:00:40.440> because<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.280> adds<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.640> little

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
here because it just adds a little

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030 
here because it just adds a little
texture<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.329> hidden<00:00:42.570> enough<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> don't

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
texture it's hidden enough so you don't

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
texture it's hidden enough so you don't
know<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.750> textural<00:00:45.750> enough<00:00:45.989> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
know what it is but textural enough that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.190 
know what it is but textural enough that
you<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.800> thicker<00:00:47.670> paint<00:00:48.200> exactly

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
you get a little thicker paint exactly

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.510 
you get a little thicker paint exactly
so<00:00:49.500> you're<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> cover<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.280> whole

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
so you're going to cover this whole

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.279 
so you're going to cover this whole
thing<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> are<00:00:51.390> using<00:00:51.570> an<00:00:51.750> acrylic<00:00:52.079> paint

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
thing and you are using an acrylic paint

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.319 
thing and you are using an acrylic paint

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
heavy bodied like a thinner acrylic

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
heavy bodied like a thinner acrylic

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.770 
wouldn't work you could use a craft
paint<00:00:59.309> tube<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.239> would<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:00.510> ahead<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
it's always a little deceiving so I like

to<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.580> test<00:02:20.940> paper<00:02:21.240> right<00:02:21.600> I

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
to have a little test paper right I

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.360 
to have a little test paper right I
always<00:02:21.840> liked<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> dimension<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.040> because

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
always liked the dimension on it because

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.650 
always liked the dimension on it because
then<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.640> really<00:02:24.030> feel<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:24.300> not<00:02:24.630> only

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
then you really feel like not only

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.660 
then you really feel like not only
visually<00:02:24.990> is<00:02:25.350> their<00:02:25.500> texture<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:25.950> actually

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
visually is their texture but actually

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.820 
visually is their texture but actually
there's<00:02:26.940> daster<00:02:27.480> any<00:02:27.690> way<00:02:27.870> i<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.020> add<00:02:28.290> texture

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
there's daster any way i can add texture

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.190 
there's daster any way i can add texture
makes<00:02:29.670> me<00:02:29.940> happy<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.450> doesn't<00:02:30.780> matter<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.080> i'm

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200

this so i can actually write because i'm
not<00:02:46.350> capable<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.890> writing<00:02:47.070> upside<00:02:47.280> down<00:02:47.670> yet

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
not capable of writing upside down yet

not capable of writing upside down yet
i'm<00:02:48.870> working<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.430> we<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:50.670> travel

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
journal and then when that dries i can

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.410 
journal and then when that dries i can
go<00:02:54.000> back<00:02:54.030> over<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:55.459> another<00:02:56.459> pen<00:02:56.820> okay

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.650 
the black adds that nice contrast that
you<00:03:05.220> see<00:03:05.519> everything<00:03:05.910> else<00:03:06.209> much<00:03:06.420> back

to do is just hold a metal ruler it

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.789 
to do is just hold a metal ruler it
works<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.030> best<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:55.230> then<00:03:55.410> I'm<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.739> the

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
just something that will fit in the

just something that will fit in the
cover<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.769> like<00:03:58.950> there's<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.220> rule<00:03:59.519> on<00:03:59.880> how

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
cover is that like there's a rule on how

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.440 
cover is that like there's a rule on how
big<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.360> has<00:04:00.450> exactly<00:04:00.870> all<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.620> these<00:04:01.860> um<00:04:02.450> you

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
big it has exactly all of these um you

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.180 
big it has exactly all of these um you
can<00:04:03.630> adjust<00:04:03.750> if<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.260> want<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.500> make<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.680> large

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
size journal you can definitely do that

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.569 
size journal you can definitely do that
you're<00:04:07.290> sort<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.560> limited<00:04:07.890> by<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.070> size<00:04:08.340> of

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
you're sort of limited by the size of

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.640 
you're sort of limited by the size of
the<00:04:08.670> giant<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.090> lot<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.360> watercolor<00:04:09.810> paper<00:04:10.019> but

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
edge so it looks uniform and I can slide

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.610 
edge so it looks uniform and I can slide
it<00:04:22.500> down<00:04:22.700> hmm<00:04:24.020> we've<00:04:25.020> got<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.169> measurement<00:04:25.470> at

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
it down hmm we've got a measurement at

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.230 
it down hmm we've got a measurement at
the<00:04:25.680> bottom<00:04:26.010> two<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:26.580> exactly

the bottom two so exactly
so<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.389> had<00:04:27.539> little<00:04:27.780> exceeded<00:04:28.229> ahead<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.530> time

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
so I had little exceeded ahead of time

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.110 
so I had little exceeded ahead of time
and<00:04:28.680> put<00:04:28.919> little<00:04:29.069> marks<00:04:29.340> on<00:04:29.460> there<00:04:29.639> yeah<00:04:29.819> so

to<00:04:44.669> score<00:04:45.210> it<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.419> we're<00:04:45.509> going<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.690> use<00:04:45.810> a

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
to score it and we're going to use a

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.659 
to score it and we're going to use a
bone<00:04:46.050> folder<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.530> score<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:47.430> course<00:04:47.580> is

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
bone folder to score it of course is

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.159 
bone folder to score it of course is
important<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.150> score<00:04:48.270> especially<00:04:48.509> a<00:04:48.930> heavy

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
important to score especially a heavy

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.689 
important to score especially a heavy
paper<00:04:49.440> like<00:04:49.680> watercolor<00:04:50.130> paper<00:04:50.310> so<00:04:50.520> John

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
paper like watercolor paper so John

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.430 
paper like watercolor paper so John
crack<00:04:51.000> exactly<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.780> don't<00:04:51.930> want<00:04:52.139> Kirk<00:04:52.349> you

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
crack exactly you don't want Kirk you

crack exactly you don't want Kirk you
don't<00:04:52.560> your<00:04:52.710> pages<00:04:52.979> to<00:04:53.099> fall<00:04:53.220> out<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.400> your

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
don't your pages to fall out of your

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.950 
don't your pages to fall out of your
book<00:04:53.639> after<00:04:53.849> you've<00:04:54.090> added<00:04:54.180> all<00:04:54.419> those<00:04:54.630> things

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
book after you've added all those things

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.290 
book after you've added all those things
so<00:04:55.680> we're<00:04:56.009> going<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.370> go<00:04:56.490> ahead<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.729> score<00:04:57.120> to

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
so we're going to go ahead and score to

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.730 
so we're going to go ahead and score to
score<00:04:57.419> it<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:57.780> make<00:04:57.990> your<00:04:58.169> marks<00:04:58.440> where<00:04:58.650> you

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
score it you make your marks where you

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.860 
score it you make your marks where you
want<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:59.009> fold<00:04:59.130> your<00:04:59.340> your<00:04:59.819> book<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.659> again

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
want to fold your your book and again

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.180 
want to fold your your book and again
the<00:05:00.960> rule<00:05:01.139> on<00:05:01.259> this<00:05:01.380> is<00:05:01.530> just<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:01.830> that<00:05:01.949> it<00:05:02.039> fits

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
the rule on this is just so that it fits

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.920 
the rule on this is just so that it fits
in<00:05:02.370> whatever<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.880> size<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.180> cover<00:05:03.389> exactly

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
in whatever the size the cover exactly

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.589 
in whatever the size the cover exactly
so<00:05:04.139> I<00:05:04.349> think<00:05:04.979> this<00:05:05.370> piece<00:05:05.580> is<00:05:05.699> about<00:05:05.819> 13<00:05:06.360> and

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
so I think this piece is about 13 and

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.170 
so I think this piece is about 13 and
three-quarters<00:05:07.199> but<00:05:07.979> if<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.699> wanted<00:05:09.030> more

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
three-quarters but if you wanted more

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.330 
three-quarters but if you wanted more
pages<00:05:09.479> you<00:05:09.750> wanted<00:05:09.990> you<00:05:10.409> would<00:05:10.530> just<00:05:10.710> extend

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
pages you wanted you would just extend

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.249 
pages you wanted you would just extend
it<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:11.580> decide<00:05:12.270> how<00:05:12.599> big<00:05:12.900> you<00:05:13.050> want<00:05:13.139> your

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
it and decide how big you want your

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.219 
it and decide how big you want your
pages<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:13.830> keep<00:05:14.460> multiplying<00:05:14.789> those<00:05:15.030> pages<00:05:15.300> I

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
pages and keep multiplying those pages I

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.379 
pages and keep multiplying those pages I
like<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:16.949> use<00:05:17.130> a<00:05:17.159> bone<00:05:17.370> folder<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.849> score<00:05:18.150> you

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
like to use a bone folder to score you

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.020 
like to use a bone folder to score you
could<00:05:18.509> also<00:05:18.659> use<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:19.020> dry<00:05:19.680> embossing<00:05:19.800> tool<00:05:20.370> but

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
could also use a dry embossing tool but

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.490 
could also use a dry embossing tool but
I<00:05:21.060> always<00:05:21.270> have<00:05:21.569> this<00:05:21.720> this<00:05:21.900> is<00:05:22.080> like<00:05:22.229> in<00:05:22.380> my

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
I always have this this is like in my

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.409 
I always have this this is like in my
back<00:05:22.680> pocket<00:05:23.099> if<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.280> had<00:05:23.460> a<00:05:23.490> tool<00:05:23.789> belt<00:05:24.060> it<00:05:24.270> will

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
back pocket if I had a tool belt it will

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.719 
back pocket if I had a tool belt it will
be<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.780> behind<00:05:25.319> your<00:05:25.470> favorite<00:05:25.650> tool<00:05:25.979> exactly

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
be the behind your favorite tool exactly

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.999 
be the behind your favorite tool exactly
so<00:05:27.210> when<00:05:27.539> you're<00:05:27.659> finished<00:05:28.110> scoring<00:05:28.620> and

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
so when you're finished scoring and

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.399 
so when you're finished scoring and
folding<00:05:29.490> what<00:05:29.909> you<00:05:30.090> want<00:05:30.330> is<00:05:30.630> sort<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.050> your

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
folding what you want is sort of your

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.249 
folding what you want is sort of your
little<00:05:31.560> book<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.130> then<00:05:32.909> your<00:05:33.300> accordion<00:05:33.810> fold

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
little book and then your accordion fold

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.439 
little book and then your accordion fold
that<00:05:34.770> comes<00:05:35.039> right<00:05:35.159> out<00:05:35.219> of<00:05:35.340> there<00:05:35.789> exactly

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
that comes right out of there exactly

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.430 
that comes right out of there exactly
and<00:05:37.110> so<00:05:37.169> I<00:05:37.349> would<00:05:37.530> use<00:05:37.710> my<00:05:37.860> bone<00:05:38.039> folder<00:05:38.070> to

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
and so I would use my bone folder to

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.659 
and so I would use my bone folder to
flatten<00:05:40.440> that<00:05:40.560> out<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:41.159> really<00:05:41.400> get<00:05:41.550> those

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
flatten that out and really get those

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.480 
flatten that out and really get those
examples<00:05:42.120> in<00:05:43.020> there<00:05:43.169> now<00:05:43.770> I<00:05:43.800> have<00:05:44.070> my<00:05:44.250> cover

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
examples in there now I have my cover

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.180 
examples in there now I have my cover
here<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.120> I've<00:05:45.419> already<00:05:45.740> scored<00:05:46.740> actually<00:05:47.159> I

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
here and I've already scored actually I

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.950 
here and I've already scored actually I
used<00:05:47.340> my<00:05:47.520> bone<00:05:47.669> folder<00:05:47.699> I've<00:05:48.210> marks<00:05:48.599> the

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
used my bone folder I've marks the

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.749 
used my bone folder I've marks the
halfway<00:05:49.110> point<00:05:49.380> and<00:05:49.860> scored<00:05:50.219> this<00:05:50.370> so<00:05:50.550> now<00:05:50.729> I

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
halfway point and scored this so now I

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.360 
halfway point and scored this so now I
can<00:05:50.969> fold<00:05:51.449> this<00:05:51.659> okay<00:05:52.320> another<00:05:52.949> hardboard

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
can fold this okay another hardboard

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.740 
can fold this okay another hardboard
folds<00:05:53.610> really<00:05:53.789> easily<00:05:54.030> because<00:05:54.210> again<00:05:54.479> once

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
folds really easily because again once

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.330 
folds really easily because again once
you<00:05:54.840> scored<00:05:55.229> something<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:55.860> just<00:05:55.919> makes<00:05:56.190> it

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
you scored something it just makes it

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.309 
you scored something it just makes it
easy<00:05:56.699> so<00:05:57.270> this<00:05:57.479> is<00:05:57.509> super<00:05:57.780> easy<00:05:57.930> you're<00:05:58.199> just

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
easy so this is super easy you're just

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.589 
easy so this is super easy you're just
going<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.560> stick<00:05:58.800> that<00:05:59.460> opening<00:05:59.940> fold<00:06:00.240> part

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
going to stick that opening fold part

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.300 
going to stick that opening fold part
and<00:06:00.930> you're<00:06:00.990> gonna<00:06:01.139> make<00:06:01.349> three<00:06:01.770> holes<00:06:02.009> and

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
and you're gonna make three holes and

simple way if you don't have we're using

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.580 
simple way if you don't have we're using
a<00:06:10.560> waxed<00:06:10.979> linen<00:06:11.130> thread<00:06:11.599> about<00:06:12.599> 12<00:06:13.050> inches<00:06:13.229> and
