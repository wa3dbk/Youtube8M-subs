00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
first sight i think is a load of shit

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.039 
first sight i think is a load of shit
yes<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.700> exists<00:01:18.240> however<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.720> phrase

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
yes it exists however as the phrase

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.320 
yes it exists however as the phrase
would<00:01:19.229> suggest<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.860> its<00:01:20.070> site<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.210> you

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
would suggest it's its site so what you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.350 
would suggest it's its site so what you
love<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.960> what<00:01:22.170> they<00:01:22.320> look<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.360> that's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
love is what they look like and that's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
love is what they look like and that's
not<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> just

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
not really what I'm all about so I just

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.410 
not really what I'm all about so I just
think<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.820> load<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> absolute

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
point my favorite tattoo one myself is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.069 
point my favorite tattoo one myself is
probably<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.040> moth<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.549> my<00:02:05.759> sternum<00:02:06.210> however

after<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.770> fuck<00:02:08.039> wit<00:02:08.250> from<00:02:08.780> one<00:02:09.780> direction

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
after that fuck wit from one direction

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.320 
after that fuck wit from one direction
got<00:02:10.590> pretty<00:02:10.860> much<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.190> same<00:02:11.340> thing<00:02:11.400> everyone

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
got pretty much the same thing everyone

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.460 
got pretty much the same thing everyone
started<00:02:12.720> getting<00:02:12.959> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
started getting it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.900 
started getting it
and<00:02:13.560> now<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.800> kind<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.190> don't<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:14.880> much

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and now I kind of don't like it as much

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.400 
and now I kind of don't like it as much
because<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.570> feels<00:02:15.780> really<00:02:15.990> like<00:02:16.230> one<00:02:16.380> of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
because it feels really like one of

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.740 
because it feels really like one of
those<00:02:16.530> commercial<00:02:17.040> tattoos<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.330> don't<00:02:18.630> know
