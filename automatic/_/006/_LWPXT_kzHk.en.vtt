00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.770
 hi friends, let's go, sports, it's a pleasure 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.470
 to be able to greet them as I was seeing in 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.530
 screen thousands of media 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.440
 is what brought the press conference 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.770
 of ronaldo if the real ronaldo the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.820
 chubby who today was pronounced 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.309
 as a new partner part of the property 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.830
 of the team of the strikers a team of 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.360
 the second division of soccer 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.360
 American and which he hinted 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.239
 who can possibly play a game 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.329
 or maybe more depending on your state 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.309
 physical the former front forward of real 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.410
 madrid and of course the corinthias 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.690
 let's listen to the words of 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.240
 chubby from the press conference the 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.759
 which one feels happy to be part of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.050
 this team from the second division of 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.050
 american football 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.110
 for me it 's an honor I'm very excited 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.300
 to be here very happy happy 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.940
 and as a boy we are I think that 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.340
 we have a possibility 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.600
 and it's a very special moment for the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.350
 soccer in usa so let's go to work 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.780
 very hard to make the costumes 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.780
 an increasingly bigger team stronger 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.979
 I will try it during the season 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.510
 train a lot and you can come a lot to 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.480
 strengthen it 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.080
 so 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.140
 we will have yes yes I will be ready 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.860
 to play a game but I have a lot 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.130
 illusion even to do it 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 people are very excited about the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.140
 football 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.780
 we have very important data of 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.480
 feedback in the usa 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.400
 It is the second market that most practices 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.730
 soccer in the world so 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.420
 it's a very good growth and we're going to 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.500
 take advantage of this possibility to create 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.680
 many new players 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.319
 and further encourage soccer in the USA 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.240
 yes I think it was very successful and 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.400
 successful the decision I think that 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.460
 in the last two years Christian 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.070
 ronaldo goes over messi 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.550
 just a little bit and I think that both 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.550
 they are the best players in the world and 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.220
 and anyone who gives it deserves it 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.830
 this is how you start writing the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.370
 new history of ronaldo in football 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.120
 American as a shareholder as 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.880
 partner or maybe as a player of this 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.400
 league like I ever did I fought with 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.540
 the new york cosmos in the camera 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.810
 Mauritius Country 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.810
