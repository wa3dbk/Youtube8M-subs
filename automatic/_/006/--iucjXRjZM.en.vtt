and so on the first thing you'd probably

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.749 
and so on the first thing you'd probably
ask<00:01:24.150> me<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.740> tools<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
ask me for would be the right tools the

just buy off the shelf a follow-up
project<00:01:44.340> or<00:01:44.520> game<00:01:44.759> will<00:01:45.179> use<00:01:45.359> the<00:01:45.600> same<00:01:45.869> code

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
project or game will use the same code

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649

and<00:01:47.009> tools<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.399> we've<00:01:47.609> produced<00:01:47.969> and<00:01:48.270> they

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and tools that we've produced and they

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.419 
and tools that we've produced and they
can<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:48.960> straight<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.530> making<00:01:49.889> the<00:01:49.979> game<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
can go straight into making the game and

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.569 
can go straight into making the game and
producing<00:01:51.060> cool<00:01:51.270> games<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.719> everybody

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
currently I'm working on a spline tool

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
currently I'm working on a spline tool
that<00:01:55.770> means<00:01:55.950> spines<00:01:56.399> are<00:01:56.549> basically<00:01:56.880> curved

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that means spines are basically curved

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.809 
that means spines are basically curved
so<00:01:57.539> I'm<00:01:57.810> trying<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> make<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> tool<00:01:59.249> to<00:01:59.520> help

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
so I'm trying to make a tool to help

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.139 
so I'm trying to make a tool to help
people<00:02:00.329> put<00:02:00.899> things<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.439> curves<00:02:01.999> lionhead<00:02:02.999> has

a<00:02:24.320> little<00:02:24.590> bit<00:02:24.770> more<00:02:24.890> recognizable<00:02:25.670> over<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
a little bit more recognizable over the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.700 
a little bit more recognizable over the
Russian<00:02:26.270> really<00:02:26.720> hardcore<00:02:27.020> indoors<00:02:27.440> game

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
Russian really hardcore indoors game

Russian really hardcore indoors game
version<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.300> bottled<00:02:29.870> out<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.290> went

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
version and I can bottled out and went

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.350 
version and I can bottled out and went
for<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.680> film<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:32.080> before<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.110> was<00:02:33.380> it

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
for the film but before I was it

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.790 
for the film but before I was it
I<00:02:34.420> don't<00:02:34.990> seem<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.320> getting<00:02:35.440> anywhere

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
I don't seem to be getting anywhere

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.880 
I don't seem to be getting anywhere
really<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:38.050> might<00:02:38.380> need<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.620> go<00:02:38.710> for<00:02:38.860> a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
really but I might need to go for a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.490 
really but I might need to go for a
little<00:02:38.980> sit-down<00:02:39.750> one<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.930> things<00:02:41.200> that's

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
little sit-down one of the things that's

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.080 
little sit-down one of the things that's
a<00:02:41.650> real<00:02:41.830> struggle<00:02:42.100> for<00:02:42.370> game<00:02:42.460> developers<00:02:42.850> is

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
a real struggle for game developers is

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.540 
a real struggle for game developers is
fitting<00:02:43.660> all<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.170> those<00:02:44.260> assets<00:02:44.770> into<00:02:45.190> memory

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
fitting all of those assets into memory

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.480 
fitting all of those assets into memory
and<00:02:45.580> onto<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.150> DVDs<00:02:46.920> what<00:02:47.920> we've<00:02:48.100> done<00:02:48.130> is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
and onto the DVDs what we've done is

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.310 
and onto the DVDs what we've done is
develop<00:02:48.700> some<00:02:49.180> compression<00:02:49.690> routines<00:02:49.930> that

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
develop some compression routines that

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.160 
develop some compression routines that
squashes<00:02:51.100> down<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.670> data<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.110> will

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
squashes down the data so that it will

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.350 
squashes down the data so that it will
fit<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.010> available<00:02:54.460> memory<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:55.240> we've

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
fit in the available memory and we've

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.660 
fit in the available memory and we've
done<00:02:55.540> this<00:02:55.750> with<00:02:56.110> animations<00:02:57.070> which<00:02:57.400> take<00:02:57.640> up

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
done this with animations which take up

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.700 
done this with animations which take up
huge<00:02:58.180> amounts<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.690> memory<00:02:58.900> uncompressed

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
huge amounts of memory uncompressed

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.920 
huge amounts of memory uncompressed
we've<00:03:00.550> done<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.760> with<00:03:00.850> textures<00:03:01.420> which<00:03:01.690> are

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
we've done it with textures which are

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.380 
we've done it with textures which are
the<00:03:02.200> sort<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.470> beautiful<00:03:03.220> pictures<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.209> go

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
the sort of beautiful pictures that go

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.660 
the sort of beautiful pictures that go
onto<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.840> meshes<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.350> we<00:03:05.470> create<00:03:05.830> in<00:03:06.130> an

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
onto the meshes that we create in an

onto the meshes that we create in an
animation<00:03:07.090> which<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.959> basically<00:03:08.380> the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
animation which is basically the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.840 
animation which is basically the
movement<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.040> character<00:03:09.459> around<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
movement of the character around the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.850 
movement of the character around the
world<00:03:10.060> we've<00:03:10.600> managed<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.020> squeeze<00:03:11.470> those

down<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.790> just<00:03:12.970> one<00:03:13.390> percent<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:14.080> their

in Lyon heads as we are focused on
creating<00:03:46.970> games<00:03:47.930> which<00:03:48.440> costs<00:03:48.830> tens<00:03:49.130> of

bit of blue sky thinking one example of
that<00:04:04.040> is<00:04:04.490> we<00:04:05.240> thought<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.690> would<00:04:05.780> be<00:04:05.870> very

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
that is we thought that would be very

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.380 
that is we thought that would be very
interesting<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:07.160> look<00:04:07.280> at<00:04:07.490> new<00:04:08.000> types<00:04:08.270> of

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
interesting to look at new types of

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.470 
interesting to look at new types of
combat<00:04:08.660> we<00:04:09.230> wanted<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.620> experiment<00:04:10.010> with

something<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:11.630> really<00:04:11.900> brought<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:12.530> drama

something that really brought the drama

something that really brought the drama
out<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.400> combat<00:04:13.840> drama<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:15.080> important<00:04:15.770> and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
out of combat drama is important and

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.150 
out of combat drama is important and
vital<00:04:16.160> for<00:04:16.730> combat<00:04:17.299> because<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.380> gives<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:19.040> a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
vital for combat because it gives it a

itself<00:04:31.669> so<00:04:32.419> we<00:04:32.540> can<00:04:32.690> use<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:32.990> lot<00:04:33.200> of<00:04:33.230> stuff<00:04:33.530> from

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
itself so we can use a lot of stuff from

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.030 
itself so we can use a lot of stuff from
movies<00:04:34.250> such<00:04:34.850> as<00:04:34.880> camera<00:04:35.660> work<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.350> use<00:04:36.770> it

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
movies such as camera work and use it

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.280 
movies such as camera work and use it
and<00:04:37.700> we<00:04:37.820> can<00:04:37.940> also<00:04:38.060> use<00:04:38.480> everything<00:04:39.140> that

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
and we can also use everything that

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.360 
and we can also use everything that
we've<00:04:39.380> got<00:04:39.500> any<00:04:39.650> game<00:04:39.860> with<00:04:40.070> slight
