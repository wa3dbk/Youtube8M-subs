00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.059
 hello everyone I am going to explain how to convert a chori editions asked 10 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.390
 At any given moment I can do at any time a laptop 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.949
 through the internet mobile 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.739
 for this we are going to take the terminal 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.519
 we're going at least 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.380
 there were many adjustments 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.140
 within settings 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.999
 we search 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.689
 Applications 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.689
 of applications we look for development 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.140
 in development we have to mark 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.500
 debugging vs betis in my case I do not have marked 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.580
 and simulated location 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.960
 states boxes 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.170
 is for the application we give status below 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.510
 can access two data spaces 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.940
 the drums were 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.020
 our car thing marked 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.350
 we go to the sea that 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.810
 and we are going to look 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.130
 an application that is called 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.450
 d tÃ¡nit 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.200
 tevenet 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.270
 and in this case and I have to put 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.270
 came in and as you can see there are two applications 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.899
 mtl and another one that is also 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.340
 in the same style 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.620
 but 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.620
 in this case we want how tele works 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.560
 lala moss 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.950
 as always they give advice 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.260
 it's not the people and officials of running 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.450
 we were 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.369
 tell us everything you can do everything you can do 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.090
 This application 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.090
 affection for unstable obligation 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.900
 net percent that is being installed 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.920
 we can all say 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.160
 we want or approving only has an Indian rocket fault 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 if right now he explained and there was the application 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.220
 we do not go to the menu 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.220
 and look for it 2 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.549
 when he said that we have scrupulously checked twice 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.260
 in April google cn 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.760
 is to perform through a bone of whoever is in this mobile by the 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.839
 moment until it's the no update to 2 1 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.310
 we can only leave 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.419
 a select 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.359
 or by group when by as brutus 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.929
 it tells us that only 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.929
 is paying two points today but a superior 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.309
 in our case as a model for a supposed power 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.089
 we scored vs 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.549
 as in the first time it is who we execute it tells us 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.809
 the one that we have to install an application also the pp 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.639
 we tell him to bring 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.359
 and candles from a web page where you will give us 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.319
 when 32 bits 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.319
 about 22 Dec 64 thousand mackintosh 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.510
 in this case my computer we have bwin 2 84 bits 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.289
 we mark it 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.129
 and start downloading 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.709
 As you can see video I have downloaded with clear mood is going back down 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.779
 and a defeat in masters lowered 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.730
 that in this case of unnim and poland patras 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.859
 because I do not have lowered 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.329
 we do not leave everything 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.319
 connect 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.219
 the wire 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
 at tc 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.440
 and as always they ask us if we want to connect clothes transfer 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.439
 athletics to climb 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:36.819
 and he does not know 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.819
 in the system 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.649
 so we can do 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.699
 to memory sd 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.559
 we open it 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.559
 and we look for a folder that is called 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.339
 and we look for a folder that shamah blur 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:56.039
 annual percent 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.379
 do not do it 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.309
 inside the vehicle file the file 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.309
 in this way we go a little bit of everything 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.069
 iruna de oca accurate 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.229
 in this case own town 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.229
 copies here 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.299
 iranzo reprimand 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.419
 they asked us windows 7 if we want to give permission 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.830
 obligation 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.180
 we give him 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.090
 others 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.090
 about 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.349
 To the next one 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.689
 anes 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.159
 we accept the license 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.509
 nets 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:43.969
 imex 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.289
 they asked us we came to save what we say that well 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.289
 with excuse for tourism, but it works perfectly 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.779
 and he asked us if we have seen the traitors 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.490
 vsd as we already have them installed again enough own terminal 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.629
 we say no 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.589
 installed 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.589
 and now it goes a little bit just for a few tests 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.289
 installed the application 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.809
 the application result 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.849
 I have disabled 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.580
 so they all saw it 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.419
 is deactivated 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.069
 the internet connection 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.849
 why not 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.849
 everything is connected to the internet and the program itself 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.170
 our endorsements 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.809
 tests 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:37.419
 this application depends on one side for a little over a month at least 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.990
 in this case they were a little bit more 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.990
 that not all prelates 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.939
 -she snapped 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.449
 mugabe piratea in English 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.279
 in this case 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:54.469
 what I compose time and faster 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.029
 per cent will offer us to the bottom part as a kind of telephone 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.169
 if you click on it 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.990
 it puts you connect to the internet 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.430
 I connected internet 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.270
 completed 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.839
 connecting 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:15.219
 the terminal is supposed to be connected and if we did not go to a 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:17.349
 page v 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.659
 we go for example the load 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.050
 our web 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.270
 well as you can see it is quite depends on the operator and the transfer 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.080
 of data that you have 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.689
 it's pretty fast 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:33.860
 loading 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.860
 as much that as he lived a moment a test for example 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.300
 with this video 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.619
 as you can see the Romanian baby won very fast the sea 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:52.270
 it's worth curious thing too 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.449
 is that the terminal 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:56.639
 when the items want 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.409
 up Navarre 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:01.180
 it puts you out of the positive 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.180
 they are using device data 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:10.460
 the other sport deputation of lugo st 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.409
 with this I do not say what terminal can happen 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.789
 like and seen very fast very very fast to install 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:23.139
 i a piano at first in 3 3% of our entire state does not support any 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:23.789
 of these 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.550
 let's hope that one side stays 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.410
 soon we can not also through an envelope 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.480
 well nothing texts all thanks to all
