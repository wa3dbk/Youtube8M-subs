I test drove the ANOVA the basic problem
I<00:02:06.060> felt<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.140> very<00:02:07.320> long<00:02:07.500> car<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I felt was it's a very long car it's the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
I felt was it's a very long car it's the
same<00:02:08.640> size<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.090> Safari<00:02:09.420> which<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.020> good

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
same size as the Safari which is good

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.100

but<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.610> braking<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.629> have<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:12.930> two

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110

it's<00:02:13.890> kids<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.780> when<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.870> turn<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.230> at<00:02:16.350> high

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it's kids and when you turn it at high

Safari was better compared to you in an
ANOVA<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.270> factor<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
ANOVA so it that is one factor the

ANOVA so it that is one factor the
second<00:02:25.200> factor<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.890> very<00:02:26.040> light<00:02:26.280> car

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520
