sort of more absorbent paper so pretty

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:34.280 
sort of more absorbent paper so pretty
closely<00:00:31.640> now<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.969> leaf<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.750> rough<00:00:33.989> it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

doesn't<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.680> really<00:00:35.219> neat<00:00:35.460> because

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
doesn't actually really neat because

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.299 
doesn't actually really neat because
this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.460> challenge<00:00:38.820> painting

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.370 

gonna<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.760> start<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.270> begin

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380
