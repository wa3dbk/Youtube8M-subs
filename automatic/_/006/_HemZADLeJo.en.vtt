00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.580
 very much that we have to be there again 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.890
 today the overview of the new old one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.870
 and that makes me very happy because everyone had 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.880
 We have not been that up to date 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.980
 my channel and I work like you 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.529
 know my portfolio bigger and bigger 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.300
 to let and it is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.279
 here to natural cosmetics and what in 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:29.939
 this LED is in it that I show 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:31.740
 you now yes this led has the beautiful 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.660
 name heart pieces where I already 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 To be honest, you have to say that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.940
 Now why I do not know why 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.739
 That's the heart of things I have now 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.540
 are expected with heart-shaped things 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.510
 maybe the most popular alterra 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.079
 Products or so you do not know it that way 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.640
 exactly 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.739
 I'll show you in any case now 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.039
 what is in there and we have as 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.020
 first time you have two shadow quads 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.539
 yes synonymous with rewe loop already more often 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.579
 seen and now at altera too 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.520
 just that it's just my age at 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.890
 Altera beside natural cosmetics is her 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.210
 you get in two shades completely 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.570
 I think the names are funny 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.939
 goddess and ice cream cup I understand 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.400
 somehow the whole concept dl little 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.799
 so why it does not say so then now 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.530
 hello my darling or so if it is 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.619
 heart is or should stop for 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.150
 icecup and goddess I die 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.390
 Do not know write me your guess 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.710
 very happy times in the comments purely 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.009
 Now the product comes what I then 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.939
 really as the centerpiece 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.009
 I could not get that kalauer 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.150
 refuse apology the l -e 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.850
 Namely it would designate one 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.409
 beautifully marbled bronze the me 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.450
 Tell us in advance coconut 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.799
 smells yes wat is always dat with this 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.619
 cocos as well we have already 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.619
 september summer is over 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.509
 not there cocos well alright I think so 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.159
 beautiful , just look at him 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.159
 closer to how he looks in real life 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.240
 because that can under circumstances of 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.710
 press release to product then always 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.840
 be different again 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.570
 also is in the led then another 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.369
 great plush with the beautiful name cake 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 pops 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.599
 that already makes of press photo 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.039
 not such a good impression but also 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.060
 maybe you will become one 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.650
 better teach 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.260
 because for example the baked one 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.780
 highlighter by reval is enough too 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.360
 really great, so you just have to 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.319
 but do not look at me now 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.110
 off the stool 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.420
 and then we have two lifeless im 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.120
 assortment once tastes after he 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.620
 once to orange and there I understand 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.680
 not so much the topic right now 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.360
 It's not my heart pressure 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.510
 on top of things so i know it 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.620
 Do not you tell me all in all ? 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.110
 I have to say an LED so-so it is 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.940
 That's certainly not easy 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.739
 is always great Ellis 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.390
 deploy and since I have the feeling 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.220
 that alterra and rossmann there still 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.720
 somehow in the beginning sometimes 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.830
 Do you have really great freaks? 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.160
 but sometimes it is 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.750
 this time it was with list this time 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.630
 was it more daring 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.580
 yes, but if you want to know something as 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.530
 Next turn, stay now 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.760
 just turn it on 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.680
 you know, I like writing that 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.570
 Comment definitely gives me one 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.910
 thumbs up that I'm always very happy 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.620
 and with that you show the things 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.850
 I like it here and if so 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.859
