00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.259
 the simplicity of its petrovsky tv during 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.339
 frankfurt booth new not represented 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.739
 only but in the car is new 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:21.980
 concept of new technology 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.239
 developing nails new engines and 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.730
 powertrain right now we are 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.749
 near 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.819
 now at the tables on which are presented 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.549
 the latest developments in the field 

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:33.000
 engine building 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.180
 2 new diesel engines one 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.340
 gasoline new type of transmission with two 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.930
 clutches and very through find very 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.700
 tech gasoline engine 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.360
 volume of 1 5 2 liters use 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 turbocharger that's the way gibbons help 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.600
 thousand turbines 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.380
 we get a pickup almost from the very 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.179
 bottom 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.859
 we have one and a half thousand rpm starts 90 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.489
 percent of all power and power 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.060
 sorry very much delphi c motor 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.620
 develop 115 horsepower and 190 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470
 newton meters of torque 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.050
 with the right to be proud that 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.020
 this engine is very light very 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.620
 small can we set 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.590
 literally any cars even 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.130
 most compact next two 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.730
 The engine belongs to the family of diesel 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.990
 engine one of them is called dozens of 109 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.090
 It has a volume of one and a half liters at the same time as 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270
 well you can understand from the name yawn 110 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.280
 horsepower power and this one 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.240
 engine volume 1598 cubes 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.330
 and called tea 130 and develops 130 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.509
 horsepower you can imagine 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.579
 imagine that using the year is the most 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.469
 turbines using this supercharger 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.979
 from the engine 1 3 6 on diesel you can get 130 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.660
 Horse power 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.410
 motor itself 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.160
 show crazy twisting 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.820
 moment 320 newton meters 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.729
 This is despite the fact that only 115 grams and two whole 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.690
 spends on 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.570
 but the body meter throwing money at 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.550
 kilometer but in the most interesting for us 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.690
 for Russian poets, something completely different is that 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.160
 fuel consumption 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.770
 the process interfered with the cycle will be only 4 4 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.610
 liter 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.580
 but this is achieved not just technology behind 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.810
 innovations which 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.159
 really find the answers of the engine but also due to 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.560
 new yet the system which is called 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.199
 china north 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.069
 percentage what does it mean it means what 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.459
 this motor 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.950
 as well as 50 110 can stop ex 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.599
 the premiere of persons of samara run then 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.409
 when race 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.040
 and I am not in prime condition 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.489
 rest for example we stopped at 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.659
 traffic lights if we polishuk 3 seconds not 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:28.440
 moves 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.710
 the motor itself stalls percent done it 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.980
 especially to held 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.930
 save fuel and secondly with address 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.079
 do not pollute the environment 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.389
 this way as soon as we so im 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.650
 the clutch pedal itself sailor starts 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.979
 and keep moving as before 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:44.919
 where 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.849
 one third of the process 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.139
 engines all check finder 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.480
 mounts do so 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.769
 this launch took place 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.780
 fire as smoothly as possible 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.400
 such a term as Stalin start that is 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.419
 silent start to actually be even 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.879
 without noticing that the motor was barely 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.530
 a priori quite noisy starts 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.030
 practically if either acoustic sooo 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.950
 nuances by the way here is this very approach and 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.900
 efficiency and efficiency of pores as 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.459
 sign in the concept of equal 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.540
 which is called this two that is a 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.540
 ecology squared actually 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.879
 main bet on the maximum 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.289
 environmental friendliness of motors 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:23.939
 to in this way and the engines and transmissions 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.959
 cars now located in 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.019
 transition before we all 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.809
 whether we need car sales 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:32.979
 gasoline floor and diesel engines and 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.549
 gearboxes must be 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.609
 as efficient as possible 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.279
 this is the most logical 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:39.999
 this very box bb bi gitis 2 quad 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.910
 that the dual clutch system 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.500
 equally plan to install on 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.970
 Some models Megan Scenic already with 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.810
 next year and in fact it 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.920
 is intended for the entire range of percent 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.169
 eye production ronaldo 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:54.199
 process 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.749
