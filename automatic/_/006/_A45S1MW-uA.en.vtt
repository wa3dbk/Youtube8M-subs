00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.430 

mmm<00:02:36.100> kingi<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.790> take<00:02:37.120> on<00:02:37.300> c3<00:02:37.540> isn't<00:02:38.350> this

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
mmm kingi to I take on c3 isn't this

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.670 
mmm kingi to I take on c3 isn't this
winning<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:39.600> think<00:02:40.600> this<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:41.620> think

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
winning I think this is just I think

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.850 
winning I think this is just I think
this<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.130> winning<00:02:42.490> I<00:02:42.610> don't<00:02:42.850> know<00:02:43.710> well<00:02:44.710> there

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
this is winning I don't know well there

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.590 
this is winning I don't know well there
you<00:02:44.890> calculate<00:02:45.640> all<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.180> then<00:02:46.330> he<00:02:46.420> gives

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
you calculate all this and then he gives

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.820 
you calculate all this and then he gives
away<00:02:46.810> chief<00:02:47.170> ride<00:02:48.180> ok<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:50.080> take<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
away chief ride ok I just take the the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.490 
away chief ride ok I just take the the
be<00:02:51.040> snow<00:02:51.340> white<00:02:52.230> resigns<00:02:53.430> come<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.780> ok<00:02:55.780> now<00:02:56.290> but

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
be snow white resigns come on ok now but

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.100 
be snow white resigns come on ok now but
let's<00:02:57.070> let's<00:02:57.340> have<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.580> look<00:02:57.820> at<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.360> hope<00:02:58.990> I

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
let's let's have a look at this I hope I

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.520 
let's let's have a look at this I hope I
was<00:02:59.290> right<00:02:59.320> here<00:03:00.000> kompis<00:03:01.000> on<00:03:01.180> 000<00:03:02.050> that's<00:03:02.290> cool

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
was right here kompis on 000 that's cool

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.650 
was right here kompis on 000 that's cool
my<00:03:03.400> idea<00:03:03.910> was<00:03:04.180> check<00:03:05.170> night<00:03:05.710> takes<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.850> now

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
my idea was check night takes and now

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.060 
my idea was check night takes and now
take<00:03:08.050> here<00:03:08.440> uh<00:03:09.630> he<00:03:10.630> actually<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:11.290> recaptures

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
take here uh he actually just recaptures

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.520 
take here uh he actually just recaptures
hmm<00:03:13.260> when<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.530> calculating<00:03:15.460> is<00:03:15.610> um<00:03:16.530> let's

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
hmm when I was calculating is um let's

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.100 
hmm when I was calculating is um let's
say<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.950> King<00:03:18.310> moves<00:03:18.610> here<00:03:18.940> I'm<00:03:19.180> threatening

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
say the King moves here I'm threatening

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.370 
say the King moves here I'm threatening
this<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.590> see<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.520> I<00:03:21.790> was<00:03:22.570> calculating<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.320> I

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
this and see to I was calculating that I

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.950 
this and see to I was calculating that I
can<00:03:23.590> actually<00:03:23.740> take<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.610> then<00:03:25.510> have<00:03:25.720> this

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
can actually take and then have this

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.750 
can actually take and then have this
check<00:03:27.450> which<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.630> good<00:03:28.840> for<00:03:28.870> me<00:03:29.080> yeah<00:03:30.040> computer

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
check which is good for me yeah computer

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.300 
check which is good for me yeah computer
agrees<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:33.190> he<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.580> take<00:03:33.820> here<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:35.220> here<00:03:36.220> I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
agrees but he can take here and here I

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.950 
agrees but he can take here and here I
didn't<00:03:36.640> really<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.880> didn't<00:03:37.240> really<00:03:37.390> continue

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
didn't really I didn't really continue

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.890 
didn't really I didn't really continue
to<00:03:38.110> calculate<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.650> wasn't<00:03:39.010> thinking<00:03:39.310> here<00:03:39.550> and
