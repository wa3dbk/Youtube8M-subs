00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
now the first impression is when I first

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.220 
now the first impression is when I first
saw<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.879> through<00:00:51.239> other<00:00:51.360> people's<00:00:51.690> videos<00:00:51.809> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
saw it through other people's videos it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
saw it through other people's videos it
looks<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.590> bit<00:00:52.620> bland<00:00:53.129> over<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.670> little<00:00:53.789> basic

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
looks a bit bland over here little basic

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
looks a bit bland over here little basic
but<00:00:54.600> when<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> looked<00:00:54.989> at<00:00:55.110> my<00:00:55.230> own<00:00:55.260> wheel<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
but when I looked at my own wheel is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.979 
but when I looked at my own wheel is
exactly<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> same<00:00:56.879> except<00:00:57.480> there's<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.899> as

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
exactly the same except there's not as

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.830 
exactly the same except there's not as
many<00:00:58.140> bolts<00:00:58.680> around<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.660> might

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
many bolts around here so that might

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
many bolts around here so that might
look<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.410> better<00:01:01.559> we're<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.859> see<00:01:02.129> what

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
look a lot better we're gonna see what

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.319 
look a lot better we're gonna see what
it's<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:02.730> actually<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
it's like when they actually see the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.060 
it's like when they actually see the
real<00:01:03.629> thing<00:01:03.660> though<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.799> always

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
real thing though because it's always

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.920 
real thing though because it's always
the<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:05.790> different<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> back<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the bit different so on the back of the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.080 
the bit different so on the back of the
box<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.280> Ferrari

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

is turn the wheel upside down and there
was<00:02:56.080> actually<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.500> screw<00:02:57.130> there<00:02:57.400> which<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:57.880> need

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
was actually a screw there which we need

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.199 
was actually a screw there which we need
to<00:02:58.150> slowly<00:02:58.390> unscrew<00:02:59.170> which<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.620> will<00:02:59.890> do<00:03:00.209> try

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
to slowly unscrew which I will do try

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.670 
to slowly unscrew which I will do try
and<00:03:01.240> attempt<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.930> with<00:03:02.050> my<00:03:02.140> left<00:03:02.380> hand<00:03:02.470> it's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
and attempt it with my left hand it's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.100 
and attempt it with my left hand it's
probably<00:03:02.920> yes<00:03:03.340> too<00:03:03.520> tight<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:03.850> need<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.390> need

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
probably yes too tight I need to I need

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.840 
probably yes too tight I need to I need
to<00:03:05.410> come<00:03:05.560> back<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.950> now<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.400> we've<00:03:06.640> loosened

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
to come back and now that we've loosened

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.790 
to come back and now that we've loosened
it<00:03:07.180> slightly<00:03:07.390> we're<00:03:07.720> basically<00:03:08.050> gonna<00:03:08.380> twist

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
it slightly we're basically gonna twist

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.980 
it slightly we're basically gonna twist
by<00:03:09.550> holding<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.090> while<00:03:10.360> holding<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.840> wheel

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
by holding the while holding the wheel

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.480 
by holding the while holding the wheel
this<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.320> gonna<00:03:11.500> be<00:03:11.620> really<00:03:11.950> really<00:03:12.370> awkward

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
this is gonna be really really awkward

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.000 
this is gonna be really really awkward
to<00:03:12.700> see<00:03:13.000> but<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.050> see<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.380> gonna<00:03:14.620> turn

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
to see but you can see it's gonna turn

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
to see but you can see it's gonna turn
and<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:16.450> wheel<00:03:16.630> will<00:03:16.840> eventually<00:03:17.380> come<00:03:17.680> out

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
and the wheel will eventually come out

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.500 
and the wheel will eventually come out
if<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.180> can<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.250> really<00:03:21.610> difficult<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.450> as

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
if I can this is really difficult so as

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.380 
if I can this is really difficult so as
you<00:03:22.600> can<00:03:22.720> see<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.050> GTE<00:03:23.530> rim<00:03:24.190> looks<00:03:24.670> very<00:03:25.060> very

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
you can see the GTE rim looks very very

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.130 
you can see the GTE rim looks very very
similar<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.380> new<00:03:26.650> rim<00:03:27.220> also<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:28.690> they're

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
similar to the new rim also so they're

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.199 
similar to the new rim also so they're
both<00:03:29.350> exactly<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.980> same<00:03:30.070> size<00:03:30.550> they've<00:03:30.970> both

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
both exactly the same size they've both

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.180 
both exactly the same size they've both
got<00:03:31.540> pretty<00:03:31.720> much<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.140> same<00:03:32.320> button<00:03:32.830> layout

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
got pretty much the same button layout

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.240 
got pretty much the same button layout
but<00:03:33.820> I've<00:03:33.970> got<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.300> say<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.720> much<00:03:35.050> prefer<00:03:35.650> the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
but I've got to say I much prefer the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.370 
but I've got to say I much prefer the
new<00:03:36.489> Thrustmaster<00:03:36.850> GT<00:03:37.630> wheel<00:03:37.900> overall

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
new Thrustmaster GT wheel overall

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.920 
new Thrustmaster GT wheel overall
because<00:03:38.590> leather<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.459> just<00:03:39.489> my<00:03:40.180> thing<00:03:40.239> and

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
because leather is just my thing and

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.289 
because leather is just my thing and
also<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.920> just<00:03:42.100> like<00:03:42.519> how<00:03:42.700> it's<00:03:42.850> clean<00:03:43.150> it

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
also I just like how it's clean it

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.090 
also I just like how it's clean it
doesn't<00:03:43.420> have<00:03:43.750> all<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.440> buttons<00:03:44.769> all<00:03:44.860> over<00:03:44.950> it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
doesn't have all the buttons all over it

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.740 
doesn't have all the buttons all over it
but<00:03:45.220> some<00:03:45.459> may<00:03:45.610> prefer<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.269> fact<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.630> this

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
but some may prefer the fact that this

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.810 
but some may prefer the fact that this
has<00:03:46.930> got<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:47.500> know<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.739> water<00:03:47.980> wipe<00:03:48.400> up<00:03:48.640> here

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
has got you know the water wipe up here

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.150 
has got you know the water wipe up here
it's<00:03:49.000> more<00:03:49.209> like<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.810> don't<00:03:50.530> know<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.830> gives<00:03:51.040> you

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
it's more like I don't know it gives you

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.009 
it's more like I don't know it gives you
more<00:03:52.080> GT<00:03:53.080> feeling<00:03:54.090> well<00:03:55.090> personally<00:03:55.510> for<00:03:55.810> what

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
more GT feeling well personally for what

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.750 
more GT feeling well personally for what
I'm<00:03:56.110> using<00:03:56.380> as<00:03:56.590> my<00:03:56.680> setup<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.190> think<00:03:57.459> this<00:03:57.580> will

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
I'm using as my setup I think this will

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.910 
I'm using as my setup I think this will
look<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.090> lot<00:03:58.390> better<00:03:58.540> for<00:03:58.870> me<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.350> there

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
look a lot better for me and there

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.570 
look a lot better for me and there
anyway

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
anyway

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.330 
anyway
let's<00:04:00.970> whack<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:01.989> on<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.290> steel<00:04:02.530> we<00:04:02.709> do<00:04:02.890> so

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
let's whack it on and steel we do so

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.190 
let's whack it on and steel we do so
here<00:04:03.580> we're<00:04:03.760> gonna<00:04:03.880> attempt<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.540> line<00:04:04.900> up<00:04:05.080> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
here we're gonna attempt to line up the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.979 
here we're gonna attempt to line up the
s-video<00:04:05.709> looking<00:04:06.310> ports<00:04:06.700> on<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.000> wheel<00:04:07.269> and

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
s-video looking ports on the wheel and

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.140 
s-video looking ports on the wheel and
then<00:04:08.380> on<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.860> rim<00:04:09.100> base<00:04:09.370> itself<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:10.000> can

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
then on the rim base itself you can

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.120 
then on the rim base itself you can
slightly<00:04:11.080> see<00:04:11.230> on<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.650> rim<00:04:11.799> base<00:04:11.920> what<00:04:12.070> you

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
slightly see on the rim base what you

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.930 
slightly see on the rim base what you
can<00:04:12.250> see<00:04:12.370> on<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.580> wheel

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
can see on the wheel

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.660 
can see on the wheel
so<00:04:13.269> you<00:04:13.360> line<00:04:13.570> it<00:04:13.720> up<00:04:13.780> basically<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.709> we<00:04:15.310> begin

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
so you line it up basically and we begin

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.759 
so you line it up basically and we begin
to<00:04:15.880> do<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.359> opposite<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.870> what<00:04:17.019> we<00:04:17.109> did<00:04:17.140> before

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
to do the opposite of what we did before

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.280 
to do the opposite of what we did before
so<00:04:17.890> keep<00:04:18.130> twisting<00:04:18.580> it<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:18.750> firmly<00:04:19.750> on<00:04:20.080> and

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
so keep twisting it and firmly on and

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.110 
so keep twisting it and firmly on and
then<00:04:20.590> do<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.830> screw<00:04:21.160> again<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.760> there<00:04:22.090> we

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
then do the screw again and there we

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.980 
then do the screw again and there we
have<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:23.500> new<00:04:23.710> wheel<00:04:24.010> head<00:04:24.880> thing<00:04:25.510> has

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
have it the new wheel head thing has

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.360 
have it the new wheel head thing has
been<00:04:26.260> added<00:04:26.680> onto

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
been added onto

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.550 
been added onto
the<00:04:27.460> wheel<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:27.940> can<00:04:28.180> see<00:04:28.449> it's<00:04:28.930> very<00:04:29.050> very

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
the wheel so you can see it's very very

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.159 
the wheel so you can see it's very very
similar<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:30.130> what<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.340> had<00:04:30.610> before<00:04:30.930> it's<00:04:31.930> got

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
similar to what I had before it's got

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.379 
similar to what I had before it's got
different<00:04:32.410> style<00:04:33.130> buttons<00:04:33.639> it<00:04:33.790> can<00:04:33.970> may<00:04:34.120> feel

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
different style buttons it can may feel

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.120 
different style buttons it can may feel
a<00:04:34.419> little<00:04:34.690> bit<00:04:34.840> different<00:04:35.229> but<00:04:35.800> they<00:04:35.979> are

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
a little bit different but they are

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.920 
a little bit different but they are
pretty<00:04:36.400> much<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.699> same<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.150> layout<00:04:37.720> is<00:04:37.840> the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
pretty much the same the layout is the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.510 
pretty much the same the layout is the
same<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:39.220> it's<00:04:39.550> leather<00:04:39.880> it<00:04:40.240> feels<00:04:40.540> much<00:04:40.930> more

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
same and it's leather it feels much more

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.379 
same and it's leather it feels much more
spongy<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.669> feel<00:04:42.820> like<00:04:43.000> it's<00:04:43.150> going<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.300> be

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
spongy and I feel like it's going to be

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.900 
spongy and I feel like it's going to be
much<00:04:43.600> more<00:04:44.190> better<00:04:45.190> it's<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.490> hole<00:04:45.639> basically

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
much more better it's a hole basically

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.450 
much more better it's a hole basically
so<00:04:46.600> there<00:04:46.750> we<00:04:46.840> have<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.199> that<00:04:47.470> is<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.130> unboxing

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
so there we have it that is the unboxing

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.180 
so there we have it that is the unboxing
how<00:04:48.820> quick<00:04:49.090> overview<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:50.290> new<00:04:50.320> wheel

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
how quick overview of the new wheel

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.120 
how quick overview of the new wheel
