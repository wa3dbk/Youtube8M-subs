00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:26.420
 Hello dear friends and all who 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.750
 watching my channel today I want 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.890
 tell here about such a beautiful 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:38.510
 luxurious blooming begonia flower 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.800
 these begonias are very beautiful large 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.210
 semi-double and terry fringed 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.870
 flowers 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.860
 they are very similar to roses or camellias or 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:59.240
 even peonies are more like peonies 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:05.920
 some plants still reach to 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.920
 20-30 centimeters diameter 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.780
 stems way of tuberous begonias juicy 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:20.130
 translucent response to green up 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 reddish or olive shades from 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.119
 one tuber can grow from one to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.280
 five or more stems 30 to 30 and 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.200
 70 centimeters 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.539
 she was considered and developing somewhat 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.420
 flowers of any color 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.420
 there are red white yellow and orange 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:51.840
 coral and bloom begonias 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:54.380
 June to December is a begonia plant 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.659
 photophilous therefore 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.619
 it is desirable to place it on the east 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.619
 or west window 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:11.009
 well if you bring to fresh air and 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 set a shaded spot of tubers 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.670
 begonium and preferably planted in 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.400
 wet peat when buds start growing 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.639
 you need to transplant the plants in big 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.980
 pot of soil consisting of clay 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:30.720
 turf and leaf peatlands and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.420
 sand is about the same ratio 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.150
 sand can be a little smaller 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.829
 two times and plant begonia should be so 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.230
 to the top of the tubers 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.170
 it was barely covered with earth only 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.180
 a little bit a bit when height 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:54.569
 the stalk will reach 6 7 8 centimeters then 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.950
 need to stop and plant again and well 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.720
 it is necessary to water it and pritenit it 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.709
 water 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.970
 good abundantly and once a decade 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.980
 feed the full mineral fertilizer 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.700
 you can buy fertilizers 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.700
 stores 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.190
 and at the end of the summer when the leaves start 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.720
 yellowing and dropping watering should stop 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.870
 completely dry up the earth and then die off 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.170
 they do not have to keep a pot by the fall of the club 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.570
 installed in cool rooms 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.910
 temperatures of about 10 12 year network 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.370
 what are the pests and diseases affecting 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:48.030
 begonia can hit me the most 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:50.010
 dangerous aphid and with the wrong care 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.940
 the plant may also be affected 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.940
 powdery mildew 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.280
 breeding possible tubers and 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.940
 seeds 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:07.940
 December seeds are sown on leafy ground 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.440
 shoots appear after 14 16 days 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:17.190
 blooms begonias after six six 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:20.400
 half months after planting still here 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.680
 I want to say that the tuberous begonia is very 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.500
 sensitive to lower temperatures and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.690
 drafts under adverse conditions 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.720
 she drops flowers 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:39.740
 be aware of this and take care when courting 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.940
 your begonias your beauties let her 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:48.720
 decorates your windowsill 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:52.380
 your home and pleases your eyes up 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.990
