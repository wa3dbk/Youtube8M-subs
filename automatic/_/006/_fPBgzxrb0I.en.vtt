sapphire<00:03:48.330> is<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.720> nine<00:03:49.049> on<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.350> hardness<00:03:49.709> scale

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
sapphire is a nine on the hardness scale

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.970 
sapphire is a nine on the hardness scale
which<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.519> falling<00:03:50.970> behind<00:03:51.209> right<00:03:51.900> behind

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
which is falling behind right behind

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.100 
which is falling behind right behind
diamond<00:03:52.980> which<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> ten<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.269> hardest<00:03:54.810> thing

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
diamond which is a ten the hardest thing

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.170 
diamond which is a ten the hardest thing
that<00:03:55.350> can<00:03:55.709> be<00:03:55.830> on<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.100> hardness<00:03:56.310> scale<00:03:56.580> so

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
that can be on the hardness scale so

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.789 
that can be on the hardness scale so
basically<00:03:57.450> what<00:03:57.690> this<00:03:57.810> means<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.200> if<00:03:58.470> Apple

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
basically what this means that if Apple

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.800 
basically what this means that if Apple
were<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.100> create<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> screen<00:04:00.000> cover<00:04:00.269> for<00:04:00.780> a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
future iphone then it would be nearly
