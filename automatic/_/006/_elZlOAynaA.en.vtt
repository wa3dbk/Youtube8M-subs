00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.569
 hello friends or tubers greet you from bin laden's somewhat 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.100
 summer day with a new legal cap on how to open faster the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.930
 programs or what 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.450
 after explaining what this good video tutorial is about, your team 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.620
 have enough ram memory 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.980
 ok can work with several programs without problems 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.520
 the system always uses the kernel 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.530
 to send and receive triggers 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.530
 of the hard disk paging file 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.450
 for this reason the speed of the computer slows down or becomes more 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.700
 slow 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.260
 if you have already said 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.370
 it would be all more moderate 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.330
 It's almost full 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.870
 you have to follow these steps 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.870
 The first thing we are going to do is start 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.390
 then it will execute 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.990
 and here we write the word 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.160
 reykjavík 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.299
 before walking the hectares of forest lacks 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.800
 This process is not to give the internet more speed but to 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.800
 enter with greater speed the programs 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.630
 Rajoy has also separated himself from being badly buried but are other steps or 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.520
 what are we going to follow other steps so do not get confused or what 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160
 when you have not done recent 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.990
 We will not accept 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.340
 i 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.390
 and now we're going to do nothing that comes out this window 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.260
 let's continue this chain that 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.590
 this chain x 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.840
 what good and if 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.430
 kelly local machine bon scott hoyt that these steps we will follow what here 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.400
 I will leave you in the description of the video so that it will not be done anymore 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.119
 hard 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.659
 with patience that 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.779
 Well the first thing we're going to do is go to 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.659
 that local machina 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.689
 once we passed that there is a little tab in what local machina 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.249
 then there are 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.869
 lille there is a little eyelash 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.549
 Then in 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.609
 current control c 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.709
 is here 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.189
 and where it is issued 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.909
 and now 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.809
 li who built in which it emits 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.519
 and we look for the word session cherokee spot 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.679
 session manager chávez 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.189
 under 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.659
 that this one wanted 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.599
 once done that is love 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.759
 yonhap escenita session manager 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.370
 and finally ram memory 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.559
 manal 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.159
 ravalomanana memory 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.159
 we do not look for 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.429
 to home 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.889
 excuse me I think we were manna memory miss that 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.929
 once done this on the right side 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.159
 or this is what you selected 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.989
 let's find the word 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.990
 wanted to 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.040
 disabled to painted executive or what 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.689
 I must leave that word in the extinction of the video so that these 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.579
 will make it more difficult or what is here and sidi saler executive pajín or what 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.349
 good 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.519
 we are not going we are looking for the word disabled 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.439
 executive pocket bonus ayala l 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.310
 we make everything wrong 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.959
 we double click 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.309
 to you here will come out 0 what 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:54.879
 and what are you going to do 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.589
 place the 1 to 0 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:01.039
 we place the 1 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.649
 nothing that we have placed in one 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:08.449
 well first we do not win what the basis is that in this tenth what 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.909
 because once assured that we will accept it 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.909
 once done that in fact all that 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.430
 we close them all 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.750
 and it is that we start our computer what makes our pc 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.189
 Once we have a king, we advance 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.649
 we are going to get more speed of access to the programs or what 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.729
 hitwise elbow will be 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.330
 plus 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.319
 mada syrio that what until yesterday does not fall for that which will have once be more 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.380
 awesome good I hope that when I explode aida a lot
