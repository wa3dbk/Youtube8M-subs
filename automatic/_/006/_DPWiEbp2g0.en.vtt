00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.210
 so in general, finally changed 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:11.400
 battery thanks dad 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:15.330
 we generally have scar 1500 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.910
 we have the very same fifteenth in the box 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.300
 4 ohms exchanged so far 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.439
 the setting was somewhere around 36 hertz 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.439
 I drive a track on 29 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.430
 not bad in principle 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.430
 small 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.670
 general landmark was high setting 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.170
 because the customer interested in the Negro 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.939
 around 35 there and higher hertz i just 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.420
 decided to have some fun chasing bliss 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.420
 at-29 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.539
 sit and guy sit 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.539
 switched to quality 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:04.040
 food 14 314 4 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.910
 small seedlings that pleases connected 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.910
 while 4 ohms 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.790
 will become the settings 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.800
 that's actually so moget tag here 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.380
 soon 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:47.460
 1500 four and asadov happy almost 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.580
 No box turned out too good while in 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.350
 the test mode we knead actually 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.870
 after the warm-up you can already tumble 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.930
 Well, somehow, I'm probably for the sake of 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.210
 fun still ural throwing of course will 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.210
 not that but still potestim
