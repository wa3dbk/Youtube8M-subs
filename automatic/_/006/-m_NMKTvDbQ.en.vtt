was reigning around they had a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.000 
was reigning around they had a
professional<00:00:15.059> camera<00:00:15.719> with<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> speed<00:00:16.800> light

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
professional camera with a speed light

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.630 
professional camera with a speed light
on<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.940> camera<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.930> they<00:00:19.080> were<00:00:19.140> using<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.980> Omni

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
on the camera and they were using a Omni

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.290 
on the camera and they were using a Omni
dome<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.570> top<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.410> speed<00:00:23.340> light<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.789> that

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
dome on top of the speed light and that

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.929 
dome on top of the speed light and that
got<00:00:24.510> me<00:00:24.689> wondering<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.830> type<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.310> light<00:00:26.640> an

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
got me wondering what type of light an

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.330 
got me wondering what type of light an
omni<00:00:27.630> dome<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:28.380> will<00:00:28.529> produce<00:00:28.769> when

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
omni dome actually will produce when

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.630 
omni dome actually will produce when
there's<00:00:29.519> no<00:00:29.789> walls<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.779> reflect<00:00:31.380> off<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.610> I

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
there's no walls to reflect off of so I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.150 
there's no walls to reflect off of so I
wanted<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.030> conduct<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.660> experiment

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
wanted to conduct a little experiment

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.889 
wanted to conduct a little experiment
using<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.399> speed<00:00:35.880> light<00:00:36.090> mounted<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.719> your

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
using a speed light mounted on your

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.280 
using a speed light mounted on your
camera<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.700> recreate<00:00:38.700> an<00:00:39.059> outdoor<00:00:39.719> venue<00:00:40.110> with

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
camera to recreate an outdoor venue with

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.790 
camera to recreate an outdoor venue with
no<00:00:40.530> walls<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.190> bounce<00:00:41.399> your<00:00:41.790> light<00:00:42.059> off<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.329> and

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
no walls to bounce your light off of and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.139 
no walls to bounce your light off of and
cycle<00:00:43.800> through<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> couple<00:00:44.280> light<00:00:44.610> modifiers

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
cycle through a couple light modifiers

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.450 
cycle through a couple light modifiers
first<00:00:45.840> using<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> speed<00:00:46.590> light<00:00:46.770> mounted<00:00:47.250> on

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
first using the speed light mounted on

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.760 
first using the speed light mounted on
the<00:00:47.610> camera<00:00:47.640> firing<00:00:48.480> directly<00:00:49.289> at<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the camera firing directly at the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.020 
the camera firing directly at the
subject<00:00:50.160> which<00:00:50.340> will<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.610> me

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
subject which will be me

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.889 
subject which will be me
and<00:00:51.210> second<00:00:52.110> will<00:00:52.320> use<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.579> built-in<00:00:54.210> little

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and second will use the built-in little

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.189 
and second will use the built-in little
bounce<00:00:55.110> card<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> flash<00:00:56.129> pointed<00:00:56.879> up

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
bounce card on the flash pointed up

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.330 
bounce card on the flash pointed up
again<00:00:58.199> there's<00:00:58.410> nothing<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.859> bounce<00:00:59.070> off<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
again there's nothing to bounce off of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.369 
again there's nothing to bounce off of
so<00:00:59.730> most<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.300> light<00:01:00.600> would<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.870> wasted

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
so most of this light would be wasted

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
so most of this light would be wasted
just<00:01:01.559> firing<00:01:01.829> straight<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> sky<00:01:02.699> some<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
just firing straight to the sky some of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420 
just firing straight to the sky some of
it<00:01:03.210> will<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.690> bouncing<00:01:04.619> off<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> card<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.250> me

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it will be bouncing off the card at me

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.000 
it will be bouncing off the card at me
next<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.420> use<00:01:06.450> an<00:01:06.689> omni<00:01:07.020> dome<00:01:07.200> again<00:01:07.799> which

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
next we use an omni dome again which

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.649 
next we use an omni dome again which
won't<00:01:08.250> waste<00:01:08.520> most<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> light<00:01:09.420> I'll<00:01:09.540> have

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
won't waste most of the light I'll have

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.080 
won't waste most of the light I'll have
it<00:01:09.750> pointed<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.310> when<00:01:11.460> you're<00:01:11.580> using<00:01:11.610> one

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it pointed up so when you're using one

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.820 
it pointed up so when you're using one
of<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.299> your<00:01:12.540> flash<00:01:12.810> output<00:01:13.080> power<00:01:13.439> has<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
of these your flash output power has to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.219 
of these your flash output power has to
go<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.070> substantially<00:01:15.049> because<00:01:16.049> it's

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
go up substantially because it's

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.780 
go up substantially because it's
shooting<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> light<00:01:16.950> all<00:01:17.220> around<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
shooting the light all around you and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
shooting the light all around you and
only<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> fraction<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> light<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.070> hitting

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
only a fraction of the light is hitting

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.960 
only a fraction of the light is hitting
the<00:01:21.060> subject<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.770> we'll<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.580> makes

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the subject so we'll see if that makes

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
the subject so we'll see if that makes
any<00:01:24.240> difference<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.780> there's<00:01:25.110> no<00:01:25.259> walls

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
any difference because there's no walls

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
any difference because there's no walls
to<00:01:25.799> bounce<00:01:25.979> off<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.270> also<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
to bounce off with and I also have a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.520 
to bounce off with and I also have a
little<00:01:27.900> tiny<00:01:28.340> speed<00:01:29.340> light<00:01:29.520> mounted<00:01:30.530> softbox

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
little tiny speed light mounted softbox

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.890 
little tiny speed light mounted softbox
that<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.860> got<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> long<00:01:32.250> time<00:01:32.490> ago<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.570> I'll<00:01:33.720> take

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that I got a long time ago so I'll take

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
that I got a long time ago so I'll take
various<00:01:34.320> shots<00:01:34.650> using<00:01:35.130> these<00:01:35.280> light

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
various shots using these light

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.999 
various shots using these light
modifiers<00:01:36.350> without<00:01:37.350> being<00:01:37.619> able<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.829> reflect

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
modifiers without being able to reflect

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
modifiers without being able to reflect
off<00:01:38.430> anything<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.060> you're<00:01:39.210> recreating<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
off anything so you're recreating the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.160 
off anything so you're recreating the
scenario<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.150> are<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.810> an<00:01:42.930> outdoor

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
scenario when you are in an outdoor

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.190 
scenario when you are in an outdoor
environment<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.509> all<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.930> your

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
environment and all you have is your

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.630 
environment and all you have is your
speed<00:01:46.409> light<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.680> your<00:01:46.799> camera<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> don't

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
speed light on your camera you don't

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.639 
speed light on your camera you don't
really<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:48.030> any<00:01:48.240> other<00:01:48.420> choices<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.500> then

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
really have any other choices and then

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.660 
really have any other choices and then
we'll<00:01:49.740> take<00:01:49.890> these<00:01:50.040> into<00:01:50.250> Lightroom<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
we'll take these into Lightroom and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.840 
we'll take these into Lightroom and
compare<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.420> we'll<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.100> these<00:01:53.100> actually

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
compare and we'll see if these actually

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.209 
compare and we'll see if these actually
will<00:01:54.000> make<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> difference<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.380> they<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.770> or

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
will make a difference I know they do or

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.590 
will make a difference I know they do or
I<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.549> Omni<00:01:56.820> dome<00:01:56.969> will<00:01:57.180> when<00:01:57.479> you're

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
I know the Omni dome will when you're

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450 
I know the Omni dome will when you're
inside<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.439> walls<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.009> bounce<00:01:59.189> off

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
inside you have walls to bounce off

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.280 
inside you have walls to bounce off
though<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.180> creates<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> much<00:02:00.719> softer<00:02:00.990> light

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
though it creates a much softer light

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.870 
though it creates a much softer light
but<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:01.590> you're<00:02:01.710> outdoor<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.579> don't

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
but when you're outdoor and you don't

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
but when you're outdoor and you don't
let's<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.170> need<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> or<00:02:04.530> not

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
let's see if you need it or not

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
let's see if you need it or not
let's<00:02:05.670> go<00:02:05.790> outside<00:02:06.060> okay

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
let's go outside okay

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.889 
let's go outside okay
or<00:02:07.439> first<00:02:07.979> flash<00:02:08.850> we're<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.360> gonna<00:02:09.479> use<00:02:09.660> a

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
or first flash we're just gonna use a

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.350 
or first flash we're just gonna use a
make<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.380> flash<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> camera<00:02:11.360> directed

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
make and flash on the camera directed

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.240 
make and flash on the camera directed
straight<00:02:13.080> out<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.740> we'll<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.100> what<00:02:14.220> that

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
straight out and we'll see what that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.709 
straight out and we'll see what that
looks<00:02:14.550> like

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.869 

so<00:02:18.719> that<00:02:18.870> throws<00:02:19.170> out<00:02:19.379> a<00:02:19.409> ton<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:19.980> light<00:02:20.310> all

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
so that throws out a ton of light all

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.099 
so that throws out a ton of light all
over<00:02:22.040> next<00:02:23.040> I'm<00:02:23.400> going<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.609> use<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.049> built-in

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
over next I'm going to use the built-in

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.720 
over next I'm going to use the built-in
white<00:02:26.269> card<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.659> will<00:02:28.530> point<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:29.459> flash

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
white card and will point the flash

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.420 
white card and will point the flash
almost<00:02:30.359> straight<00:02:30.629> up<00:02:30.829> slightly<00:02:31.829> pointed

almost straight up slightly pointed

almost straight up slightly pointed
forward<00:02:32.909> and<00:02:33.510> we'll<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.959> if<00:02:34.079> that<00:02:34.109> makes<00:02:34.409> any

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
forward and we'll see if that makes any

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.770 
forward and we'll see if that makes any
difference

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.950 

now<00:02:42.290> we're<00:02:42.440> gonna<00:02:42.530> try<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:43.310> Omni<00:02:43.880> dome<00:02:44.060> still

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
now we're gonna try the Omni dome still

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.380 
now we're gonna try the Omni dome still

forward<00:02:47.810> palmito<00:02:48.710> Mazon<00:02:49.100> let's<00:02:49.400> try<00:02:49.610> this<00:02:49.670> one

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.880 

we'll<00:02:54.610> try<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.790> only<00:02:54.909> go<00:02:55.180> one<00:02:55.420> more<00:02:55.569> times

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
we'll try the only go one more times

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.349 
we'll try the only go one more times
pointed<00:02:56.890> slightly<00:02:57.280> backwards<00:02:57.879> if<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.180> makes

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.589 

and<00:03:09.129> lastly<00:03:09.849> we're<00:03:10.090> going<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.239> try<00:03:10.540> this

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
and lastly we're going to try this

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:20.500 
and lastly we're going to try this
little<00:03:11.319> soft<00:03:12.310> box<00:03:12.580> thing

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.509 

so<00:03:21.080> with<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.260> softbox<00:03:21.709> thing<00:03:21.980> it's<00:03:22.159> much

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
so with the softbox thing it's much

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.160 
so with the softbox thing it's much
darker<00:03:22.819> I'm<00:03:23.390> not<00:03:23.569> sure<00:03:23.720> why<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:23.900> probably

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
darker I'm not sure why you probably

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.360 
darker I'm not sure why you probably
need<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.349> use<00:03:24.440> flash<00:03:24.739> exposure<00:03:25.099> compensation

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
need to use flash exposure compensation

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.229 
need to use flash exposure compensation
plus<00:03:26.319> maybe<00:03:27.319> a<00:03:27.470> full<00:03:27.830> stock<00:03:28.159> so<00:03:28.970> let's<00:03:29.120> take

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
plus maybe a full stock so let's take

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.550 
plus maybe a full stock so let's take
these<00:03:29.360> into<00:03:29.510> Lightroom<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.049> see<00:03:30.349> what<00:03:30.470> they

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
these into Lightroom and see what they

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.410 
these into Lightroom and see what they
actually<00:03:30.650> look<00:03:30.860> like<00:03:31.159> so<00:03:31.849> here<00:03:32.060> are<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.209> shots

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
actually look like so here are the shots

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.660 
actually look like so here are the shots
we<00:03:32.629> just<00:03:32.840> took<00:03:33.140> let's<00:03:34.010> take<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.220> closer<00:03:34.549> look

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
we just took let's take a closer look

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.900 
we just took let's take a closer look
this<00:03:35.629> is<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.959> flash<00:03:36.230> point<00:03:36.620> directly<00:03:37.190> at<00:03:37.670> the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
this is the flash point directly at the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.699 
this is the flash point directly at the
subject<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:38.810> can<00:03:38.959> see<00:03:39.140> it's<00:03:39.260> pushing<00:03:39.500> out

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
subject you can see it's pushing out

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.589 
subject you can see it's pushing out
quite<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:40.160> bit<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.430> light<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.819> illuminated<00:03:41.540> the

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
quite a bit of light it illuminated the

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.600 
quite a bit of light it illuminated the
background<00:03:42.140> walls<00:03:43.030> subject<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:45.160> there's<00:03:46.160> the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
background walls subject and there's the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.789 
background walls subject and there's the
slightest<00:03:47.269> bit<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.780> red<00:03:48.200> eye<00:03:48.230> just<00:03:48.739> because

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
slightest bit of red eye just because

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.550 
slightest bit of red eye just because
when<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.879> flash<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.299> facing<00:03:50.780> completely

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
when the flash is facing completely

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.890 
when the flash is facing completely
forward<00:03:52.010> it's<00:03:52.129> closest<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.209> lens<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:53.690> you

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
forward it's closest to the lens so you

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.190 
forward it's closest to the lens so you
can<00:03:54.709> potentially<00:03:55.370> risk<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:56.450> red-eye<00:03:57.079> effect

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
can potentially risk the red-eye effect

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.420 
can potentially risk the red-eye effect
and<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.400> can<00:03:58.519> see<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:59.049> shadow<00:04:00.049> line<00:04:00.410> on<00:04:00.709> my

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
and you can see the shadow line on my

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.140 
and you can see the shadow line on my
jaw<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.930> light<00:04:03.829> is<00:04:04.040> pretty<00:04:04.430> hard<00:04:04.700> it's<00:04:04.970> not

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
jaw the light is pretty hard it's not

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.619 
jaw the light is pretty hard it's not
very<00:04:05.390> soft<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:06.170> next<00:04:07.150> this<00:04:08.150> is<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.359> flash

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
very soft so next this is the flash

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.839 
very soft so next this is the flash
point<00:04:08.959> it<00:04:09.109> almost<00:04:09.530> straight<00:04:09.920> up<00:04:10.069> one<00:04:10.609> notch

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
point it almost straight up one notch

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.119 
point it almost straight up one notch
forward<00:04:11.450> with<00:04:11.599> a<00:04:11.629> built-in<00:04:12.109> bounce<00:04:12.440> card<00:04:12.829> I

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
forward with a built-in bounce card I

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.750 
forward with a built-in bounce card I
think<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.120> actually<00:04:14.480> looks<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:15.140> lot<00:04:15.470> better

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
think this actually looks a lot better

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.789 
think this actually looks a lot better
yeah<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.090> can<00:04:17.209> see<00:04:17.479> these<00:04:17.660> harshness<00:04:18.410> in<00:04:18.680> the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
yeah you can see these harshness in the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.039 
yeah you can see these harshness in the
shadows<00:04:19.190> on<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.489> leaves<00:04:19.699> colors<00:04:20.690> everything

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
shadows on the leaves colors everything

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.270 
shadows on the leaves colors everything
looks<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.500> little<00:04:21.590> bit<00:04:21.799> better<00:04:21.949> these<00:04:22.160> are

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
looks a little bit better these are

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.590 
looks a little bit better these are
directly<00:04:22.669> from<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.910> camera<00:04:23.210> but<00:04:23.479> no

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
directly from the camera but no

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.659 
directly from the camera but no
modification<00:04:24.350> if<00:04:24.950> we<00:04:25.039> look<00:04:25.220> at<00:04:25.340> my<00:04:25.460> eyes

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
modification if we look at my eyes

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.839 
modification if we look at my eyes
they're<00:04:26.300> not<00:04:26.539> a<00:04:26.570> hint<00:04:26.900> of<00:04:27.020> red<00:04:27.610> shadow<00:04:28.610> is

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
they're not a hint of red shadow is

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.290 
they're not a hint of red shadow is
still<00:04:29.090> harsh<00:04:29.870> but<00:04:30.200> not<00:04:30.410> quite<00:04:31.220> as<00:04:31.400> bad<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:32.030> like

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
still harsh but not quite as bad I like

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
still harsh but not quite as bad I like
the<00:04:33.169> light<00:04:33.380> from<00:04:33.620> this<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:35.110> compared<00:04:36.110> back

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
the light from this and compared back

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.350 
the light from this and compared back
color<00:04:36.800> temperature<00:04:37.460> is<00:04:37.490> slightly<00:04:38.000> different

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
color temperature is slightly different

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.879 
color temperature is slightly different
really<00:04:38.810> because<00:04:38.960> it's<00:04:39.110> bouncing<00:04:39.470> off<00:04:39.560> of<00:04:39.620> that

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
really because it's bouncing off of that

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.170 
really because it's bouncing off of that
white<00:04:40.099> card<00:04:40.460> but<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.330> one's<00:04:41.720> not<00:04:42.050> too<00:04:42.320> bad<00:04:43.180> so

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
white card but that one's not too bad so

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.540 
white card but that one's not too bad so
next<00:04:44.360> we<00:04:44.599> moved<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.020> Omni<00:04:45.470> dome<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:45.950> this

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
next we moved to the Omni dome and this

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.159 
next we moved to the Omni dome and this
one<00:04:46.729> because<00:04:47.030> it's<00:04:47.180> bouncing<00:04:47.570> light<00:04:47.750> in<00:04:47.900> every

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
one because it's bouncing light in every

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.920 
one because it's bouncing light in every
direction<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.979> illuminates<00:04:49.490> everything<00:04:49.930> and

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
direction it illuminates everything and

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.070 
direction it illuminates everything and
it's<00:04:51.110> not<00:04:51.200> particularly<00:04:51.919> that<00:04:52.520> soft<00:04:53.450> of<00:04:53.900> a

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
it's not particularly that soft of a

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.670 
it's not particularly that soft of a
light<00:04:54.320> just<00:04:55.070> because<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.389> size<00:04:57.110> of<00:04:57.380> light

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
light just because of the size of light

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.260 
light just because of the size of light
source<00:04:58.099> is<00:04:58.780> tiny<00:04:59.780> so<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.710> just<00:05:01.580> soft<00:05:01.849> as<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.120> can

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
source is tiny so I just soft as you can

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.140 
source is tiny so I just soft as you can
get<00:05:02.479> but<00:05:02.599> it's<00:05:02.660> not<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:03.500> soft<00:05:03.979> so<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:05.000> was

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
get but it's not that soft so that was

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.640 
get but it's not that soft so that was
with<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.389> Omni<00:05:05.720> dome<00:05:05.870> facing<00:05:06.349> almost

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
with the Omni dome facing almost

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.210 
with the Omni dome facing almost
straight<00:05:07.580> up<00:05:07.760> one<00:05:08.090> notch<00:05:08.300> forward<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.860> next

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
straight up one notch forward the next

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.830 
straight up one notch forward the next
one<00:05:10.400> this<00:05:10.580> one<00:05:10.639> I<00:05:10.940> moved<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.419> Omni<00:05:11.690> dome

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
one this one I moved the Omni dome

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.810 
one this one I moved the Omni dome
pointed<00:05:12.410> almost<00:05:12.710> backwards<00:05:12.979> it<00:05:13.460> was<00:05:13.580> one

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
pointed almost backwards it was one

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.350 
pointed almost backwards it was one
notch

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
notch

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.290 
notch
pointed<00:05:14.960> backwards<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:16.729> like<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.120> light

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
pointed backwards and I like the light

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.480 
pointed backwards and I like the light
that<00:05:17.330> this<00:05:17.720> produced<00:05:18.139> better<00:05:19.010> than<00:05:19.250> when<00:05:19.400> it

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
that this produced better than when it

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.540 
that this produced better than when it
was<00:05:19.610> pointed<00:05:19.849> forward<00:05:20.660> it's<00:05:21.590> not<00:05:21.830> quite<00:05:22.370> as

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
was pointed forward it's not quite as

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.670 
was pointed forward it's not quite as
bright<00:05:22.760> in<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.180> background<00:05:23.780> which<00:05:24.320> we<00:05:24.560> don't

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
bright in the background which we don't

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.860 
bright in the background which we don't
really<00:05:25.039> want<00:05:25.250> anyway<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:26.240> quality<00:05:26.630> of<00:05:26.690> light

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
really want anyway the quality of light

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.240 
really want anyway the quality of light
something<00:05:27.199> about<00:05:27.500> it's<00:05:27.650> just<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:27.860> little<00:05:28.039> bit

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
something about it's just a little bit

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.640 
something about it's just a little bit
better<00:05:28.669> I<00:05:28.789> like<00:05:29.030> that<00:05:29.320> that<00:05:30.320> was<00:05:30.349> a<00:05:30.440> good

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
better I like that that was a good

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.779 
better I like that that was a good
discovery<00:05:30.950> I've<00:05:31.159> never<00:05:31.310> tried<00:05:31.550> that<00:05:31.610> before

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
discovery I've never tried that before

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.290 
discovery I've never tried that before
and<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:32.479> actually

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
and I actually

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.170 
and I actually
my<00:05:33.690> last<00:05:33.990> shot<00:05:34.290> was<00:05:34.500> with<00:05:34.740> my<00:05:34.980> little<00:05:35.310> softbox

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
my last shot was with my little softbox

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.980 
my last shot was with my little softbox
thing<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:37.370> this<00:05:38.370> thing<00:05:38.430> consumed<00:05:39.389> a<00:05:39.600> ton<00:05:39.960> of

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
thing and this thing consumed a ton of

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.280 
thing and this thing consumed a ton of
light<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.560> TTL<00:05:41.040> metering<00:05:41.220> was<00:05:41.880> not<00:05:42.210> doing<00:05:43.050> its

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
light the TTL metering was not doing its

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.280 
light the TTL metering was not doing its
job<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.650> did<00:05:44.160> two<00:05:44.490> test<00:05:44.790> shots<00:05:45.060> and<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.360> produced

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
job I did two test shots and it produced

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.310 
job I did two test shots and it produced
the<00:05:46.440> same<00:05:46.650> image<00:05:47.040> so<00:05:48.030> it<00:05:48.360> was<00:05:48.450> underexposed<00:05:49.169> by

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
the same image so it was underexposed by

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.100 
the same image so it was underexposed by
bus<00:05:49.470> stop<00:05:49.889> and<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.130> half<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:50.460> had<00:05:50.610> to<00:05:50.790> raise<00:05:51.780> this

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
bus stop and a half I had to raise this

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.600 
bus stop and a half I had to raise this
up<00:05:52.710> otherwise<00:05:53.780> it<00:05:54.780> was<00:05:54.930> really<00:05:55.320> dark<00:05:55.470> so<00:05:56.310> that

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
up otherwise it was really dark so that

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.250 
up otherwise it was really dark so that
introduced<00:05:57.000> a<00:05:57.120> lot<00:05:57.270> of<00:05:57.389> extra<00:05:57.720> noise<00:05:57.930> and

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
introduced a lot of extra noise and

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.400 
introduced a lot of extra noise and
stuff<00:05:58.620> and<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.130> light<00:05:59.210> isn't<00:06:00.410> particularly

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
stuff and the light isn't particularly

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.480 
stuff and the light isn't particularly
that<00:06:01.620> much<00:06:02.090> softer<00:06:03.090> so<00:06:03.780> my<00:06:04.200> favourites<00:06:04.889> from

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
that much softer so my favourites from

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.270 
that much softer so my favourites from
the<00:06:05.669> two<00:06:05.910> were<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.530> built-in<00:06:07.530> bounce<00:06:07.830> card

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
the two were the built-in bounce card

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.520 
the two were the built-in bounce card
and<00:06:09.169> the<00:06:10.169> on<00:06:10.440> dome<00:06:10.830> facing<00:06:11.550> backwards

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
and the on dome facing backwards

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.000 
and the on dome facing backwards
surprisingly<00:06:16.940> so<00:06:17.940> if<00:06:18.030> we<00:06:18.180> look<00:06:18.360> at<00:06:18.510> our

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
surprisingly so if we look at our

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.790 
surprisingly so if we look at our
shadows<00:06:20.010> the<00:06:20.880> Omni<00:06:21.750> dome<00:06:21.870> facing<00:06:22.290> backwards

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
shadows the Omni dome facing backwards

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.940 
shadows the Omni dome facing backwards
is<00:06:23.310> a<00:06:23.370> slightly<00:06:23.820> softer<00:06:24.210> light<00:06:24.750> based<00:06:25.710> on

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
is a slightly softer light based on

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.790 
is a slightly softer light based on
these<00:06:26.100> leaf<00:06:26.430> shadows<00:06:27.030> based<00:06:27.930> on<00:06:28.110> that<00:06:28.350> one<00:06:28.560> but

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
these leaf shadows based on that one but

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.310 
these leaf shadows based on that one but
this<00:06:28.979> one<00:06:29.220> different<00:06:29.760> it's<00:06:30.750> actually<00:06:31.080> very

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
this one different it's actually very

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.409 
this one different it's actually very
similar<00:06:31.880> yeah<00:06:32.880> it<00:06:33.090> would<00:06:33.240> be<00:06:33.389> really

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
similar yeah it would be really

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.330 
similar yeah it would be really
difficult<00:06:34.410> to<00:06:34.530> tell<00:06:34.710> the<00:06:34.860> difference<00:06:35.250> between

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
difficult to tell the difference between

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.610 
difficult to tell the difference between
the<00:06:35.940> two<00:06:36.150> I<00:06:36.180> think<00:06:36.360> these<00:06:36.720> two<00:06:37.080> light<00:06:37.260> sources

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
the two I think these two light sources

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.640 
the two I think these two light sources
are<00:06:37.800> very<00:06:37.830> similar<00:06:38.340> so<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:39.600> built-in<00:06:40.050> bounce

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
are very similar so the built-in bounce

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.529 
are very similar so the built-in bounce
card<00:06:41.010> seems<00:06:41.370> to<00:06:41.610> be<00:06:41.700> like<00:06:42.000> a<00:06:42.030> really<00:06:42.390> good

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
card seems to be like a really good

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:44.090 
card seems to be like a really good
option<00:06:42.750> I<00:06:43.110> think<00:06:43.560> that's<00:06:43.740> what<00:06:43.890> I'm<00:06:43.979> gonna

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
option I think that's what I'm gonna

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.390 
option I think that's what I'm gonna
start<00:06:44.400> using<00:06:44.669> or<00:06:45.229> potentially<00:06:46.229> the<00:06:46.260> Omni<00:06:47.220> dome

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
start using or potentially the Omni dome

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.670 
start using or potentially the Omni dome
facing<00:06:47.789> backwards<00:06:48.210> so<00:06:49.050> I<00:06:49.080> hope<00:06:49.380> you<00:06:49.500> found

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
facing backwards so I hope you found

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.390 
facing backwards so I hope you found
this<00:06:49.890> useful

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
this useful

other type of speed light light modifier
you<00:06:57.240> use<00:06:57.660> when<00:06:57.900> the<00:06:58.050> flash<00:06:58.350> is<00:06:58.560> on<00:06:58.770> camera<00:06:59.400> and

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
you use when the flash is on camera and

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.860 
you use when the flash is on camera and
you're<00:06:59.729> outside<00:06:59.880> you<00:07:00.180> can't<00:07:00.419> bounce<00:07:00.600> off

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
you're outside you can't bounce off

you're outside you can't bounce off
anything<00:07:01.289> let<00:07:02.070> me<00:07:02.100> know<00:07:02.270> otherwise<00:07:03.270> like<00:07:03.750> and
