00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
eternity and I've even actually made one

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.099 
eternity and I've even actually made one
slightly<00:00:16.170> smaller<00:00:16.680> how<00:00:17.250> small<00:00:17.580> well<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.660> was

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
slightly smaller how small well I was

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.830 
slightly smaller how small well I was
able<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.350> fit<00:00:19.560> inside<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.920> head<00:00:20.840> introducing

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
able to fit inside a head introducing

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.620 
able to fit inside a head introducing
the<00:00:22.560> outcast<00:00:23.160> honeydew<00:00:24.109> cannon<00:00:26.210> he<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.449> hit

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the outcast honeydew cannon he just hit

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.110 
the outcast honeydew cannon he just hit
me<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.680> again<00:00:29.580> I've<00:00:29.789> actually<00:00:31.700> now<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.880> does

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
me so again I've actually now this does

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.549 
me so again I've actually now this does
run<00:00:33.360> greater<00:00:33.690> risk<00:00:33.930> than<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> other<00:00:34.320> ones

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
run greater risk than the other ones

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.260 
run greater risk than the other ones
because<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:35.010> misfire<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:35.760> blow<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.120> his

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
because one misfire will blow up his

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.069 
because one misfire will blow up his
head<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.489> well<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:40.610> look<00:00:41.610> inside

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
head so well this one I look inside

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.479 
head so well this one I look inside
Simon's<00:00:43.079> head<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.950> show<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.730> again

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
Simon's head will show you that again

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.970 
Simon's head will show you that again
just<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> four<00:00:47.969> by<00:00:48.329> five<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.260> think<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
just the four by five I think it is and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.520 
just the four by five I think it is and
I've<00:00:50.579> actually<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.360> down<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.379> where

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
I've actually have that down to where

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
I've actually have that down to where
it's<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.920> straight<00:00:53.219> down<00:00:53.309> there's<00:00:53.910> no<00:00:54.059> fall

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
it's going straight down there's no fall

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's going straight down there's no fall
so<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.260> instantly<00:00:56.070> goes<00:00:56.250> two<00:00:56.460> blocks

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
so it just instantly goes two blocks

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
so it just instantly goes two blocks
down<00:00:56.899> one<00:00:57.899> misfire<00:00:58.410> will<00:00:58.739> blow<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> whole

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
down one misfire will blow up the whole

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.180 
down one misfire will blow up the whole
thing<00:00:59.489> trust<00:01:00.480> me<00:01:00.629> I've<00:01:00.899> rebuilt<00:01:01.500> Simon
