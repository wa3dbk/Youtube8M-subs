i'm going to be ready to start my next
row<00:02:26.220> now<00:02:26.790> because<00:02:27.150> i<00:02:27.270> only<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.720> one<00:02:27.959> row<00:02:28.230> on

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
row now because i only have one row on

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.620 
row now because i only have one row on
here<00:02:29.040> your<00:02:29.520> second<00:02:29.970> row<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.300> little

you're going to be able to do some

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.680 
you're going to be able to do some
wonderful<00:03:28.109> samples<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:28.920> by<00:03:29.700> changing<00:03:30.120> the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
wonderful samples just by changing the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.370 
wonderful samples just by changing the
size<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.319> beads<00:03:31.850> on<00:03:32.850> my<00:03:33.480> first<00:03:33.780> sample<00:03:34.290> I

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
size of the beads on my first sample I

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.809 
size of the beads on my first sample I
used<00:03:34.709> size<00:03:35.250> eight<00:03:35.690> hexes<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.519> size<00:03:38.519> eight

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
used size eight hexes and size eight

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.440 
used size eight hexes and size eight
metallic<00:03:40.310> triangles<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.549> you<00:03:41.880> can<00:03:42.030> see<00:03:42.299> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
metallic triangles and you can see the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.920 
metallic triangles and you can see the
difference<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:44.370> look<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.510> piece<00:03:45.720> of

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
difference in the look of the piece of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.500 
difference in the look of the piece of
bead<00:03:46.139> work<00:03:46.380> in<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:47.069> second<00:03:47.489> sample<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.120> tried

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
bead work in the second sample I tried

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.229 
bead work in the second sample I tried
all<00:03:48.750> different<00:03:48.989> sizes<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.459> can<00:03:50.639> see<00:03:50.940> just

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
all different sizes and you can see just

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.390 
all different sizes and you can see just
the<00:03:51.510> same<00:03:51.870> stitch<00:03:52.260> same<00:03:52.739> number<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.130> beads

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
the same stitch same number of beads

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.220 
the same stitch same number of beads
across<00:03:54.410> so<00:03:55.410> here's<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.459> finished<00:03:56.910> piece<00:03:57.230> where

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
across so here's a finished piece where

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.360 
across so here's a finished piece where
I<00:03:58.260> used<00:03:58.670> 1.3<00:03:59.670> size<00:03:59.970> cylinder<00:04:00.720> beads<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.650> it

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
I used 1.3 size cylinder beads and it

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.330 
I used 1.3 size cylinder beads and it
just<00:04:02.880> shows<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.180> variety<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.410> herringbone

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
just shows the variety in herringbone

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.500 
just shows the variety in herringbone
stitch<00:04:05.819> that<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.239> can<00:04:06.420> make<00:04:06.600> once<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.230> learn
