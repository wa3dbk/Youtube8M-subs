00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:09.509
 Hello collage and we are friends with you Andrei 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.809
 words we are now in something of a storm 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.730
 largest gems market in 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.720
 Asia is a bit far away for us 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.210
 there are buyers here come 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.010
 sellers of stones with a bunch and sit a bunch 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.800
 You can buy a lot of food here. 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.300
 all sorts of different and tasty and appreciate 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.750
 for some reason I remembered 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.259
 I remembered at once the three most important 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.390
 mistakes 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.120
 sales and 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.890
 market relations first mistake 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.199
 if you have a product or something 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.260
 sold means you can't sell 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.640
 ill sell the second mistake if you can 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.180
 sell but the product still doesn't 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.540
 sold means bad and third 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.649
 mistake is if you sell no order 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.649
 people or not given 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 track down leave you a joke from 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.049
 my favorite 2k wallpaper decided to do 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.110
 business buy melons in mexico download 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.659
 car and drive them to canada and sell them 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.200
 in Canada for fucking goes on one dollar 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.940
 selling at 2 here on this one percent on 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.550
 I don't live here, they made one trip 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.950
 second third but no money 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.780
 need everyone wish overhead part 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.570
 goods spoil the ear money goes to 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.000
 one to service the car to a stop 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.490
 in hotels parking and so on although the goods 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.710
 quickly diverges in general and here they are 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.370
 they are already driving the third walk they donâ€™t like 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.530
 this situation and they are silent intensely 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.930
 I think here one thing is different, John says I 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.950
 know why 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.950
 we have no money or chisel tell in 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.550
 what's the matter really need to drive faster here 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.470
 at all 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.660
 and very many are trying really 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.080
 Faster is if we take for example 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.180
 such a situation and trying to project 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.150
 these three mistakes in sales it is obvious 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.860
 that these wallpapers do not know how to sell on you 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.869
 in the same way you can teach your 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.300
 sales manager selling his 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.259
 what product there will be no more action 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.819
 perform 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.099
 but at the same time the product will be sold 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.159
 bad because you do it alone 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.709
 and the same there is so now acceleration so 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.629
 bad process it does not lead to 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.510
 increase sales efficiency 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.250
 so if you want to sell more 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.700
 active learn really good 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.670
 sell then need to learn new methods 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.610
 sales that are not yet mental 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.930
 who do not yet know the competitors who 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.379
 they really work 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.829
 there and a thousand years used and 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.890

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.000

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.639

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.030
 those children do not know if you will teach 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.890
 manager 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.190
 their managers just so simple 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.230
 banal technicians is a normal client 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.840
 you just give me a little you have no choice for me 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.069
 you give the choice again to do it 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.470
 generally no more talking to you 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.380
