going to hooking up a single RGB
multicolor<00:00:30.079> bulb<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:31.279> we<00:00:31.399> just<00:00:31.550> need<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.790> plug

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
multicolor bulb so we just need to plug

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.490 
multicolor bulb so we just need to plug
the<00:00:32.570> RGB<00:00:32.989> output<00:00:33.489> into<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.579> RGB<00:00:34.850> wire<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.079> just

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
the RGB output into the RGB wire so just

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.160 
the RGB output into the RGB wire so just
plug<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.770> directly<00:00:36.860> in<00:00:37.570> if<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:38.690> doesn't<00:00:38.990> come

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
plug it directly in if it doesn't come

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.520 
plug it directly in if it doesn't come
on<00:00:39.200> right<00:00:39.470> away<00:00:39.590> you'll<00:00:40.340> want<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:40.550> unplug<00:00:41.530> flip

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
on right away you'll want to unplug flip

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.370 
on right away you'll want to unplug flip
it<00:00:42.650> 180<00:00:42.980> degrees<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.810> then<00:00:44.810> plug<00:00:45.020> it<00:00:45.140> in<00:00:45.230> once

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.530 
it 180 degrees and then plug it in once
again<00:00:45.680> you<00:00:46.640> should<00:00:46.880> be<00:00:47.030> able<00:00:47.090> to<00:00:47.210> have<00:00:47.420> it

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
again you should be able to have it

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.300 
again you should be able to have it
light<00:00:47.690> up<00:00:47.810> a<00:00:47.900> single<00:00:48.140> color<00:00:48.410> before<00:00:48.890> we<00:00:49.160> even

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
light up a single color before we even

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.670 
light up a single color before we even
try<00:00:49.579> accessing<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.300> app<00:00:50.420> at<00:00:50.600> all<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.290> first<00:00:51.560> of

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
try accessing the app at all so first of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.990 
try accessing the app at all so first of
all<00:00:51.710> make<00:00:51.920> sure<00:00:51.950> you're<00:00:52.220> getting<00:00:52.490> power<00:00:52.670> and

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
all make sure you're getting power and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.590 
all make sure you're getting power and
that<00:00:53.630> system<00:00:53.810> itself<00:00:54.230> lights<00:00:54.500> up<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.800> bulb

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
that system itself lights up the bulb

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.510 
that system itself lights up the bulb
we're<00:00:56.600> now<00:00:56.690> going<00:00:56.900> to<00:00:56.960> find<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.380> app<00:00:57.800> for<00:00:58.370> the

that in the store and you'll find one

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.910 
that in the store and you'll find one
that<00:01:13.790> with<00:01:13.909> this<00:01:14.120> type<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.659> logo<00:01:14.990> we'll<00:01:15.770> go

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
that with this type of a logo we'll go

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.680 
that with this type of a logo we'll go
ahead<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.190> download<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.580> I've<00:01:17.360> already

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
ahead and download that I've already

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.289 
ahead and download that I've already
installed<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.140> on<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:18.380> phone<00:01:19.060> so<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.120> next

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
installed it on this phone so the next

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.740 
looking to have in the future what's
nice<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.979> that<00:03:43.009> even<00:03:43.579> if<00:03:43.699> the<00:03:43.849> app<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.269> updated

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
nice is that even if the app is updated

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.270 
nice is that even if the app is updated
you<00:03:44.900> won't<00:03:45.439> need<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.650> purchase<00:03:45.919> another

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
you won't need to purchase another

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.369 
you won't need to purchase another
controller<00:03:46.699> just<00:03:47.449> the<00:03:47.569> free<00:03:47.870> app<00:03:48.049> will<00:03:48.259> be

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
controller just the free app will be

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.659 
controller just the free app will be
updated<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:48.979> you<00:03:49.099> can<00:03:49.250> get<00:03:49.370> those<00:03:49.519> new

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
updated and you can get those new

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.390 
updated and you can get those new
features<00:03:50.030> without<00:03:50.359> any<00:03:50.720> cost<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:52.099> final

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
features without any cost the final

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.890 
features without any cost the final
setting<00:03:52.639> is<00:03:52.729> the<00:03:52.819> built-in<00:03:53.120> modes<00:03:53.359> so<00:03:53.750> these

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
setting is the built-in modes so these

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.599 
setting is the built-in modes so these
are<00:03:54.199> just<00:03:54.379> modes<00:03:54.680> for<00:03:54.919> example<00:03:55.009> the<00:03:55.340> first<00:03:55.489> one

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
are just modes for example the first one

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.659 
are just modes for example the first one
is<00:03:55.790> 7<00:03:56.090> color<00:03:56.269> crossfade<00:03:57.189> so<00:03:58.189> if<00:03:58.280> we<00:03:58.340> go<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.519> that

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
is 7 color crossfade so if we go to that

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.699 
is 7 color crossfade so if we go to that
mode<00:03:58.849> you<00:03:58.879> can<00:03:59.090> see<00:03:59.299> we<00:03:59.989> have<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.109> crossfade

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
mode you can see we have a crossfade

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.979 
mode you can see we have a crossfade
then<00:04:01.459> there's<00:04:01.669> different<00:04:01.819> ones<00:04:02.090> blue<00:04:02.449> gradual

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
then there's different ones blue gradual

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.110 
then there's different ones blue gradual
change<00:04:03.290> that's<00:04:03.560> just<00:04:03.709> just<00:04:03.859> slow<00:04:04.400> strobe<00:04:04.879> and

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
change that's just just slow strobe and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.819 
change that's just just slow strobe and
kind<00:04:05.509> of<00:04:05.569> go<00:04:05.689> through<00:04:05.719> those<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.290> see<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.530> lot

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
kind of go through those and see a lot

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.469 
kind of go through those and see a lot
of<00:04:06.889> different<00:04:07.129> ones<00:04:07.250> there's<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.299> lot<00:04:08.419> of

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:08.479 
of different ones there's a lot of

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.550 
of different ones there's a lot of
difference<00:04:08.750> in<00:04:08.870> there<00:04:09.049> but<00:04:09.199> if<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.379> don't

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
difference in there but if you don't

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.959 
difference in there but if you don't
like<00:04:09.799> any<00:04:09.979> of<00:04:10.069> those

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:10.969 
like any of those

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.749 
like any of those

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:22.219 
going left to right into squares right

now it's red green blue and white we can

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.269 
now it's red green blue and white we can
then<00:04:25.969> set<00:04:26.360> gradual<00:04:27.110> jumping<00:04:27.529> or<00:04:27.650> strobe<00:04:28.010> and

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:28.279 
then set gradual jumping or strobe and

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:30.820 
then set gradual jumping or strobe and
then<00:04:29.150> change<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.930> actual<00:04:30.229> speed<00:04:30.529> as<00:04:30.650> well

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
then change the actual speed as well

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.159 
then change the actual speed as well
with<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.130> slider<00:04:31.370> at<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.490> bottom

with the slider at the bottom

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.320

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
then if I get the speed going again it

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.629 
then if I get the speed going again it
will<00:04:43.300> start<00:04:43.360> play<00:04:44.139> just<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.009> red<00:04:45.279> and<00:04:45.520> that
