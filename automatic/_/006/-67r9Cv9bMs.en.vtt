00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.540
 positions of the pentatonic scale 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:10.210
 minor for my minor's tonality and the 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.790
 Greater sun hue is convenient 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.520
 practice this tonality a lot because 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.610
 there are infinity of cruiser rockers themes 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.580
 metal that use the minor tonic in the 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:26.230
 tonality of me and many songs 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.300
 more pop more classic rock more country than 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.610
 also the shade of sun we are going to 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.060
 start with a first position 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.410
 the first position in the tonality and 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.330
 first let's talk as my minor 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.720
 knowing that it is exactly the same as 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.720
 be older 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.040
 begins with a string to the air the sixth 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.829
 rope 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.800
 the air is a 1000 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:55.210
 therefore I would stay a first 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.909
 position that would be to air space 3 to 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.280
 air space 2 air space two at 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.640
 air space two air space 3 al 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.600
 air space 3 would be the equivalent of 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.340
 if instead of stepping in fear one 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.979
 they touch the strings in the air to a 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.979
 dummy medium fingering using finger 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.720
 with the correct fingering it would be 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.630
 in the third space I would have the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.630
 second position 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.170
 in the third in the fifth space I 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.170
 it would be the third position 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.760
 in the seventh space I would have the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760
 quarter 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.950
 the fifth position on the disk 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.020
 on the 12th fret again the first 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.020
 position 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.200
 again 1a 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.890
 second 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.280
 third 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.410
 guard 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.569
 fifth 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.300
 first round 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:29.950
 we return first 5a 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.950
 the fourth day 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.469
 third 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.530
 Look 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.530
 divine
