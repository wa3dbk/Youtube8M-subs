 chopped a problem in the foot and that no one wants also of the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.210
 images no 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.770
 the goblin as a dye 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.500
 adm and people is everything 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.560
 but how cool is not the truth is the beat and john lennon or not but yes 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.760
 the truth will be moved on Monday for parents, you returned several of the 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.660
 activities that we developed yesterday the voice and 3 30 a.m. 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.080
 who tried against apple is stuck bogota 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.560
 in the adventure of traveling in a 10 by specially designed tracks to 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.820
 this type of vehicle cp this person emotions that many people have not lived and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.930
 that many times 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.039
 probably will not have the opportunity to live 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.450
 and in the bag are farmers sharing our jovi that's how 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.789
 started all this started as cob and ricardo sent box we were going in 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.590
 our chip knew how to make roads 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.450
 india we came up with and croc the same day curiously pointillism includes 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.410
 father because it occurred to us that why we did not make our jovi something 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.360
 that could reach more people 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.060
 and since we also liked to rappel this camping is something that we like 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.979
 A lot too 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.289
 We decided to take advantage of some land that we have there the laborcita for 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:15.359
 put park 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.599
 and notice that it works very well we are very very happy as it does not 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.799
 there is no magic part because no one wanted 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.560
 Everyone should do if you are over 18 low because 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.029
 they have not been completely familiar 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.449
 it's called that I really love paris indications that there's something very 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.839
 It is important that the voice and text on campus make sure that all experiences are of 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:35.889
 learning 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.400
 dt with security you very funny because what we are looking for 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:43.859
 expressly that people the little ones the new generations then go 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.839
 vivaldi that combines with nature live in harmony with nature but 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.249
 the most interesting 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:50.969
 that they also learn to respect it 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.769
 that they learn to share with their family and that they can live a personal challenge 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:59.019
 notice that it inhabits us we are inviting all schools to all 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.639
 the groups of the university secondary high schools 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.489
 who want to go live the experience can understand a camp we design 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.980
 activities dynamic challenges competition games role playing 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.069
 yes throughout a reality 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.920
 with several very interesting clues we will suddenly have a group doing 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.730
 lgl the descent by bicycle while others are doing kayak damming 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.849
 there in the lake others will be giving some tracks beyond the track of 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.810
 four-for-four vehicles others may be doing the rappel others 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.700
 maybe playing bocha but everyone is going to be well entertained another thing that 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.490
 we make a lot of sense there's going to be every one of the activities we could well 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.500
 organize groups to play monkfish or pay others to rappel to make cocha 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:47.129
 a simple activity more than we have in the game but also 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.209
 we try to put together an experience 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.529
 eto'o lived it, we advance you to take the group so that you live all the 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:53.400
 experiences 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.370
 and when we take it further for example for groups of companies they 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.910
 we help to generate a synergy of work 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.370
 we helped them to dinner to a high performance work group based on the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.480
 experiences that they have with the challenges that we put them there that 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.869
 belong the one that mentions 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:10.059
 they help a lot to implement what strategies and good team of 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.809
 work 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:14.150
 Corgan posed to companies is this way 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.269
 that as a requirement to milk that you can also communicate 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.209
 well forward with the people who collaborate within the dam 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.150
 and it is something very father 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.270
 you have to handle it also like that in that way you know what the teams 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.770
 are integrated in some way a high work team 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.430
 I have expressly thought about these points 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.040
 help for example we have had a group are important 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.910
 in which a person of the group exploded that they have to do all rappel 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.189
 but one has a phobia and it can be that the phobia pc catches mind to the height 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.099
 but the group motivates her 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.619
 there has not been anyone who is truly ricardo ahued all enter all what 

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:50.979
 they stage the challenge because they feel supported by the trained team 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.979
 for the company goes further in the day to day of work the company 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.790
 the experience that the music lived that charm 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.189
 will help us to have higher performance 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.569
 there is a variety of local artists 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.129
 there are entrepreneurs built the plant installed that the advantage 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.280
 67 I would like to share with you something that mentions this, we are a group of 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.330
 specialists 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.680
 which we have been working with for a long time with the work teams and 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.319
 now it occurred to us to have our own place our own park such 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.419
 it's a place with a lot of history because it's going if you do not know it well there 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:22.400
 this 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.590
 prehispanic background of a group chichimecas box there are things well 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.250
 interesting to know and to see and in the voice and text in singer so happy 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.759
 and we will never be 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.119
 we brought it an extreme prudence this is a bag is a bag goodbye to 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:38.120
 through a bag pays homage 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.639
 what do we use it for what people 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.040
 which means that he wants to live with us 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.490
 good thing you can try to win music contingent 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.669

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.820

 third 1 will be good if the president 77 will make it have 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:13.949
