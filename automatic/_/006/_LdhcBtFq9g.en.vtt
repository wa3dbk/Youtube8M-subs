00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
least 30 seconds so the easiest way that

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.350 
least 30 seconds so the easiest way that
I've<00:00:20.860> found<00:00:21.070> to<00:00:21.310> be<00:00:21.640> able<00:00:21.730> to<00:00:21.910> do<00:00:22.030> this<00:00:22.180> is

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
I've found to be able to do this is

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.740 
I've found to be able to do this is
actually<00:00:22.540> doing<00:00:23.080> it<00:00:23.230> in<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:24.150> red<00:00:25.150> zone<00:00:25.180> where

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
actually doing it in the red zone where

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.870 
actually doing it in the red zone where
there's<00:00:25.930> a<00:00:25.990> lot<00:00:26.230> of<00:00:26.400> infected<00:00:27.400> just<00:00:27.580> running

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
there's a lot of infected just running

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.300 
there's a lot of infected just running
around<00:00:27.970> on<00:00:28.420> the<00:00:28.450> ground<00:00:29.440> so<00:00:29.770> basically<00:00:30.070> you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
around on the ground so basically you

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.710 
around on the ground so basically you
just<00:00:30.490> have<00:00:30.610> to<00:00:30.700> jump<00:00:30.880> up<00:00:31.060> really<00:00:31.300> high<00:00:31.510> and
