and I bet you thought it never applied

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830 
and I bet you thought it never applied
to<00:00:52.710> bow<00:00:52.860> hunting<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.730> even<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.059> old<00:00:54.270> dog<00:00:54.510> can

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
to bow hunting but even an old dog can

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.290 
to bow hunting but even an old dog can
learn<00:00:55.020> new<00:00:55.289> tricks<00:00:55.620> now<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> do

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
learn new tricks now what you want to do

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689 
learn new tricks now what you want to do
is<00:00:57.480> use<00:00:57.660> your<00:00:57.840> thumb<00:00:58.199> or<00:00:58.620> more<00:00:58.949> precisely<00:00:59.340> your

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
is use your thumb or more precisely your

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.689 
is use your thumb or more precisely your
thumbnail<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:01.079> estimate<00:01:01.649> distance<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
thumbnail to estimate distance now it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.299 
thumbnail to estimate distance now it
sounds<00:01:02.850> crazy<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> works<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> do

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
sounds crazy but it works now what I do

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.670 
sounds crazy but it works now what I do
is<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.090> stick<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:06.540> thumb<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.200> arm's<00:01:07.470> length

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
is I stick my thumb out at arm's length

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.370 
is I stick my thumb out at arm's length
pointed<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> target<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> deer<00:01:10.229> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
pointed at the target now a deer is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.100 
pointed at the target now a deer is
about<00:01:10.650> 36<00:01:11.250> inches<00:01:11.520> from<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> ground<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
about 36 inches from the ground to the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.100 
about 36 inches from the ground to the
top<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.530> its<00:01:13.680> back<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.250> through<00:01:14.970> practice<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
top of its back and through practice and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.620 
top of its back and through practice and
experimentation<00:01:17.009> I've<00:01:17.700> learned<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.479> I'm

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
experimentation I've learned that if I'm

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.160 
experimentation I've learned that if I'm
standing<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.229> 30<00:01:19.560> yards<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.880> thumbnail<00:01:21.540> will

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
standing at 30 yards my thumbnail will

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.010 
standing at 30 yards my thumbnail will
cover<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> distance<00:01:23.090> from<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.299> deers<00:01:24.600> hoofs

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
cover that distance from the deers hoofs

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.530 
cover that distance from the deers hoofs
to<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> top<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.100> his<00:01:26.220> back<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:27.030> what<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:27.420> if

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
to the top of his back but what about if

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.450 
to the top of his back but what about if
you<00:01:27.659> don't<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.320> range<00:01:28.470> oK<00:01:29.009> we've<00:01:29.159> moved

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you don't know your range oK we've moved

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.249 
you don't know your range oK we've moved
up<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> target<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:30.720> gonna<00:01:30.869> use<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
up on the target and I'm gonna use the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.660 
up on the target and I'm gonna use the
same<00:01:31.530> rule<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.130> thumb

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
same rule of thumb

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.690 
same rule of thumb
okay<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.170> bottom<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.710> my<00:01:34.890> thumbnail<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
okay now the bottom of my thumbnail is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
okay now the bottom of my thumbnail is
resting<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> ground<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.560> top<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.009> my

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
resting on the ground the top of my

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.890 
resting on the ground the top of my
thumbnails<00:01:38.700> hitting<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> deer<00:01:39.659> about

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
thumbnails hitting the deer about

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.289 
thumbnails hitting the deer about
halfway<00:01:40.200> between<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.189> ground<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> top

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
halfway between the ground and the top

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.810 
halfway between the ground and the top
of<00:01:42.450> his<00:01:42.570> back<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> math<00:01:43.710> half<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.490> 30

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
of his back so do the math half of 30

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.120 
of his back so do the math half of 30
I'm<00:01:45.450> guessing<00:01:45.899> were<00:01:45.990> standing<00:01:46.259> 15<00:01:46.530> yards

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I'm guessing were standing 15 yards

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.810 
I'm guessing were standing 15 yards
let's<00:01:47.340> check<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:49.340> fifteen<00:01:50.340> point<00:01:50.579> five

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
let's check it out fifteen point five

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.880 
let's check it out fifteen point five
that's<00:01:51.270> good<00:01:51.509> enough<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:51.750> me<00:01:51.930> okay<00:01:52.740> let's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
that's good enough for me okay let's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.380 
that's good enough for me okay let's
move<00:01:53.130> back<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> see<00:01:53.729> how<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.970> works

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
move back and see how it works

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
move back and see how it works
okay<00:01:54.990> I've<00:01:55.170> moved<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:55.619> back<00:01:55.920> again<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
okay I've moved way back again now and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
okay I've moved way back again now and
we're<00:01:57.299> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> try<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> estimate<00:01:58.439> this

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
we're going to try to estimate this

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.160 
we're going to try to estimate this
range<00:01:58.979> using<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.549> thumb<00:01:59.850> again<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.689> bottom<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
range using my thumb again the bottom of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.440 
range using my thumb again the bottom of
my<00:02:01.320> thumbnail<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> ground<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
my thumbnail is on the ground and the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.139 
my thumbnail is on the ground and the
top<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.719> my<00:02:03.990> thumbnail<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.710> about<00:02:05.070> even<00:02:05.670> with

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
top of my thumbnail is about even with

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.479 
top of my thumbnail is about even with
the<00:02:06.210> top<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> deers<00:02:07.049> wrap<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.250> my<00:02:08.429> D

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
the top of the deers wrap so my D

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.350 
the top of the deers wrap so my D
estimation<00:02:09.119> is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
estimation is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.380 
estimation is
this<00:02:09.479> distance<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:11.340> we're<00:02:11.640> about<00:02:11.880> half

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
this distance is that we're about half

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.020 
this distance is that we're about half
of<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.690> 30<00:02:13.020> hi<00:02:13.350> now<00:02:13.650> we're<00:02:14.190> probably<00:02:14.460> at<00:02:14.520> 45

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
of that 30 hi now we're probably at 45

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.420 
of that 30 hi now we're probably at 45
yards

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
yards

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.640 
yards
okay<00:02:17.430> we're<00:02:17.610> spot<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.390> time<00:02:18.630> 45<00:02:19.230> yards

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
okay we're spot on this time 45 yards

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.530 
okay we're spot on this time 45 yards
now<00:02:20.190> most<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.640> time<00:02:20.850> I'm<00:02:21.030> going<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.240> be<00:02:21.360> off

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
now most of the time I'm going to be off

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.960 
now most of the time I'm going to be off
a<00:02:21.750> yard<00:02:22.050> or<00:02:22.230> two<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:23.010> at<00:02:23.130> least<00:02:23.460> it's<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:23.850> to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
a yard or two but at least it's going to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.390 
a yard or two but at least it's going to
put<00:02:24.300> me<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> ballpark<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.130> said

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
put me in the ballpark like I said

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.820 
put me in the ballpark like I said
earlier<00:02:26.880> don't<00:02:27.600> leave<00:02:27.930> home<00:02:28.140> without<00:02:28.350> this

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
earlier don't leave home without this

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.250 
earlier don't leave home without this
but<00:02:29.430> if<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.670> do<00:02:29.910> or<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.510> can't<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
but if you do or if you can't get to it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:51.950 
but if you do or if you can't get to it
always<00:02:31.920> remember<00:02:32.610> your<00:02:32.790> rule<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.210> thumb

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.020
