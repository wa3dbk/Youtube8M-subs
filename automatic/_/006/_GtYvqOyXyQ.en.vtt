00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
so also too in this video I am freaking

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.270 
so also too in this video I am freaking
flat<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> pancake<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:25.290> remember<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.740> think<00:02:26.069> by

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
flat as a pancake I remember I think by

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.920 
flat as a pancake I remember I think by
this<00:02:26.340> by<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.850> time<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:29.340> had<00:02:29.370> only<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:30.540> think

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
this by this time we had only I think

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.260 
this by this time we had only I think
I'm<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.740> was<00:02:31.890> still<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.190> really<00:02:32.610> low<00:02:32.790> carbs

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
I'm I was still on really low carbs

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.730 
I'm I was still on really low carbs
because<00:02:33.450> he<00:02:33.570> waited<00:02:33.930> until<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.320> end<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
because he waited until the end of the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.140 
because he waited until the end of the
week<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:38.040> start<00:02:38.250> carb<00:02:38.490> loading<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:38.970> at<00:02:39.060> this

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
week to to start carb loading so at this

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.330 
week to to start carb loading so at this
point<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.720> was<00:02:39.900> still<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.410> really

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
point I think I was still on really

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.740 
point I think I was still on really
really<00:02:41.550> low<00:02:41.730> carbs<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.630> pretty

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
really low carbs so I was pretty

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.000 
really low carbs so I was pretty
depleted<00:02:43.400> but<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.760> here<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.090> my<00:02:45.480> opinion<00:02:46.010> going

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
depleted but so here is my opinion going

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.810 
depleted but so here is my opinion going
forward

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
forward

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.400 
forward
into<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> offseason<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:51.780> my<00:02:52.019> number

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
into the offseason is I think my number

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.610 
into the offseason is I think my number
one<00:02:52.680> area<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.640> I'm<00:02:54.300> really<00:02:54.660> gonna<00:02:54.900> focus<00:02:55.200> on

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
one area that I'm really gonna focus on

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.090 
one area that I'm really gonna focus on
is<00:02:56.959> hamstrings<00:02:58.610> that's<00:02:59.610> one<00:02:59.850> area<00:03:00.090> for<00:03:00.600> me

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
is hamstrings that's one area for me

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.530 
is hamstrings that's one area for me
that<00:03:02.100> actually<00:03:02.310> really<00:03:02.760> spent<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.120> lot<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.300> time

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
that actually really spent a lot of time

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.610 
that actually really spent a lot of time
focusing<00:03:04.050> on<00:03:04.200> last<00:03:05.130> offseason<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.080> me<00:03:07.290> I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
focusing on last offseason but to me I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.590 
focusing on last offseason but to me I
still<00:03:07.950> feel<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:09.030> an<00:03:09.209> area<00:03:09.480> that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
still feel like it's it's an area that

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.949 
still feel like it's it's an area that
needs<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:10.200> improve<00:03:10.940> especially<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.510> my<00:03:12.690> back

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
needs to improve especially in my back

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.520 
needs to improve especially in my back
poses<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.830> feel<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.340> my<00:03:14.459> legs<00:03:15.320> really<00:03:16.320> need

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
poses I feel like my legs really need

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.069 
poses I feel like my legs really need
more<00:03:16.800> just<00:03:17.100> thicker<00:03:17.640> they<00:03:18.090> look<00:03:18.510> thicker<00:03:18.750> from

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
more just thicker they look thicker from

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.960 
more just thicker they look thicker from
behind<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.739> think<00:03:19.769> they<00:03:19.980> look<00:03:20.160> pretty<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.790> my

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
behind I think they look pretty like my

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.600 
behind I think they look pretty like my
hamstrings<00:03:21.450> look<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.890> know<00:03:22.980> pretty<00:03:23.190> good<00:03:23.400> in

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
hamstrings look you know pretty good in

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.500 
hamstrings look you know pretty good in
my<00:03:23.760> side<00:03:24.000> shots

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
my side shots

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.530 
my side shots
I<00:03:24.660> think<00:03:24.930> they<00:03:25.019> improve<00:03:25.350> there<00:03:25.709> but<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:27.420> know

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
I think they improve there but you know

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.830 
I think they improve there but you know
being<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.959> taller<00:03:28.230> guy<00:03:28.560> at<00:03:28.799> 6<00:03:29.130> foot<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.840> think

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
being a taller guy at 6 foot I think

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.300 
being a taller guy at 6 foot I think
isn't<00:03:30.989> really<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.410> know<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:31.739> with<00:03:31.890> longer

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
isn't really you know it's with longer

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.069 
isn't really you know it's with longer
legs<00:03:32.519> it's<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.209> kind<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:33.750> one<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.959> those

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
legs it's just kind of it's one of those

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.330 
legs it's just kind of it's one of those
areas<00:03:34.290> where<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.709> think<00:03:34.769> it's<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.160> going<00:03:35.280> to

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
areas where I think it's just going to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.699 
areas where I think it's just going to
take<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:36.630> know<00:03:36.750> could<00:03:37.110> take<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.290> couple<00:03:37.500> years

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
take you know could take a couple years

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.949 
take you know could take a couple years
to<00:03:38.100> really<00:03:38.549> fill<00:03:38.790> out<00:03:38.820> my<00:03:39.120> hamstrings<00:03:39.630> and

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
to really fill out my hamstrings and

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.759 
to really fill out my hamstrings and
make<00:03:40.170> them<00:03:40.320> look<00:03:40.530> more<00:03:40.970> impressive<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.650> who

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
make them look more impressive so who

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.900 
make them look more impressive so who
are<00:03:43.860> your<00:03:43.980> kind<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.250> get<00:03:44.370> into<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.549> back<00:03:44.700> to
