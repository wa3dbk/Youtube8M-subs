 god suffer to laugh and I saw the people that I 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.940
 surrounds and is where all the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.790
 situations that I speak caddy for 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.550
 my life is my life because my party is called 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.500
 Maria Dolores Garcia Cardoso in my mother 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.410
 my brother my sister my son cat and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.300
 I live in my street of Cidentes 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.330
 and little more I did not belong a party 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 politician in life that I think this 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.590
 who tries to play with us the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.080
 games that play between them to lie down 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.360
 the faults I 'm not if I do not now 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.680
 it was my fault it was the one that came 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.940
 to say he was violent to the face of limoges 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 like we are part of a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.620
 radical left if they want to follow 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.390
 someone who follow their own heart 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.920
 it's fine to follow someone for a 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.360
 moment if it is for a matter of 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.960
 learning if you want to learn 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.000
 something 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.770
 in any reason an experience but 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.260
 always your path should be something personal 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.610
 if you follow someone you will never be 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.240
 following you will always be fire of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.490
 another effectively 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.049
 and what to become acculturated, you have to know the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.060
 history you have to know something about politics 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.619
 some economics just so that 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.700
 when you want to spit in the face 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.369
 son of a bitch who is oppressing you 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.750
 know where to look and do not blame them at 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.580
 first local police who put you 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.070
 in front or the first politician in turn 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.470
 that politician in turn has surely been 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.259
 sold military that you do not know but 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.939
 that if you read a little if you would know 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.939
 I certainly do not pursue a 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.470
 revolution type the hem not like me 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.090
 they say you on the street let's burn it 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.200
 We are going to break everything when I 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.909
 I say no 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.740
 the replacement part of here is in your 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.259
 head I wanted you to change your head is going to 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.000
 change all the points no yes or yes and 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.560
 that is the true revolution one hundred thousand 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.569
 people who have changed shape baby 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.819
 there are one hundred thousand people who change one 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.979
 city a country and a world without someone me 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.049
 is asking me to save me that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.560
 I tighten the belt that I 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.940
 Appear with years of scarcity that does not 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.500
 I can be charging three salaries 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.850
 three thousand euros and walking in a 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.410
 porsche cayenne forty thousand euros 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.239
 down the street because to start your 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.530
 word for me stops making sense to the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.120
 quarter hour 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.220
 what difference between the people and the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.210
 police the basic is that the police 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.770
 can be 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.510
 the right of violence she has the 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.610
 monopoly of violence a citizen 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.280
 can not be violent or in word 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.470
 however a politician can lie to you 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.140
 in the campaign you can make laws that 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.870
 they lead but we are going to social exclusion 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.820
 to misery they can be violent with 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.400
 your laws so the police take you out of your 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.260
 house that is pure violence if a man 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.970
 it cuts off the light and leaves a family with 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.160
 three children without water for the receipts is 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.780
 violence if I later learn that you are 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.440
 forgive thousands of euros to others 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.080
 entities 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.570
 that is violent for me you are 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.090
 creating scarcity here is impoverishing 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.920
 my level of life before I said that there 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.930
 many levels of violence, of course 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.610
 the stone is the last then me from 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.810
 then that's where not from here all 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.700
 physical violence 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.020
 but I understand the father that when his 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.610
 children have to eat when 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.800
 sleeping in the street hits a glove 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.360
 hit a kick breaks a bench towards what 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.739
 that it is I understand it not the one with new 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.300
 I condemn more I would worry about 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.400
 ask him that he is taking you to 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.950
 do that but these politicians seem 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.170
 that in that they are not interested I am 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.239
 interested in condemning to want us not in 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.489
 ask yourself why you saw the accounts and 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.739
 not to forgive you and do all the 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.330
 emphasizes the punishment reinserting to 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.090
 in giving you the conditions so that you never 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.620
 the more I see you in that situation there's a lot 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.030
 very prepared people who are standing and 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.980
 that should help the collective 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.630
 standing immediately there are four 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.519
 humble and simple people we have to 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.410
 fellow Pedro who is not only in the 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.390
 collective of unemployed day after day after 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.370
 day fighting for the rights of those 18 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.019
 thousand but it is in the association of 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.880
 neighbors of the poppus but that is 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.580
 picking up school supplies for the 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.310
 boys and that's just one person that 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.769
 would make 18,000 Cadiz unemployed with two 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.239
 cojones so gaditanos get up to 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.510
 wade to get into your house and take 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.900
 or by the cojones eggs 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.900
 do not
