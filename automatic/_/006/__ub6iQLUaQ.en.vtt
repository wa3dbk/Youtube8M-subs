the<00:00:56.809> reason<00:00:57.140> why<00:00:57.230> I'm<00:00:57.290> making<00:00:57.380> this<00:00:57.530> video<00:00:57.770> is

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
the reason why I'm making this video is

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.119 
the reason why I'm making this video is
I<00:00:58.280> had<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.880> really<00:00:59.239> important<00:01:00.110> question<00:01:00.320> from

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129

I had a really important question from
one<00:01:01.309> of<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.489> optimal<00:01:01.850> tribes<00:01:02.089> member<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:02.660> the

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
one of the optimal tribes member and the

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.780 
one of the optimal tribes member and the
question<00:01:03.170> was<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.530> mere<00:01:03.830> you<00:01:04.070> think<00:01:04.370> juicing<00:01:04.699> is

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
question was a mere you think juicing is

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.580 
question was a mere you think juicing is
healthy<00:01:05.150> as<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.360> real<00:01:05.660> legitimate<00:01:06.020> question

take a ride with me and let me show you

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.110 
take a ride with me and let me show you
first<00:01:12.890> how<00:01:13.070> your<00:01:13.250> body<00:01:13.460> actually<00:01:13.730> the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
first how your body actually the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.750 
first how your body actually the
siblings<00:01:14.480> and<00:01:14.720> digest<00:01:15.080> food<00:01:15.320> okay<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:16.070> all

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
siblings and digest food okay it all

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.880 
siblings and digest food okay it all
stops<00:01:17.180> with<00:01:17.480> the<00:01:17.510> mount<00:01:17.780> okay<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.680> there's<00:01:18.860> a

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
stops with the mount okay and there's a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.040 
stops with the mount okay and there's a
process<00:01:19.100> called<00:01:19.400> mastication<00:01:20.060> I'm<00:01:20.360> you

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
process called mastication I'm you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.450 
process called mastication I'm you
chewing<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.440> food<00:01:21.650> right<00:01:21.890> mastication

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
chewing the food right mastication

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.610 
chewing the food right mastication
you're<00:01:22.850> breaking<00:01:23.150> down<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.630> food<00:01:23.840> particles

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
you're breaking down the food particles

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.340 
you're breaking down the food particles
into<00:01:25.280> smaller<00:01:25.610> pieces<00:01:25.940> right<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:27.140> first

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
into smaller pieces right and the first

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.899 
into smaller pieces right and the first
thing<00:01:27.440> that<00:01:27.620> happens<00:01:28.040> is<00:01:28.220> because<00:01:28.520> you're

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
thing that happens is because you're

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.270 
thing that happens is because you're
chewing<00:01:29.270> your<00:01:29.510> food<00:01:29.570> your<00:01:30.530> saliva<00:01:30.979> starts

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
chewing your food your saliva starts

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.890 
chewing your food your saliva starts
accumulating<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:32.270> your<00:01:32.360> mouth<00:01:32.540> in<00:01:32.810> this

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
accumulating in your mouth in this

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.610 
accumulating in your mouth in this
accumulation<00:01:33.290> has<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.660> enzyme<00:01:35.660> called<00:01:35.990> analyst

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
accumulation has a enzyme called analyst

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.200 
accumulation has a enzyme called analyst
and<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:36.950> Emily's<00:01:37.400> enzyme<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:37.940> actually

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
and this Emily's enzyme is actually

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.780 
and this Emily's enzyme is actually
responsible<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:39.380> sugar<00:01:39.620> breakdowns<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.400> will

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
responsible for sugar breakdowns it will

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.820 
responsible for sugar breakdowns it will
break<00:01:41.000> down<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.300> sugar<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:42.020> simple<00:01:42.440> sugars

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
break down the sugar to simple sugars

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.580 
break down the sugar to simple sugars
within<00:01:43.580> your<00:01:43.730> mouth<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.360> second<00:01:44.810> enzyme<00:01:45.110> your

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
within your mouth the second enzyme your

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.170 
within your mouth the second enzyme your
mouth<00:01:46.010> has<00:01:46.310> which<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:46.760> actually<00:01:46.880> located

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
mouth has which is actually located

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.390 
mouth has which is actually located
within<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.750> tongue<00:01:48.020> called<00:01:48.530> light<00:01:48.860> beige<00:01:49.160> and

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
within the tongue called light beige and

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.310 
within the tongue called light beige and
white<00:01:49.430> pays<00:01:50.120> is<00:01:50.390> responsible<00:01:51.050> for<00:01:51.200> their

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
white pays is responsible for their

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.710 
white pays is responsible for their
breakdown<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.770> facts<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.000> that's<00:01:53.150> two<00:01:53.510> things

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
breakdown of facts so that's two things

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.100 
breakdown of facts so that's two things
so<00:01:53.900> far<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.440> have<00:01:54.530> two<00:01:54.770> very<00:01:55.130> important

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
so far you have two very important

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.980 
so far you have two very important
jail<00:01:56.440> amylase<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:57.490> lipase<00:01:57.820> right<00:01:58.120> now<00:01:58.930> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
jail amylase and lipase right now the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.290 
jail amylase and lipase right now the
third<00:01:59.320> really<00:02:00.190> important<00:02:00.670> thing<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:00.940> the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
third really important thing is the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.260 
third really important thing is the
actual<00:02:01.660> act<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:02.170> mastication<00:02:02.950> on<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.820> chewing

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
actual act of mastication on the chewing

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.930 
actual act of mastication on the chewing
act<00:02:04.510> actually<00:02:05.110> was<00:02:05.470> sent<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.740> signal<00:02:05.920> few<00:02:06.610> cheap

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
act actually was sent a signal few cheap

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.630 
act actually was sent a signal few cheap
cells<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.450> create<00:02:07.660> more<00:02:08.340> HCl<00:02:09.340> hydrochloric

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
cells to create more HCl hydrochloric

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.600 
cells to create more HCl hydrochloric
acid<00:02:10.630> right<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.320> more<00:02:11.500> increase<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.100> HCl

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
acid right so the more increase of HCl

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.570 
acid right so the more increase of HCl
you<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:13.150> now<00:02:13.960> will<00:02:14.350> digest<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.130> food<00:02:15.310> better

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
you have now will digest and food better

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.910 
you have now will digest and food better
but<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.690> where<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.050> missing<00:02:17.410> pieces<00:02:17.650> of

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
but this is where the missing pieces of

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.040 
but this is where the missing pieces of
people<00:02:18.190> don't<00:02:18.370> understand<00:02:18.820> is<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.300> once<00:02:19.900> or

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
people don't understand is that once or

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.960 
people don't understand is that once or
HCL<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.680> activated<00:02:21.400> its<00:02:21.520> going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.730> send<00:02:21.910> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
HCL is activated its going to send a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.390 
HCL is activated its going to send a
signal<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.660> your<00:02:22.930> pancreas<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.950> start

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
signal to your pancreas to start

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.240 
signal to your pancreas to start
secreting<00:02:24.880> more<00:02:25.330> pancreatic<00:02:26.200> enzymes<00:02:26.709> do<00:02:27.190> you

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
secreting more pancreatic enzymes do you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.610 
secreting more pancreatic enzymes do you
see<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.550> connection<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.240> all<00:02:28.690> starts<00:02:29.380> for<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
see the connection it all starts for the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.400 
see the connection it all starts for the
mouth<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.370> problem<00:02:30.670> with<00:02:31.060> over<00:02:31.870> juicing

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
mouth so the problem with over juicing

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.890 
mouth so the problem with over juicing
right<00:02:32.650> too<00:02:32.950> much<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.190> juicing<00:02:33.820> originally<00:02:34.660> I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
right too much of juicing originally I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.390 
right too much of juicing originally I
didn't<00:02:35.200> see<00:02:35.290> juicing<00:02:35.680> was<00:02:35.830> evil<00:02:36.250> or<00:02:36.370> bad

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
didn't see juicing was evil or bad

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400 
didn't see juicing was evil or bad
there's<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.060> time<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.480> place<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:37.900> such<00:02:38.260> and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
there's a time and place for such and

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.820 
there's a time and place for such and
stuff<00:02:38.590> but<00:02:39.040> when<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.190> see<00:02:39.459> people<00:02:39.510> literally

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830

don't<00:02:51.280> know<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.730> should<00:02:51.880> think<00:02:52.510> twice<00:02:52.570> about

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
don't know you should think twice about

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.199 
don't know you should think twice about
that<00:02:53.320> right<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:54.190> when<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.430> actually<00:02:54.640> juice

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
that right so when you actually juice
