00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
that you blend it into the crease into

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.300 
that you blend it into the crease into
the<00:03:10.010> pink<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.609> blue<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.629> red<00:03:12.250> make<00:03:13.250> purple

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
the pink and blue and red make purple

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.729 
the pink and blue and red make purple
too<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.329> it's<00:03:14.450> going<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.629> turn<00:03:14.959> into<00:03:15.230> a

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
too so it's going to turn into a

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.339 
too so it's going to turn into a
purplish<00:03:16.519> color<00:03:16.549> in<00:03:17.239> your<00:03:17.299> crease<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.199> it's

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
purplish color in your crease so it's

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.050

pretty<00:03:18.500> cool<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:18.859> using<00:03:19.579> these<00:03:19.699> colors

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
pretty cool that using these colors

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.180 
pretty cool that using these colors
together<00:03:20.260> actually<00:03:21.260> gives<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.590> illusion<00:03:21.680> of

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
together actually gives the illusion of

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.259 
together actually gives the illusion of
using<00:03:23.090> several<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.989> shadows<00:03:24.590> together<00:03:25.269> so

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
using several I shadows together so

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.089 
using several I shadows together so
