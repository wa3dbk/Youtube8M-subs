EPA you know our government is putting

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
EPA you know our government is putting
ethanol<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.780> fuel<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.700> unfortunately

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
ethanol in the fuel and unfortunately

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.330 
ethanol in the fuel and unfortunately
ethanol<00:00:36.750> while<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.649> pretty<00:00:37.950> nice<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.219> your

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
ethanol while it's pretty nice in your

ethanol while it's pretty nice in your
glass<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:39.360> too<00:00:39.540> good<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.780> your<00:00:39.899> gas<00:00:40.079> because

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
glass not too good in your gas because

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
glass not too good in your gas because
it's<00:00:41.219> corrosive<00:00:41.510> right<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.110> see

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
it's corrosive right and you can see

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.959 
it's corrosive right and you can see
right<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.680> well<00:00:43.920> here's<00:00:44.280> an<00:00:44.399> example<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.879> a

right here well here's an example of a
carburetor<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.690> 90<00:00:46.440> days<00:00:46.969> only<00:00:47.969> 90<00:00:48.539> days<00:00:48.750> the

assuming<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.629> took<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.020> from<00:00:58.199> my<00:00:58.379> partner

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680

assuming you took this from my partner
in<00:00:58.800> crime<00:00:58.829> brian<00:00:59.280> loans<00:00:59.579> but<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
in crime brian loans but this is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
in crime brian loans but this is
unbelievable<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.420> amount<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.809> corrosion

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
unbelievable the amount of corrosion

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.950 
unbelievable the amount of corrosion
that<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.739> see<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.510> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
that you see on this and and is this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.870 
that you see on this and and is this
worse<00:01:07.229> than<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> car<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:08.250> sits<00:01:08.580> like

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
worse than a car that sits like

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
worse than a car that sits like
everybody's<00:01:09.450> hot<00:01:09.600> rods<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.290> don't<00:01:10.590> get

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
everybody's hot rods that don't get

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
everybody's hot rods that don't get
driven<00:01:10.920> every<00:01:11.189> day<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> problem

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
driven every day or that is the problem

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.630 
driven every day or that is the problem
this<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.290> from<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.549> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
this is what it's from because when you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.929 
this is what it's from because when you
have<00:01:14.670> hot<00:01:15.270> rods<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.810> sit<00:01:16.080> around<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:17.759> have

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
have hot rods that sit around you have

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570 
have hot rods that sit around you have
time<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> ability<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
time and you have the ability for the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
time and you have the ability for the
fuel<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.119> draw<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.450> moisture<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:22.470> reason

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
fuel to draw in moisture right reason

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.800 
fuel to draw in moisture right reason
why<00:01:23.369> guys<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:23.880> having<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.360> scotch<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
why guys like having a scotch on the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.580 
why guys like having a scotch on the
rocks<00:01:24.900> yeah<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.820> alcohol<00:01:27.590> right

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
rocks yeah is because the alcohol right

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.840 
rocks yeah is because the alcohol right
the<00:01:28.740> ethanol<00:01:29.100> yeah<00:01:29.460> absorbs<00:01:30.450> moisture<00:01:31.850> that

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the ethanol yeah absorbs moisture that

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.870 
the ethanol yeah absorbs moisture that
corrosive<00:01:33.750> cocktail<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.670> moisture<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
corrosive cocktail of moisture and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.530 
corrosive cocktail of moisture and
ethanol<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.350> causes<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> guy

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
ethanol is what causes this so if a guy

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.690 
ethanol is what causes this so if a guy
drove<00:01:39.869> his<00:01:40.049> hot<00:01:40.259> rod<00:01:40.290> everyday<00:01:40.920> he<00:01:41.430> wouldn't

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
drove his hot rod everyday he wouldn't

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.609 
drove his hot rod everyday he wouldn't
have<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.970> worry<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.560> as

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
have to worry about this as much but as

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
have to worry about this as much but as
much<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.820> still<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.689> there

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
much but it's still going to be there

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.429 
much but it's still going to be there
because<00:01:46.259> even<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.189> ethanol<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.909> so

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
because even you know ethanol is so

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.920 
because even you know ethanol is so
corrosive<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.829> hydro<00:01:50.250> scopic<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
corrosive and hydro scopic that the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.350 
corrosive and hydro scopic that the
pipeline<00:01:52.350> companies<00:01:52.860> don't<00:01:53.399> even<00:01:53.700> let<00:01:53.909> them

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
pipeline companies don't even let them

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.530 
pipeline companies don't even let them
put<00:01:54.630> ethanol<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> pipeline<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.880> you're<00:01:57.090> 87

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
put ethanol in the pipeline so you're 87

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600 
put ethanol in the pipeline so you're 87
octane<00:01:57.840> gasoline<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> gas<00:01:59.189> station

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
octane gasoline you get the gas station

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.240 
octane gasoline you get the gas station
you<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.479> yeah<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:00.990> actually<00:02:01.290> 83<00:02:01.860> octane

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you know yeah it's actually 83 octane

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.030 
you know yeah it's actually 83 octane
pump<00:02:03.149> fuel<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.780> no<00:02:03.899> ethanol<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
pump fuel with no ethanol it going to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.459 
pump fuel with no ethanol it going to
the<00:02:05.100> pipeline<00:02:05.570> until<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> gets<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.110> where<00:02:07.290> they

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the pipeline until it gets to where they

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.589 
the pipeline until it gets to where they
mix<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.950> right<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.700> truck<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.360> truck

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
mix it right in the truck in the truck

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.190 
mix it right in the truck in the truck
then<00:02:10.289> they<00:02:10.440> add<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.920> ethanol<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.150> truck

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
then they add the ethanol in the truck

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.770 
then they add the ethanol in the truck
and<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.739> makes<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.010> from<00:02:14.220> 83<00:02:14.430> octane<00:02:14.940> up<00:02:15.540> to

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
and that makes it from 83 octane up to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.589 
and that makes it from 83 octane up to
87<00:02:16.080> octane<00:02:16.370> because<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.790> fuel<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.420> so

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
87 octane because the fuel is so

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.110 
87 octane because the fuel is so
corrosive<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:20.040> hydroscopic<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:21.000> was

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
corrosive and so hydroscopic it was

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.820 
corrosive and so hydroscopic it was
sucking<00:02:21.450> moisture<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:22.080> corrode<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
sucking moisture and corrode the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.589 
sucking moisture and corrode the
pipeline<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:24.030> don't<00:02:24.180> really<00:02:24.269> want<00:02:24.540> that

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
pipeline and we don't really want that

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.930 
pipeline and we don't really want that
happening<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.440> nobody's<00:02:25.800> telling<00:02:26.069> us<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.640> I

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
have to be careful with that kind of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.930 
have to be careful with that kind of
thing<00:02:30.239> with<00:02:30.450> our<00:02:30.630> vehicles<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:32.370> guys<00:02:32.580> have

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
stepped up though and have the carb

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.530 
stepped up though and have the carb

thing is you don't have this in a fuel
injection<00:03:11.970> system<00:03:12.329> right<00:03:13.019> that's<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.980> thing

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
injection system right that's the thing

these issues because it's materially
different<00:03:24.420> when<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.530> old<00:03:25.769> carburetors

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
different when you have old carburetors

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.250 
different when you have old carburetors
that<00:03:26.519> had<00:03:26.670> these<00:03:27.030> components<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.079> just

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
that had these components you just

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.860 
that had these components you just
described<00:03:28.590> all<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.400> those<00:03:29.790> are<00:03:30.120> at<00:03:30.329> risk<00:03:30.630> to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
described all of those are at risk to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.030 
described all of those are at risk to
corrosion<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.920> ethanol<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.829> here's<00:03:34.829> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
corrosion to ethanol so here's the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.640

whatever yep but you also have the race
version<00:03:43.850> clearly<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.000> one<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.180> should<00:03:45.359> have

what's<00:03:46.950> different<00:03:47.370> about<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.730> one<00:03:47.790> higher

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
what's different about this one higher

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.259 
what's different about this one higher
level<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.290> concentration<00:03:49.709> where<00:03:50.670> this<00:03:50.910> works

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
level of concentration where this works

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.870 
level of concentration where this works
great<00:03:51.389> for<00:03:51.660> say<00:03:52.049> EA<00:03:52.260> 5<00:03:52.620> all<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.069> way<00:03:53.250> down<00:03:53.549> to

great for say EA 5 all the way down to

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.539 
great for say EA 5 all the way down to
the<00:03:54.299> e10<00:03:54.930> pump<00:03:55.200> gas<00:03:55.380> right<00:03:55.680> okay<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.370> riggers

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
the e10 pump gas right okay the riggers

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.000 
the e10 pump gas right okay the riggers
have<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.819> get<00:03:56.970> right<00:03:57.359> this<00:03:58.260> will<00:03:58.500> actually<00:03:58.650> run

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
have to get right this will actually run

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.509 
have to get right this will actually run
with<00:03:59.459> straight<00:03:59.849> methanol<00:04:00.599> as<00:04:00.870> well<00:04:01.230> as<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:02.040> 85

going to change my octane rating or
screw<00:04:26.289> that<00:04:26.440> up<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:27.220> how<00:04:27.430> does<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:27.850> actually

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
screw that up so how does this actually

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.450 
screw that up so how does this actually
work<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:28.810> changing<00:04:29.110> my<00:04:29.470> fuel<00:04:29.740> now<00:04:30.220> that's

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
work is it changing my fuel now that's

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.430 
work is it changing my fuel now that's

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
to alter the fuel somehow another you

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.939 
to alter the fuel somehow another you
know<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:40.240> know<00:04:40.330> stabilizing<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.229> fuel<00:04:41.530> or

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
know you know stabilizing the fuel or

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.950 
know you know stabilizing the fuel or
you<00:04:42.520> know<00:04:42.610> separating<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.479> moisture<00:04:43.840> from

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
you know separating the moisture from

you know separating the moisture from
the<00:04:44.020> fuel<00:04:44.289> well<00:04:44.919> all<00:04:45.130> of<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:45.400> does<00:04:45.669> is<00:04:46.030> change

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
the fuel well all of that does is change

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.830 
the fuel well all of that does is change
things<00:04:46.750> like<00:04:46.930> vapor<00:04:47.350> pressure<00:04:47.620> octane<00:04:48.280> this

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
things like vapor pressure octane this

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.159 
things like vapor pressure octane this
this<00:04:49.860> or<00:04:50.860> this<00:04:51.090> doesn't<00:04:52.090> matter<00:04:52.240> all<00:04:52.960> it's

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
this or this doesn't matter all it's

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.640 
this or this doesn't matter all it's
doing<00:04:53.350> is<00:04:53.530> using<00:04:53.889> the<00:04:54.130> fuel<00:04:54.430> as<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:54.789> carrier

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
doing is using the fuel as a carrier

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.339 
doing is using the fuel as a carrier
right<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.889> fuel<00:04:57.160> carries<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:58.240> additive<00:04:58.750> to

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
right the fuel carries the additive to

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.860 
right the fuel carries the additive to
that<00:04:59.530> surface<00:04:59.860> that<00:05:00.550> creates<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:00.970> microscopic

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
that surface that creates a microscopic

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
fuel that way your carburetor tuning

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.379

your jet sizes timing all of that never

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.589 
your jet sizes timing all of that never
changes<00:05:10.930> so<00:05:11.500> this<00:05:11.680> is<00:05:11.860> not<00:05:12.039> going<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.599> increase
