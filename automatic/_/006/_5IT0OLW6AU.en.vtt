00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.170
 she was documentary 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.030
 documentary word about trolls 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 but I 'm not half scientific hardcore 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.190
 cars entered the memory pages 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 So you know, that guy who died 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.320
 he began to control strong so type 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 It's like I do not know the kid is a program in the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.710
 An entire documentary does not really 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.960
 trying to see any source because the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.269
 that motivated the guys do that tone and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.540
 in the program they can reach 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.820
 Sucrose some sections or other well 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.940
 Do you want to know the guys all about blueberries? 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.770
 bag oscar all coxinha fucking but 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.690
 went after others to know how they were 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.510
 your people have reached two 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 you wonder loser guy is a spindle 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.600
 So, what the fuck you say, man? 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.690
 this guy 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
 Just because this is so fucking expensive because 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.550
 I think the joke is that the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.890
 jokes, but there are people who 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.619
 Fuck these, I think one of the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.479
 more terrible things can happen 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.490
 problem and I felt this seriously was 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.700
 period of training he has the image 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.189
 he knows he does not have all the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 devices and mechanisms to 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.270
 to defend does not even know 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.770
 it's cool because 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.600
 generalizing but most of the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.310
 adolescents confessed that they still have a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.500
 a lot of total insecurity 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.409
 usually it happens to them and it and 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.780
 doing network analysis also networks 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.340
 social networks and be part of my 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.229
 work was monitored in the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.479
 launches and wants to pass in the middle of the street 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.250
 Okay, I was monitored if it sends 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.770
 youth and adolescence 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.040
 entering virtual networks is huge 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.140
 flees a little expensive is that the larger 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.500
 sensors for who should actually be 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.229
 attentive and annual censorship facebook is not 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.540
 youtube is not orkut it's not any of that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.579
 biggest sensors are the parents is incredible the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.850
 how much they are lacking in this regard 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.850
 it has been 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.670
 and I'm generalizing 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.380
 I know it has a legal parent who pays 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.929
 attention to what the child is seeing 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.670
 puts the program to track what 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.760
 occurs is common among 8 humans only 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.400
 I'm talking in general so the type 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.290
 kids on the internet no one for every 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.090
 one that the command of the farm 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.480
 eventually it is not that it is being 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.959
 victim knows of some type of harassment or 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.290
 of bullying but eventually he is 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:37.730
 causing knife and here as there is no 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:42.230
 no parameters nothing nothing at all 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.630
 can stop this teenager and free hand 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.640
 a single and he can can get a 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.860
 image x to the internet make an assembly 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.450
 any know 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.310
 and this image may be linked 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.870
 to the wake of another child 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.660
 This has happened to you with 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.700
 frequency if you do not know that 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.090
 This is going to speak teen motherfucker. 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.920
 no omitted parent is real in that schema 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.840
 then son in the world have to see what 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.290
 he is doing it may be 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.590
 victim or victimizing other children 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.750
 It's serious because usually when you 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.400
 thinks a child or thinks a relative 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.829
 close to a child you think 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.359
 she may be the victim of anything but 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.310
 You never think she could be the one. 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.420
 author 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.579
 usually in these cases are of the type 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.090
 many authors against a victim 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.950
 Did you know this is serious? 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.590
 man starts talking shit at school 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.450
 blackcurrant of a serious subject enters there 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.220
 another comes and another came today when 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.840
 will see has 20 people filling the bag 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.880
 I'm posting, I'm talking 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.280
 specifically for adolescents and 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.810
 adults know how to defend it but they 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.850
 Why are you saying this because? 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.579
 often people think the exchange one 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:54.739
 little cool for a little bit cool 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.200
 Yes, when we take a friend, it's not 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.750
 cool when school friend when 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.010
 people exchange who we know there 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.750
 Just kidding 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.379
 now when you do not know a person 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.750
 and troller to play troll you actually 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.239
 it's not just offending offending the person 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.790
 Seriously, my friend, let's see. 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.599
 Your great son of a bitch has no 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.790
 problem 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.280

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.419

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.720
 Big son of a bitch is going to take a son. 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.400
 the bitch in the middle of the face understood as a 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.070
 motherfucker on the tail 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.419
