00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
started um you can see the base right

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.919 
started um you can see the base right
there<00:00:29.429> over<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> left<00:00:30.359> that's<00:00:30.570> our<00:00:30.689> base

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
there over on the left that's our base

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.470 
there over on the left that's our base
me<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.920> wee<00:00:32.309> captain<00:00:32.700> shell<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> yak<00:00:33.360> attack

me a wee captain shell and yak attack
all<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.960> multiplayer<00:00:34.410> server<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> guess

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
all this multiplayer server and I guess

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
all this multiplayer server and I guess
we'll<00:00:36.239> show<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.390> off<00:00:36.540> right<00:00:36.690> now<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:37.200> walk<00:00:37.710> on

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
we'll show it off right now just walk on

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.910 
we'll show it off right now just walk on
down<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:40.230> first<00:00:40.440> thing<00:00:40.590> most<00:00:40.800> people

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
down there the first thing most people

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.610 
down there the first thing most people
notice<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.059> cactuses<00:00:42.930> around<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> base

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
notice is that cactuses around the base

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.400 
notice is that cactuses around the base
and<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.030> more<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.870> you'll

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and this is more of a thing you'll

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
and this is more of a thing you'll
realize<00:00:47.129> when<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.520> into<00:00:47.640> Minecraft<00:00:48.120> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
realize when you get into Minecraft is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.049 
realize when you get into Minecraft is
that<00:00:48.870> these<00:00:49.410> protect<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.280> creepers<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that these protect you from creepers and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.450 
that these protect you from creepers and
animals<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.739> sort<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.039> stuff<00:00:53.100> so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
animals and all that sort of stuff so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.340 
animals and all that sort of stuff so
they'll<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.239> run<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> cactus<00:00:55.079> they'll

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
they'll just run into the cactus they'll

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
they'll just run into the cactus they'll
take<00:00:55.590> damage<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:57.059> prevent<00:00:57.570> them

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
take damage and that will prevent them

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.799 
take damage and that will prevent them
from<00:00:58.609> getting<00:00:59.609> close<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.270> base<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
from getting close to your base and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.439 
from getting close to your base and
perhaps<00:01:01.039> popping<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.370> whole<00:01:02.609> cave<00:01:03.059> or

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
perhaps popping out whole cave or

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.750 
perhaps popping out whole cave or
something<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.890> Alex

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
something like that as you can see Alex

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.969 
something like that as you can see Alex
have<00:01:05.880> taken<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.360> damage<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.170> Oh<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
have taken some damage over there Oh a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.719 
have taken some damage over there Oh a
lot<00:01:08.189> shouldn't<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.270> at<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> home<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
lot shouldn't right at the home so is

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
lot shouldn't right at the home so is
there<00:01:11.909> any<00:01:12.090> cacti<00:01:12.570> near<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.110> current

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
there any cacti near your current

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.920 
there any cacti near your current
location<00:01:14.030> follow<00:01:15.030> lead<00:01:15.360> captain<00:01:15.720> shells

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
location follow lead captain shells

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.630 
location follow lead captain shells
advice<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.439> don't<00:01:16.530> repeatedly<00:01:17.070> run<00:01:17.369> into

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
advice and don't repeatedly run into

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.630 
advice and don't repeatedly run into
them<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:18.150> probably<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.540> good<00:01:18.600> idea<00:01:19.640> over

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
them that's probably a good idea over

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.539 
them that's probably a good idea over
here<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.320> one<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> earlier<00:01:23.040> additions<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
here is one of the earlier additions to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.230 
here is one of the earlier additions to
the<00:01:23.700> base<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> pier<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.900> personally<00:01:25.229> made

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
the base it's a pier I personally made

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
the base it's a pier I personally made
it's<00:01:27.240> basically<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.110> boating<00:01:28.380> or

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
it's basically just for boating or

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.450 
it's basically just for boating or
fishing<00:01:29.869> stuff<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.159> I'll<00:01:32.159> show<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
fishing stuff like that I'll show a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.940 
fishing stuff like that I'll show a
little<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.930> later<00:01:34.320> video<00:01:34.530> but

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
little more of it in a later video but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.580 
little more of it in a later video but
there's<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:35.970> much<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.590> yeah

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
there's really not much to it yeah

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.080 
there's really not much to it yeah
science<00:01:37.950> has<00:01:38.130> no<00:01:38.159> fishing<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:38.850> pretty

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
science has no fishing that's pretty

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.749 
science has no fishing that's pretty
much<00:01:39.180> alive<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.979> guess<00:01:40.979> we'll<00:01:41.159> explore<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
much alive I guess we'll explore the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.819 
much alive I guess we'll explore the
main<00:01:42.060> base<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.960> we've<00:01:43.140> seen<00:01:43.350> most<00:01:43.740> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
main base now that we've seen most of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.050 
main base now that we've seen most of
the<00:01:43.920> outside<00:01:45.649> this<00:01:46.649> door<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> doors

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the outside this door I like the doors

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.550 
the outside this door I like the doors
in<00:01:48.119> Minecraft<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.780> reminds<00:01:49.110> me<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.439> bit

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
in Minecraft it reminds me a little bit

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.929 
in Minecraft it reminds me a little bit
of<00:01:49.710> door<00:01:49.890> systems<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.610> garys<00:01:51.390> mod<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:52.350> of

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
of door systems and garys mod because of

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.520 
of door systems and garys mod because of
the<00:01:53.939> sort<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.240> complexity<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.110> use<00:01:55.320> if

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the sort of complexity you can use if

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
the sort of complexity you can use if
you<00:01:55.649> want<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.610> simplicity<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you want to and the simplicity if you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.740 
you want to and the simplicity if you
don't<00:01:57.619> there's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
don't there's

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.270 
don't there's
button<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.140> this<00:01:59.290> side<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.560> can<00:01:59.740> press<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.250> and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
button on this side I can press it and

attached to our fort I was pretty

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.920 
attached to our fort I was pretty
surprised<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.030> say<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.180> least<00:03:01.300> but<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.810> know

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
surprised to say the least but you know

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.590

you<00:03:02.530> really<00:03:02.709> need<00:03:02.830> food<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.489> especially<00:03:04.420> if

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
you really need food and especially if

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.870 
you really need food and especially if
we<00:03:04.660> go<00:03:04.810> exploring<00:03:05.470> or<00:03:05.650> mining<00:03:05.980> or<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.790> know

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
we go exploring or mining or you know

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.130 
we go exploring or mining or you know
get<00:03:07.090> into<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:07.269> fight<00:03:07.510> or<00:03:07.690> something<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:08.080> that

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
get into a fight or something like that

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.680 
get into a fight or something like that
and<00:03:08.670> grain<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.880> be<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.000> great<00:03:10.209> source<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.570> that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
and grain can be a great source of that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.289 
and grain can be a great source of that
all<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.049> need<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.320> three<00:03:11.590> grain<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:12.220> make<00:03:13.090> one

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
all you need is three grain to make one

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.100 
all you need is three grain to make one
piece<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.660> bread<00:03:13.870> as<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.739> can<00:03:14.860> see<00:03:15.010> we<00:03:15.160> have

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
piece of bread as you can see we have

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.870 
piece of bread as you can see we have
probably<00:03:17.110> about<00:03:17.200> 20<00:03:17.650> times<00:03:17.860> three<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.580> grain

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
probably about 20 times three in grain

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.460 
probably about 20 times three in grain
so<00:03:19.030> we<00:03:19.150> have<00:03:19.269> 20<00:03:19.570> piece<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.840> bread<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.049> sit<00:03:20.380> in

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
so we have 20 piece of bread to sit in

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.340 
so we have 20 piece of bread to sit in
here<00:03:20.650> ready<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.010> be<00:03:21.190> created<00:03:21.610> at<00:03:21.730> any<00:03:21.850> time

here ready to be created at any time
let's<00:03:23.350> take<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.530> look<00:03:23.769> at<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.980> second<00:03:24.670> floor

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
let's take a look at the second floor

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.350 
let's take a look at the second floor
this<00:03:25.989> is<00:03:26.200> our<00:03:26.440> preliminary<00:03:27.340> expansion<00:03:28.180> that's

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
this is our preliminary expansion that's

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.150 
this is our preliminary expansion that's
to<00:03:28.510> say<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.140> first<00:03:29.470> expansion<00:03:29.860> we

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
to say this is the first expansion we

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.400 
to say this is the first expansion we
ever<00:03:30.280> made<00:03:30.489> beyond<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.239> basic<00:03:31.630> hut<00:03:31.900> in<00:03:32.110> which

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
ever made beyond the basic hut in which

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.650 
ever made beyond the basic hut in which
we<00:03:32.590> survive<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.130> first<00:03:33.310> night<00:03:33.489> you<00:03:33.910> can<00:03:34.600> see

expanded<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.139> farm<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.980> bigger<00:04:25.580> location

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260

it's<00:04:35.720> pretty<00:04:35.870> good<00:04:36.110> view<00:04:36.320> it's<00:04:36.950> not<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.220> best

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
it's pretty good view it's not the best

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.030 
it's pretty good view it's not the best
I've<00:04:37.610> seen<00:04:37.669> in<00:04:37.850> pinecraft<00:04:38.360> obviously<00:04:39.020> but<00:04:39.230> you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
I've seen in pinecraft obviously but you

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.080 
I've seen in pinecraft obviously but you
know<00:04:40.100> it's<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.280> decent<00:04:40.610> view<00:04:40.760> from<00:04:40.970> this

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
know it's a decent view from this

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.720 
know it's a decent view from this
rooftop<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.830> know<00:04:42.950> all<00:04:43.220> that's<00:04:43.340> going<00:04:43.640> on

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
rooftop of you know all that's going on

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.680

in<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.030> outside<00:04:44.390> world<00:04:46.390> probably<00:04:47.390> descend

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
in the outside world probably descend

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:56.629 
in the outside world probably descend
now<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.140> look<00:04:48.560> at<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.770> rest<00:04:49.010> of<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.220> base

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.969 

over<00:04:57.300> my<00:04:57.419> left<00:04:57.659> are<00:04:57.960> various<00:04:58.319> mines<00:04:58.650> and

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
over my left are various mines and

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.100 
over my left are various mines and
tunnels<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.789> go<00:04:59.849> to<00:05:00.030> different<00:05:00.270> bases<00:05:00.840> and

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
tunnels that go to different bases and

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.869 
tunnels that go to different bases and
different<00:05:01.499> areas<00:05:02.159> from<00:05:02.550> which<00:05:02.610> we've

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
different areas from which we've

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.739 
different areas from which we've
extracted<00:05:03.270> or<00:05:03.749> and<00:05:03.990> other<00:05:04.110> resources<00:05:04.729> I<00:05:05.749> won't

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:06.749 
extracted or and other resources I won't

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:08.929 
extracted or and other resources I won't
really<00:05:06.990> show<00:05:07.229> you<00:05:07.289> them<00:05:07.560> they're<00:05:08.009> kind<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.789> I

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:08.939 
really show you them they're kind of I

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.219 
really show you them they're kind of I
think<00:05:09.180> that's<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.419> most<00:05:09.539> boring<00:05:09.960> part<00:05:10.139> of

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
think that's the most boring part of

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.570 
think that's the most boring part of
Minecraft<00:05:10.620> actually<00:05:10.949> the<00:05:11.039> actual<00:05:11.370> mining

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
Minecraft actually the actual mining

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.640 
Minecraft actually the actual mining
it's<00:05:12.210> just<00:05:12.389> getting<00:05:12.569> resources<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.349> build<00:05:13.469> the

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
it's just getting resources to build the

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.610 
it's just getting resources to build the
really<00:05:13.889> cool<00:05:14.039> stuff<00:05:15.199> over<00:05:16.199> here<00:05:16.229> shells

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
really cool stuff over here shells

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.290 
really cool stuff over here shells
looking<00:05:16.949> at<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.129> food<00:05:17.370> pantry<00:05:17.610> as<00:05:18.090> he

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
looking at the food pantry as he

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.050 
looking at the food pantry as he
mentioned<00:05:18.509> before<00:05:19.009> there<00:05:20.009> is<00:05:20.039> a<00:05:20.249> great<00:05:20.759> deal

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
mentioned before there is a great deal

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.719 
mentioned before there is a great deal
of<00:05:21.090> bread<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:21.659> they're<00:05:22.430> probably<00:05:23.430> not<00:05:23.580> the

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
of bread and they're probably not the

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.519 
of bread and they're probably not the
most<00:05:23.969> you've<00:05:24.240> ever<00:05:24.300> seen<00:05:24.599> but<00:05:24.870> still<00:05:25.139> quite

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:25.529 
most you've ever seen but still quite

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.850 
most you've ever seen but still quite
long<00:05:25.939> and<00:05:26.939> even<00:05:27.300> more<00:05:27.509> in<00:05:27.599> here<00:05:27.719> I<00:05:27.990> think

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
long and even more in here I think

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.640 
long and even more in here I think
there's<00:05:29.009> like<00:05:29.069> a<00:05:29.430> bunch<00:05:30.180> of<00:05:30.360> extra<00:05:30.810> storage

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
there's like a bunch of extra storage

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.700 
there's like a bunch of extra storage
for<00:05:31.919> that<00:05:32.039> stuff<00:05:32.340> because<00:05:32.599> we<00:05:33.599> made<00:05:34.439> way<00:05:34.680> too

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
for that stuff because we made way too

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.550 
for that stuff because we made way too
much<00:05:34.860> ground<00:05:35.250> if<00:05:36.000> you<00:05:36.120> look<00:05:36.270> in<00:05:36.419> here<00:05:36.689> this<00:05:37.349> is

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
much ground if you look in here this is

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.119 
much ground if you look in here this is
the<00:05:37.889> Red<00:05:38.129> Wing<00:05:38.430> one<00:05:39.090> of<00:05:39.210> our<00:05:39.590> second<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:41.009> know

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
the Red Wing one of our second you know

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.700 
the Red Wing one of our second you know
expansions<00:05:41.960> show<00:05:42.960> we'll<00:05:43.080> talk<00:05:43.259> a<00:05:43.289> little<00:05:43.469> bit

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
expansions show we'll talk a little bit

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.309 
expansions show we'll talk a little bit
more<00:05:43.860> about<00:05:44.129> that<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:45.840> red<00:05:46.020> one<00:05:46.199> was

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
more about that the red one was

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.869 
more about that the red one was
something<00:05:46.680> we<00:05:46.800> created<00:05:47.189> because<00:05:47.370> we<00:05:47.639> need<00:05:47.759> a

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879
