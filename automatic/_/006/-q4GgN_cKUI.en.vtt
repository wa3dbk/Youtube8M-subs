00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
really revolutionized the mini ITX

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.419 
really revolutionized the mini ITX
compact<00:01:20.840> in<00:01:20.929> the<00:01:21.020> same<00:01:21.259> way<00:01:21.469> the<00:01:21.679> BitFenix<00:01:21.920> did

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
compact in the same way the BitFenix did

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.749 
compact in the same way the BitFenix did
with<00:01:22.609> prodigy<00:01:23.179> so<00:01:24.109> not<00:01:24.590> only<00:01:24.619> did<00:01:25.039> we<00:01:25.249> have<00:01:25.280> a

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
with prodigy so not only did we have a

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.539 
with prodigy so not only did we have a
mini<00:01:26.539> ITX<00:01:26.869> case<00:01:27.079> that<00:01:27.439> we<00:01:27.530> could<00:01:27.829> hold<00:01:28.310> an

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
mini ITX case that we could hold an

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.060 
mini ITX case that we could hold an
aesthetic<00:01:29.030> system<00:01:29.390> in<00:01:29.539> but<00:01:30.170> then<00:01:30.320> we<00:01:30.439> also<00:01:30.619> had

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
aesthetic system in but then we also had

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.270 
aesthetic system in but then we also had
a<00:01:31.369> one<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:32.509> could<00:01:33.079> add<00:01:33.320> stuff<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.799> that<00:01:34.249> I

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
a one that I could add stuff to that I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.520 
a one that I could add stuff to that I
wouldn't<00:01:34.579> be<00:01:34.640> able<00:01:34.759> to<00:01:35.060> in<00:01:35.179> another<00:01:35.450> mini<00:01:36.109> ITX

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
wouldn't be able to in another mini ITX

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.270 
wouldn't be able to in another mini ITX
case<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.990> for<00:01:39.170> example<00:01:39.259> why<00:01:39.799> which<00:01:40.009> was

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
case and so for example why which was

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.590 
case and so for example why which was
project<00:01:40.729> project<00:01:41.630> prodigy<00:01:42.350> as<00:01:42.590> as<00:01:43.119> as<00:01:44.119> the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
project project prodigy as as as the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.809 
project project prodigy as as as the
project<00:01:44.960> prodigy<00:01:45.350> well<00:01:45.979> obviously<00:01:46.579> it's

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
project prodigy well obviously it's

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.300 
project prodigy well obviously it's
based<00:01:46.999> around<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.299> prodigy<00:01:47.749> and<00:01:48.310> obviously

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
based around the prodigy and obviously

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.300 
based around the prodigy and obviously
they<00:01:49.490> have<00:01:49.700> their<00:01:50.210> other<00:01:50.390> cases<00:01:50.719> out<00:01:51.310> out

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
they have their other cases out out

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.209 
they have their other cases out out
there<00:01:52.639> and<00:01:52.939> now<00:01:53.420> which<00:01:53.780> are<00:01:54.109> based<00:01:54.439> on<00:01:54.710> kind<00:01:55.100> of

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
there and now which are based on kind of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.359 
there and now which are based on kind of
the<00:01:55.280> same<00:01:55.549> skeleton<00:01:55.990> but<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.229> like<00:01:57.649> their<00:01:58.130> soft

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
the same skeleton but I like their soft

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.569 
the same skeleton but I like their soft
touch<00:01:58.579> treatment<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.240> and<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:01.159> know<00:02:01.219> really

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
touch treatment and and you know really

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.940 
touch treatment and and you know really
I<00:02:02.030> wanted<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.689> prodigy<00:02:03.139> to<00:02:03.319> be<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.710> first

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
I wanted the prodigy to be the first

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.129 
I wanted the prodigy to be the first
case<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.729> I<00:02:04.819> tried<00:02:05.060> out<00:02:05.090> from<00:02:05.420> bitfenix<00:02:05.929> suit

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:06.139 
case that I tried out from bitfenix suit

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.800 
case that I tried out from bitfenix suit
because<00:02:06.499> I<00:02:06.829> was<00:02:07.579> a<00:02:07.759> bit<00:02:07.909> skeptical<00:02:08.330> about<00:02:08.479> it

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
because I was a bit skeptical about it

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.020 
because I was a bit skeptical about it
at<00:02:08.899> first<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.380> I<00:02:09.679> wanted<00:02:10.039> them<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.700> really

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
at first and I wanted them to really

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.990 
at first and I wanted them to really
change<00:02:11.270> my<00:02:11.540> mind<00:02:11.870> about<00:02:12.709> this<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.550> this

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
change my mind about this this this

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.780 
change my mind about this this this
route<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.630> they<00:02:14.660> were<00:02:14.810> going<00:02:15.170> in

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
route that they were going in

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.229 
route that they were going in
and<00:02:16.299> they<00:02:16.420> really<00:02:16.719> did<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.370> learned<00:02:18.370> through

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
and they really did I learned through

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.020 
and they really did I learned through
reviewing<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.469> bitfenix<00:02:21.099> prodigy<00:02:21.129> that

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
reviewing the bitfenix prodigy that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.610 
reviewing the bitfenix prodigy that
their<00:02:22.269> side<00:02:22.450> panels<00:02:22.930> are<00:02:23.109> the<00:02:23.140> best<00:02:23.439> side

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
their side panels are the best side

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.979 
their side panels are the best side
panels<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.129> I've<00:02:24.280> ever<00:02:24.430> ever<00:02:24.969> seen<00:02:25.569> on<00:02:25.930> a

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
panels that I've ever ever seen on a

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.220 
panels that I've ever ever seen on a
case<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.950> my<00:02:27.609> entire<00:02:27.909> life<00:02:28.209> they're<00:02:29.109> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
case in my entire life they're the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.470 
case in my entire life they're the
heaviest<00:02:29.590> side<00:02:30.040> panels<00:02:30.489> for<00:02:30.790> their<00:02:31.030> size<00:02:31.239> that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
heaviest side panels for their size that

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.229 
heaviest side panels for their size that
I've<00:02:31.599> ever<00:02:31.780> felt<00:02:32.189> and<00:02:33.189> it's<00:02:33.609> they're<00:02:33.970> probably

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
I've ever felt and it's they're probably

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.869 
I've ever felt and it's they're probably
the<00:02:34.599> thicker<00:02:34.840> side<00:02:34.959> panels<00:02:35.650> I've<00:02:35.829> ever<00:02:36.010> tried

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
the thicker side panels I've ever tried

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.970 
the thicker side panels I've ever tried
this<00:02:37.120> bitch<00:02:37.359> where<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.629> side<00:02:38.200> panel<00:02:38.560> bends<00:02:38.769> in

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
this bitch where the side panel bends in

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.770 
this bitch where the side panel bends in
on<00:02:39.129> itself<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:40.239> it's<00:02:40.390> double<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
on itself and then it's double the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.809 
on itself and then it's double the
thickness<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.439> and<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.569> really<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:45.459> made

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
thickness and and I it really it made

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.699 
thickness and and I it really it made
something<00:02:46.150> different<00:02:46.989> out<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:47.469> mini-itx

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
something different out of a mini-itx

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.979 
something different out of a mini-itx
system<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.239> couldn't<00:02:49.569> really<00:02:49.689> get

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
system and that you couldn't really get

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.649 
system and that you couldn't really get
out<00:02:50.349> of<00:02:50.560> any<00:02:50.709> other<00:02:50.950> case<00:02:51.159> and<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:51.939> the<00:02:52.209> market

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
out of any other case and on the market

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.839 
out of any other case and on the market
and<00:02:52.840> yes<00:02:53.709> there<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.099> companies<00:02:54.639> out<00:02:54.819> there

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
and yes there is companies out there

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.220 
and yes there is companies out there
that<00:02:55.269> are<00:02:55.629> essentially<00:02:56.530> copying<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
that are essentially copying the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.729 
that are essentially copying the
bitfenix<00:02:59.230> prodigy<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.859> but<00:03:00.730> why<00:03:00.939> why<00:03:01.739> deal

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
bitfenix prodigy and but why why deal

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.190

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
through a window at the certain parts

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.420 
through a window at the certain parts
certain<00:03:26.199> components<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:26.829> i<00:03:26.889> want<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.250> look

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
certain components that i want to look

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.180 
certain components that i want to look
at<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.409> because<00:03:29.409> it's<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.709> prodigy

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
at and that because it's the prodigy

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.009 
at and that because it's the prodigy
it's<00:03:30.699> basically<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:33.329> case<00:03:34.329> on<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.629> market

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
it's basically the case on the market

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.129 
it's basically the case on the market
that<00:03:35.049> has<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.530> most<00:03:35.829> color<00:03:36.220> options<00:03:36.699> so<00:03:37.139> it's

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
that has the most color options so it's

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.099 
that has the most color options so it's
a<00:03:38.260> case<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.500> not<00:03:39.040> only<00:03:39.159> i<00:03:39.310> can<00:03:39.489> build<00:03:39.879> a<00:03:40.239> color

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
a case that not only i can build a color

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.349 
a case that not only i can build a color
theme<00:03:41.349> around<00:03:41.560> but<00:03:42.069> also<00:03:42.310> everybody<00:03:42.970> else<00:03:43.150> can

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
theme around but also everybody else can

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.110 
theme around but also everybody else can
build<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.629> color<00:03:43.810> theme<00:03:44.049> around<00:03:44.199> a<00:03:45.120> regardless

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
build a color theme around a regardless

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.119 
build a color theme around a regardless
of<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.419> color<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.810> they<00:03:46.989> want<00:03:47.199> to<00:03:47.290> choose<00:03:47.560> so

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
of the color that they want to choose so

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.180 
of the color that they want to choose so
it's<00:03:48.400> really<00:03:48.639> it's<00:03:48.879> almost<00:03:49.500> kind<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.010> most

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
it's really it's almost kind of the most

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.099 
it's really it's almost kind of the most
customizable<00:03:51.699> case<00:03:52.239> on<00:03:52.419> the<00:03:52.510> market<00:03:52.810> in<00:03:52.900> some

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
customizable case on the market in some

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.420 
customizable case on the market in some
respects<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.659> let<00:03:56.349> me<00:03:56.769> not<00:03:56.979> only<00:03:57.129> do

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
respects and so it let me not only do

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.449 
respects and so it let me not only do
why<00:03:57.909> i<00:03:57.940> wanted<00:03:58.329> to<00:03:58.449> do<00:03:58.659> it<00:03:58.989> but<00:03:59.379> also<00:03:59.650> let<00:04:00.280> me

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
why i wanted to do it but also let me

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.179 
why i wanted to do it but also let me
leave<00:04:00.849> it<00:04:01.000> open<00:04:01.359> for<00:04:01.569> other<00:04:02.019> people<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.709> copy

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
leave it open for other people to copy

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.330 
leave it open for other people to copy
but<00:04:03.579> in<00:04:03.760> their<00:04:04.090> own<00:04:04.239> way<00:04:04.479> in<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:05.049> sense<00:04:05.379> so

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
but in their own way in a sense so

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.009 
but in their own way in a sense so
that's<00:04:06.549> that's<00:04:06.849> why<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.120> went<00:04:07.389> with<00:04:07.540> bit<00:04:07.720> finish

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
that's that's why I went with bit finish
