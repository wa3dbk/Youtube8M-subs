 find out how much we actually have 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.410
 turned out the average consumption we refuel 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.140
 the product is already an envera from ibs with the calculation 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.819
 one tablet per 25 liters baku 40 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.000
 liters, respectively, we add a half 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.500
 pills and let's start our own test 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.930
 follow the results 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.600

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.900
 she will behave but I am more than 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.819
 sure that everything will be fine i 'm sure 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.780
 and is aimed at a positive result

 use Beck fuel sellers 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.120
 envirotabs we i drove two hundred 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.329
 sixty eight kilometers practically 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.850
 in city mode, it can be seen that 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:47.450
 because a and the average speed of 19 meters 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.930
 per hour time spent traveling 7 hours 47 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.510
 minutes 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.819
 this state in the evening corks 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.109
 in the morning 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.739
 average consumption is seven and seven 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:00.079
 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.200
 car remind lada priora 2012 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.870
 release baseline data were 10 half 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.060
 10 and 8 liters of 95 gasoline 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.150
 now all 8 liters 92 gasoline 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.970
 use a fuel catalyst but I want 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.850
 Still say that this is not a working dosage 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.130
 this 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:22.470
 I still pass testing so to speak 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.220
 I watch for consumption this dosage alone 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.680
 tablet our nets you 60 liters 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.570
 accordingly it is a bit too much for the track 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.230
 maybe once but for the city it is necessary 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.570
 slightly smaller dosage Lilith 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.000
 displacement that is one then. I think 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.850
 will be 35 40 liters and then there will be 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.220
 maximum effect achieved 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:51.900
 but now these are the results 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:56.280
 I am very pleased with it I save almost 3 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.740
 liters from the tank is the declared company 30 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.750
 percent product working product 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.930
