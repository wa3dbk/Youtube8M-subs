00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.170
 hello and support the creation band 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.710
 imma be naked believe in debate have made 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.710
 vibrate 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.560
 for this creation I decided 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.390
 to use standard oreo cookies that 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.010
 works as well even a little better 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.840
 with cream double oreo cookies 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.510
 because the stick to that sound is when 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.040
 even thick enough for ie6 and no matter 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.170
 what two-story cookies that 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.910
 outside and inside biscuits 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.090
 cream and cookies outside we go 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.260
 to be able to separate the bat one knew without it 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.809
 is in shops in 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.239
 confectionery chocolate and company in the 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.949
 background all the shops that have 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.900
 homemade chocolate products and you 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.399
 should have if not made you 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.350
 coffee sticks it works too 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.700
 good sweets it's small 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.800
 glitter and standard candy 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.360
 of groceries for chocolates I 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.390
 decided to take milk chocolate have 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.130
 past and white chocolate you could 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.170
 choose the color you want in 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.080
 the bottom is to decorate the outside 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.880
 of the oreo what you could also take 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.530
 chocolate chips in a grocery store 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.890
 works well we'll start with 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.080
 open the oreo cookies with a biscuit 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.640
 a knife we ​​will take the edge 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.869
 then we want to go inside 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.360
 go there gently to be able to 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.250
 to separate the cookies that will happen to you 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.400
 there several times in the case it is 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.260
 a 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.690
 we continue with a horse that we 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.369
 takes a good amount to get in 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.780
 to have a dozen because the 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.420
 oreo cookies are still pretty dry 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.340
 and his sister it breaks easily if 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.140
 his shares like that with the cream of two 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.490
 sides it does not matter we use when 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.479
 even it works well we just want 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.479
 that the biscuits be not broken 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.090
 we will try the knife inside 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.560
 open gently if you want 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.310
 recover the crim I can their master to 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.310
 the inside gently 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.980
 once completed the separation of 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.840
 cookies we'll take a little bit of 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.729
 chocolate that color that leaves you to 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.380
 your importance for the interior but 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.850
 we do not take the whole quantity because 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.440
 that otherwise it will make it freeze 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.690
 more quickly we just take a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.280
 small portion can work with a 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.020
 bain-marie to melt it or to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.850
 crowne me I use the microwave 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.680
 the technique is simple when who 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.570
 start to stay a little bit of 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.820
 pass in you stop heating 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.590
 and you mix it up and if the parties get 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.300
 shape in the mix and that we see 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.980
 more is that the mixture is taken must 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.730
 do not overheat castle there otherwise 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.950
 it works well rest we are a step 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.590
 so these fades we need chocolate 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.060
 our cookies and we beat some sound for 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.090
 start we start by taking a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.709
 stick and a biscuit cream side 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.890
 we will take the stick and then we will 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.590
 scratch the cream so that the chocolate 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.120
 can stick on the biscuit have the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.040
 keep it inside anyway so 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.640
 our stick come settle on the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.400
 biscuit we always take the stick on 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.269
 soaked in chocolate and we come 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.560
 to install inside must not 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.550
 push too hard because the cookies 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.000
 oreo is fragile 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.930
 the second suite and we take them 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.730
 puts on top of it not weighed by yet 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.260
 once because otherwise we will break and 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.239
 we put aside 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.890
 same thing with a second one takes the 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:34.030
 on the client side we are serious to remove the 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.510
 creaming a little chocolate in place at 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.700
 interior 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.570
 if you see that it can not hold 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.280
 well you can take a little 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.140
 spoon and add some chocolate 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.880
 here to make sure it fits well 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.160
 but in the case of muscu it works 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.500
 and we stick once we're going to have 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.989
 many of the facts we put them to 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.280
 freezer 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.290
 once out of the freezer 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.540
 after about ten minutes the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.610
 chocolate poster and so our cookies 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.840
 oreo hold on our sticks you go 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.090
 need some tips for 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.769
 can decorate and we will shape 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.690
 chocolate for decoration 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.489
 some sweets and you go ou have 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.959
 need some support to install them 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.519
 what I decided to do is 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.680
 that I took a fancy drink to 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.060
 the inside of which is sugar and 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.070
 when I'm going to plant my stop at 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.049
 in it come you could decide 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.330
 to make one per person or to 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.250
 put several inside for 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.940
 we can see them in the center of your 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.500
 table we go with the decoration for this 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.600
 kind of sweets I like on a leash 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.710
 and some without chocolate because 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.870
 it's not all guests who like 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.570
 as sweet for others as you can 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.539
 take the stick oreo on soak 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.880
 inside the chocolate you can catch 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.500
 in full or not m only half 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.600
 as to the costs at the level gently 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.740
 so that it does not take off from the bar 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.060
 can the wrist a little bit taken 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.919
 on more like these at the level of the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.840
 half and we can take a few 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:04.500
 glitter candy a supo two in 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.500
 chocolate like that 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.410
 and that's it for the first one 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.570
 in our glasses of sugar for the 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:22.100
 second we can take our spoon 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:29.690
 and flung the horse over 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:29.690
 to make small lines like that 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.730
 same thing on the other side 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.250
 to go with it our imagination 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.810
 we see it we put a care by everything 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.600
 just a few places for the 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.650
 chocolate strand same thing we can 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.090
 find inside we could 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.870
 decide by m I'm going to decide to 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:07.000
 put a full size of the biscuit 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:12.670
 for the sweet beaks have the state for 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.140

 once we have removed their supply 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.530
 chocolate sticking it by bumping it 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:32.140
 delicately like that we can take 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:39.490
 a few chocolate backers and in 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:40.900
 add on it like this here you 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.480
 could also take small 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.700
 beads and take the trouble to write some 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.860
 letters on your oreo not that to be
