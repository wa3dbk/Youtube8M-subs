my tutorial today I want to show you
guys<00:00:05.970> how<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.509> can<00:00:06.600> set<00:00:06.960> up<00:00:06.990> your<00:00:07.109> first

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
guys how you can set up your first

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.100 
guys how you can set up your first
animation<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.849> Maya<00:00:09.120> if<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.690> never<00:00:09.840> did<00:00:10.050> that

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
animation in Maya if you never did that

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.549 
animation in Maya if you never did that
before<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.309> pretty<00:00:11.730> neat<00:00:11.969> because

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
before this is a pretty neat because

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.900 
before this is a pretty neat because
there's<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> lot<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.740> functions<00:00:14.190> out<00:00:14.340> there<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
there's a lot of functions out there and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.490 
there's a lot of functions out there and
if<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.299> kind<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.660> figure<00:00:15.929> out<00:00:15.990> how<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.289> works

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
if you kind of figure out how it works

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.590 
if you kind of figure out how it works
it's<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.580> do<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> lot<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.000> nice<00:00:18.180> stuff<00:00:18.210> with

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
it's you can do a lot of nice stuff with

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.830 
it's you can do a lot of nice stuff with
it

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
it

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.920

so we're going to get started so I'm
going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.080> start<00:00:22.320> off<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> ground<00:00:22.980> plane

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
going to start off with a ground plane

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.769 
going to start off with a ground plane
and<00:00:24.949> my<00:00:25.949> polygons<00:00:26.430> menu<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:27.150> select<00:00:27.449> plane

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
and my polygons menu just select plane

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.979 
and my polygons menu just select plane
and<00:00:28.640> ride<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.179> your<00:00:30.330> grid<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:32.989> I'm

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and ride that out on your grid and I'm

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.889 
and ride that out on your grid and I'm
going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> hit<00:00:34.290> five<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.920> shaded<00:00:35.219> mode<00:00:35.899> all

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
going to hit five for shaded mode all

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.330 
going to hit five for shaded mode all
right<00:00:38.329> okay<00:00:39.329> next<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:40.200> need<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.649> create<00:00:41.010> some

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
so I'm going to in the polygons menu

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.630 
so I'm going to in the polygons menu
select<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.050> cube<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:48.410> I'm<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> drag<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
select a cube and I'm going to drag that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.110 
select a cube and I'm going to drag that
out<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.239> drag<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:52.699> maybe<00:00:53.699> scale<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.000> down

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
out and drag that up maybe scale it down

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
out and drag that up maybe scale it down
a<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.449> bit<00:00:54.600> hit<00:00:55.050> R<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.920> scale<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.340> down<00:00:58.250> like

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
a little bit hit R to scale it down like

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.410 
a little bit hit R to scale it down like
so<00:00:59.539> pull<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:01.020> bit<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:02.120> need<00:01:03.120> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so pull it up a little bit and need to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.750 
so pull it up a little bit and need to
position<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.320> nicely<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.739> my<00:01:04.890> grid<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.670> I'm

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
position it nicely on my grid so I'm

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.149 
position it nicely on my grid so I'm
going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> my<00:01:06.479> front<00:01:07.049> view<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:08.520> W<00:01:10.159> pull

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
going to go to my front view it W pull

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.940 
going to go to my front view it W pull
it<00:01:11.280> down<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.500> move<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> over<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it down a bit and move it over to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.410 
it down a bit and move it over to
roughly<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.090> middle<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.909> view<00:01:18.180> when

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
roughly the middle and in this view when

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.100 
roughly the middle and in this view when
you<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> same<00:01:22.100> okay<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.960> back<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> my

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.450 
you do the same okay like so back to my
perspective<00:01:25.680> view<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.710> brick<00:01:28.920> but

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
perspective view so that's one brick but

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.819 
perspective view so that's one brick but
obviously<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.939> need<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> few<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.830 
obviously I need a few so I'm going to
hit<00:01:31.950> control<00:01:32.400> D<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:34.250> I'm<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.659> move<00:01:36.659> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
hit control D and I'm going to move that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.469 
hit control D and I'm going to move that
over<00:01:37.280> I'm<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.549> drag<00:01:38.820> select<00:01:39.030> them<00:01:39.299> both

and move that over and now I'm going to
select<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.130> bricks<00:02:05.600> hit<00:02:06.600> W<00:02:07.080> actually

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
select all the bricks hit W actually

select all the bricks hit W actually
it's<00:02:08.220> ready<00:02:08.520> selected<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.800> put<00:02:10.800> them

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
it's ready selected and put them

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.660

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.240 
somewhat in the middle of the grid now
normally<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> would<00:02:15.900> set<00:02:16.140> up<00:02:16.170> lighting<00:02:16.770> and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
normally I would set up lighting and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.880 
normally I would set up lighting and
texture<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> lot<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.690> stuff<00:02:18.900> but<00:02:19.410> because

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
texture and a lot of stuff but because

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.170 
texture and a lot of stuff but because
we're<00:02:20.070> not<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.400> render<00:02:20.700> out<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.000> full

we're not going to render out the full

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.850 
we're not going to render out the full
animation<00:02:21.750> I'm<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.290> show<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
animation I'm just going to show you the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.190 
animation I'm just going to show you the
animation<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.580> view<00:02:23.820> but<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.990> want

animation in this view but if you want
to<00:02:25.320> animate<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.130> set<00:02:26.310> up<00:02:26.400> lights

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
to animate it you have to set up lights

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.530 
to animate it you have to set up lights
and<00:02:26.940> textures<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.720> all<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.040> alright<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:30.210> now

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
and textures and all that alright so now

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.560 
and textures and all that alright so now
we<00:02:30.600> need<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.370> select<00:02:32.370> or<00:02:32.610> create<00:02:32.880> an<00:02:33.120> object

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
we need to select or create an object

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.060 
we need to select or create an object
that<00:02:33.990> will<00:02:35.210> hit<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.300> bricks<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.590> I'm<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:38.010> to

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
that will hit the bricks so I'm going to

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.260 
that will hit the bricks so I'm going to
get<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> sphere<00:02:39.650> my<00:02:40.650> polygons<00:02:41.070> menu<00:02:41.160> I'm<00:02:42.030> going

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
get a sphere my polygons menu I'm going

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.660 
get a sphere my polygons menu I'm going
to<00:02:42.330> drag<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.780> out<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> grid<00:02:43.460> I'm<00:02:44.460> going

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
to drag that out on the grid I'm going

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.530 
to drag that out on the grid I'm going
to<00:02:44.760> pull<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.330> up<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:46.370> I'm<00:02:47.450> position<00:02:48.450> it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
to pull that up and I'm position it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.350 
to pull that up and I'm position it
correctly<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.860> will<00:02:50.040> hit<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.250> bricks<00:02:50.550> so

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
correctly so it will hit the bricks so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.840 
correctly so it will hit the bricks so
I'm<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.660> go<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.870> my<00:02:52.220> my<00:02:53.220> separate<00:02:53.550> views

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
I'm going to go to my my separate views

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.690 
I'm going to go to my my separate views
here<00:02:54.210> in<00:02:54.900> my<00:02:55.080> front<00:02:55.320> view<00:02:55.500> I'm<00:02:56.190> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> drag

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
here in my front view I'm going to drag

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.370 
here in my front view I'm going to drag
it<00:02:56.850> over<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.300> middle<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.930> it's<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.170> front

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
it over to the middle so it's in front

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.450 
it over to the middle so it's in front
the<00:02:58.530> bricks<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.300> right<00:03:00.300> here<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.990> need<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:02.250> make

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
the bricks and right here I need to make

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.630 
the bricks and right here I need to make
sure<00:03:02.570> that<00:03:03.570> when<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.320> falls<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:05.790> will<00:03:05.940> actually

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
sure that when it falls it will actually

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.810 
sure that when it falls it will actually
contact<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:09.150> first<00:03:09.420> brick<00:03:09.750> correctly<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.820> like

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
contact the first brick correctly I like

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.620 
contact the first brick correctly I like
something<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.450> okay<00:03:14.360> alrighty

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
something like that okay alrighty

something like that okay alrighty
back<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.590> my<00:03:16.709> perspective<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:18.239> everything

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
back to my perspective you so everything

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.449 
back to my perspective you so everything
is<00:03:18.780> positioned<00:03:19.320> correctly<00:03:19.500> I'm<00:03:20.220> going<00:03:20.400> to

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
is positioned correctly I'm going to

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.580 
is positioned correctly I'm going to
pull<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:20.760> up<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.060> little<00:03:21.180> bit<00:03:21.390> more<00:03:21.600> now<00:03:22.560> I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
pull this up a little bit more now I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.530 
pull this up a little bit more now I
need<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:22.950> do<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.100> couple<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.459> things<00:03:23.640> first<00:03:24.300> of

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
need to do a couple of things first of

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.390 
need to do a couple of things first of
all<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:25.050> need<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.350> select<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.950> ground<00:03:26.220> plane

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
all we need to select the ground plane

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.470 
all we need to select the ground plane
and<00:03:27.530> then<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.890> go<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.100> our<00:03:29.430> dynamics<00:03:30.120> menu

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
and then we go to our dynamics menu

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.420 
and then we go to our dynamics menu
actually<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.170> did<00:03:31.410> select<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.950> but<00:03:32.220> if<00:03:32.310> you

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
actually I did select that but if you

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.530 
actually I did select that but if you
didn't<00:03:32.930> dynamics<00:03:33.930> menu<00:03:34.459> go<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.489> soft<00:03:36.060> rigid

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
didn't dynamics menu go to soft rigid

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.540 
didn't dynamics menu go to soft rigid
bodies<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.250> create<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.430> passive<00:03:39.000> rigid<00:03:39.510> body

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
bodies and create a passive rigid body

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.050 
bodies and create a passive rigid body
for<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.670> floor

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
for the floor

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.630 
for the floor
okay<00:03:43.700> now<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.150> dominoes<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
okay now the dominoes and the in the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.090 
okay now the dominoes and the in the
sphere<00:03:48.000> they're<00:03:48.570> active<00:03:49.019> rigid<00:03:49.440> bodies<00:03:49.769> so

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
sphere they're active rigid bodies so

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.600 
sphere they're active rigid bodies so
I'm<00:03:50.190> going<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.550> select<00:03:51.480> my<00:03:51.660> dominoes<00:03:52.610> I'm

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
I'm going to select my dominoes I'm

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.550 
I'm going to select my dominoes I'm
going<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:53.880> select<00:03:54.150> my<00:03:54.300> sphere<00:03:54.720> shift<00:03:55.260> select

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
going to select my sphere shift select

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.040 
going to select my sphere shift select
actually<00:03:55.980> I'm<00:03:56.880> going<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.180> go<00:03:57.300> up<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.570> soft

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
actually I'm going to go up to soft

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.710 
actually I'm going to go up to soft
rigid<00:03:58.410> bodies<00:03:58.739> create<00:03:59.459> active<00:03:59.940> rigid<00:04:00.540> body

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
rigid bodies create active rigid body

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.250 
rigid bodies create active rigid body
and<00:04:01.760> another<00:04:02.760> thing<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.030> need<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.300> do<00:04:03.450> because<00:04:03.989> I

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
and another thing I need to do because I

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.020 
and another thing I need to do because I
want<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.530> ball<00:04:04.800> to<00:04:05.040> fall<00:04:05.190> down<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.730> want<00:04:05.910> the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
want this ball to fall down I want the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.420 
want this ball to fall down I want the
bricks<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.420> fall<00:04:06.630> down<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.830> need<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.280> add

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
bricks to fall down is I need to add

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.880 
bricks to fall down is I need to add
gravity<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.540> these<00:04:09.720> objects<00:04:10.290> already<00:04:10.590> got

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
gravity to these objects already got

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.500 
gravity to these objects already got
them<00:04:11.010> selected<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.090> I'm<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:12.299> to<00:04:12.329> go<00:04:12.450> to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
them selected so I'm going to go to

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.330 
them selected so I'm going to go to
fields

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
fields

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.930 
fields
I<00:04:14.370> mean<00:04:14.580> I<00:04:14.670> select<00:04:14.989> gravity<00:04:16.400> now<00:04:17.400> one<00:04:17.760> more

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
I mean I select gravity now one more

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.610 
I mean I select gravity now one more
thing<00:04:18.000> we<00:04:18.269> need<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.449> do<00:04:18.660> is<00:04:18.989> we<00:04:19.230> need<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.470> make

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
thing we need to do is we need to make

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.340 
thing we need to do is we need to make
sure<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.130> in<00:04:20.250> our<00:04:20.370> animation<00:04:20.940> timeline<00:04:21.840> we

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
sure that in our animation timeline we

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.070 
sure that in our animation timeline we
have<00:04:22.380> enough<00:04:22.830> frames<00:04:23.130> for<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.870> animation<00:04:24.870> to

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
have enough frames for the animation to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.080 
have enough frames for the animation to
play<00:04:25.229> out<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:27.050> let's<00:04:28.050> say<00:04:28.260> 200<00:04:29.220> that<00:04:29.850> would<00:04:29.970> be

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
play out so let's say 200 that would be

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.060 
play out so let's say 200 that would be
fine

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
fine

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.040 
fine
we're<00:04:32.070> going<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.250> position<00:04:32.820> it<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.840> have<00:04:34.020> a

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
we're going to position it to have a

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.360 
we're going to position it to have a
good<00:04:34.380> view<00:04:34.919> of<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.220> animation<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:37.220> if<00:04:38.220> I

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370
