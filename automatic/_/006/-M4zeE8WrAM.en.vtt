this<00:02:28.989> was<00:02:29.230> going<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.830> thought<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.519> I<00:02:30.550> was

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
this was going I thought that I was

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.460 
this was going I thought that I was
going<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.910> lose<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.300> match<00:02:31.510> eventually<00:02:31.750> due

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
going to lose this match eventually due

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.830 
going to lose this match eventually due
to<00:02:32.650> all<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.069> entry<00:02:33.550> hazards<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.360> are<00:02:34.660> being

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
to all the entry hazards that are being

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.550 
to all the entry hazards that are being
set<00:02:35.140> up

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
set up

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.150 
set up
and<00:02:35.849> though<00:02:36.849> I'm<00:02:37.239> racking<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.230> damage<00:02:38.830> and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and though I'm racking up damage and

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160 
and though I'm racking up damage and
there<00:02:39.340> really<00:02:39.730> isn't<00:02:40.030> anything<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:40.989> just

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
there really isn't anything I can just

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.100 
there really isn't anything I can just
do<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.530> dent<00:02:41.799> his<00:02:42.010> team<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.870> also<00:02:43.870> another

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
do to dent his team and also another

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.860 
do to dent his team and also another
thing<00:02:44.260> jirachi<00:02:45.099> when<00:02:45.640> he<00:02:45.730> sent<00:02:46.000> in<00:02:46.180> Jirachi<00:02:46.569> I

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
thing jirachi when he sent in Jirachi I

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.339 
thing jirachi when he sent in Jirachi I
figured<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:48.099> maybe<00:02:49.140> offensive<00:02:50.140> type

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
figured that maybe offensive type

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.259 
figured that maybe offensive type
Pokemon<00:02:50.890> on<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.190> team<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.489> figured<00:02:51.790> no<00:02:52.060> matter

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
Pokemon on this team I figured no matter

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.020 
Pokemon on this team I figured no matter
what<00:02:52.540> Jirachi<00:02:52.870> would<00:02:53.200> hit<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.769> would<00:02:54.489> not<00:02:54.700> die

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
what Jirachi would hit I would not die

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.660 
what Jirachi would hit I would not die
because<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.260> DRA<00:02:56.500> Chi<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.739> usually<00:02:57.160> see<00:02:57.370> are

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
because the DRA Chi I usually see are

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.640 
because the DRA Chi I usually see are
what<00:02:58.510> do<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.660> call<00:02:58.810> it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
what do you call it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.949 
what do you call it
especially<00:03:00.310> defensive<00:03:00.819> now<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.540> figure

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
especially defensive now so I figure

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.229 
especially defensive now so I figure
Thunder<00:03:02.380> Wave<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.829> luckily<00:03:03.640> he<00:03:03.849> went<00:03:04.030> for

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
Thunder Wave it luckily he went for

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.420 
Thunder Wave it luckily he went for
thunder<00:03:04.540> predicting<00:03:05.019> in<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.260> switch<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.799> I

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
thunder predicting in a switch and I

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.059 
thunder predicting in a switch and I
feel<00:03:06.790> like<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.450> Jirachi<00:03:07.870> may<00:03:08.410> have<00:03:08.799> been

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
feel like that Jirachi may have been

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.130 
feel like that Jirachi may have been
scarfed<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.940> may<00:03:10.060> have<00:03:10.209> been<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.630> one<00:03:10.840> poked

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
scarfed and may have been that one poked

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
scarfed and may have been that one poked
one<00:03:11.349> that's<00:03:11.650> supposed<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:12.130> just<00:03:12.340> like<00:03:14.160> take

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
one that's supposed to just like take

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.840 
one that's supposed to just like take
care<00:03:15.609> of<00:03:15.970> all<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.560> weakened<00:03:18.040> pokemon<00:03:18.549> from

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
care of all the weakened pokemon from

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.819 
care of all the weakened pokemon from
entry<00:03:19.299> hazards<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.019> kind<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.319> thing<00:03:20.530> so

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
entry hazards and that kind of thing so

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.849 
entry hazards and that kind of thing so
I<00:03:21.040> feel<00:03:21.639> like<00:03:21.670> once<00:03:22.389> I<00:03:22.660> got<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.470> Jirachi

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
I feel like once I got that Jirachi

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.039 
I feel like once I got that Jirachi
paralyzed<00:03:24.579> that<00:03:25.030> was<00:03:25.389> also<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> good<00:03:25.810> thing

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
paralyzed that was also a good thing

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.960 
paralyzed that was also a good thing
because<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.680> may<00:03:26.799> have<00:03:26.920> been<00:03:27.100> scarf<00:03:27.579> there's

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
because it may have been scarf there's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.509 
because it may have been scarf there's
something<00:03:28.299> I'm<00:03:28.420> not<00:03:28.600> sure<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.310> I

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
something I'm not sure so I like I

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.900 
something I'm not sure so I like I
figured<00:03:31.060> since<00:03:31.630> he<00:03:31.810> switched<00:03:32.109> then<00:03:32.670> he<00:03:33.670> was

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
figured since he switched then he was

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.400 
figured since he switched then he was
probably<00:03:34.299> choiced

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
probably choiced

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.830 
probably choiced
I<00:03:35.500> figure<00:03:35.859> scarf<00:03:36.310> since<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.359> rest<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.720> his

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
I figure scarf since the rest of his

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.800 
I figure scarf since the rest of his
team<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.470> really<00:03:38.980> defensive<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.910> he<00:03:40.569> needs

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
team is really defensive so he needs

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.979 
team is really defensive so he needs
like<00:03:41.170> another<00:03:41.500> Pokemon<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.160> just<00:03:42.400> like<00:03:42.989> kill

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
like another Pokemon to just like kill

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.900 
like another Pokemon to just like kill
off<00:03:45.030> all<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.389> pokemon<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.959> are<00:03:47.079> like<00:03:47.910> just

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
off all the pokemon that are like just

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.270 
off all the pokemon that are like just
switching<00:03:49.359> in<00:03:49.510> due<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:50.079> all<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.799> entry

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
switching in due to all the entry

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.210 
switching in due to all the entry
hazards<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.299> I<00:03:52.720> feel<00:03:53.319> like<00:03:53.560> since<00:03:53.859> I<00:03:53.980> got<00:03:54.160> that

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
hazards so I feel like since I got that

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.430 
hazards so I feel like since I got that
Jirachi<00:03:54.760> paralyzed<00:03:55.389> that<00:03:55.510> was<00:03:55.750> also<00:03:56.049> a<00:03:56.079> key

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
Jirachi paralyzed that was also a key

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.479 
Jirachi paralyzed that was also a key
part<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:58.000> thing<00:03:58.359> because<00:03:58.690> if<00:03:59.440> it<00:04:00.040> was<00:04:00.280> not

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
part to this thing because if it was not

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.660 
part to this thing because if it was not
paralyzed<00:04:01.150> later<00:04:01.720> on<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:03.430> would<00:04:03.609> have

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
paralyzed later on it would have

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.670 
paralyzed later on it would have
probably<00:04:04.120> affected<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.599> match<00:04:04.780> that's<00:04:05.170> one

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
probably affected the match that's one

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.589 
probably affected the match that's one
thing<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.400> there<00:04:06.700> are<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.819> few<00:04:06.849> other<00:04:07.329> things

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
thing that there are a few other things

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.270 
thing that there are a few other things
that<00:04:07.750> would<00:04:07.900> have<00:04:08.049> affected<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.560> match<00:04:08.739> like

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
that would have affected the match like

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.720 
that would have affected the match like
I<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:10.780> keep<00:04:10.959> switching<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.739> switching<00:04:12.220> i<00:04:12.370> I

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
I just keep switching and switching i I

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
he decides to go for leech seed or

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.040 
he decides to go for leech seed or
Thunder<00:05:30.130> wave<00:05:30.370> if<00:05:30.580> he<00:05:30.700> has<00:05:30.820> it<00:05:31.060> again<00:05:31.330> but<00:05:31.990> he

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
Thunder wave if he has it again but he

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.260 
Thunder wave if he has it again but he
goes<00:05:32.200> for<00:05:32.380> another<00:05:32.590> power<00:05:32.860> whip<00:05:33.160> so<00:05:33.490> right

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
goes for another power whip so right

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.240 
goes for another power whip so right
here<00:05:34.570> I'm<00:05:34.720> like<00:05:34.870> okay<00:05:35.260> I'm<00:05:35.470> gonna<00:05:35.680> attack<00:05:36.010> with

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
here I'm like okay I'm gonna attack with

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.270 
here I'm like okay I'm gonna attack with
thunder<00:05:36.730> because<00:05:37.510> thunder<00:05:37.900> is<00:05:38.110> stabbed<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:39.160> I

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
thunder because thunder is stabbed and I

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.700 
thunder because thunder is stabbed and I
think<00:05:39.520> it's<00:05:39.640> base<00:05:39.850> power<00:05:40.240> is<00:05:40.450> 120<00:05:41.110> plus<00:05:41.470> the

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
think it's base power is 120 plus the

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.960 
think it's base power is 120 plus the
percent<00:05:42.480> of<00:05:43.480> peril<00:05:44.320> paralysis<00:05:45.160> is<00:05:45.520> also

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
percent of peril paralysis is also

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.900 
percent of peril paralysis is also
pretty<00:05:46.200> decent<00:05:47.200> and<00:05:47.440> I'm<00:05:48.040> hoping<00:05:48.400> I<00:05:48.550> can<00:05:48.580> live

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
pretty decent and I'm hoping I can live

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.080 
pretty decent and I'm hoping I can live
this<00:05:49.140> power<00:05:50.140> whip<00:05:50.350> and<00:05:50.680> I<00:05:50.920> live<00:05:51.160> with<00:05:51.340> 53<00:05:51.940> hit

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
this power whip and I live with 53 hit

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.820 
this power whip and I live with 53 hit
points<00:05:52.390> and<00:05:52.480> thankfully<00:05:53.050> I'm<00:05:53.230> glad<00:05:53.560> I<00:05:53.590> don't

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
points and thankfully I'm glad I don't

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.250

run life orb on this set because that

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.200 
run life orb on this set because that
would<00:05:56.710> have<00:05:56.830> just<00:05:57.040> killed<00:05:57.280> me<00:05:57.490> off<00:05:57.640> if<00:05:57.880> I<00:05:58.000> ran

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
would have just killed me off if I ran

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.850 
would have just killed me off if I ran
life<00:05:58.450> orb<00:05:58.720> actually<00:05:59.110> preferred<00:05:59.470> the<00:05:59.500> left

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
life orb actually preferred the left

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.040 
life orb actually preferred the left
over<00:06:00.160> set<00:06:00.430> and<00:06:00.700> I<00:06:01.150> go<00:06:01.300> for<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:01.570> hidden<00:06:01.810> power

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050

over set and I go for the hidden power
ice<00:06:02.110> knowing<00:06:02.710> that'll<00:06:03.010> knock<00:06:03.490> it<00:06:03.700> out<00:06:03.820> just<00:06:04.150> in
