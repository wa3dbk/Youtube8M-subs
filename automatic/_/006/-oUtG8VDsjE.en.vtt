00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.980
 if it were in their hands they would impose 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.290
 severe fines to all the piracy of the 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.510
 private ambulances that currently 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.240
 does not respect the rule says the director of 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.090
 the red cross ricardo portugal exists 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.220
 krumm the club is the regulatory center of 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.560
 medical emergencies and is here on the cross 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.070
 red but all these ambulances 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.810
 individuals have not respected them 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.140
 then we are waiting for 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.900
 civil protection 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.480
 ok this rule to be able to work 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.239
 as it should be and thus avoid that 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.520
 emergency service hacking and it's 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.460
 which ensures that each transfer charge 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.500
 minimum at 8,000 pesos but only go to 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.270
 crashes or vehicular accidents in the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.640
 that frequently participate 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.500
 car insurance that the club 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.010
 dispatch the ambulances according to their 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.650
 location the nearest island always and 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.330
 obviously with that maxim that the 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.910
 service rendered no matter what 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.250
 companies are the service has to be 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.820
 free because they are companies 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.930
 individuals who work under agreements 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.430
 so now they are covering here in 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.890
 the center the emergency services 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.590
 to see to make money and that is not 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.930
 it's worth it because I repeat the end user 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.450
 in injured is the one who has to pay 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.700
 all for that reason he expects the management of 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.130
 civil protection press to conclude 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.259
 the regulation that obliges every unit 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.840
 of medical assistance to meet for 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.590
 not be sanctioned, there was already a pact 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.210
 civility precisely to avoid that and 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.430
 the red cross should cover all 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.340
 but these guys are hearing the 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.810
 Police frequencies to go fast 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.280
 when when a service is required 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.810
 obviously they see it as a business that 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.619
 that's the bad 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.090
 I do not disagree that there are 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.130
 I disagree with how they operate 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.000
 but obviously we are not 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.280
 authority to be able to regulate that criterion 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.250
 of work has to be protection 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.659
 civil in the camera ricardo vallejo for 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.659
 cute nutrition like
