 share with you before 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
 start with the video I want to comment two 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.430
 things the first one is the gameplay that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.320
 you have in the background that is a gameplay of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.239
 the new carrier zombies of the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 advanced warfare that was playing in 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.539
 light was really happening 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.999
 quite badly I was in trouble 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.339
 but to say that they are very handsome and 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.050
 tell you that if you want me to upload to the channel 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.030

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.879
 come then let me leave it in the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.370

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.370
