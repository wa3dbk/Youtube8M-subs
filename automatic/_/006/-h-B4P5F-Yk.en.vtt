00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
think of them in the most situations

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.100 
think of them in the most situations
that<00:01:39.640> are<00:01:39.790> kind<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.090> awkward<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.660> we<00:01:40.750> all<00:01:40.900> go

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
really hard to think about when you go

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.950 
really hard to think about when you go
through<00:01:45.940> that<00:01:46.120> moment<00:01:46.480> in<00:01:46.570> life<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.870> you're
