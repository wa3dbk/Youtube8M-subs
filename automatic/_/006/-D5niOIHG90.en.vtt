00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.490
Today I will give a hint on one of the foods that

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.009
Brazilian prefer

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.559
garlic

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.900
it is very difficult to squeeze the garlic, you can use these crushes garlic, but after what

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:19.909
happens

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.980
holes always get dirty, you should clean it

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.650
stink, today you'll learn a thing, simple and practical

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.829
that will not make your house smell

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.270
squeeze the garlic

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.480
we only need baking paper

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.980
that bend the edges

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.660
and make a small envelope

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.900
then I take the garlic, in this case I have a wonderful fresh garlic

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.190
I remove the skin

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.700
watch as she takes off, take it off easily when it's fresh

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.390
cut in half

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.300
if you need to remove the soul of garlic

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.610
and I put it

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.060
in our envelope

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.460
I do this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.130
with all the garlic that I need

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.780
This is simple

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.140
I close the envelope

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.970
on the high side

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.270
Now that I put the garlic in the envelope

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.480
crush it with a meat tenderizer

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.030
if I did not have a meat mallet, you can use a saucepan or the bottom of a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.030
bottle

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.940
now

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.560
open

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.260
our envelope

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.710
and use a garlic to cook rice, or for any our recipe

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.710
we have not soiled nothing

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.860
advantage of having crushed garlic to create a recipe SambaCooking

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.389
and put it on instagram

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:12.559
hashtag sambacooking

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:13.480
see you soon
