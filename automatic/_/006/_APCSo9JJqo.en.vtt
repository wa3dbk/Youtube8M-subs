00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
about is we're building a base now we

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.389 
about is we're building a base now we
will<00:01:00.050> basically<00:01:00.229> be<00:01:00.589> asking<00:01:00.920> our<00:01:01.010> audience

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:03.139 
what we should build a base of for

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.410 
what we should build a base of for
example<00:01:03.589> back<00:01:04.460> in<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.670> past<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.180> don't<00:01:05.239> know<00:01:05.330> if

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
example back in the past I don't know if

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.610 
example back in the past I don't know if
you<00:01:05.479> guys<00:01:05.570> remember<00:01:05.720> or<00:01:06.020> not<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:06.320> there<00:01:06.440> was
