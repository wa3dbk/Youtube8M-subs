00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:10.139
 and then guys Shadyac making tips 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.660
 on this 2 time and I think I 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.570
 I have to where the staff is doing a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.949
 analysis in the year that I thought it was 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.779
 missing much with the Brazilian for 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.609
 less the difference I 'm seeing Brazilian 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.220
 gringo now I 'm following the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.109
 communities at the same time is to see that 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.580
 Brazilian has a very big embezzlement. 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.619
 community 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.250
 I used to talk about the community 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.399
 Brazilian in general and such but in the real 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.640
 There is a lot of a Brazilian community . 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.730
 joint 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.620
 there are several different focuses for 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.879
 how many bildsten competing numbers 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.719
 with each other 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.850
 stems emergency there the wi fi and 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.510
 all I'm talking about is the accounts 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.239
 world knows that the player everything and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.489
 guys are 90 and few people online 120 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.829
 people to more than 140 people online 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.329
 All the time , so it rolls a lot. 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.550
 theater discussion many many 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.970
 affairs and 27 what made the break 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.799
 brazilian very much in the league 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.390
 Brazil is Brazil, Brazil does not have 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.000
 opportunity to follow this up because 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.380
 everyone awake bigger than his 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.590
 Brazil's peak monitors have 5 to 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.270
 director there 16 I do not know 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.549
 and these guys barely go online 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.409
 talking directly with the people and even 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.850
 so the little time they are in 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.439
 a very big talk has a personal 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.900
 being many others then as is a 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.369
 large group and larger mangos 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.530
 the people below where 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.820
 have and up to stay the same 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.920
 the level of people taking a shower 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.619
 while there are more people here 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.759
 1700 and 1800 the 'guy' I want to change from 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.799
 uterine cervix bg 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.009
 he was with another guild that has 15 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.299
 people than 1,800 only after he leaves in 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.009
 tenth with the other that has all the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.899
 people who in 1900 and want it with 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.610
 it is only then that people are 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.500
 online at the most of the day 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.070
 instead of joining this crew every one 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.360
 place and always have that 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.950
 good discussion of subject 61 community is 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.729
 a very small oprah niche is 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.849
 separate 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.129
 You know, I think it brings people together 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.640
 have the same focus not to focus on Helena I 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.319
 I want to be good at the expensive alliance. 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.480
 as many people as possible in Libya and 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.250
 clichy and make a community needs 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.209
 understand the problem and even the Brazilians 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.550
 elitist are not at this point I want and 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.130
 adilson only between the two camacho and this 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.140
 it's two strong camacho knows it is not well 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.090
 well you know you have a lot of face you have potential 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.530
 and may be growing we have faces 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.270
 when you have a chance to play with a guy 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.790
 better that he ended up getting nervous at 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.320
 right knee but he may prefer 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.630
 It can be good because as I go 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.300
 most common for him is in a line of 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.770
 computers that no wonder you know the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.840
 it is better that everything plays against loses 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.090
 all the time to headline who always 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.430
 growing subjects conversations the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.989
 fights chatting things really well 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.610
 makes a very big difference for who 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.530
 is wanting to improve 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.830
 so the tip that I personally give is 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.470
 staff tries to focus a little more 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.110
 community that you want for now. 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.750
 focus but my focus tvp game is serious 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.489
 I want to improve the registry is helping 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.810
 I do not want to deceive people who have 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.030
 greater direct contact 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.470
 knows who is talking about total area and looking 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.450
 the guy talks as much as I do not want 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.040
 different from the river left the event 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.350
 speak with the raised high ceiling exposed 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.870
 on the staff guide are talking everything I want 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.450
 going to the theater speaks so much in 1930 but 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.810
 The name of the United 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.610
 has to accompany know that the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.030
 Guys are talking the subject over there. 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.250
 important to me I played of the hour megi 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.799
 I lost limbs and why they killed 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.540
 my means or know that half was easy to 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.670
 killing happen good target because 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.890
 but also knows that MP does not 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.570
 she had water today she had a fracture 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.540
 in the femur of the leg is so easy 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.209
 But he left there today to speak 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.769
 potent because this guy being taken 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.620
 the water is high playing wp as it is 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.090
 seeing with hatred or knowing there the level of 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.100
 chinese trade 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.860
 so here's how the book begins to notice 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.030
 this same level of the row and I started to 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.400
 notice that it is because staff do not have 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.620
 opportunity to monitor also has 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.480
 many do not have a Brazilian forum like 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.370
 I have looking ahead tranquility 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.690
 before it exists because the whole world 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.669
 that it can have a community in 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.500
 English to everyone Brazilians 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.050
 are part of it, it's no use here 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.910
 allegedly weather is mild but .vbp 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.540
 no one likes to see anything 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.090
 practically opposite 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.440
 so the comments of the 76 pages 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.600
 when someone is speaking ill of the other 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.070
 but when you have any comments this 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.130
 I do not have anything 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.070
 So the tip is all folks, guys, the rain. 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.570
 Guilty knows he has the focus myself 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.370
 I created a guitar, I said now I 'm 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.920
 trying to focus on helping the 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.990
 people that improve so do not have 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.610
 in any oil producer 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.130
 and 500 km2 in 2007 that 1,800 km 590 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.530
 nothing was just saying its the ranking is the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.920
 even the pirate mine for everyone and 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.200
 including the likes and the rest type 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.330
 Who does she have a lilac daughter? 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.370
 the guy has one nowadays and the game is 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.500
 so rare that it's good to close a shaman 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.670
 brook is keeping mental is more 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.970
 easy of my car 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.780
 So I found it a little bit, you tell me what? 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.160
 do you think that 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.010
 I think the environment really helps me 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.600
 I do not think because because it 's under there gives 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.190
 some traffic on the channel being 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.450
 accompanied that mustache and let's 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.620
 Talking let's make an improvement in 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.130
 brazilian community 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.130
 a hug
