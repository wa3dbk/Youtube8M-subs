00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 recently have become very 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.350
 popular survival programs 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.450
 then two digital americans live 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.670
 jungle something else englishman 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.440
 land on the island absolute there 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.389
 by foot 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 survives and lives 60 days but I 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.279
 I remember a completely different Englishman a and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.310
 on their gear to survive at any cost 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.789
 and today we have a bear knife on the review 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.240
 grylls 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 from the very same survive and la veto knife 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.330
 gerber 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.330
 forum chef knife 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.859
 yes for the match for 1 nick the castle is 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.930
 them parts of the handle a little tight 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.559
 him as for me it is more reliable 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.769
 treatment 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.920
 rather than a lock with the top and therefore 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.049
 how he wears out pretty quickly 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.079
 plastic rubberized top handle 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.420
 orange grip quite comfortable as 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.280
 ordinary and back then 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.740
 hardened steel have a very difficult 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.630
 name c r17 well, it does not matter 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.729
 its main feature is the series 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.530
 tare blade due to which you can 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.119
 cut the rope of the rope of the tree and so on 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.840
 descents and large occupy most of 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.369
 blades 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:32.979
 there is also a gerbera logo and 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:35.440
 Bear Grylls signature and could have been on the OS 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.950
 but what will it be in after our test 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.450
 you will see 1 with a raiter on i believe in first 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.440
 the queue is designed for cutting 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.929
 any ropes 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:52.989
 or small branches as you can see with your 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:02:00.489
 the task he copes well but 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:02:03.720
 the tip of the blade cuts no worse now 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:03.720
 check the knife on the tree 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.670
 dad carlo 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.650
 in this world as you see, or 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.620
 left a little bit just on 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.690
 left side axis but I don't think that's 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.170
 a big problem 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.040
 but because I'm so strong 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.650
 cola corrected 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:07.160
 everything is fine grip grip after 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.160
 blows intact no backlash anything 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.680
 look yes all videos 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:35.600
 no chips even stuck in the ground a little 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:41.560
 a little scratched but you are all 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:44.440
 normal shoes on the butt dirt 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:50.810
 nothing after such blows 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:54.400
 backlash window handle no all ok yes 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.400
 strict and for a snack 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.870
 taste 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.700
 new with a pity don't eat it 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.670
 unsafe love open test 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.170
 tin cans knife did not pass on the blade 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.959
 small chips appeared 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.730
 but it can be sharpened after our 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.860
 harsh experiments i'm completely 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.710
 pleased with this knife there is no 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.290
 damage to the handle there is no backlash 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.330
 but the only one blunted a little 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:37.720
 blade but it can be sharpened 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:50.110
 how big are the paper he tears a little lived 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:54.450
 But smog does not pass, he tears 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.830
 paper rips like a dildo 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.200
 whole as a survival knife can i 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.330
 fully recommend of course there is 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.580
 small chips when working with metal 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.380
 but the price is $ 50 at all 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.390
 insignificant for such a quality 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.760
 knife which is under extreme loads 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.860
 stays fully functional 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.020
 able she have it all with you was 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.360
 Alexander Peace is not the channel of plowshares 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.290
 subscribe put likes to all good luck 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.290
 bye Bye 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.250
 otherwise it seems to me 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.159
 we no longer lead gerberas to test for 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.840
 ointment money although macheto chopping wood is not 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.060
 as easy as an ax and yes it is 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.490
 opportunity therefore match the bear 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.969
 grylls proved she is a good color for 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.969
 survive
