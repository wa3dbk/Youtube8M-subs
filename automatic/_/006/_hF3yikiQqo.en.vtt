two<00:01:21.960> minutes<00:01:22.170> after<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.530> break<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:23.670> was

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
two minutes after the break there was

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.890 
two minutes after the break there was
only<00:01:23.820> one<00:01:24.090> winner<00:01:24.380> leads<00:01:25.380> didn't<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.250> look

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
only one winner leads didn't really look

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
only one winner leads didn't really look
capable<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.229> coming<00:01:28.530> back<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:28.890> them<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.460> any

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
capable of coming back at them at any

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.880 
capable of coming back at them at any
stage<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.420> lead<00:01:30.600> Graham<00:01:30.869> possibly<00:01:31.740> made

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
stage I think lead Graham possibly made

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.760 
stage I think lead Graham possibly made
one<00:01:32.130> brave<00:01:32.460> block<00:01:32.850> throughout<00:01:33.240> 90<00:01:33.720> minutes<00:01:33.960> so

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
one brave block throughout 90 minutes so

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.100 
one brave block throughout 90 minutes so
all<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.400> thoroughly<00:01:35.880> deserved<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.810> say

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
