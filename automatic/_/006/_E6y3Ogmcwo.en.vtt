entire design around it some of you is

00:02:38.519 --> 00:03:06.470 
entire design around it some of you is
actually<00:02:39.030> suggest<00:02:39.510> doing<00:02:39.750> this

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.449 

if<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.989> arms<00:03:07.319> could<00:03:07.530> tuck<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.129> little<00:03:08.370> bit

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.490 
if the arms could tuck in a little bit
more<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:09.390> would<00:03:09.569> actually<00:03:09.690> look<00:03:10.200> pretty

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
more this would actually look pretty

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.869 
more this would actually look pretty
good<00:03:10.849> but<00:03:11.849> as<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.120> stands<00:03:12.680> it's<00:03:13.760> nothing<00:03:14.760> to

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
good but as it stands it's nothing to

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.309 
good but as it stands it's nothing to
get<00:03:15.000> excited<00:03:15.150> about<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:18.150> recolor<00:03:18.629> and<00:03:18.900> retool

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
now the ball joints are fixable but they

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.249 
now the ball joints are fixable but they
shouldn't<00:06:12.029> have<00:06:12.149> to<00:06:12.539> be<00:06:12.689> fixed<00:06:15.259> interestingly
