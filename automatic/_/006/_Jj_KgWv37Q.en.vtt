00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.630
 exists your first appears in public to 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.970
 maria de villota we have not seen it more 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.209
 that smile I do not know if the smile or the 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.650
 smiles are the best safe medicine and 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.959
 I have not done on purpose I think from 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.080
 small was very cheerful I always have 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:21.400
 been in formula 1 do not smile so much no 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.400
 they'll think you 're in line 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.510
 and actually today, you see that we are not going 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.510
 to drive 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.600
 uniform know what we do not 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.340
 I have not even gotten in this car 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.860
 that we are going to overturn 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.020
 fantastic they are going to overturn me we put the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 ball on the plate 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.010
 here to add a little more 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.960
 difficulty I have prepared a slalom for 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
 that you see it with the car that leads to bs 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.670
 you are going to come to approximately 65 or 70 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.320
 kilometers per hour and in the cones 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 yellows that I'm going to ask to stop as much 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.300
 strong you can however with the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.280
 car without abs you'll see that doing what 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.590
 same braking everything you can with the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 same pressure when you get that point 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.170
 from there despite turning the steering wheel you 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.170
 will do 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.850
 I have prepared for you to have a water 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.470
 planning in all conditions of what 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.420
 it's about that you have prepared a track 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.460
 withdrawal of these that you will have the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.830
 hands that more than several have grass 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.830
 well placed on the steering wheel because it's not going 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.560
 to be easy and then he proposed and now 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.330
 so you can see that the car is already 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.030
 well with benefits this post a 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.659
 slam 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.369
 1 2 and 3 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.369
 It is a bit which is nothing more we do not go bad 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.200
 good perfect that good fantastic and in 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 champions 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.670
 but how do you think but with your hand 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.670
 as we said at the door 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.750
 Do not try to break in life just like 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.780
 even if you do strength with your legs, 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.780
 you would still try to burst this 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.080
 well we do not know the brand 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.879
 and a crystal made it impossible however 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.409
 that same blow the one on the side what 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.409
 we would have totally busted 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.990
 good 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.530
 incredible and universities 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.440
 is that this one was really 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.220
 there is new believe and maybe a pussy can not 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.070
 be good the days at the wheel 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.400
 I think I 'm going to split because I'm going to 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.400
 win 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.440
 ah 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.150
 ah 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.800
 from the first time I was here 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.650
 piloting a little fire 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.920
 I was 14 years old when my reference arrived 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.080
 was to get to the pedals 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.540
 you can not see that every time you need more 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.849
 track is losing more trajectory 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.050
 needs to stop stopping more and even seen 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.790
 the body swinging more hands and 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.190
 especially be very attentive position to 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.580
 You already know three parallel hands 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.770
 minus fourth nothing to take it here 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.870
 and you want me to tell you but it does not seduce 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.640
 nothing the cookie movement we carry to 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.660
 the whole family in the car and you have to 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.120
 monitor the pressures because 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.010
 question us with equal 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.780
 and if we saw the side of doubts 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.659
 we would see that little by little all this part 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.599
 from here you would start to spend it with 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:13.580
 that the tire is not supposed to be 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.580
 stepping correctly and the benefits 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.570
 and these devices that do not know much 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.700
 but rafa I think are important 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.560
 carry in the car to be able to burst 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.060
 one of the side windows as we said 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.910
 in case you have to go down then 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.920
 we have a lot to contribute I'm sure 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.230
 that all drivers are going to 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.230
 enjoy because a driving 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.730
 the detail is that taste of life like that 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.730
 what
