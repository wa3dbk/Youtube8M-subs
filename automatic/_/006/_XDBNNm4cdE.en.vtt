bucking a lot of energy a good live show

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.350 
bucking a lot of energy a good live show
good<00:02:46.350> songs<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.950> people<00:02:47.100> could<00:02:47.400> get<00:02:47.550> into<00:02:48.030> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
good songs that people could get into a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.870 
good songs that people could get into a
certain<00:02:48.570> age<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.410> authenticity<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.550> really

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
certain age and authenticity is really

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.000 
certain age and authenticity is really
important<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.020> it's<00:02:52.050> sort<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.320> balancing<00:02:52.860> all

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
important so it's sort of balancing all

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.300 
important so it's sort of balancing all
of<00:02:53.130> those<00:02:53.220> factors<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.000> I'd<00:02:54.450> really<00:02:54.630> been

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
of those factors I think I'd really been

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.750 
of those factors I think I'd really been
able<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.580> communicate<00:02:57.210> with<00:02:57.720> an<00:02:57.840> audience<00:02:58.760> not

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
able to communicate with an audience not

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.000 
able to communicate with an audience not
in<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.030> sense<00:03:00.240> of<00:03:00.510> talking<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.560> them<00:03:01.680> between

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
in a sense of talking to them between

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.590 
in a sense of talking to them between
the<00:03:02.280> songs<00:03:02.550> or<00:03:02.880> anything<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.330> that

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
the songs or anything like that

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.450 
the songs or anything like that
