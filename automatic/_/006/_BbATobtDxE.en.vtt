he is a short tail Python breeder which
is<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.660> bit<00:00:07.200> different<00:00:07.560> than<00:00:07.649> blood<00:00:07.890> pythons<00:00:08.340> he

can you tell me a little bit about the

can you tell me a little bit about the
Serra<00:00:21.750> wax<00:00:22.699> interest<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.789> think<00:00:23.820> right<00:00:24.090> now

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
Serra wax interest I think right now

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.370 
Serra wax interest I think right now
it's<00:00:24.359> air<00:00:24.539> wax<00:00:24.779> even<00:00:25.109> though<00:00:25.199> they're<00:00:25.350> not

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it's air wax even though they're not

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.589 
it's air wax even though they're not
considered<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> separate<00:00:26.580> species<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.449> of

considered a separate species because of

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.210 
considered a separate species because of
the<00:00:27.689> uniqueness<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.260> them<00:00:28.410> they're<00:00:28.920> actually

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the uniqueness of them they're actually

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.500 
the uniqueness of them they're actually
probably<00:00:29.340> rarer<00:00:29.730> than<00:00:30.029> some<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> other

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
probably rarer than some of the other

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
complex pattern on them as well they

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.899 
complex pattern on them as well they
definitely<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:16.080> low<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.799> very<00:01:17.010> robust<00:01:17.549> like

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
definitely get low for very robust like

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.060 
definitely get low for very robust like
short<00:01:18.270> le<00:01:18.510> would<00:01:18.930> expect<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.650> they<00:01:19.800> tend<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
short le would expect but they tend to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
short le would expect but they tend to
be<00:01:20.159> actually<00:01:20.970> even<00:01:21.180> more<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.659> little<00:01:21.960> bit<00:01:21.990> more

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
be actually even more a little bit more

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.010 
be actually even more a little bit more
robust<00:01:22.680> than<00:01:22.890> even<00:01:23.190> my<00:01:23.250> audios<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.270> I've<00:01:24.900> been

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
robust than even my audios so I've been

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
robust than even my audios so I've been
working<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.350> since<00:01:25.619> nineteen<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.159> never

are other short tails I should say and

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
are other short tails I should say and
you<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.530> sort<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.100> niche<00:01:35.280> thing<00:01:35.610> it's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
you know it's sort of a niche thing it's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.249 
you know it's sort of a niche thing it's
not<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> group<00:01:36.330> they're<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.720> colorful<00:01:37.229> as

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
definitely something they're worthwhile

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.040 
definitely something they're worthwhile

that<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.480> Garbi<00:02:12.989> line<00:02:13.170> tends<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.739> little

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
that the Garbi line tends to be a little

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.800 
that the Garbi line tends to be a little
temperamental<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.360> there's<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.690> big

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
temperamental so there's the big

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.900 
temperamental so there's the big
difference<00:02:16.230> between<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.769> two<00:02:16.799> there's<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.790> bit

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
difference between the two there's a bit

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.360 
difference between the two there's a bit

adam2<00:02:34.290> which<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.740> one<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> things<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.310> I

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
adam2 which is one of the things that I

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.550 
adam2 which is one of the things that I
find<00:02:35.640> appealing<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.630> hard<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.960> show<00:02:37.170> exactly

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
find appealing it's hard to show exactly

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.840 
find appealing it's hard to show exactly
what<00:02:37.830> they<00:02:37.920> look<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.130> when<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.550> look<00:02:38.670> at<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
what they look like when you look at a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.880 
what they look like when you look at a
little<00:02:39.150> one<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.840> adults<00:02:40.260> once<00:02:40.620> really

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
little one that the adults once really

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.040 
little one that the adults once really
really<00:02:41.190> starting<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.550> darken<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.270> it's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
really starting to darken up and it's

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.650 
really starting to darken up and it's
the<00:02:43.860> difference<00:02:44.040> between<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.700> gold<00:02:45.330> color

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
the difference between the gold color

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.660 
the difference between the gold color
and<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.380> really<00:02:46.650> dark<00:02:46.890> chocolate<00:02:47.340> there's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
and the really dark chocolate there's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.080 
and the really dark chocolate there's
what<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:47.940> think<00:02:48.300> makes<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.720> stand<00:02:49.260> out<00:02:49.610> now<00:02:50.610> we

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
what I think makes it stand out now we

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.670 
what I think makes it stand out now we
have<00:02:51.240> quitted<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.050> always<00:02:52.320> called<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
think we're finally getting over the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.290 
think we're finally getting over the
stereotype<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.610> short<00:02:59.820> tails<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.240> the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
stereotype of the short tails in the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.360 
stereotype of the short tails in the
Bloods<00:03:00.540> being<00:03:00.960> nasty<00:03:01.200> snakes<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.250> we're

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
Bloods being nasty snakes I think we're

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.320 
Bloods being nasty snakes I think we're
starting<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.640> see<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:03.060> mean<00:03:03.180> there's

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
starting to see it I mean there's

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.360 
starting to see it I mean there's
certainly<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.630> lot<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.930> people<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.320> are<00:03:04.440> more

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
certainly a lot of people that are more

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.400 
certainly a lot of people that are more
open<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.760> actually<00:03:06.240> handling<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.050> Bloods<00:03:07.290> the
