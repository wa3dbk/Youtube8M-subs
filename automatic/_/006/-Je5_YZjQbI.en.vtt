it's called Jacobson's organ and that's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.670 
it's called Jacobson's organ and that's
where<00:00:39.329> they<00:00:39.450> draw<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.690> scene<00:00:39.989> through<00:00:40.290> and

where they draw the scene through and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.810 
where they draw the scene through and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
then the brain and obviously form

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.510 
then the brain and obviously form
recognition<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> then<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> future<00:00:47.399> when

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
recognition and then in the future when

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.000 
recognition and then in the future when
