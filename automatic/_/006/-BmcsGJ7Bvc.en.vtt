removed<00:00:43.770> okay<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.340> there's<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.789> little

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
removed okay so there's a little

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119

drawback<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.690> only<00:00:45.809> put<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.110> once<00:00:46.350> but

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
drawback you can only put it on once but

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.990 
drawback you can only put it on once but
I<00:00:47.160> mean<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.899> boosts<00:00:48.899> everything<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.920> let's<00:00:50.670> get

I mean it boosts everything so let's get
it<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:51.600> now<00:00:54.949> okay
