00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
around like that I'm not going to be

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.540 
around like that I'm not going to be
resting<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.540> like<00:01:35.720> this<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:37.100> gives<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.399> very

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
resting it like this it gives you a very

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.749 
resting it like this it gives you a very
tight<00:01:37.970> detail<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:39.590> is<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:40.009> whole<00:01:40.399> arm

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
tight detail this is a whole arm

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:49.300 
tight detail this is a whole arm
movement<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:44.050> here<00:01:45.050> I<00:01:45.080> go<00:01:48.009> pop<00:01:49.009> in

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
movement and it's here I go pop in

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.389 
movement and it's here I go pop in
there's<00:01:50.180> that<00:01:50.360> little<00:01:50.630> few<00:01:50.990> guidelines<00:01:51.320> here

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.850 

during<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.670> Frog<00:01:56.119> I<00:01:56.330> saw<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:56.720> other<00:01:57.050> day<00:01:57.380> just

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
during the Frog I saw the other day just

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.320 
during the Frog I saw the other day just
to<00:01:58.009> make<00:01:58.160> sure<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.460> fits<00:01:58.789> in<00:01:59.149> you<00:02:00.940> gonna<00:02:01.940> start

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
to make sure it fits in you gonna start

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.940 
to make sure it fits in you gonna start
with

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.550 

because<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.130> stuff<00:02:08.460> is<00:02:08.840> almost<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.229> using

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
because this stuff is almost like using

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.410 
because this stuff is almost like using
an<00:02:10.890> int<00:02:12.140> it's<00:02:15.320> just<00:02:16.320> putting<00:02:16.590> down<00:02:16.620> very

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
an int it's just putting down very

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.050 
an int it's just putting down very
gentle<00:02:19.490> guidelines<00:02:20.490> like<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:23.310> then

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
gentle guidelines like this and then

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.750 
gentle guidelines like this and then
it's<00:02:24.210> about<00:02:25.790> being<00:02:26.790> bold<00:02:27.210> with<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:31.760> don't

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
it's about being bold with this I don't

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.730 
it's about being bold with this I don't
say<00:02:32.880> nice<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.090> lot<00:02:33.360> holding<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.960> too<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:40.410> good

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
say nice a lot holding it too so good

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.940 
say nice a lot holding it too so good
being<00:02:40.980> timid<00:02:41.280> when<00:02:41.520> you're<00:02:41.760> using<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.209> stuff

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
being timid when you're using this stuff

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:51.230 
being timid when you're using this stuff
and<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:44.240> probably<00:02:45.240> more<00:02:46.140> careful<00:02:49.910> then<00:02:50.910> you

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
and be probably more careful then you

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.720 
and be probably more careful then you
can<00:02:51.390> see<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.780> froggy<00:02:52.230> shape<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:54.020> take<00:02:55.020> place

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
this very very slowly just putting

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.350 
this very very slowly just putting
the<00:05:01.200> final<00:05:01.380> touches<00:05:01.650> on<00:05:02.130> this<00:05:02.280> now<00:05:02.520> usually

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
the final touches on this now usually

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.430 
the final touches on this now usually
putting<00:05:03.900> in<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.169> dark<00:05:04.980> bits<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:07.200> great

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
putting in the dark bits and the great

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.780 
putting in the dark bits and the great
thing<00:05:07.650> about<00:05:07.680> track<00:05:08.130> though<00:05:08.340> is<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:08.760> can

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
thing about track though is that you can

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.690 
thing about track though is that you can
go<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:09.330> really<00:05:10.110> done<00:05:11.870> where<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:12.930> has<00:05:13.700> slight

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
go to really done where it has slight

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.250 
go to really done where it has slight
visual<00:05:15.300> advantage<00:05:15.870> over<00:05:16.110> pencil<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.960> that's

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
visual advantage over pencil and that's

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.100 
visual advantage over pencil and that's
probably<00:05:19.910> much<00:05:20.910> more<00:05:21.180> graphic<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.930> get

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
probably much more graphic and get

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.740 
probably much more graphic and get
really<00:05:22.350> nice<00:05:22.500> blacks<00:05:23.070> rest<00:05:23.790> of<00:05:23.940> pencil<00:05:24.419> you

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
really nice blacks rest of pencil you

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.840 
really nice blacks rest of pencil you
get<00:05:25.110> so<00:05:25.320> a<00:05:25.350> darker<00:05:25.950> shade<00:05:26.220> of<00:05:26.250> gray<00:05:27.210> usually

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
get so a darker shade of gray usually

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:37.060 
get so a darker shade of gray usually

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
it's good you're gonna have to frame it

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.659 
it's good you're gonna have to frame it
I<00:05:57.960> suppose<00:05:58.350> you<00:05:58.530> could<00:05:58.770> store<00:05:59.100> it<00:05:59.280> by<00:05:59.430> putting

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
I suppose you could store it by putting

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.990 
I suppose you could store it by putting
a<00:05:59.790> bit<00:05:59.910> of<00:06:00.000> tissue<00:06:00.180> paper<00:06:00.360> over<00:06:01.080> it

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
a bit of tissue paper over it

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.540 
a bit of tissue paper over it
as<00:06:03.000> I<00:06:03.180> say<00:06:03.390> you<00:06:03.450> know<00:06:03.630> yeah<00:06:04.229> a<00:06:04.260> fixative<00:06:04.800> can<00:06:05.220> of

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
as I say you know yeah a fixative can of

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.870 
as I say you know yeah a fixative can of
some<00:06:05.760> sort<00:06:06.120> some<00:06:06.450> art<00:06:06.660> fixative<00:06:07.200> varnish<00:06:08.010> it

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
some sort some art fixative varnish it

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.510 
some sort some art fixative varnish it
might<00:06:09.090> sort<00:06:09.360> of<00:06:09.450> stop<00:06:09.780> it<00:06:09.900> from<00:06:10.080> smudging<00:06:10.520> but

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
might sort of stop it from smudging but

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.690 
might sort of stop it from smudging but
apart<00:06:11.820> from<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.090> smudging<00:06:12.570> it's<00:06:13.410> really<00:06:14.010> an

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
apart from the smudging it's really an

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.750 
apart from the smudging it's really an
awesome<00:06:14.970> medium<00:06:15.630> to<00:06:15.780> use<00:06:16.400> I'll<00:06:17.400> see<00:06:17.610> you<00:06:17.729> next
