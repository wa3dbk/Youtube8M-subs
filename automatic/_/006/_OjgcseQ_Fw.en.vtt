00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.680

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.619

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.050
 At the beginning of the week there were still rumors 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.310
 that the new us series is a short fun 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.380
 could be and a little later 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.780
 fox not only confirms the return of 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.760

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.010
 series will come back with six consequences 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.110

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.240
 familiar faces in front and behind the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.760

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.020
 2002 at fox in 1998 and 2008 came 28 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.820
 ticks movie in the cinema 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.590

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.200
 not yet 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.700
 I still know a little bit here 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.930

 not any but in 1080p 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.040
 Wesley lets you drop the bar 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.390
 for unnecessarily complicated dax speed runs 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.310
 continue to screw upwards 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.690
 as it is the guy the bright one 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.790
 A hard farewell from a while already 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.820
 played through with guitar hero guitar 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.860
 has and his new challenge it still and 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.270
 more practical and somehow namely 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.430
 this time it is the use 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.140
 control over bongos more precisely the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.209
 bongos with donkey konga 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.070
 music plays but no problem 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.780
 he only has beer for his speed run 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.120
 needed nearly five and a half hours and 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.950
 in which it also loud self-statement only 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.370
 died about 57 times 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.370
 good off 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.680
 June 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.860
 and now there's the best star wars 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.169
 movie he still sees this week 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.590
 happen to be star wars episode 4 5 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.080

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.610

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.810
 the little masterpiece worked that 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.550
 he has finally released and 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.650
 that's not just star wars out 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.419
 the perspective of the imperium of the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.819
 short film is based on the design 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.560
 from anime series from the 80s and 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.560
 looks absolutely out of it 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.020
 that was it again with the most important 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.520
 Gaming from me last week follows us
