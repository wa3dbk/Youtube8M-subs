challenge in driving because if you
looked<00:00:17.970> well<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.750> don't<00:00:18.840> discern<00:00:19.140> any<00:00:19.410> right

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
looked well you don't discern any right

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.330 
looked well you don't discern any right
here<00:00:20.210> but<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:21.359> are<00:00:21.390> big<00:00:22.170> cracks<00:00:22.470> some<00:00:23.250> of

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
here but there are big cracks some of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.140 
here but there are big cracks some of
them<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.609> like<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.970> big<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.539> big<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.880> some

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
them are like this big this big and some

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.169 
them are like this big this big and some
of<00:00:27.269> them<00:00:27.420> go<00:00:27.570> straight<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.439> road<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.179> your

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
of them go straight up the road and your

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.299 
of them go straight up the road and your
tire<00:00:30.420> wants<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.900> go<00:00:31.050> into<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:32.160> there's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
tire wants to go into it so well there's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:32.840 
tire wants to go into it so well there's
one<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.579> there

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
one right there

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.600 
one right there
and<00:00:33.440> it's<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:34.950> over<00:00:35.130> railroad

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and it's just like going over railroad

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.010 
and it's just like going over railroad
tracks<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> don't<00:00:36.329> want<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.540> bike<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.930> go

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
tracks so you don't want your bike to go

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.040 
tracks so you don't want your bike to go
into<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:38.489> got<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> keep<00:00:39.059> steering<00:00:39.390> away

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
into it so you got to keep steering away

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
into it so you got to keep steering away
from<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> crack<00:00:40.640> where's<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.850> friend

start<00:01:19.470> spinning<00:01:19.799> out<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.509> front

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
start spinning out because the front

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.420 
start spinning out because the front
tire<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:21.990> doing<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> has<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.310> when

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
tire is doing what it has to do when

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.940 
tire is doing what it has to do when
your<00:01:23.549> other<00:01:23.700> tires<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.630> crazy<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
your other tires are now going crazy and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.289 
your other tires are now going crazy and
they're<00:01:26.130> off<00:01:26.280> they're<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.610> over<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> place

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
they're off they're all over the place

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.249 
they're off they're all over the place
so<00:01:27.750> yeah<00:01:28.680> they're<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.070> ice<00:01:29.340> potholes<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
so yeah they're like ice potholes and I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.899 
so yeah they're like ice potholes and I
and<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.590> don't<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.890> studs<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.460> rear<00:01:32.640> tire

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
and I don't have studs in my rear tire

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.580 
and I don't have studs in my rear tire
it's<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.390> become<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> real<00:01:34.290> challenge

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it's it's become it's a real challenge

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.670 
it's it's become it's a real challenge
so<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.930> only<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.229> by<00:01:37.439> going

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
so I I just I can only do it by going

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.050 
so I I just I can only do it by going
slow<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.070> soon<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:38.640> over<00:01:39.020> about<00:01:41.060> 60

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
slow as soon as I go over about 60

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.819 
slow as soon as I go over about 60
kilometers<00:01:42.509> an<00:01:42.540> hour<00:01:42.720> my<00:01:43.079> rear<00:01:43.259> tire<00:01:43.530> breaks

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
kilometers an hour my rear tire breaks

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.789 
kilometers an hour my rear tire breaks
loose<00:01:44.100> even<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> snow<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> ice<00:01:46.530> my

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
loose even on the snow and on the ice my

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.399 
loose even on the snow and on the ice my
rear<00:01:46.979> tire<00:01:47.189> breaks<00:01:47.490> loose<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.409> 40

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
rear tire breaks loose at like 40

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.800 
rear tire breaks loose at like 40
kilometres<00:01:49.829> an<00:01:49.950> hour<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.340> less<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.390> learned

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
kilometres an hour or less so I learned

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.810 
kilometres an hour or less so I learned
our<00:01:51.960> fishtailing<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.040> definitely

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
our fishtailing so it's definitely

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.700 
our fishtailing so it's definitely
getting<00:01:54.000> good<00:01:54.360> studs<00:01:54.750> yeah<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.409> gonna<00:01:55.619> be

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
getting good studs yeah that's gonna be

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.090 
getting good studs yeah that's gonna be
the<00:01:55.950> trick<00:01:56.899> if<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.079> were<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.439> again<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the trick if I were to do this again I

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.760 
the trick if I were to do this again I
would<00:01:59.549> experiment<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.750> different<00:02:01.560> stud

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
would experiment with a different stud

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.969 
would experiment with a different stud
solution<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.460> think<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.820> would<00:02:02.969> take<00:02:03.979> really

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
solution I think I would take really

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.900 
solution I think I would take really
good<00:02:05.340> ice<00:02:05.520> ice<00:02:06.000> studs<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.110> put<00:02:07.979> them<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.280> just

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
good ice ice studs and put them on just

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.999 
good ice ice studs and put them on just
add<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> Dempster<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.679> guy<00:02:10.830> was

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
add the Dempster like that guy was

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.450 
add the Dempster like that guy was
telling<00:02:11.340> us<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.610> ego<00:02:12.150> play

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
telling us that ego play

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.760 
telling us that ego play
and<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.940> would<00:02:13.120> use<00:02:13.300> these<00:02:13.600> studs<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.530> have

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
and I would use these studs that I have

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.160 
and I would use these studs that I have
I<00:02:15.070> just<00:02:15.670> put<00:02:15.790> them<00:02:15.910> on<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.090> bike<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.390> get<00:02:16.510> up<00:02:16.690> to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
I just put them on the bike to get up to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.300 
I just put them on the bike to get up to
the<00:02:17.260> Dempster<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.800> know<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.010> could<00:02:18.160> hurt

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the Dempster you know it could hurt

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.850
