00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:14.990
 hello you see right here the acer 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:17.210
 aspire s3 an ultrabook from acer like that 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.710
 It looks like I'll go right back 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.380
 rum I show you again directly all 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.140
 connections that are especially hidden 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.990
 So are right on 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.090
 here on the right side we see 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.369
 Here, first of all, nothing but first 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.190
 It is surprising that we have one 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.670
 combined microphone headset port as well 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.440
 I under the sd-card slot with 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.020
 cover provided that no dirt 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.270
 come in hope you see that here 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.309
 we can do that a little better now 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.860
 All times again and go further we 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.360
 have on the front except for here 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.879
 the power button that hides here 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.460
 two more leds power button on the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.329
 front one can ask oneself now 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.469
 why an ultrabook i can give you 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.140
 Also do not say what he is doing 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:11.720
 thought but they are very 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.250
 set differently with the connections 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.210
 because we have on the right side 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.670
 no connection 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.610
 we have only one dvd multi here 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.439
 burner and cd rom drive quasi and 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.420
 on the back since we did because 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.100
 finally we have our connections 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:35.060
 kensington lock lan network connection 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 hdmi port two usb 3.0 ports one of them 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.390
 with power usb function and of course 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.030
 Here then also the power plug connection 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.900
 and a fan exit yes that was it 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.400
 then actually with me again 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.570
 Connection options here on the acer 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.420
 nonetheless, I show 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.670
 you still how it looks inside so there 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.710
 but then it's a bit more 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.000
 cleaned up so we have the tig of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.060
 keyboard we have the touchpad and me 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.479
 somehow miss a few more leds 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.030
 me here 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.619
 so you can see what's going on 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.410
 Of course we have the front here but the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.740
 you do not see so well from here then 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.860
 that's what I think is nice 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.920
 really nice display so we have 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.680
 an off buried as one of 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.830
 is used to other manufacturers 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.600
 actually I would be very very 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.920
 well, you know what happens 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.960
 something you poorer fat than because 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.730
 a bit more and we almost have 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:40.400
 no frame her yes lit 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.200
 keyboard we also tried the times 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.990
 to turn on here is now running linux 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.820
 I'll just show you that 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.760
 illuminated keyboard hereby 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.210
 Turn off keyboard lighting 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.220
 here with fn and f 9 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:59.900
 actually yes because you see it to also 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.910
 off on and do not be fooled 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.180
 from the startscreen here that is linux 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.020
 boot is not that important now 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.240
 me and what you can still recognize 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.700
 the first impression of this almost 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.870
 Frameless display is deceptive for that 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.990
 Display will start after one 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.330
 black bars on so if this is so 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.570
 you can see well here is display 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.300
 rand and here is display so this 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.220
 Dark darker black is not a display 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.730
 He just has my hand there 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.590
 then a trick is allowed and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.490
 Do not be so convinced with that 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.480
 display and the first look 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:50.350
 We have 15 inches with a resolution 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:53.390
 of 1366 x 768 16 9 format 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.900
 otherwise what else do we have to say 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.510
 The battery has been installed here has one 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.570
 capacity of 4850 milliamp hours 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.820
 and should be up to eight hours, according to Acer 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.209
 keep up 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:11.150
 the whole device weighs 105 kilo is so 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.740
 not too light but not too 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.300
 heavy 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.980
 I do not even know if it as 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.660
 Ultrabooks I do not expect anything 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.280
 say wrong but I think so too 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.780
 no sticker so i think but it 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.580
 is not an ultrabook it does not work as 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.800
 hamburg I apologize for this 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.540
 Said and hope you see her after 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.790
 that I'm not so good 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.770
 I just informed me that really does 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.380
 suffering 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.450
 Nevertheless, I thank you for 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.990
 to look and hope you have it 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.330
 like 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.330
 until next time ciao
