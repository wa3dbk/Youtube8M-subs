involved with it's not a very expensive
program<00:05:33.319> I<00:05:33.560> think<00:05:34.250> it's<00:05:34.400> under<00:05:34.550> a<00:05:34.639> hundred

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
program I think it's under a hundred

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.670 
program I think it's under a hundred
dollars<00:05:35.240> for<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.569> the<00:05:35.779> basic<00:05:36.199> I<00:05:36.379> think<00:05:36.560> it's

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
dollars for the the basic I think it's

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.550 
dollars for the the basic I think it's
called<00:05:36.860> red<00:05:37.159> I<00:05:37.400> don't<00:05:38.330> think<00:05:38.750> it's<00:05:38.900> red<00:05:39.080> at<00:05:39.319> any

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
called red I don't think it's red at any
