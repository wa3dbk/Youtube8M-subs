00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
very long arm holes so I paired it with

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.699 
very long arm holes so I paired it with
a<00:02:12.940> green<00:02:13.300> tank<00:02:13.600> top<00:02:13.660> underneath<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:14.350> like

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
switch it up a little bit and I found

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.790

this<00:02:18.700> maxi<00:02:19.180> skirt<00:02:19.510> with<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> solid<00:02:20.260> black<00:02:20.500> line

this maxi skirt with a solid black line
down<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> side<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.910> saw<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.090> picture

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
down the side and if you saw the picture

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.210

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
black line down the side so I thought it

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.170

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.180 

the<00:02:43.660> fourth<00:02:44.019> outfit<00:02:44.380> was<00:02:44.560> inspired<00:02:44.590> by<00:02:45.130> this

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
the fourth outfit was inspired by this

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.030 
the fourth outfit was inspired by this
picture<00:02:45.670> from<00:02:45.880> season<00:02:46.330> 3<00:02:46.569> episode<00:02:47.050> 21<00:02:47.560> out<00:02:47.950> of

picture from season 3 episode 21 out of
sight<00:02:48.370> out<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.610> mind<00:02:48.940> as<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:49.989> see<00:02:50.170> she<00:02:50.350> was

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
sight out of mind as you can see she was

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.920 
sight out of mind as you can see she was
wearing<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.830> very<00:02:51.069> bold<00:02:51.310> green<00:02:51.910> skull<00:02:52.450> top<00:02:52.690> and

wearing a very bold green skull top and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.780 
wearing a very bold green skull top and
I<00:02:53.170> already<00:02:53.290> had<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.680> black<00:02:54.100> skull<00:02:54.400> top<00:02:54.580> in

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
I already had this black skull top in

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.920 
I already had this black skull top in
the<00:02:54.850> closet<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.450> thought<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.780> would<00:02:55.900> work

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
the closet so I thought it would work

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.440 
the closet so I thought it would work
perfectly<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.860> paired<00:02:57.610> mine<00:02:57.790> with<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.060> some

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
perfectly I paired mine with just some

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.150 
perfectly I paired mine with just some
white<00:02:58.630> jeggings<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.350> then<00:02:59.650> some<00:02:59.950> black

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
white jeggings and then some black

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.340 
white jeggings and then some black
combat<00:03:00.549> boots<00:03:00.819> for<00:03:01.450> jewelry<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.870> was<00:03:02.049> having<00:03:02.290> a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
combat boots for jewelry I was having a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.690 
combat boots for jewelry I was having a
hard<00:03:02.530> time<00:03:02.590> seeing<00:03:02.950> what<00:03:03.190> she<00:03:03.370> was<00:03:03.519> wearing

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
hard time seeing what she was wearing

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.490 
hard time seeing what she was wearing
but<00:03:04.209> I'm<00:03:04.360> pretty<00:03:04.660> sure<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.049> was<00:03:05.170> just<00:03:05.200> some

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
but I'm pretty sure it was just some

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.100 
but I'm pretty sure it was just some
hoop<00:03:05.920> earrings<00:03:06.340> with<00:03:06.579> some<00:03:06.910> like<00:03:07.239> dangly

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
hoop earrings with some like dangly

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.530 
hoop earrings with some like dangly
metal<00:03:08.530> strands<00:03:08.890> off<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.340> them<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:10.209> just

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
metal strands off of them so I just

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.880 
metal strands off of them so I just
grabbed<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.900> closest<00:03:11.260> thing<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.590> had<00:03:11.860> in

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
grabbed the closest thing that I had in

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:27.959 
grabbed the closest thing that I had in
my<00:03:12.400> wardrobe<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:13.090> match<00:03:13.269> it

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:27.969 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.489 

the<00:03:28.969> next<00:03:29.269> look<00:03:29.389> came<00:03:29.629> from<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.109> picture

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:30.499 
the next look came from this picture

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.099 
the next look came from this picture
from<00:03:30.739> season<00:03:31.159> 2<00:03:31.310> episode<00:03:31.849> 24<00:03:32.450> if<00:03:32.659> these<00:03:32.840> dolls

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
from season 2 episode 24 if these dolls

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.559 
from season 2 episode 24 if these dolls
could<00:03:33.349> talk<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.829> really<00:03:34.670> love<00:03:34.849> this<00:03:34.969> look<00:03:35.329> not

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
could talk I really love this look not

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.940 
could talk I really love this look not
just<00:03:35.780> because<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.079> think<00:03:36.139> it<00:03:36.349> came<00:03:36.530> out<00:03:36.650> really

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
just because I think it came out really

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.619 
just because I think it came out really
similar<00:03:37.280> but<00:03:37.430> because<00:03:38.000> it's<00:03:38.180> something<00:03:38.510> I

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
similar but because it's something I

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.539 
similar but because it's something I
would<00:03:38.689> definitely<00:03:39.260> wear<00:03:39.439> I<00:03:39.680> found<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.370> same

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
would definitely wear I found the same

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.399 
would definitely wear I found the same
slip<00:03:40.819> that<00:03:40.969> she<00:03:41.030> wore<00:03:41.299> in<00:03:41.389> this<00:03:41.510> episode<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.230> I

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
slip that she wore in this episode and I

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.559 
slip that she wore in this episode and I
paired<00:03:42.739> mine<00:03:42.920> over<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.459> plain<00:03:43.790> black<00:03:44.030> t-shirt

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
paired mine over a plain black t-shirt

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.300 
paired mine over a plain black t-shirt
and<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.989> black<00:03:45.230> body<00:03:45.500> con<00:03:45.799> skirt

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
and a black body con skirt

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.280 
and a black body con skirt
I<00:03:46.340> think<00:03:46.819> hers<00:03:47.030> was<00:03:47.269> just<00:03:47.299> over<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> black

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
I think hers was just over a black

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.530 
I think hers was just over a black
one-piece<00:03:48.769> dress<00:03:49.129> but<00:03:49.639> obviously<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.239> really

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
one-piece dress but obviously you really

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.940 
one-piece dress but obviously you really
can't<00:03:50.749> tell<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:50.989> difference<00:03:51.109> with<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.739> slip

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
can't tell the difference with the slip

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.909 
can't tell the difference with the slip
over<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.400> I<00:03:52.719> then<00:03:53.719> added<00:03:53.959> on<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> full<00:03:54.739> leather

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
over it I then added on a full leather

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.069 
over it I then added on a full leather
bomber<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.609> medallion<00:03:56.150> style<00:03:56.450> necklace<00:03:56.870> and
