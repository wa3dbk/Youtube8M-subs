what you want to do the other end is the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.049 
what you want to do the other end is the
light<00:00:55.260> source<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> laser<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
light source not a laser just a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.229 
light source not a laser just a
fiber-optic<00:00:57.960> light<00:00:58.379> source<00:00:58.910> you<00:00:59.910> want<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
fiber-optic light source you want to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
fiber-optic light source you want to
grab<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.600> end<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.050> plug<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> into<00:01:01.949> your

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
grab this end and plug it into your

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.950 
grab this end and plug it into your
receiver<00:01:04.430> when<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> plug<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.970> mine<00:01:06.720> has<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
receiver when you plug it in mine has a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.500 
receiver when you plug it in mine has a
digital<00:01:07.229> out<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.060> case<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.390> want

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
digital out right here in case you want

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.300 
digital out right here in case you want
to<00:01:09.720> keep<00:01:10.110> bouncing<00:01:10.590> them<00:01:10.710> from<00:01:10.860> receiver<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
to keep bouncing them from receiver to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
to keep bouncing them from receiver to
receiver<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.880> should<00:01:12.659> light<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
receiver and that should light up on it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.880 
receiver and that should light up on it
when<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> lights<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.960> now<00:01:15.960> let<00:01:16.650> me<00:01:16.680> show<00:01:16.799> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
when it lights up so now let me show you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.570 
when it lights up so now let me show you
how<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.040> works<00:01:17.720> there's<00:01:18.720> no<00:01:18.990> sound<00:01:19.580> right

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
how this works there's no sound right

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
how this works there's no sound right
here<00:01:20.790> because<00:01:21.150> well<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.930> not<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> internal

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
here because well it's not the internal

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
here because well it's not the internal
speakers<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.280> digital<00:01:23.909> optical<00:01:24.210> cannot<00:01:24.600> be

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
speakers and digital optical cannot be

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.320 
speakers and digital optical cannot be
you<00:01:25.619> can't<00:01:25.830> change<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> volume<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.580> so

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
you can't change the volume on it so

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780 
you can't change the volume on it so
it's<00:01:27.450> giving<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.810> its<00:01:27.960> full<00:01:28.080> power<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.790> what

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
it's giving it its full power but what

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.020 
it's giving it its full power but what
happens<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> digital<00:01:31.470> optical

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.540 

is<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.810> lights<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.160> tells<00:01:41.370> the

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
is this lights up and it tells the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.910 
is this lights up and it tells the
receiver<00:01:42.060> gives<00:01:42.480> it<00:01:42.660> codes<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.320> tell<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.680> what

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
receiver gives it codes to tell you what

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.190 
receiver gives it codes to tell you what
it's<00:01:44.040> trying<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.370> do<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:45.480> one<00:01:45.720> right<00:01:45.900> here

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it's trying to do this one right here

this<00:04:10.620> is<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:11.160> really<00:04:11.640> significant<00:04:12.240> upgrade

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
this is a really significant upgrade

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.950 
this is a really significant upgrade
from<00:04:13.370> stereo<00:04:14.370> which<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.120> was<00:04:15.270> using<00:04:15.420> before<00:04:15.690> and

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
from stereo which I was using before and

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.759 
from stereo which I was using before and
I<00:04:16.170> was<00:04:16.320> using<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:17.209> was<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.239> digital<00:04:18.769> something

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
I was using it was a digital something

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.620 
I was using it was a digital something
it<00:04:19.890> was<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.040> converter<00:04:20.549> from<00:04:21.000> stereo<00:04:21.390> to

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
it was a converter from stereo to

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.750 
it was a converter from stereo to
somehow<00:04:22.380> surround<00:04:23.040> sound<00:04:23.280> even<00:04:23.580> though<00:04:23.670> it

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
somehow surround sound even though it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.690 
somehow surround sound even though it
only<00:04:23.790> has<00:04:24.000> 2<00:04:24.150> channels<00:04:24.360> but<00:04:25.290> as<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:26.040> don't<00:04:26.550> think

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
only has 2 channels but as I don't think

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.680 
only has 2 channels but as I don't think
the<00:04:26.760> microphone<00:04:27.120> would<00:04:27.210> pick<00:04:27.390> it<00:04:27.510> up<00:04:27.600> because

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
the microphone would pick it up because

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.530 
the microphone would pick it up because
the<00:04:27.870> microphones<00:04:28.260> mono<00:04:28.820> but<00:04:29.820> as<00:04:30.030> I<00:04:30.420> was

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
the microphones mono but as I was

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.730 
the microphones mono but as I was
playing<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.870> music<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:31.320> could<00:04:31.470> hear<00:04:31.710> each

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
playing the music I could hear each

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.040 
playing the music I could hear each
speaker<00:04:32.220> playing<00:04:32.490> its<00:04:32.610> own<00:04:32.730> part<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.330> I

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
speaker playing its own part and I

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.680 
speaker playing its own part and I
turned<00:04:34.290> off<00:04:34.440> decoding<00:04:35.220> if<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.300> turn<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.540> on<00:04:36.630> I

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
turned off decoding if I turn it on I

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.920 
turned off decoding if I turn it on I
might<00:04:36.900> get<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.050> better<00:04:37.200> experience<00:04:38.570> but<00:04:39.570> these

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
might get a better experience but these

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.820 
might get a better experience but these
