00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.979
 rays fruits again you because 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.380
 we have to eat so many things 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.110
 nutritious I want the food 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.209
 objectives give us energy in which 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.300
 we found the fatty proteins 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.019
 carbohydrates vitamins minerals 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.820
 it always wanes 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.480
 everything our body needs to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.189
 be healthy is true now remember the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920
 protein is found in food 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.460
 of animal origin like the cow and it was removed 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.840
 the chicken every day more help us to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.840
 let's be strong our 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.350
 also times are sources of energy 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.120
 both those of plant and animal origin 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.400
 but you have to be very careful because 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.130
 if we eat too much fat we could 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.660
 get sick the other day my mom told me 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.730
 that it is also important to eat 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.970
 foods that contain carbohydrates 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.770
 they sing enough cereal and so on and so 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.040
 to be able to keep running and treat them like 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.760
 We like it so much, and your mom told me 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.090
 one of the vitamins and minerals and such 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.939
 time 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.890
 I remember the fruits and vegetables 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.899
 they are the foods that have the most 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.969
 vitamins and minerals and we need 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.130
 eat a lot of this so that our 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.750
 port can absorb and use all 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.630
 these fats proteins and carbohydrates 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.280
 that require us 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.380
 and good that I also love the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.209
 I like things much more, they lower me 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.569
 prepares them rich to carry less in the 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.569
 school 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.580
 Look, I told myself, I greet the others 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.540
 sports 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.540
 do not 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.350
 the other day my brother told me that he 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.299
 like to exercise a lot because what 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.299
 keeps active all day 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.979
 so as not to get fat otherwise 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.640
 interesting is that of the dish of good 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.500
 eat then people enjoy that yes it is 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.500
 as a divo representing the three 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.819
 food groups serves you as a guide 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.819
 to achieve good nutrition 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.730
 I know the three food groups 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.730
 legumes 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.700
 and is that animals come 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.000
 that day 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.450
 fruit without light 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.440
 but now 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.440
 so 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.110
 good 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.990
 and if that were not enough you can see what 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.420
 you can combine to make more 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.970
 effective the opposite that you eat to 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.240
 little our father if what is not so 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.340
 father is to eat junk food with the 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.570
 commonwealth and we could no longer 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.440
 correctly and it would not run out very 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.440
 Quick 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.310
 I say it's okay to eat them from time to time 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.050
 when 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.360
 It should not be daily here, it's already 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.700
 thundering the gut because you know what 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.239
 eat save your health first and what 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.239
 what do you eat
