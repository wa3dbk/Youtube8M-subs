00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200 

I<00:00:00.269> think<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.829> last<00:00:02.040> two<00:00:02.280> friendlies<00:00:02.730> have

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
I think the the last two friendlies have

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.059 
I think the the last two friendlies have
been<00:00:03.389> against<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.170> world-class<00:00:04.680> competition

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
been against a world-class competition

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.629 
been against a world-class competition
so<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.589> think<00:00:07.589> we<00:00:07.799> can<00:00:08.130> gain<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> lot<00:00:08.519> of

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
so I think we can gain a lot of

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.520 
so I think we can gain a lot of
confidence<00:00:08.970> from<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.330> germany<00:00:09.660> win<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.110> also

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
confidence from the germany win I also

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.959 
confidence from the germany win I also
think<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:10.980> can<00:00:11.130> look<00:00:11.250> at<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.519> films<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
think we can look at the films of the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.270 
think we can look at the films of the
two<00:00:12.179> games<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.660> take<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> lot<00:00:13.679> out<00:00:13.710> from<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
two games and take a lot out from the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.330 
two games and take a lot out from the
mistakes<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:14.910> made<00:00:15.890> but<00:00:16.890> really<00:00:17.250> it's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
mistakes that we made but really it's

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.890 
mistakes that we made but really it's
all<00:00:17.520> about<00:00:17.730> these<00:00:17.880> next<00:00:18.240> three<00:00:18.270> qualifiers

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
all about these next three qualifiers

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.529 
all about these next three qualifiers
and<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.710> intensity<00:00:20.279> level<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.150> games<00:00:21.330> are

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and the intensity level of the games are

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.019 
and the intensity level of the games are
going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:21.990> higher<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.820> got<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
going to be a little higher so we got to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
going to be a little higher so we got to
be<00:00:24.119> ready<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.480> them<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:25.350> know<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.680> work

be ready for them you know it's a work

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.580 
be ready for them you know it's a work
in<00:00:25.949> progress<00:00:26.599> you<00:00:27.599> know<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.930> back<00:00:28.109> four<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
in progress you know the back four and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.859 
in progress you know the back four and
the<00:00:28.740> goalkeeper<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:30.000> takes<00:00:30.330> time<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.660> develop

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the goalkeeper it takes time to develop

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.330 
the goalkeeper it takes time to develop
relationships<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.890> comfort<00:00:34.890> pneus<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
relationships and the comfort pneus of

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.459 
relationships and the comfort pneus of
playing<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.059> each<00:00:36.239> other<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.750> takes<00:00:37.230> time

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
playing with each other it takes time

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.160 
playing with each other it takes time

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and so you know some of us are learning

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.310 
and so you know some of us are learning
on<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> fly<00:00:40.559> right<00:00:40.950> now<00:00:41.750> but<00:00:42.750> again<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.079> just

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
on the fly right now but again you just

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
on the fly right now but again you just
look<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> tapes<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.370> their<00:00:44.579> their<00:00:44.610> stuff

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
look at the tapes and their their stuff

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
look at the tapes and their their stuff
where<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:46.050> should<00:00:46.260> drop<00:00:46.440> their<00:00:46.739> stuff<00:00:46.860> where

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
where you should drop their stuff where

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.270 
where you should drop their stuff where
you<00:00:47.370> should<00:00:47.579> step<00:00:47.789> up<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.500> experiencing

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you should step up and just experiencing

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.850 
you should step up and just experiencing
that<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> only<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> learn<00:00:51.449> really<00:00:52.050> you

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that is the only way to learn really you

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.310 
that is the only way to learn really you
know<00:00:52.980> we're<00:00:53.160> expected<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.930> quite<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.230> bit

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
know we're expected to to do quite a bit

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.490 
know we're expected to to do quite a bit
on<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.010> defensive<00:00:56.460> end<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.789> know<00:00:57.500> you're

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
on the defensive end you know you're

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
on the defensive end you know you're
going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.710> preach<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.489> starts<00:00:59.910> high

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
going to preach is that it starts high

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
going to preach is that it starts high
up<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> field<00:01:01.079> with<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.649> outside<00:01:01.980> mids<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
up the field with the outside mids and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.630 
up the field with the outside mids and
in<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> forwards<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.979> you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.309> that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
in the forwards and you know that that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.020 
in the forwards and you know that that
first<00:01:05.939> line<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.210> pressure<00:01:07.760> can<00:01:08.760> make<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
first line of pressure can make it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
first line of pressure can make it
predictable<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> guys<00:01:10.350> behind<00:01:10.590> us<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
predictable for the guys behind us and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.450 
predictable for the guys behind us and
easier<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.909> them<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> clean<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:13.460> what

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
easier for them to kind of clean up what

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.620 
easier for them to kind of clean up what
comes<00:01:14.670> next<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.119> know<00:01:15.240> we're<00:01:15.540> not

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
comes next you know we're not

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.020 
comes next you know we're not
necessarily<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:17.130> guys<00:01:17.310> who<00:01:17.549> are<00:01:17.670> winning<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
necessarily the guys who are winning the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.940 
necessarily the guys who are winning the
ball<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.290> said<00:01:19.470> making<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
ball but it's like I said making it a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
ball but it's like I said making it a
little<00:01:20.040> bit<00:01:20.189> easier<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> predictable<00:01:21.509> for

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
little bit easier and predictable for

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.440 
little bit easier and predictable for
the<00:01:22.049> guys<00:01:22.170> behind<00:01:22.409> us<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.330> be<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.420> good

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
the guys behind us to be in good

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.960 
the guys behind us to be in good
positions<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.439> win<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.460> second<00:01:26.850> ball

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
positions to win that that second ball

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.640 
positions to win that that second ball
every<00:01:27.659> chance<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.470> get<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.799> play<00:01:28.950> its<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:31.560> know
