00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
as we go in the game to hear Idris is a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.880 
as we go in the game to hear Idris is a
little<00:01:42.030> bit<00:01:42.119> ahead<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.659> tarsan<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:43.740> needs

to<00:01:43.979> change<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> strategy<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.759> think<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.479> beat

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
to change the strategy I think to beat

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.460 
to change the strategy I think to beat
hydro<00:01:47.369> right<00:01:47.549> now<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.290> racks

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
hydro right now so we do see the racks
coming<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:49.950> here<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> front<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> ramp

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
coming up here in the front on the ramp

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.139 
coming up here in the front on the ramp
we<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.990> seen<00:01:52.229> tarsan<00:01:52.649> cut<00:01:53.280> his<00:01:53.460> ramp<00:01:53.729> off<00:01:53.909> all

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
we have seen tarsan cut his ramp off all

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.569 
we have seen tarsan cut his ramp off all
the<00:01:54.450> time<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.530> looks<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.770> Hydra<00:01:56.250> coming

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the time and it looks like Hydra coming

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.429 
the time and it looks like Hydra coming
in<00:01:56.700> here<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> short<00:01:57.689> rush<00:01:57.960> distance

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
in here and a short rush distance

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.440 
in here and a short rush distance
between<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> two<00:01:58.829> bases<00:01:59.310> Idris<00:02:00.030> sees<00:02:00.210> how

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
between the two bases Idris sees how

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.170 
between the two bases Idris sees how
close<00:02:00.750> Tarson<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> probably<00:02:02.130> saying<00:02:02.399> this

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
close Tarson is is probably saying this

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.080 
close Tarson is is probably saying this
is<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.420> good<00:02:04.170> at<00:02:04.409> all<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:07.640> looks<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.910> drew

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
is not good at all and looks like I drew

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.729 
is not good at all and looks like I drew
just<00:02:09.209> coming<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.569> scoping<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.080> what's<00:02:10.410> going

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
just coming in scoping out what's going

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.080 
just coming in scoping out what's going
on<00:02:10.890> inside<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.459> base<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.060> hey

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
on inside the base and hey

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.390 
on inside the base and hey
can<00:02:13.269> I<00:02:13.390> explain<00:02:13.750> here<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.800> looks<00:02:14.830> like

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
can I explain here and it looks like

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.780 
can I explain here and it looks like
yeah<00:02:15.760> he's<00:02:15.940> going<00:02:16.239> for<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.629> extractor<00:02:17.790> again

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
yeah he's going for that extractor again

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.990 
yeah he's going for that extractor again
he<00:02:19.090> did<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.569> game<00:02:19.810> number<00:02:19.989> one<00:02:20.879> but<00:02:21.879> it

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
he did that in game number one but it

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.220 
he did that in game number one but it
looks<00:02:22.150> like<00:02:22.209> tar<00:02:22.510> sins<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.780> little<00:02:23.019> ahead<00:02:23.110> of

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
looks like tar sins a little ahead of

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.410 
looks like tar sins a little ahead of
the<00:02:23.379> game<00:02:23.590> here<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.190> we'll<00:02:24.819> be<00:02:24.940> able<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.239> take

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
the game here and we'll be able to take

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.059 
the game here and we'll be able to take
this<00:02:25.540> extractor<00:02:26.050> down<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> little<00:02:26.530> bit<00:02:26.709> earlier

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
this extractor down a little bit earlier

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.880 
this extractor down a little bit earlier
it<00:02:27.580> looks<00:02:27.819> like<00:02:28.110> tarsan<00:02:29.110> coming<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.620> here

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
it looks like tarsan coming up here

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.920 
it looks like tarsan coming up here
trying<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.519> stop<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.940> early<00:02:31.390> expand<00:02:31.810> from

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
trying to stop the early expand from

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.800 
trying to stop the early expand from
Hydra<00:02:32.470> always<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> hallmark<00:02:34.000> move<00:02:34.180> from<00:02:34.360> Hydra

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
Hydra always a hallmark move from Hydra

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.110 
Hydra always a hallmark move from Hydra
if<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.049> can<00:02:35.260> if<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:35.950> stop<00:02:36.400> his<00:02:36.640> expansion

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
if you can if you can stop his expansion

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.479 
if you can if you can stop his expansion
you<00:02:37.360> can<00:02:37.540> usually<00:02:37.750> beat<00:02:38.170> them<00:02:38.319> but<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.099> looks

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
you can usually beat them but it looks

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.570 
you can usually beat them but it looks
like<00:02:39.640> oh<00:02:40.030> these<00:02:40.900> zerglings<00:02:41.440> coming<00:02:41.769> in<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.340> it

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
like oh these zerglings coming in and it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.949 
like oh these zerglings coming in and it
looks<00:02:42.760> like<00:02:42.819> tarsals<00:02:43.299> going<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.510> be<00:02:43.569> forced

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
looks like tarsals going to be forced

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.280 
looks like tarsals going to be forced
out<00:02:44.110> here<00:02:44.920> as<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.670> drew<00:02:46.030> will<00:02:46.299> be<00:02:46.450> able<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:47.079> build

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
out here as I drew will be able to build

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.100 
out here as I drew will be able to build
his<00:02:47.590> expansion<00:02:48.250> early<00:02:49.120> on<00:02:49.239> into<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.870> field

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
his expansion early on into the field

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.259 
his expansion early on into the field
and<00:02:50.319> we<00:02:50.920> do<00:02:51.130> have<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.310> little<00:02:51.610> bit<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.819> change<00:02:52.120> up

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
and we do have a little bit of change up

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.660 
and we do have a little bit of change up
here<00:02:52.480> very<00:02:52.870> good<00:02:53.200> here<00:02:53.440> Tarson<00:02:53.860> changing<00:02:54.579> it

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
here very good here Tarson changing it

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.910 
here very good here Tarson changing it
up<00:02:54.790> building<00:02:55.299> a<00:02:55.360> factory<00:02:55.660> here<00:02:55.930> going<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.739> be

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
up building a factory here going to be

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.009 
up building a factory here going to be
walling<00:02:57.760> off<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.329> yeah<00:02:58.629> he's<00:02:58.780> going<00:02:58.959> to

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
walling off this yeah he's going to

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.479 
walling off this yeah he's going to
finish<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.410> wall<00:02:59.620> off<00:02:59.769> with<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.010> supply<00:03:00.459> depot

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
finish that wall off with a supply depot

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.180 
finish that wall off with a supply depot
and<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.540> extractor<00:03:02.200> almost<00:03:02.680> down<00:03:02.980> it's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
and this extractor almost down it's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.160 
and this extractor almost down it's
bleeding<00:03:03.790> all<00:03:04.030> over<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.540> place<00:03:04.660> all<00:03:05.110> over

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
bleeding all over the place all over

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.880 
bleeding all over the place all over
charset<00:03:05.920> space<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:07.410> there<00:03:08.410> goes<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
charset space and there goes the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.650 
charset space and there goes the
extractor<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.819> looks<00:03:10.000> like<00:03:10.060> we<00:03:10.269> are<00:03:10.299> now

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
extractor so it looks like we are now

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.580 
extractor so it looks like we are now
going<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.930> be<00:03:11.019> able<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.200> go<00:03:11.290> into<00:03:11.379> full

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
going to be able to go into full

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.949 
going to be able to go into full

getting ready to go down into this

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.740 
getting ready to go down into this
expansion<00:03:20.430> with<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> spine<00:03:22.090> crawler<00:03:22.420> as<00:03:22.569> well

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
expansion with a spine crawler as well

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.629 
expansion with a spine crawler as well
it<00:03:22.930> looks<00:03:23.170> like<00:03:23.380> he's<00:03:23.769> getting<00:03:24.040> ready<00:03:24.220> for

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
some kind of hellions here with that

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.190 
some kind of hellions here with that
spine<00:03:27.010> crawler<00:03:27.340> knowing<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.120> this<00:03:28.750> factor

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
spine crawler knowing that this factor

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.339 
spine crawler knowing that this factor
is<00:03:29.230> here<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.769> producing<00:03:30.489> something<00:03:31.349> he's

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
is here and producing something he's

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.410 
is here and producing something he's
getting<00:03:32.680> ready<00:03:32.829> for<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:33.700> we<00:03:33.819> do<00:03:33.970> have<00:03:34.000> some
