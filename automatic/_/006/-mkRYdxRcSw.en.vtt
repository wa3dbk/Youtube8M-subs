00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.550

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.070

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:15.690

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.690
 we recorded it and good as this 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.940
 and surely 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.010
 I have two thousand 354 when this is very 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.760
 easy the first thing they have to do is 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.650
 go to the trick I have to put copy 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.050
 they minimize this and now they put a cardon iv 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.850
 c sheets 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.390

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.820

 and now look 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.630
 as you can see, we can use them for them 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.289
 we can walk through the water too 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.960
 this is very good because they are on their own or 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:09.220
 be quite a trick of more than we can 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.240

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.890
 and ready all so much good a trick that 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.860
 it serves quite well I do not want to fight 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.220
