00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
this is actually probably the hardest

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.190 
this is actually probably the hardest
drafts<00:00:47.730> we've<00:00:47.879> had<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> do<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.450> year<00:00:48.719> because

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
drafts we've had to do this year because

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
drafts we've had to do this year because
it's<00:00:49.530> literally<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.980> well<00:00:50.219> half<00:00:51.210> these

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it's literally like well half these

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.610 
it's literally like well half these
players<00:00:51.750> we're<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.020> even<00:00:52.140> sure<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.500> they

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
players we're not even sure what they

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
players we're not even sure what they
want<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.890> want<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> play<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.789> I'm<00:00:54.390> probably

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
want to want to play so I'm probably

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
want to want to play so I'm probably
pretty<00:00:55.170> sure<00:00:55.350> they<00:00:55.500> go<00:00:55.710> into<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.070> game<00:00:56.309> like

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
pretty sure they go into this game like

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
pretty sure they go into this game like
pretty<00:00:56.850> soloqueue<00:00:57.420> ish<00:00:57.510> style<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.050> feel<00:00:58.500> like

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
pretty soloqueue ish style I feel like

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
pretty soloqueue ish style I feel like
our<00:00:58.829> job<00:00:59.460> business<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> control<00:01:00.239> variables<00:01:00.690> in

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
our job business to control variables in

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.280 
our job business to control variables in
the<00:01:00.870> draft<00:01:01.109> phase<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.670> go<00:01:02.670> into<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> game<00:01:03.290> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the draft phase and go into the game and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.740 
the draft phase and go into the game and
just<00:01:04.589> beat<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.790> being<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.420> stronger

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
just beat them with being a stronger

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
just beat them with being a stronger
team<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> only<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.400> lose

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
team like I think the only way we lose

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.370 
team like I think the only way we lose
this<00:01:08.700> game<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.330> get<00:01:09.479> dragged<00:01:09.810> into<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
this game is if we get dragged into the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.859 
this game is if we get dragged into the
mud<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.770> gets<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.090> chaotic<00:01:12.450> team

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
mud and gets really really chaotic team

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.350 
mud and gets really really chaotic team
fights<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.680> small<00:01:13.979> skirmishes<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.060> we're

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
fights or or small skirmishes so we're

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.730 
fights or or small skirmishes so we're
just<00:01:15.390> hoping<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> take<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.590> really

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
just hoping to take this one really

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.580 
just hoping to take this one really
clean<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.280> quickly<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.360> move<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
clean really quickly and move on to the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
clean really quickly and move on to the
next<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.460> interestingly<00:01:20.850> enough<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
next in so interestingly enough you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.830 
next in so interestingly enough you
could<00:01:22.020> end<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.439> playing<00:01:22.830> CLG<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.420> playoffs

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
could end up playing CLG in the playoffs

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 
could end up playing CLG in the playoffs
after<00:01:25.140> playing<00:01:25.979> against<00:01:26.310> their<00:01:26.400> sub<00:01:26.580> roster

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
after playing against their sub roster

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.550 
after playing against their sub roster
so<00:01:27.299> how<00:01:27.810> does<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.990> make<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.170> feel<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
so how does that make you feel is that a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200 
so how does that make you feel is that a
disadvantage<00:01:29.250> having<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.579> play<00:01:29.759> against<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
disadvantage having to play against a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.810 
disadvantage having to play against a
different<00:01:30.420> set<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.079> guys<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:32.280> getting<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
different set of guys not getting to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.850 
different set of guys not getting to
scout<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.420> CLG<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.290> much<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> would<00:01:34.770> have

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
scout out CLG as much as you would have

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
scout out CLG as much as you would have
liked<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.640> into<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> playoffs<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.390> don't

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
liked to going into the playoffs I don't

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
liked to going into the playoffs I don't
really<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.290> uh<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.369> week<00:01:38.579> we

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
really think so uh going to this week we

single team in LCS mainly because we
feel<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.329> there's<00:01:42.540> such<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> big<00:01:43.079> gap<00:01:43.290> between

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
kind of grasp on their team and how they

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.789 
kind of grasp on their team and how they
play<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.810> nothing<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.140> really<00:01:55.350> sticks<00:01:55.740> with

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
play but nothing that really sticks with

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.469 
play but nothing that really sticks with
you<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.100> three<00:01:56.399> weeks<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.149> three<00:01:57.360> weeks

a spot in the playoffs so there's at

a spot in the playoffs so there's at
least<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.810> much<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.200> talk<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> me<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> little

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
least that much but talk to me a little

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.910 
least that much but talk to me a little
bit<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> importance<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.820> positioning

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
bit about the importance of positioning

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.109 
bit about the importance of positioning
matchups<00:02:07.920> I'd<00:02:08.160> choice<00:02:08.429> things<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.849> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
matchups I'd choice things like that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.619 
matchups I'd choice things like that
going<00:02:09.420> into<00:02:09.599> these<00:02:09.869> big<00:02:10.229> best<00:02:10.530> five<00:02:10.770> series<00:02:11.129> um

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
going into these big best five series um

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.640 
going into these big best five series um
it's<00:02:12.629> definitely<00:02:12.930> really<00:02:13.020> really<00:02:13.260> important

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's definitely really really important

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.980 
it's definitely really really important
to<00:02:13.770> get

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
to get

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.650 
to get
a<00:02:14.190> side<00:02:15.190> advantage<00:02:15.580> if<00:02:15.700> you're<00:02:15.820> let's<00:02:16.030> say<00:02:16.180> 45

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
a side advantage if you're let's say 45

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.660 
a side advantage if you're let's say 45
like<00:02:16.930> although<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.710> four<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.130> five<00:02:18.310> fifth

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
like although the four and five fifth

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.270 
like although the four and five fifth
spots<00:02:18.910> are<00:02:19.060> pretty<00:02:19.560> whatever<00:02:20.560> they're<00:02:21.070> pretty

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
spots are pretty whatever they're pretty

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.040 
spots are pretty whatever they're pretty
interchangeable<00:02:21.490> in<00:02:21.940> my<00:02:22.060> opinion<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.810> third

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
interchangeable in my opinion the third

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.900 
interchangeable in my opinion the third
spot<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.470> really<00:02:23.920> really<00:02:24.070> nice<00:02:24.340> like<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.700> think

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
spot is really really nice like I think

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.550 
spot is really really nice like I think
we<00:02:25.180> may<00:02:25.360> have<00:02:25.390> lost<00:02:25.660> our<00:02:25.840> chance<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.260> cinch

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
we may have lost our chance to cinch

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.770 
we may have lost our chance to cinch
first<00:02:26.920> or<00:02:27.100> second<00:02:27.430> here<00:02:27.610> but<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.150> 40<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.660> week

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
first or second here but we 40 the week

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.420 
first or second here but we 40 the week
we<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:28.990> still<00:02:29.200> get<00:02:29.320> third<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.860> third<00:02:30.220> means

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
we can still get third and third means

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.830 
we can still get third and third means
we<00:02:30.550> play<00:02:30.760> against<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.150> sixth<00:02:31.450> place<00:02:31.600> team

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
we play against the sixth place team

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.200 
we play against the sixth place team
which<00:02:31.990> is<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.110> think<00:02:32.230> most<00:02:32.710> likely<00:02:33.040> curse<00:02:33.310> and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
which is I think most likely curse and

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.850 
which is I think most likely curse and
we<00:02:34.360> really<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.960> we'd<00:02:35.380> really<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:35.800> to
