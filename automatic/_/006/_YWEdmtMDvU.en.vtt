00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
putting the cream from like not too

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.180 
putting the cream from like not too
but<00:02:08.090> focus<00:02:08.479> more<00:02:08.510> from<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.350> middle<00:02:09.619> shaft<00:02:09.830> to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
but focus more from the middle shaft to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.960 
but focus more from the middle shaft to
the<00:02:10.340> end<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:11.320> going<00:02:12.550> scrunching<00:02:13.550> like<00:02:13.700> that

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
the end and going scrunching like that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.780 
the end and going scrunching like that
and<00:02:14.270> making<00:02:14.600> that<00:02:14.720> movement<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.950> one<00:02:16.250> so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
and making that movement and that one so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.450 
and making that movement and that one so
you're<00:02:17.030> kind<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.410> defining<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.860> scrunching

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
you're kind of defining and scrunching

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.490 
you're kind of defining and scrunching
them<00:02:19.490> they<00:02:19.940> scrunching<00:02:20.420> part<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.930> more<00:02:21.140> for

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
them they scrunching part is more for

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.650 
them they scrunching part is more for
the<00:02:21.620> hold<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.670> just<00:02:22.880> more<00:02:23.090> like<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.480> make

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the hold it's just more like to make

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.920 
the hold it's just more like to make
them<00:02:23.950> hold<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> ball<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.670> get<00:02:26.000> bouncy<00:02:26.750> back

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
them hold the ball and get bouncy back

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.040 
them hold the ball and get bouncy back
and<00:02:27.440> more<00:02:27.800> Kirlia<00:02:28.250> than<00:02:28.670> before<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.870> quite

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
and more Kirlia than before it's quite

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.710 
and more Kirlia than before it's quite
stretchy<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.130> more<00:02:31.280> frizzy<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.270> defining

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
stretchy and more frizzy so the defining

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.680 
stretchy and more frizzy so the defining
and<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.320> scrunching<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.070> more<00:02:34.310> like

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
and the scrunching is more like

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.910 
and the scrunching is more like
controlling<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> freeze<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.560> then<00:02:36.770> the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
controlling the freeze and then the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.480 
controlling the freeze and then the
elasticity<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:37.820> well<00:02:38.860> when<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.980> put<00:02:40.190> all<00:02:40.460> over

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
elasticity as well when you put all over

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.060 
elasticity as well when you put all over
the<00:02:41.120> cream<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.570> they<00:02:41.780> define<00:02:42.470> all<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
the cream and they define all of the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.670 
the cream and they define all of the
hair<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.640> top<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.270> did<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.140> same<00:02:45.320> thing<00:02:45.650> you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
hair the top you did the same thing you

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.680 
hair the top you did the same thing you
do<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.160> side<00:02:46.430> part<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.240> side<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.630> you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
do the side part to the side that you

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.390 
do the side part to the side that you
like<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.140> party<00:02:48.560> here<00:02:48.800> if<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:49.160> at<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
like to party here if it is at the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.640 
like to party here if it is at the
middle<00:02:49.610> leave<00:02:49.970> at<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.180> middle<00:02:50.510> if<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:51.050> if<00:02:51.470> you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
middle leave at the middle if you if you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.590 
middle leave at the middle if you if you
like<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.340> side<00:02:52.580> already<00:02:52.940> part<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.480> the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
like on the side already part to the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.080 
like on the side already part to the
side<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.320> that's<00:02:54.470> how<00:02:54.710> your<00:02:54.950> head<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.760> going<00:02:56.030> to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
side so that's how your head is going to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.140 
side so that's how your head is going to
sit<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:56.630> drive<00:02:56.960> after<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.740> we<00:02:58.280> come<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
sit and drive after that we come to the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.180 
sit and drive after that we come to the
chair<00:02:59.390> or<00:02:59.570> like<00:02:59.750> in<00:02:59.990> our<00:03:00.290> salon<00:03:00.680> we<00:03:00.710> come<00:03:01.070> to

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
chair or like in our salon we come to

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.120 
chair or like in our salon we come to
the<00:03:01.310> chair<00:03:01.550> but<00:03:01.850> if<00:03:02.000> you're<00:03:02.150> at<00:03:02.270> home<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:03.350> you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
the chair but if you're at home you you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.220 
the chair but if you're at home you you
I<00:03:04.160> would<00:03:04.430> say<00:03:04.670> just<00:03:05.090> if<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.720> have<00:03:05.900> fine<00:03:06.200> hair

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
I would say just if you have fine hair

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.340 
I would say just if you have fine hair
flip<00:03:07.160> your<00:03:07.370> hair<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.880> get<00:03:08.060> more<00:03:08.270> before<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:09.140> dry

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
flip your hair to get more before to dry

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.280 
flip your hair to get more before to dry
and<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:10.220> get<00:03:10.370> more<00:03:10.610> bouncy<00:03:11.240> to<00:03:11.750> get<00:03:11.900> more<00:03:12.110> like

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and to get more bouncy to get more like

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.949 
and to get more bouncy to get more like
volume<00:03:13.010> always<00:03:13.310> doing<00:03:13.730> those<00:03:13.880> movement<00:03:14.450> this

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
volume always doing those movement this

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.860 
volume always doing those movement this
way<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.830> way<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.060> get<00:03:17.239> more<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.810> more

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
way that way so you get more and more

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.280 
way that way so you get more and more
volume<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.830> if<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:20.000> want<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.360> if<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:21.020> want<00:03:21.200> to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
volume and if you want to if you want to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.160 
volume and if you want to if you want to
like<00:03:21.910> control<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.180> fries<00:03:23.450> but<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.870> don't<00:03:24.050> want

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
like control the fries but I don't want

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.210 
like control the fries but I don't want
a<00:03:24.230> too<00:03:24.500> much<00:03:24.739> volume<00:03:25.100> so<00:03:25.880> I<00:03:25.910> would<00:03:26.090> say<00:03:26.300> just<00:03:26.540> to

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
a too much volume so I would say just to

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.070 
a too much volume so I would say just to
define<00:03:28.220> them<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:28.850> then<00:03:29.060> just<00:03:29.360> do<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.660> little

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
define them and then just do a little

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.960 
define them and then just do a little
tip<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.350> little<00:03:30.470> bit<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.010> side<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.940> other

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
tip a little bit to the side the other

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.540 
tip a little bit to the side the other
side<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.840> then<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.860> back<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:34.100> little<00:03:34.340> bit

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
side and then to the back a little bit

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.729 
side and then to the back a little bit
like<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.209> then<00:03:35.570> scrunch<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.170> sauce

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
like that and then scrunch that sauce

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.790 
like that and then scrunch that sauce
and<00:03:37.239> always<00:03:38.239> doing<00:03:38.570> that<00:03:38.780> movements<00:03:39.530> not

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
and always doing that movements not

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.009 
and always doing that movements not
never<00:03:40.070> doing<00:03:40.430> these<00:03:40.670> oo<00:03:41.060> like<00:03:41.570> they<00:03:41.959> see

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
never doing these oo like they see

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.460 
never doing these oo like they see
happen<00:03:42.830> so<00:03:43.670> once<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.090> define<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.600> curls<00:03:44.930> make

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
happen so once you define the curls make

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.690 
happen so once you define the curls make
sure<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:46.220> you're<00:03:46.340> not<00:03:46.459> going<00:03:47.269> through<00:03:47.480> and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
sure that you're not going through and

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.810 
sure that you're not going through and
touching<00:03:49.700> them<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.120> March<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.870> not<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:52.400> know

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
touching them to March and not I know

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.520 
touching them to March and not I know
you'll<00:03:53.060> be<00:03:53.180> tempted<00:03:53.390> but<00:03:53.750> don't<00:03:54.110> touch<00:03:54.290> too

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
you'll be tempted but don't touch too

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.400 
you'll be tempted but don't touch too
much

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.180 

just<00:03:59.890> for<00:04:00.700> ten<00:04:00.880> minutes

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
just for ten minutes

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.640 
just for ten minutes
and<00:04:02.310> go<00:04:02.550> out<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:03.120> be<00:04:03.270> on<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> walk<00:04:03.810> right<00:04:04.350> in<00:04:04.530> the
