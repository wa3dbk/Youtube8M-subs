on<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.599> webpage<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.500> discussed<00:00:32.219> my<00:00:32.369> five-step

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
on this webpage I discussed my five-step

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.110 
on this webpage I discussed my five-step
proven<00:00:33.989> method<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:35.100> how<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> study<00:00:35.820> in

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
proven method for how to study in

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.569 
proven method for how to study in
medical<00:00:36.719> school<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.950> apply<00:00:38.070> also

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
medical school and this would apply also

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.770 
medical school and this would apply also
to<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.120> MCAT<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.930> any<00:00:40.350> other<00:00:40.620> licensing<00:00:41.250> exams

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
to the MCAT or any other licensing exams

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.200 
to the MCAT or any other licensing exams
so<00:00:42.780> what<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.010> five-step<00:00:44.550> study<00:00:44.820> method

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so what is this five-step study method

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.880 
so what is this five-step study method
how<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.840> know<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.500> pulling

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
how do you know that I'm not pulling

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.660 
how do you know that I'm not pulling
your<00:00:46.980> leg<00:00:47.250> well<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:49.129> everybody<00:00:50.129> was

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
your leg well this is what everybody was

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.000 
your leg well this is what everybody was
talking<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> halls<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.379> my<00:00:52.530> medical

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
talking about in the halls of my medical

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220 
talking about in the halls of my medical
school<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> second<00:00:54.690> year<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> medical

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
school in the second year of medical

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
school in the second year of medical
school<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
school so this is what you're going to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.459 
school so this is what you're going to
learn<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.770> hard<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.809> by<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:01.020> through<00:01:01.379> that

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
learn the hard way by going through that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.380 
learn the hard way by going through that
first<00:01:01.800> year<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.219> medical<00:01:02.399> school<00:01:02.670> what

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
first year of medical school what

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.479 
first year of medical school what
experiences<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> learn

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
experiences are you going to learn

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.100 
experiences are you going to learn
they're<00:01:05.820> gonna<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.390> more<00:01:06.540> efficient

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
they're gonna make you more efficient

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.649 
they're gonna make you more efficient
how<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> digest<00:01:07.920> five<00:01:08.580> times<00:01:08.909> more<00:01:09.150> material

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
how to digest five times more material

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.960 
how to digest five times more material
and<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.020> actually<00:01:10.260> remember<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.670> sort

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and you can actually remember that sort

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.590 
and you can actually remember that sort
of<00:01:12.030> thing<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.080> I've<00:01:13.920> broken<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.119> down<00:01:15.150> into

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
of thing so I've broken it down into

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.350 
of thing so I've broken it down into
five<00:01:15.960> steps<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.369> simple<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
five steps to make it really simple to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
five steps to make it really simple to
digest<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.560> walk<00:01:19.770> through<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.280> module

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
digest and to walk through this module

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.850 
digest and to walk through this module
of<00:01:20.939> course<00:01:21.290> for<00:01:22.290> pre-meds

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
of course for pre-meds

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.420 
of course for pre-meds
okay<00:01:23.270> now<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.840> my<00:01:25.140> full-blown<00:01:25.950> speed

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
okay now this is not my full-blown speed

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.700 
okay now this is not my full-blown speed
reading<00:01:26.729> course<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.509> medical<00:01:27.869> school<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
reading course for medical school that I

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.819 
reading course for medical school that I
do<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.250> medical<00:01:29.610> students<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
do for medical students but this is the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.370 
do for medical students but this is the
basics<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.729> need<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> start<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.780> before<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
basics you need to start here before you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.859 
basics you need to start here before you
can<00:01:34.500> even<00:01:34.650> think<00:01:35.009> about<00:01:35.299> speed<00:01:36.299> reading<00:01:36.630> or

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
can even think about speed reading or

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.719 
can even think about speed reading or
you<00:01:36.900> won't<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.530> fundamentals<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.400> how

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you won't have the fundamentals of how

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
you won't have the fundamentals of how
to<00:01:38.759> study<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.210> medical<00:01:39.750> school<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.259> enough

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
to study in medical school down enough

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.039 
to study in medical school down enough
to<00:01:41.070> become<00:01:41.430> more<00:01:41.850> efficient<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.540> begin<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to become more efficient and begin to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.670 
to become more efficient and begin to
soar<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:45.450> even<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.049> ask<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
soar so I don't even have to ask if that

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.280 
soar so I don't even have to ask if that
sounds<00:01:47.220> interesting<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.540> would<00:01:49.110> just

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
sounds interesting to you I would just

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
sounds interesting to you I would just
