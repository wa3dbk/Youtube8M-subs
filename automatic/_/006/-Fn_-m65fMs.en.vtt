when<00:02:25.860> you're<00:02:25.980> starting<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.940> usually<00:02:27.240> focus<00:02:27.420> on

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
when you're starting we usually focus on

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.810 
when you're starting we usually focus on
the<00:02:28.350> leader<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.130> tree<00:02:29.310> or<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.490> center

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
the leader of the tree or the center

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.120 
the leader of the tree or the center
part<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.209> tree<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.680> reason<00:02:31.920> we<00:02:32.010> do

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
part of the tree and the reason we do

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.310 
part of the tree and the reason we do
that<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.310> well<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.540> paper<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.959> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> come

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
that is well the paper is going to come

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.320 
that is well the paper is going to come
down<00:02:34.470> from<00:02:34.830> there<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.580> we<00:02:35.610> kind<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.060> tend<00:02:36.239> to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
down from there so we kind of tend to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.240 
down from there so we kind of tend to
aim<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.140> what<00:02:37.260> we'll<00:02:37.410> generally<00:02:37.769> do<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.040> tell

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
aim and what we'll generally do is tell

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.420 
aim and what we'll generally do is tell
people<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.610> aim<00:02:38.820> over<00:02:39.390> then<00:02:39.840> here<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.190> see

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
people to aim over then here just to see

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.030 
people to aim over then here just to see
it's<00:02:42.150> kind<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:42.510> Satan<00:02:43.050> in<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.350> gun<00:02:43.530> I've

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
it's kind of like Satan in a gun I've

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.860 
it's kind of like Satan in a gun I've
got<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.370> aim<00:02:44.580> over<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.330> see<00:02:45.510> where<00:02:45.720> you're

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
got to aim over that to see where you're

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.650 
got to aim over that to see where you're
swinging<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.769> then<00:02:47.120> eventually<00:02:48.120> move<00:02:48.480> into

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
swinging and then eventually move into

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.540 
swinging and then eventually move into
it<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> little<00:02:49.170> bit<00:02:49.290> more<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.739> put<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> nice

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
it a little bit more and put a nice

00:02:50.550 --> 00:03:04.130 
it a little bit more and put a nice
paper

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.760 

that's<00:03:05.140> all<00:03:05.290> right<00:03:05.470> okay<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:07.560> see<00:03:08.560> why<00:03:08.710> this

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
that's all right okay I see why this

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.460 
that's all right okay I see why this
follow-through<00:03:09.550> is<00:03:09.670> important<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:14.290> that's

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
follow-through is important and that's

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.290 
follow-through is important and that's
what<00:03:14.680> we<00:03:14.800> tell<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.190> phobic<00:03:15.730> guys<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.090> know<00:03:16.180> we
