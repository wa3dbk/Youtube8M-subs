it's just like smooth this one you can

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.370 
it's just like smooth this one you can
hear<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.220> as<00:04:56.420> that<00:04:57.420> grip<00:04:57.720> on<00:04:57.990> it<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.350> whole

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
hear it as that grip on it the whole

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.950 
hear it as that grip on it the whole
crew<00:04:58.890> has<00:04:59.070> a<00:04:59.100> grip<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.670> it<00:04:59.700> so<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.450> ball<00:05:00.630> sticks

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
crew has a grip to it so the ball sticks

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.670 
crew has a grip to it so the ball sticks
nice<00:05:01.260> not<00:05:01.830> really<00:05:02.130> nice<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:03.930> even<00:05:04.410> on

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
nice not really nice to it and even on

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.140 
nice not really nice to it and even on
that<00:05:04.830> puma<00:05:05.190> cat<00:05:05.340> here<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:05.670> got<00:05:05.820> some<00:05:06.000> little

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
that puma cat here you got some little

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.400 
that puma cat here you got some little
grip<00:05:06.450> elements<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:06.990> when<00:05:07.140> you're<00:05:07.260> shooting

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
grip elements so when you're shooting

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.220 
grip elements so when you're shooting
and<00:05:08.400> obviously<00:05:09.330> it<00:05:09.420> does<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.630> same<00:05:09.780> thing<00:05:09.960> if

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
and obviously it does the same thing if

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.190 
and obviously it does the same thing if
you're<00:05:10.350> passing<00:05:10.770> but<00:05:10.890> obviously<00:05:11.190> minimal

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
you're passing but obviously minimal

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.630 
you're passing but obviously minimal
right<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:15.120> then<00:05:15.270> you<00:05:15.360> got<00:05:15.510> their<00:05:16.320> uni<00:05:16.740> that's

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
right and then you got their uni that's

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.960 
right and then you got their uni that's
what<00:05:17.760> they<00:05:17.850> call<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.180> stud<00:05:18.480> pattern<00:05:18.890> uni

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
what they call the stud pattern uni

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.450 
what they call the stud pattern uni
whatever<00:05:20.970> if<00:05:21.450> you<00:05:21.630> wanna<00:05:21.840> and<00:05:22.170> you<00:05:23.010> got<00:05:23.220> the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
whatever if you wanna and you got the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.680 
whatever if you wanna and you got the
this<00:05:23.910> also<00:05:24.120> incorporates<00:05:26.000> carbon<00:05:27.000> fiber<00:05:27.210> but

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
this also incorporates carbon fiber but

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.450 
this also incorporates carbon fiber but
this<00:05:27.810> only<00:05:27.990> in<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.200> mid-foot<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:28.920> obviously

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
this only in the mid-foot so obviously

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.570 
this only in the mid-foot so obviously
it's<00:05:29.780> stiff<00:05:30.780> but<00:05:31.410> flexible<00:05:31.680> like<00:05:32.400> it's

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
it's stiff but flexible like it's

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.780 
it's stiff but flexible like it's
flexible<00:05:33.590> upwards<00:05:34.590> like<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:35.340> where<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:35.580> need

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
flexible upwards like for where you need

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.030 
flexible upwards like for where you need
it<00:05:35.820> but<00:05:36.180> not<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.630> other<00:05:36.750> way<00:05:36.960> so<00:05:37.500> it's<00:05:37.890> really

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
it but not the other way so it's really

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.560 
it but not the other way so it's really
nice<00:05:40.280> though<00:05:41.280> I<00:05:41.310> gotta<00:05:41.640> just<00:05:41.730> say<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.210> upper

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
nice though I gotta just say the upper

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.960 
nice though I gotta just say the upper
on<00:05:42.750> these<00:05:43.080> is<00:05:43.290> better<00:05:43.620> than<00:05:43.830> that<00:05:43.980> that's<00:05:44.670> just

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
on these is better than that that's just

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.870 
on these is better than that that's just
that<00:05:45.300> is<00:05:45.480> the<00:05:45.660> biggest<00:05:45.870> difference<00:05:46.550> to<00:05:47.550> me<00:05:47.730> at

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
that is the biggest difference to me at

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.390 
that is the biggest difference to me at
least<00:05:48.060> just<00:05:48.750> cuz<00:05:48.930> it's<00:05:49.110> softer<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:50.070> I<00:05:50.160> like

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
least just cuz it's softer and I like

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.130 
least just cuz it's softer and I like
candlelight<00:05:50.970> and<00:05:51.150> has<00:05:51.330> that<00:05:51.570> kind<00:05:51.750> of<00:05:51.900> feels

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
candlelight and has that kind of feels

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.300 
candlelight and has that kind of feels
like<00:05:52.380> leathery<00:05:52.970> so<00:05:53.970> and<00:05:54.870> then<00:05:55.830> you<00:05:55.950> got<00:05:56.160> that

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
like leathery so and then you got that

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.620 
like leathery so and then you got that
this<00:05:56.670> thing<00:05:56.910> adds<00:05:57.120> lateral<00:05:57.630> support<00:05:57.920> so<00:05:58.920> this

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
this thing adds lateral support so this

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.230 
this thing adds lateral support so this
also<00:06:00.630> feels<00:06:01.020> really<00:06:01.260> nice<00:06:01.470> on<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:03.030> step

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
also feels really nice on the step

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.790 
also feels really nice on the step
pattern<00:06:03.450> is<00:06:03.810> obviously<00:06:04.170> just<00:06:04.260> standard

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
pattern is obviously just standard

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.760 
pattern is obviously just standard
bladed<00:06:05.220> standard<00:06:06.150> puma<00:06:06.480> thing<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:07.320> heel<00:06:07.530> ones

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
bladed standard puma thing the heel ones

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.350 
bladed standard puma thing the heel ones
are<00:06:07.920> different<00:06:08.340> but<00:06:08.760> these<00:06:08.970> ones<00:06:09.180> actually

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
are different but these ones actually

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.970 
are different but these ones actually
give<00:06:09.600> you<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.750> nice<00:06:09.900> stability<00:06:10.470> when<00:06:10.620> you<00:06:10.770> shoot

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
give you a nice stability when you shoot

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.460 
give you a nice stability when you shoot
because<00:06:11.910> when<00:06:12.150> you<00:06:12.240> plant<00:06:12.540> I<00:06:12.780> don't<00:06:13.200> know<00:06:13.290> they

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
because when you plant I don't know they

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.960 
because when you plant I don't know they
just<00:06:13.650> put<00:06:13.890> the<00:06:13.980> way<00:06:14.100> they<00:06:14.280> are<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.640> plinth

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
just put the way they are the plinth

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.490 
just put the way they are the plinth
they're<00:06:15.240> really<00:06:15.480> nice<00:06:15.630> and<00:06:15.980> the<00:06:16.980> bladed<00:06:18.500> just

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
they're really nice and the bladed just

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.110 
they're really nice and the bladed just
standard<00:06:19.920> you<00:06:20.160> know<00:06:20.310> Pumas<00:06:20.910> got<00:06:21.030> the

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
standard you know Pumas got the

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.210 
standard you know Pumas got the
anatomical<00:06:21.720> fit<00:06:21.930> which<00:06:22.140> is<00:06:22.380> size<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:23.040> mix

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
anatomical fit which is size and mix

sizing issues which super flies do not

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.260 
sizing issues which super flies do not
have<00:06:26.100> so<00:06:26.340> if<00:06:26.400> you're<00:06:26.520> thinking<00:06:26.550> about<00:06:26.820> online

have so if you're thinking about online
ordering<00:06:28.260> you<00:06:28.830> gotta<00:06:29.010> do<00:06:29.160> some<00:06:29.400> research<00:06:29.580> for

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
ordering you gotta do some research for

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.590 
ordering you gotta do some research for

your sizing and yeah and there's n come
some<00:06:33.870> people<00:06:34.110> don't<00:06:34.200> like<00:06:34.320> it<00:06:34.410> but<00:06:34.710> you'll<00:06:35.040> get

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
some people don't like it but you'll get

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.140 
some people don't like it but you'll get
used<00:06:35.250> to<00:06:35.490> it<00:06:35.580> in<00:06:35.850> the<00:06:35.910> shoe<00:06:36.840> 60<00:06:37.380> you<00:06:37.440> get<00:06:37.710> you

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
used to it in the shoe 60 you get you

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.990 
used to it in the shoe 60 you get you
get<00:06:38.300> used<00:06:38.510> to<00:06:38.570> it<00:06:38.660> and<00:06:39.040> then<00:06:40.040> but<00:06:40.400> traction

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
get used to it and then but traction

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.640 
get used to it and then but traction
these<00:06:41.360> come<00:06:41.570> pretty<00:06:41.750> high<00:06:41.930> up<00:06:41.960> at<00:06:42.230> oh<00:06:42.380> so<00:06:42.560> you

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
these come pretty high up at oh so you

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.130 
these come pretty high up at oh so you
get<00:06:42.800> some<00:06:42.830> good<00:06:43.160> traction<00:06:43.690> but<00:06:44.690> it's<00:06:44.960> not<00:06:45.110> the

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
get some good traction but it's not the

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.520 
get some good traction but it's not the
much<00:06:45.950> more<00:06:46.130> shallow<00:06:46.460> than<00:06:46.610> the<00:06:46.850> Super<00:06:47.000> Fly

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
much more shallow than the Super Fly

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.600 
much more shallow than the Super Fly
studs<00:06:48.530> which<00:06:48.740> are<00:06:48.860> much<00:06:48.980> longer<00:06:49.190> and<00:06:49.490> those

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
studs which are much longer and those

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.340 
studs which are much longer and those
things<00:06:49.790> are<00:06:50.060> beasts<00:06:50.450> the<00:06:50.630> grip<00:06:50.810> I'll<00:06:51.020> give<00:06:51.320> it
