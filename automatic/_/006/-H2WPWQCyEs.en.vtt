00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
it right pulling it through and going

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.200 
it right pulling it through and going
around<00:04:28.389> it<00:04:28.630> basically<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:30.520> try<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:31.030> try

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
around it basically and try to and try

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.080 
around it basically and try to and try
to<00:04:31.240> stay<00:04:31.570> as<00:04:31.690> close<00:04:31.900> as<00:04:32.290> as<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:33.280> last<00:04:33.550> ones<00:04:33.880> as

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
to stay as close as as the last ones as

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.150 
to stay as close as as the last ones as
you<00:04:34.180> had<00:04:34.389> for<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:35.229> the<00:04:35.350> other<00:04:35.500> twist<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:36.010> had

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
you had for like the other twist you had

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.690 
you had for like the other twist you had
before<00:04:36.810> close<00:04:37.810> as<00:04:37.960> possible<00:04:38.169> so<00:04:38.800> it's<00:04:39.250> you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
before close as possible so it's you

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.650 
before close as possible so it's you
know<00:04:39.820> close<00:04:40.060> right

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
know close right

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.900 
know close right
so<00:04:41.320> because<00:04:42.130> then<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.310> don't<00:04:42.490> want<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:42.729> get

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
so because then you don't want to get

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.080 
so because then you don't want to get
like<00:04:43.090> some<00:04:43.389> wire<00:04:44.080> in<00:04:44.380> between<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:45.550> like<00:04:45.910> you

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
like some wire in between you like you

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.820 
like some wire in between you like you
hurt<00:04:46.360> yourself<00:04:46.510> because<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.350> wire<00:04:47.530> cuz

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
hurt yourself because of the wire cuz

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.570 
hurt yourself because of the wire cuz
the<00:04:47.950> wire<00:04:48.160> at<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.400> ends<00:04:48.580> are<00:04:48.700> pretty<00:04:48.910> sharp<00:04:49.120> so

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
the wire at the ends are pretty sharp so

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.240 
the wire at the ends are pretty sharp so
yeah<00:04:51.580> I<00:04:51.760> just<00:04:51.820> I<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.330> just<00:04:52.690> try<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.080> keep<00:04:54.070> as

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
yeah I just I I just try to keep as

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
yeah I just I I just try to keep as
close<00:04:54.520> as<00:04:54.700> possible<00:04:55.620> so<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:56.680> guys<00:04:56.979> wanna<00:04:57.639> turn

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
close as possible so you guys wanna turn

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:11.700 
close as possible so you guys wanna turn
a<00:04:58.300> little<00:04:58.660> bit<00:04:58.840> here

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.620 

this<00:05:12.310> hopefully<00:05:12.820> should<00:05:12.880> be<00:05:13.240> more<00:05:13.480> than

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
this hopefully should be more than

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.140 
this hopefully should be more than
enough<00:05:14.140> once<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.890> covers<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.430> ring<00:05:15.640> since<00:05:16.030> I

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
enough once it covers the ring since I

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.550 
enough once it covers the ring since I
made<00:05:16.300> my<00:05:16.540> little<00:05:16.750> bit<00:05:16.930> short

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
made my little bit short

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.400 
made my little bit short
once<00:05:18.040> it<00:05:18.220> fully<00:05:18.460> covers<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.030> ring<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:20.380> can

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
once it fully covers the ring you can

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.990 
once it fully covers the ring you can
just<00:05:20.860> cut<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.220> off<00:05:21.400> from<00:05:21.550> there<00:05:21.790> you<00:05:21.910> don't

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
just cut it off from there you don't

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.240 
just cut it off from there you don't
want<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.300> have<00:05:22.450> it<00:05:22.600> like<00:05:22.750> too<00:05:22.960> thick<00:05:23.230> but<00:05:24.060> yeah
