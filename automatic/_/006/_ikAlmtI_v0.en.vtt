 not so with the game it works 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.789
 In any case I do not know that no 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.410
 the rubbish with the here and 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.450
 he does not notice that we practice it 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.310
 just a little bit so already 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.229
 simply better, so I'm better if 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.440
 So I'm schizophren so my wife 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.050

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.590
 then just better so bvb yes still 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:20.440
 not then just parallel here with 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.069
 wm ok go and pop as often as it goes yes 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.069
 very good 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.670
 under my mistake 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.079
 So it is definitely one that is 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.269
 one of the few games that mine 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.439
 watch on the blue chips player app 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.599
 player met 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.739
 I do not always know it 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.359
 go better than you were on the phone 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.530
 can use my buttons here 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:47.790
 look better and better than 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.590
 back and forth between I take everything 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:58.079
 back and claim the opposite way 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:06.239
 bad as I'm playing right now 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:08.760
 and there and i just tell myself i can 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.980
 because not much say I'm without 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.500
 words but then I have a question 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.480
 ever who goes with his hamster 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.250
 but walking is often seen 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.659
 so is the medium so little girls 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.780
 walk with a medium karnickel 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.340
 so go with dolls baby dare alone 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.720
 but is for the sake of the floor 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.650
 sanded that was not ordered 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.889
 hamster so I am I have it or 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.000
 guinea pigs do not really know 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.269
 good guinea pigs run by themselves 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.220
 always gone but a hamster a 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:42.389
 well, 171 points 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.159
 but that's right 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.470
 yes okay with it I can 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.609
 work well then we already have it 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.040
 Let's see what we can do 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.510
 because he still plays dapd with the evening 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.120
 do not know what's coming, the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.169
 I said to myself that I have never 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:07.260
 said so what can i can do dynamo 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:09.659
 play and you can tic tac toe are 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.329
 is boring 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.250
 with the pool was not here 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.769
 skyeurope skyeurope 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.099
 Morocco without so I can do that with the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.099
 audi gets 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:34.850
 is ok at the time is with the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.850
 make mouse 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.630
 I can actually do it the keys 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.230
 but that's not so good 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:48.870
 worked now eats the input 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:53.580
 with the mouse here so we can 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.410
 but then it also plays well it is one 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.790
 almost a small sparring round for 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.440
 I do not care so completely 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.700
 hard because the spd so play always right 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.790
 good but I've got my again 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.140
 problems and it gets full of flop though 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.430
 he does that when we do not do it together 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.410
 but I have played pretty much 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.620
 threatened to start afresh in succession 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.620
 10 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.020
 ok berlin is talking about it either or 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:22.070
 Play this is one of the pointers 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.070
 at last that is not possible 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:32.430
 that is still time there is 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:36.050
 either I can do that here 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:53.280
 if I either double hop or 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:54.750
 here holds then hops halt 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.330
 faster so in a row my 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:01.380
 species but has rather with heat so 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.900
 Of course, mathis takes a bit 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.460
 longer but you can be sure if you do 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.410
 then stop here all this little one 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.700
 bequeath all the games I play here 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.310
 can you if you like the latest version 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.470
 on your mobile phone you have to play or 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.840
 in the blood the advantage expresses the 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.389
 advantage in the case of the fc 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.740
 my opinion is also a bit 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.949
 annoying it is pretty switched on 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.530
 makes a new cover but you are 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:30.320
 always up to date 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:32.630
 100 meters and that's it 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.330
 Mine says a good point to say 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.010
 we are ready for today because that's how 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.250
 A daily beast is always there 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.660
 again short little place so he has 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.110
 also once again taken off there 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:49.729
 was the sport then quite helpful 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:52.250
 because here and it may rain 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:56.240
 I at opportunity since he is now junior 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.800
 is called on my facebook page or 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.070
 twitter depending on that I have both 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.400
 you would have the same in the end card 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.080
 comes in there where and when will 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.760
 I post something from time to time 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.229
 because i am playing now i am taking now 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.520
 up and then we can go there together 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.010
 So that works 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.039
 I hope so far this is still going on 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.690
 I suppose so yes either way 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.979
 the body can not be there anymore 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.330
 Now we are working together 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:21.979
 play or not be there 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.180
 put we try this before 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.979
 Of course we do not and so on 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.479
 well before I get here now 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:29.300
 continue and collar talk what I yes 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:31.669
 anyway I always say I just say 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.200
 See you next time and I hope you 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:33.740
 brings a lot of fun and a lot of joy and 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.849
 motivation 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.849
 bye bye
