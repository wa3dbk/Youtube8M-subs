ready for to up riding there's a little

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.109 
ready for to up riding there's a little
bit<00:01:23.080> of<00:01:23.170> storage<00:01:23.470> underneath<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:24.009> seat<00:01:24.220> where

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
bit of storage underneath the seat where

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.690 
bit of storage underneath the seat where
the<00:01:25.240> manual<00:01:25.540> is<00:01:25.689> located<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.460> where<00:01:27.640> you

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
the manual is located and where you

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.030 
the manual is located and where you
could<00:01:27.820> put<00:01:27.970> a<00:01:28.030> toolkit<00:01:28.650> doesn't<00:01:29.650> come<00:01:29.829> with<00:01:30.009> it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
could put a toolkit doesn't come with it

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.969 
could put a toolkit doesn't come with it
in<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.310> States<00:01:30.610> but<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.479> guess<00:01:31.659> you<00:01:32.530> can<00:01:32.680> order

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
in the States but I guess you can order

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.179 
in the States but I guess you can order
that<00:01:33.100> separately<00:01:33.700> from<00:01:33.820> Honda<00:01:34.979> let's<00:01:35.979> take<00:01:36.159> a

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
that separately from Honda let's take a

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.170 
that separately from Honda let's take a
look<00:01:36.369> at<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.549> electronics<00:01:38.790> you've<00:01:39.790> got<00:01:40.030> the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
look at the electronics you've got the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.859 
look at the electronics you've got the
speedometer<00:01:41.110> odometer<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:43.450> B<00:01:43.540> trip

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
speedometer odometer a and B trip

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.399 
speedometer odometer a and B trip
sensors

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.429 

you've<00:01:47.409> got<00:01:47.649> attack<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.729> then<00:01:49.259> fuel<00:01:50.259> capacity

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
you've got attack and then fuel capacity

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.569 
you've got attack and then fuel capacity
there<00:01:51.040> so<00:01:51.820> I've<00:01:51.909> got<00:01:52.060> 52<00:01:52.540> miles<00:01:52.780> on<00:01:53.049> mine<00:01:53.579> it's

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
there so I've got 52 miles on mine it's

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.440 
there so I've got 52 miles on mine it's
like<00:01:54.729> full<00:01:55.000> fuels<00:01:55.420> running<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.290> bit<00:01:56.469> low<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:58.119> I

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
like full fuels running a bit low but I

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.600 
like full fuels running a bit low but I
just<00:01:58.689> took<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:59.020> all<00:01:59.140> out<00:01:59.350> right<00:01:59.380> now<00:01:59.799> on<00:02:00.490> the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
just took it all out right now on the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.760 
just took it all out right now on the
way<00:02:00.729> home<00:02:00.969> so<00:02:01.780> I'll<00:02:02.079> just<00:02:02.200> do<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.350> quick<00:02:02.469> start

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
way home so I'll just do a quick start

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.010 
way home so I'll just do a quick start
up<00:02:02.860> for<00:02:03.040> you<00:02:03.100> guys

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
so you can see the bike is super quiet

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.889 
so you can see the bike is super quiet
compared<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.450> something<00:02:10.450> I've<00:02:10.569> shown<00:02:10.810> you

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
compared to something I've shown you

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.350 
compared to something I've shown you
guys<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.290> past<00:02:11.440> my<00:02:11.739> Harley<00:02:12.069> Sportster<00:02:12.540> so

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
guys in the past my Harley Sportster so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.460 
guys in the past my Harley Sportster so
really<00:02:16.360> fun<00:02:16.569> package<00:02:19.020> it'd<00:02:20.020> be<00:02:20.200> great<00:02:20.349> for

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
really fun package it'd be great for

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:32.600 
really fun package it'd be great for
beginner<00:02:21.099> riders<00:02:29.940> might<00:02:30.940> get<00:02:31.090> parts<00:02:31.420> galore

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
beginner riders might get parts galore

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.240 
beginner riders might get parts galore
already<00:02:33.610> I'm<00:02:33.880> thinking<00:02:34.590> these<00:02:35.590> reflectors

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
already I'm thinking these reflectors

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.400 
already I'm thinking these reflectors
don't<00:02:36.459> be<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.640> first<00:02:36.880> thing<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.150> go<00:02:37.299> as<00:02:38.110> well

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
don't be the first thing to go as well

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
don't be the first thing to go as well
as<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.180> little<00:02:40.739> tail<00:02:42.000> thingy<00:02:43.560> idiots<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.830> mean

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
as the little tail thingy idiots I mean

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.850 
as the little tail thingy idiots I mean
I<00:02:45.549> think<00:02:45.670> they<00:02:45.940> still<00:02:46.150> smaller<00:02:47.049> license<00:02:47.590> plate

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
I think they still smaller license plate

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.680 
I think they still smaller license plate
frames<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.900> could<00:02:50.019> hold<00:02:50.260> your<00:02:51.269> turn<00:02:52.269> signals

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
frames that could hold your turn signals

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.840 
frames that could hold your turn signals
as<00:02:52.840> well<00:02:54.660> exhausts<00:02:55.660> probably<00:02:56.110> on<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.319> list<00:02:56.850> as

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
as well exhausts probably on the list as

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:10.199 
as well exhausts probably on the list as
well<00:02:58.120> as<00:03:02.610> ranking<00:03:03.610> shift<00:03:04.120> levers<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:09.120> lot<00:03:10.120> of

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
well as ranking shift levers a lot of

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.960 
well as ranking shift levers a lot of
guys<00:03:10.359> are<00:03:10.769> even<00:03:11.769> changing<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.190> color<00:03:12.820> of
