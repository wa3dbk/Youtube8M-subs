00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the table last year and that seems to be

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.300 
the table last year and that seems to be
able<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.850> take<00:02:06.090> place<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.659> um<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.799> year<00:02:08.099> I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.639 
able to take place to be um this year I
had<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> problem<00:02:08.789> where<00:02:09.119> my<00:02:09.300> RS<00:02:09.690> audio<00:02:10.140> mic

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
had a problem where my RS audio mic

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.740 
had a problem where my RS audio mic
equipment<00:02:11.310> didn't<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:11.730> chips<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.300> was<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.720> a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
equipment didn't get chips so I was on a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.300 
equipment didn't get chips so I was on a
hard<00:02:13.050> table<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
hard table and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.680 
hard table and
that<00:02:14.370> was<00:02:14.520> really<00:02:14.700> scary<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.450> don't

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
that was really scary because you don't

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.540 
that was really scary because you don't
have<00:02:15.750> any<00:02:15.989> freedom<00:02:16.290> you're<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:17.069> know<00:02:17.160> roaming

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
have any freedom you're you know roaming

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.729 
have any freedom you're you know roaming
around<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.970> court<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:18.959> you've<00:02:19.530> done

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
around on court and you know you've done

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.490 
around on court and you know you've done
sideline<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.910> rs<00:02:21.630> stuff<00:02:21.900> before<00:02:22.290> that's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
sideline and rs stuff before that's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.839 
sideline and rs stuff before that's
really<00:02:22.770> hard<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> be<00:02:23.220> tethered<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.640> something

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
really hard to be tethered to something

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.510 
really hard to be tethered to something
trying<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> navigate<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:25.110> crowd<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:26.340> did

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
trying to navigate that crowd so we did

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.890 
trying to navigate that crowd so we did
the<00:02:26.640> best<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:26.910> could<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.480> thought<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.810> was

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the best we could but I thought it was

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.110 
the best we could but I thought it was
scary<00:02:28.200> for<00:02:28.260> coach<00:02:29.010> self<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.700> got<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.880> little

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
scary for coach self it got a little

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.540 
scary for coach self it got a little
while<00:02:30.300> down<00:02:30.540> there<00:02:30.720> should<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.380> allow<00:02:31.620> fans

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
while down there should be allow fans

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.130 
while down there should be allow fans

spontaneous joy of eruption that happens

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.220 
spontaneous joy of eruption that happens
I<00:02:41.340> think<00:02:42.330> they<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.660> do<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.080> more

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
I think they can do it in a more

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.229 
I think they can do it in a more
controlled<00:02:43.290> way<00:02:43.890> I've<00:02:44.280> been<00:02:44.459> at<00:02:44.610> some<00:02:44.819> courts

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
controlled way I've been at some courts

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.030 
controlled way I've been at some courts
where<00:02:45.420> they<00:02:45.569> put<00:02:45.810> up<00:02:45.900> kind<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.380> security

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
where they put up kind of a security

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.670 
where they put up kind of a security
corridor<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.630> coach<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.170> team<00:02:49.440> can

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
corridor so the coach and the team can

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.500 
corridor so the coach and the team can
get<00:02:49.799> off<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.069> floor<00:02:50.280> safety<00:02:50.760> thankfully

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
scoring record for them and it looks

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.449 
scoring record for them and it looks
like<00:03:25.230> fans<00:03:25.530> were<00:03:25.709> going<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:25.890> rush<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.190> court

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459
