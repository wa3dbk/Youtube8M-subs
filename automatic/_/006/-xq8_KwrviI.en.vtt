built<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.110> see

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
built in with here you go you can see

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.730 
built in with here you go you can see
there's<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.530> sub<00:01:10.860> woofer<00:01:11.250> built<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.180> oh<00:01:12.740> here

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
there's like sub woofer built in oh here

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.200 
there's like sub woofer built in oh here
we<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:13.920> 5<00:01:14.100> driver<00:01:14.640> speaker<00:01:15.090> system<00:01:17.210> 5

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
we go 5 driver speaker system 5

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.810 
we go 5 driver speaker system 5
dedicated<00:01:18.830> digital<00:01:19.830> amplifiers<00:01:20.400> two

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
dedicated digital amplifiers two

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910 
dedicated digital amplifiers two
tweeters<00:01:21.150> two<00:01:21.540> mid-range<00:01:21.810> drivers<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.740> one

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
tweeters two mid-range drivers in one

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.399 
tweeters two mid-range drivers in one
base<00:01:23.189> driver<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:24.299> accurate<00:01:24.720> oh<00:01:24.900> no<00:01:24.960> balance

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
base driver for accurate oh no balance

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.679 
base driver for accurate oh no balance
and<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.340> comes<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.420> it's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and so it comes with this well it's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.039 
and so it comes with this well it's
pretty<00:01:27.960> much<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.509> unit<00:01:30.840> one

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
pretty much one you know one unit one

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.530 
pretty much one you know one unit one

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
then we've got another one the zone

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
then we've got another one the zone
bridge<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.130> put<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.729> connect
