00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
from treyarch and of course I think they

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.160 
from treyarch and of course I think they
are<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.110> best<00:00:44.329> company<00:00:45.329> at<00:00:45.420> making<00:00:45.780> call<00:00:46.020> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
are the best company at making call of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.910 
are the best company at making call of
duty's<00:00:46.470> I<00:00:46.710> think<00:00:47.130> they<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.910> best

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
duty's I think they just have the best

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.440 
duty's I think they just have the best
feeling<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.160> game<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.520> best<00:00:50.670> skin<00:00:51.030> best

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
feeling to the game the best skin best

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.869 
feeling to the game the best skin best
textures<00:00:52.040> basically<00:00:53.040> I<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.309> love<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.700> look

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
textures basically I just love the look

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.970 
textures basically I just love the look
of<00:00:54.030> their<00:00:54.210> games<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> lot<00:00:55.829> better

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of their games I think it's a lot better

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
of their games I think it's a lot better
course<00:00:56.520> black<00:00:56.760> ops<00:00:56.940> 1<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.270> black<00:00:57.390> ops<00:00:57.629> 2<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
course black ops 1 and black ops 2 a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.770 
course black ops 1 and black ops 2 a
really<00:00:58.260> good<00:00:58.410> hits<00:00:58.850> probably<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.390> best

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
really good hits probably to the best

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.229 
really good hits probably to the best
Call<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> Duty's<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.250> honestly<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.820> think<00:01:02.969> they

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
Call of Duty's so honestly I think they

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.210 
Call of Duty's so honestly I think they
make<00:01:03.450> the<00:01:03.570> best<00:01:03.600> games<00:01:04.020> so<00:01:04.739> they're<00:01:04.920> making

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
make the best games so they're making

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.279 
make the best games so they're making
the<00:01:05.309> next<00:01:05.520> games<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.300> lot<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.509> it<00:01:06.750> there's

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
the next games and a lot of it there's

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.040 
the next games and a lot of it there's
been<00:01:07.440> a<00:01:07.500> lot<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.800> talk<00:01:08.130> about<00:01:08.310> them<00:01:08.869> black<00:01:09.869> ops

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
been a lot of talk about them black ops

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.309 
been a lot of talk about them black ops
3<00:01:10.440> or<00:01:10.770> modern<00:01:11.250> warfare<00:01:11.399> 4<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.149> think<00:01:13.110> they

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:13.319 
3 or modern warfare 4 I think they

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.469 
3 or modern warfare 4 I think they
shouldn't<00:01:13.649> go<00:01:13.679> into<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.160> future<00:01:14.429> black<00:01:14.940> ops<00:01:15.119> 3

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
shouldn't go into the future black ops 3

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.900 
shouldn't go into the future black ops 3
it<00:01:15.750> sounds<00:01:16.110> more<00:01:16.319> of<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.670> futuristic<00:01:17.670> kind

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
it sounds more of a futuristic kind

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.480 
it sounds more of a futuristic kind
Vance<00:01:18.390> warfare<00:01:18.990> take<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.069> don't<00:01:20.250> think

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
Vance warfare take but I don't think

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.219 
Vance warfare take but I don't think
they<00:01:20.819> should<00:01:20.850> go<00:01:21.090> any<00:01:21.390> further<00:01:21.720> into<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
they should go any further into the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.109 
they should go any further into the
future<00:01:22.410> because<00:01:22.979> it'll<00:01:23.280> turn<00:01:23.429> into<00:01:23.490> halo

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
future because it'll turn into halo

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.389 
future because it'll turn into halo
nobody<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.110> wants<00:01:25.349> to<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.649> halos<00:01:26.190> and

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
nobody really wants to have halos and

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.609 
nobody really wants to have halos and
then<00:01:26.550> people<00:01:26.819> like<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.840> already<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.319> mech

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
then people like it we already have mech

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.440 
then people like it we already have mech
suits<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.099> stuff<00:01:29.190> in<00:01:29.459> advanced<00:01:29.819> warfare<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
suits and stuff in advanced warfare that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
suits and stuff in advanced warfare that
makes<00:01:30.630> no<00:01:30.780> sense<00:01:30.810> we're<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.920> flying<00:01:32.280> around

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
makes no sense we're like flying around

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.730 
makes no sense we're like flying around
already<00:01:33.179> in<00:01:33.330> call<00:01:33.569> of<00:01:33.599> duty<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.619> they

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
already in call of duty I think they

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.219 
already in call of duty I think they
should<00:01:34.920> go<00:01:35.009> into<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> past<00:01:35.610> into<00:01:35.940> like<00:01:36.929> world

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
should go into the past into like world

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.520 
should go into the past into like world
war<00:01:37.410> three<00:01:37.860> World<00:01:38.640> War<00:01:39.000> 2<00:01:39.179> or<00:01:39.479> Vietnam<00:01:39.899> era<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
war three World War 2 or Vietnam era and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.859 
war three World War 2 or Vietnam era and
they<00:01:41.160> should<00:01:41.399> just<00:01:41.429> face<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.149> game<00:01:42.509> off<00:01:42.690> of

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
they should just face the game off of

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.680 
they should just face the game off of
that<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.319> then<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.099> this<00:01:44.280> feeling<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.360> black

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
that and then have this feeling of black

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.290 
that and then have this feeling of black
ops<00:01:45.720> 2<00:01:46.080> just<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.979> way<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.670> game<00:01:47.700> looked<00:01:48.149> in

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
ops 2 just the way the game looked in

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.240 
ops 2 just the way the game looked in
black<00:01:48.479> ops<00:01:48.599> 2<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:49.020> absolutely<00:01:49.560> phenomenal<00:01:49.679> I

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
black ops 2 was absolutely phenomenal I

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.960 
black ops 2 was absolutely phenomenal I
think<00:01:51.380> seems<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.709> Ghost<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.340> advanced

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
think seems like in Ghost and advanced

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.249 
think seems like in Ghost and advanced
warfare<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.989> seems<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.440> of<00:01:55.470> grayish<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
warfare it seems kind of grayish the

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.109 
warfare it seems kind of grayish the
saturation<00:01:58.259> seem<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.709> be<00:01:58.830> down<00:01:59.310> low<00:01:59.670> contrast

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
saturation seem to be down low contrast

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.109 
saturation seem to be down low contrast
