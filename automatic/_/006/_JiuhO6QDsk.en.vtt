Microsoft<00:01:11.400> thought<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:11.850> hate<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.900> fix

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
Microsoft thought they hate we can fix

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.620 
Microsoft thought they hate we can fix
it<00:01:13.439> even<00:01:13.790> even<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.030> already<00:01:15.240> been<00:01:15.330> fixed

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
it even even if it's already been fixed

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.539 
it even even if it's already been fixed
and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.020> they<00:01:16.080> end<00:01:16.259> up<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.680> breaking

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and then they end up actually breaking

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.880 
and then they end up actually breaking
it<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.150> broken<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.110> they<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> fix<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it so it's broken so they have to fix it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
it so it's broken so they have to fix it
again<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.400> makes<00:01:20.759> no<00:01:20.850> sense<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.360> could<00:01:21.720> have

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
again it makes no sense they could have

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.420 
again it makes no sense they could have
solved<00:01:22.049> themselves<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.439> lot<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.890> trouble<00:01:23.280> if

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
solved themselves a lot of trouble if

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.929 
solved themselves a lot of trouble if
they<00:01:24.020> actually<00:01:25.020> went<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.310> xbox<00:01:26.340> one

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
they actually went back for the xbox one

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.440 
they actually went back for the xbox one
they<00:01:27.420> went<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.110> 360<00:01:28.970> party<00:01:29.970> system<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
they went to the 360 party system and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
they went to the 360 party system and
all<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.689> stuff<00:01:30.810> maybe<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.710> fancier

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
all that stuff maybe with some fancier

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.240 
all that stuff maybe with some fancier
logos<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.090> hasta<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.140> did<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> no<00:01:35.070> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
logos and hasta it just did that no this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.230 
logos and hasta it just did that no this
will<00:01:35.369> ever<00:01:35.490> happen<00:01:35.610> they<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
will ever happen they don't have to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.760 
will ever happen they don't have to
patch<00:01:36.450> or<00:01:36.720> anything<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:39.049> man<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
was probably one big biggest thing that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.710 
was probably one big biggest thing that
had<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.229> gripe<00:01:43.590> about<00:01:44.450> here's<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> other

had to gripe about here's the other
things<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.229> probably<00:01:46.560> not<00:01:46.710> gonna<00:01:46.920> patch

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
