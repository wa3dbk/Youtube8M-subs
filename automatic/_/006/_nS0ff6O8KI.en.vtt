00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.340
 today what I want to talk about the 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.450
 templates my house 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.010
 some insoles for knitting 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.070
 They are extremely resistant 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.180
 and apart from being tough they are super 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.180
 comfortable since the template comes 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.180
 cushioned 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 and I want you to see 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.340
 that when you stretch your shoe 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.860
 it does not come off 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.860
 what makes it extremely resistant 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.610
 sample 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.930
 and now I want you to see 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.930
 these templates that do not have 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.410
 nothing bad but in comparison to the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.010
 knitting soles 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.010
 well 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.320
 before 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.320
 it breaks 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.980
 they break very easily 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.340
 this means that we can only 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.750
 use at home and state if we can 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.560
 use to walk on the street 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.159
 another sample 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.159
 leave it alone 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.700
 threw 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.950
 and the plant is stuck to the sole 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.799
 it does much more 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.640
 so that once you have certain 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.560
 shoes 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.390
 really worth bringing 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.920
 good shoes 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.920
 facts of soil 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.720
 thank you visit the facebook page mica 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.720
