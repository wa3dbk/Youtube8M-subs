00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.109
 and in the conversation with my guests there arose a topic that I think 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:09.130
 interesting to be present tonight the conversation for you and complicated 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.510
 because without a doubt we all recognize tri that copper is still the pillar engine 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.870
 of the economy and what since the year 2006 finale of 2005 1006 2007 is the one that 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.510
 allows the country to have the Mallorcan bierzo dollars and where obviously 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.980
 that those dollars also allow a better quality of life to a sector of the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.450
 population in the social assistance that the state can do and also for the 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.100
 growth and investment research sectors 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.610
 It should be noted that copper is so important that if you do not measure the point 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.660
 numerical view a penny means that for the Chilean state if its time remained 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.140
 about 300 million 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.420
 they took out story that of what is happening with the transantiago the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.420
 importance that copper and prisoner can mean internationally 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.770
 well let's touch this topic 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.450
 in the past program spoke that the natural resource is that the pillar of the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.520
 Chilean economy and if we want to have a developing country it was 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.650
 developed we have to look for another figure the point of view of our 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.020
 exports and if we have the copper why not do what they have done great 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.270
 countries like Finland and others where they have had benefits from the point of 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.500
 view p the metal and in that sense I invite you to stay bacchanal 22 for 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.600
 talk about this matter with my guests where we will try 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.690
 is going to be an entertaining program and also quique in you with the patería 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.770

 here 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.729
 and also linked 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.830
 Aprocom of fat for accompanying us thank you 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.390

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.640
 to take us to look for him 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.490
 understandings and that was called a different line than what we have lived 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.910
 d matter our copper and businesses thank you very much for inviting the sun 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.920
 the copper is present in this table in the conversation 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.810
 and through the images I invite you to see 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.810
 to you the following images 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.719
 one of the pillars of the national economy 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.099
 the main generator of foreign exchange in these fiscal acts 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.939
 this time is the large number of applications here 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.109
 thus only in the field of research and development were invested during the 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.269
 2006 markit 10 million dollars 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.439
 projects that already bear fruit the automotive industry could have a 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.340
 revolution thanks to its electric transmission engine for cars and 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.549
 orders that provides eight kilos plus copper in relation to the hotel 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.549
 the traditional 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:12.259
 star of Chinese exports that period of growth given by 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.259
 families 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.919
 he had more tino martínez and his looks instantly 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.009
 and it is precisely access to this 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.139
 who will certify 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.979
 as the first with properties 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.419
 While it is true 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.419

 Caesar infected and bow 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.979
 and here goes hand in hand with the un 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.189

 units for our country 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.229
 pamela our journalist who was commissioned this note leaves us 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.820
 a very clear question 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.570
 we will be ready for the challenge but before that answer to me 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.910
 would like in this table will be able to do an analysis in nancy liked 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.289
 about is the real situation of what is happening 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.759
 with copper international markets 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.360
 there is talk of important economic growth which is why it is the best 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.099
 transaction that is taking place 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.249
 company in the london metal exchange the juiciest to cover 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.599
 what anger and with respect to the 60s the metal point of view 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.539
 well i can answer you what is happening in chile 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.330
 when we initiate percent these metal promotion campaigns 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.570
 in the year 1989, a per capita consumption 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:04.669
 discovery 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.189
 d falls 2 kilograms 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.689
 and in the course of this whole period we have worked since the year 90 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:13.879
 little 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.629
 the four kilograms per capita which means 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.509
 who set aside our consumption and what in comparative terms with 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.539
 developed countries of the development of our country are a 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:32.509
 country of high consumption in terms of the eco and refined we are the country that 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.800
 has no higher consumption 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.900
 of Latinamerica 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.080
 that the point of view of the international markets liked 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.069
 in the year 2000 the 60s in us 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.430
 we produced 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.499
 ten times less than now 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:48.629
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.639
 so no debt and asking all of them said that the production would look 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.639
 a little 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.740
 There was also a possibility that Bolivia markets 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.950
 I remember we are five or six years ago the weight was very low and they were 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.030
 few mining companies that remained operating in many states 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.419
 united closed etc. 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.190
 this allowed the best is the production 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.370
 percent in prices and the search for markets that were not 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.580
 satisfactory for the sins that serrano 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.540
 the sixties bland 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.559
 percent the world knows a lot less copper than now and 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.559
 ee uu sada of the order of less than half 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.430
 less than half the copper that is used now its savings in santa 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.430
 and therefore obviously the production was also lower 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.440
 percent if you read was then the second country 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:42.499
 most important the world in delta production of united states 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.159
 he was the first away 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:48.119
 there is a substantial difference what I wanted 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.119
 has progressed in these 45 years 

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:55.699
 three times bigger than the united states 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:56.930
 four months 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.659
 bigger than the second 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.399
 then we were 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.580
 percent so I would say there's one of 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.580
 clement imposes an important element 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.520
 the one that he uses copper today is of the order of 17 million tons in the world 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.520
 hitcher produces 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.430
 a little less than 6 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.430
 the day and 2 million tons that are recycled 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:25.409
 that expire from the scrap 10 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:29.180
 because before Chile it produces more than a third of the world's copper mine 

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:32.409
 it's an extraordinary thing 

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:35.089
 and second, it was a situation of pressure 

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:36.339
 and the price 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:40.229
 I think it's not a matter of looking at a particular year because the price has 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:41.759
 cycles 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.899
 and we have cycles of the alleged origin 

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:48.080
 as far back as one wants to look at the market 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.910
 since the 19th century 

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.249
 even the 18th century 

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:55.309
 he was injured in the market was relatively small 

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:57.699
 started with 10 thousand tons of copper 

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:00.699
 worldwide today we have 17 million 

00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:03.299
 and there is no shortage there is enough
