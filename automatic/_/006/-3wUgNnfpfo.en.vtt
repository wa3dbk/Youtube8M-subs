00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.160
 well found by alessio grosso therefore 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.680
 italy get ready to ride lightning 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.660
 and storms because it is from northern Europe 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.540
 arriving a mass of cold air that 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.790
 between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.040
 will invade the whole country and then continue 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.440
 to insist at least until Friday here 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.329
 the merciless synoptic analysis with the high 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.030
 pressure here in the west of the continent 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.159
 that leaves just one corridor 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.920
 narrow corridor to cold currents 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.140
 those blue vectors that run right 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.180
 sharply on the Mediterranean 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.549
 central there is already a first cold front 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.500
 what tomorrow will go through a bit 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.299
 all of Italy this synoptic map is 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.250
 scheduled for Wednesday but the situation 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.159
 it will be similar let's say until Friday 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.860
 other impulses will come thankfully 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.930
 of the north will impact the bow 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.360
 alpine but still the cold air will flounder 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.549
 forming thunderstorms especially at 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.380
 central south and north east 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.119
 the most protected air in the northwest and 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.430
 sardinia but we will all have to that 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.750
 deal with a severe drop in the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.060
 temperatures 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.280
 let's see then what kind of clouds 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.170
 we will meet on Tuesday afternoon 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.180
 these will be found both in the val 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.790
 Padana is then along the middle Adriatic 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.159
 but they will also break into the Tyrrhenian Sea 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.260
 then heading towards the south 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.960
 these are temporals these are also 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.390
 hailstorms and gusts of wind and I repeat 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.909
 thermal shock then pay attention to how 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.620
 you dress the expected rainfall 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.810
 just Tuesday afternoon 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.280
 you see the blue thunderstorms that you are 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.110
 direct this is the cold front 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.750
 we also designed that track 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.580
 in black the currents that precede more 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.979
 mild and wet from the west and those that 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.780
 they follow colder from north north east than 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.400
 will go to activate these strict i 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.470
 storm cores that will strike 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.690
 I repeat tomorrow north and center and then 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.330
 will also affect the south 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.090
 between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.280
 in short, all of Italy visited and behind 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.620
 at the cold front look at the cold air 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.019
 the temperatures that will be recorded 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.569
 Wednesday morning at dawn also values 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.549
 between 6 and 8 degrees 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.829
 Val Padana therefore it will be cold cover you 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.540
 especially on Wednesdays but cold weather 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.310
 it will also invade other regions 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.930
 we are talking about a cold beetle 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.730
 therefore it is not that it will make an intense cold 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.530
 but we are used to it at temperatures 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.639
 definitely spring we will take a step 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.219
 back 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:38.170
 a step back that will continue for 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.150
 then the whole week there will be a 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.349
 improvement over the weekend but 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.349
 let's see better in detail 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.409
 then let's start now with the summaries 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.269
 Tuesday is probably the day 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.870
 worst for all with showers and 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.609
 temporal 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.379
 here they are not well highlighted but there 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.359
 they will also be north of the species 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.579
 triveneto then come to the center in the 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.590
 afternoon evening and then into the night too 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.900
 on the south first on the Molise 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.750
 then on the Puglia then on all the south 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.579
 accompanied by an important I repeat 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.989
 thermal drop and a reinforcement of the 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.209
 ventilation 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.299
 let's see the day now 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.609
 next with the time that is released but 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.680
 remains uncertain I repeat again along the 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.629
 Adriatic regions in the south with risk of 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.579
 further showers in the afternoon 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.620
 some thunderstorms could reactivate 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.709
 reactivate between Brescia the Garda the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.530
 Veronese with local hailed again 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.049
 I will repeat it rather cold 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.459
 let's see now to understand the rest of the 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.889
 week the remaining part of the 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.169
 week with a quick summary then 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.819
 Tuesday and Wednesday with all 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.389
 this instability that moves from the north 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.579
 South 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.560
 then again insists on the central regions 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.049
 southern still between Thursday and Friday 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.090
 slowly over the weekend it regains the 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.049
 good weather and also a rise in the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.340
 temperatures but already Monday Monday 19 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.229
 new weather this time 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.509
 probably located at 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:07.419
 north and on Tuscany but we will have 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:09.579
 time to talk about it again in the edition of 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.769
 Friday in the meanwhile weekend 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.169
 here is the time that we will then experience from 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.939
 Wednesday in the Po valley with these skies 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.560
 beautiful these wonderful tremors 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.419
 due to currents from the north that there 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.709
 they will also show the mountains and beyond 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.020
 over there look at what 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.669
 will happen in Austria in Switzerland and also 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.159
 on high border areas 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.199
 valtellina with alto adige splashes of 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:32.090
 snow will seem winter north of the alps 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.100
 for those who are headed for work know it 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.449
 Mondays and Thursdays in the wind and snow 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.280
 Carinthia in Styria in Switzerland 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.110
 GraubÃ¼nden so be careful cover yourself 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.919
 will be a crazy week see you 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.820
 Friday 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.820
 see you soon from alessio grosso
