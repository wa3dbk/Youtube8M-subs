day and for the entirety of ice lake and
really<00:00:15.360> all<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.690> means<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.320> can't<00:00:16.619> use

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
really all that means is you can't use

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.189 
really all that means is you can't use
any<00:00:17.609> gadgets<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> get<00:00:19.140> a

any gadgets so it's going to get a
little<00:00:19.350> when<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:20.220> get<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> little<00:00:20.609> used<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.710> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
little when I get a little used to the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.290 
little when I get a little used to the
steer<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.430> cannot<00:00:23.640> turn<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.000> traction

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
steer is you cannot turn on traction

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
steer is you cannot turn on traction
control<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.930> can't<00:00:25.170> use<00:00:25.350> your<00:00:25.380> weapons<00:00:25.830> can't

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
control you can't use your weapons can't

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.640 
control you can't use your weapons can't
use<00:00:26.250> anything<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.670> gotta<00:00:26.939> drive<00:00:27.650> drive

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
like a madman so the first area is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.010 
like a madman so the first area is
pretty<00:00:32.910> easy<00:00:33.180> that's<00:00:33.540> gonna<00:00:33.660> they're<00:00:33.930> gonna

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
pretty easy that's gonna they're gonna

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.860 
pretty easy that's gonna they're gonna
throw<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.320> couple<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:38.030> bombs<00:00:39.030> i<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.660> ecchi

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
throw a couple of bombs i think ecchi

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.990 
throw a couple of bombs i think ecchi
eventually<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.010> you're<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.579> trying

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
eventually right now you're just trying

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.910 
eventually right now you're just trying
to<00:00:42.210> steer<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.160> three<00:00:44.579> sections<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
to steer and it's in three sections and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
to steer and it's in three sections and
you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.070> reload<00:00:47.489> checkpoints<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.180> had<00:00:48.390> Duke<00:00:48.660> so

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you can reload checkpoints I had Duke so

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.540 
you can reload checkpoints I had Duke so
there's<00:00:49.440> no<00:00:49.559> worries<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
there's no worries there you get a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.119 
there's no worries there you get a
section<00:00:50.969> clean<00:00:52.070> don't<00:00:53.070> worry<00:00:53.250> about<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
section clean don't worry about it I

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.470 
section clean don't worry about it I
guess<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> first<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.850> driving<00:00:57.090> out

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
guess the first one is just driving out

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.520 
guess the first one is just driving out
the<00:00:57.600> other<00:00:57.690> they're<00:00:57.989> gonna<00:00:58.109> throw<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.350> couple

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the other they're gonna throw a couple

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.149 
the other they're gonna throw a couple
of<00:00:58.680> rockets<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.190> us<00:01:02.719> who<00:01:03.719> spin<00:01:04.500> out<00:01:04.680> threat

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
of rockets at us who spin out threat

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.190 
of rockets at us who spin out threat

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.069 

but<00:01:19.009> I'm<00:01:19.549> detecting<00:01:20.060> an<00:01:20.240> energy<00:01:20.630> spike<00:01:20.869> from

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
but I'm detecting an energy spike from

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.919 
but I'm detecting an energy spike from
the<00:01:21.200> interest<00:01:22.179> bouncing<00:01:23.179> off<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.329> walls<00:01:23.630> I

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
the interest bouncing off the walls I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.179 
the interest bouncing off the walls I
was<00:01:24.109> good<00:01:25.630> laser<00:01:26.630> beams<00:01:26.960> obviously<00:01:27.679> don't

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
was good laser beams obviously don't

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.279 
was good laser beams obviously don't
drive<00:01:28.429> through<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.759> laser<00:01:29.000> beams<00:01:31.960> on<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.200> the

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
drive through the laser beams on to the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.899 
drive through the laser beams on to the
next<00:01:33.469> Icarus<00:01:33.890> strike<00:01:34.159> will<00:01:34.340> be<00:01:34.459> picked<00:01:34.700> up<00:01:34.850> by

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
next Icarus strike will be picked up by

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:47.359 
next Icarus strike will be picked up by
your<00:01:35.209> threat<00:01:35.450> detection<00:01:35.840> system

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.230 

okay<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:48.429> that<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.700> section<00:01:49.329> one<00:01:49.689> complete

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.510 

and<00:01:53.360> then<00:01:54.079> Giles<00:01:54.439> going<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.770> take<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.070> out<00:01:55.100> and

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
and then Giles going to take you out and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.069 
and then Giles going to take you out and
again<00:01:55.820> it's<00:01:56.000> going<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.210> tell<00:01:56.329> you<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.689> activate

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
again it's going to tell you to activate

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.130 
again it's going to tell you to activate
your<00:01:57.380> weapons<00:01:57.939> do<00:01:58.939> not<00:01:58.970> do<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.110> just

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
your weapons do not do that you just

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.670 
your weapons do not do that you just
gotta<00:02:00.500> kind<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:00.829> dodge<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:02.479> try<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.290> keep<00:02:03.470> up

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
gotta kind of dodge and try to keep up

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.320 
gotta kind of dodge and try to keep up
with<00:02:03.740> them<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:05.210> really<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.939> gotta<00:02:08.090> dodge

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
with them and really you gotta dodge

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.749 
with them and really you gotta dodge
like<00:02:08.720> these<00:02:08.899> rocket<00:02:09.410> back<00:02:09.769> lock<00:02:10.039> rockets<00:02:10.580> and

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
like these rocket back lock rockets and

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.150 
like these rocket back lock rockets and
he<00:02:10.819> also<00:02:10.970> drop<00:02:11.330> some<00:02:11.599> minds<00:02:12.080> it's<00:02:12.890> not<00:02:12.980> too

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
he also drop some minds it's not too

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.890 
he also drop some minds it's not too
hard<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:14.000> problem<00:02:14.269> is<00:02:14.360> really<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
hard the problem is really the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.040 
hard the problem is really the
opportunity<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.980> finally<00:02:16.220> take<00:02:16.519> him<00:02:16.700> out

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
opportunity to finally take him out

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.259 
opportunity to finally take him out
comes<00:02:18.050> very<00:02:18.440> quickly<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.819> what<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.090> need<00:02:20.209> to

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
comes very quickly and what you need to

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.240 
comes very quickly and what you need to
do<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.480> then<00:02:20.720> just<00:02:21.019> finally<00:02:21.290> make<00:02:21.680> contact

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
do is then just finally make contact

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.960 
do is then just finally make contact
with<00:02:22.519> him<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.880> hit<00:02:23.420> him<00:02:24.549> but<00:02:25.549> you<00:02:25.670> don't<00:02:25.850> have

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
with him and hit him but you don't have

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.240 
with him and hit him but you don't have
a<00:02:26.030> lot<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.239> time<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:26.810> if<00:02:27.019> he<00:02:27.170> manages<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.890> throw

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
a lot of time so if he manages to throw

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.580 
a lot of time so if he manages to throw
something<00:02:28.640> at<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:30.080> don't<00:02:30.230> get<00:02:30.560> a
