00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.660
 hey ho people gets a new one 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.880
 Video 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.889
 today it's about the 30 day question because 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.719
 I was left by the funky day 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.859
 is in the description and I would like 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.390
 not talk about it much now 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.640
 I want to start with the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.320
 first question and that laptop or 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.600
 computer 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.369
 yes, I actually had the biggest one 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.670
 part of my life you only in the computer 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.070
 I have no idea now 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.829
 a year or so a laptop well 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.170
 if anything, I have a laptop first 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.610
 and computer-see stop is much better 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.760
 you have a lot more performance has a lot more 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.739
 make is just the only advantage 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.879
 on the laptop I therefore see that one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.840
 mobile is so that's why computer has 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.640
 many advantages 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.350
 in my opinion good second question 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.260
 mcdonald's or burger king 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.730
 i think mcdonald's better i know 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.730
 not somehow always better then 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.260
 I like it now 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.460
 never there so I'm mega rare only 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.760
 still there third question deo roller or deo 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.060
 spray I use if then only ever 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.540
 the spray so no eyes I know 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.520
 I have never used and I have never 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.000
 I think I will not necessarily 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.090
 do so apples or strawberries 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.680
 I think strawberries are better so can I. 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.979
 somehow find the taste better that way 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.689
 a bit of sweetish cats or dogs 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.509
 dogs in any case 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.220
 I find it often finds and how sweeter 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.869
 and if you can do it a bit 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.070
 what 's up for giving girls and I think 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.600
 that many certainly blonde or brown yes 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.450
 it just always depends on it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.270
 always fit the type 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.399
 sweet food or hearty food 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.290
 hearty food so with me is now 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.219
 so maybe I need something like that 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.469
 I could be vegetarian or vegan 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.329
 at least for the next few years 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.710
 not imagine because I am 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.380
 so i'm totally on meat lego or 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.470
 definitely playmobil my whole 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.680
 childhood i had lego and that's why 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.390
 yes i never had playmobil nike or 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.260
 Actually, I know that adidas 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.080
 both because they are not iphone or 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.270
 samsung galaxy i got samsung 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.610
 galaxy but i know so i find one 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.020
 also cool i do not know yet 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.550
 not what I want my next 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.510
 whether she will be the samsung or 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.190
 an iphone 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.880
 I can not force myself there either 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.710
 I totally do not know that 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.230
 party or chill I am not now 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.140
 so crass the party guy chillig 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.000
 So that's why they prefer me 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.220
 just nice now because i just 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.440
 Not so the box office party types are 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.140
 It's really cool but I have to do that now 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.060
 not so party does not last so much each 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.240
 second weekend every weekend away 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.340
 I do not need to go so subway 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.570
 or casey i can not say that to me 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.920
 was never with both 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.150
 Unfortunately , that's not possible in our city 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.890
 left or right-handed right-handed 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.519
 cola or fanta or horror or 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.580
 love movies i am from both now 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.250
 not really that big fan i am 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.750
 more action type so no idea 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.430
 the golden middle I say now times 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.220
 nintendo or playstation alright me 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.200
 actually do not gamble console except 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.250
 xbox rarely but or even just goes 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.830
 that's why he's not too cold just five 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.350
 computer so at computer countries none 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.510
 new nikon 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.970
 even I have no camera of those 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.250
 but I have to recognize each one 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.670
 already heard so much better and 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.050
 that's why when I say something like that 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.720
 I would not have to judge myself 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.600
 because I never do anything like that because I like that 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.100
 not exactly because I never had such a thing 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.870
 so from what I've heard 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.180
 know here or dvds so I think cinema 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.740
 also much hornier this atmosphere there and 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.450
 so I think that's really cool in the cinema 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.790
 I also really like to go to the cinema 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.100
 friends and to christmas or 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.640
 birthday 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.070
 I'm better to know birthday 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.500
 that is somehow more personal 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.630
 Christmas is kind of like now 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.790
 not really with me what to do it 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.110
 is I do not know 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.700
 has at all so with the family 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.210
 really nothing private and 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:41.520
 personal therefore dear birthday 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.650
 So yes, if I'm gambling or skating 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.660
 I would have to decide now 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.190
 longboard he would say 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.680
 I would take it longboard so first 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:55.110
 apply night or day of summer if 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.420
 the sun shines day or day 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.890
 single i say it is both 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.890
 really very good benefits 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.980
 yes, but actually more 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.290
 relationship disney or looney tunes was 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.660
 I've never had looney tunes 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.590
 So rather disney apple or 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.670
 Microsoft 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.800
 I had never somehow now 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:23.570
 imac or something or macbook or something 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.540
 is bathing or showering because of microsoft 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.880
 I never go to shower ground batman or 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.650
 I think spiderman batman is a lot cooler 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.370
 because the holder is really everything 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.830
 and the others moan all the way 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.720
 the forces that help, and so on 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.320
 I think batman is better, too 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.669
 I think every film corridor or something 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.990
 dunkin donuts or starbucks i was 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.630
 neither can ever do so either way 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.210
 do not judge that 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.280
 starbucks valley is always so coffee and 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.180
 so I do not drink any coffee coffee 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.620
 not but I can not judge it 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.790
 I do not know what fits but also 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.550
 Otherwise , I was there with both 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.810
 never asked hair or cap 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.060
 are styled hair 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.280
 i dont know i like with anything at all 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.919
 not even in winter or otherwise 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:13.240
 What I never wear a cap manga or 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:14.949
 comics I really read nothing nothing 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.310
 I have planned but maybe 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:20.800
 start reading a few books though 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.810
 I have not made it yet 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.100
 youtube or watch TV here on everyone 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.050
 If you have youtube you always have that 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.880
 choice because you want to watch something and 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.590
 does not insist on so extremely long advertising 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.539
 not somehow so 10 15 minutes advertising 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:37.930
 between getting in between now 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.250
 everyone followed but i watched tv 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.470
 That's always in the middle of it and not 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.770
 only good after each succession 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:47.310
 there are always the former 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:51.270
 as on youtube or mostly but no matter 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.440
 Well those were the 30 questions 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:58.120
 Now I have to look at the carpet 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.440
 because I wear I do not even know me 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.750
 Do not know if they already do 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:08.680
 just done it 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:11.199
 date lps dj tom and those yet 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.789
 thinks I think that's it I'm always 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:17.169
 so you have to meet three days but that is 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:19.990
 yes not so good i day date lps 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.789
 and dj tom so thanks for watching 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.639
 if you liked it did not rate 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:26.860
 forget and see you then 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:30.900
 hopefully at the next video so 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.900
 then see you next time
