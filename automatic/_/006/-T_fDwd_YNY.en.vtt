00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.750
 after five months I got the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.790
 opalÃ£o this here for those who do not know 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.929
 one for the ps 79 4 cylinders is the dashboard 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 it was all broken in this 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.170
 part of the air here 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.109
 is missing the pieces that normally 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.230
 where it usually breaks 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.989
 in this control of the direction of the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.600
 air of the windshield and what I did is me 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.410
 I switched the whole panel show for a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.660
 mask of one and if the paulo is the 79, I am 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.620
 I switched to the paula panel mask 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.460
 69 What happens in this piece here that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.010
 has the adjustment of the year to driver 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.320
 to breeze 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.579
 he has a small aquino hole of the 79 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.300
 for the logo of the diar 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.659
 to the windshield exactly where it breaks 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.510
 So what I did I got from 169 that 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.330
 this piece of inter he has a 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:18.330
 little more resistance to power 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:21.960
 to be able to move and also that more 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.080
 I had a radio or I preferred to 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.240
 original radio that is the normal one 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.970
 came the radio and gives me the same chevrolet 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:38.490
 that radio that motown rs m31 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.009
 radio as the car already had the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.570
 loud speakers on the door I preferred 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:49.890
 put the radio fm even if it was stereo 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:53.810
 to operate on both channels the door 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:59.030
 new also did not have a huge hole 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.030
 I did not have that cardboard here from the bottom 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.969
 a radio including a straw coffee 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.690
 in rank out of all that old party 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.400
 wiring in a very precarious state without 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.380
 could have given a nice short 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.300
 circuit 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.910
 God, it was not the case, that's all. 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.870
 finally the only adaptation I had to 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.310
 do over there is the 69 panel were is 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.460
 that 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.720
 these players here from the 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:38.340
 This part is here 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 the panel teaches it is equal to that of the 69 and 79 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.170
 this fund base is totally equal to 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.630
 Only thing that piece that goes 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.570
 fit right up 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.850
 so what I make my choice 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:57.510
 Efisa itches there pasting upon 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.580
 690 divergence panel did not have any 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.550
 in this panel of 69 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.760
 I made a cut here, huh? 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:15.600
 this piece and finally I did everything 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:17.780
 everything insertion had normally is this 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.780
 there 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.050
 there what I call modifying in the panel 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.850
 in case 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.110
 I was seeing that the old opals 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.540
 they have a problem with the lighting is 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.570
 so that I did it I particularly myself 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.780
 I opted to put a led 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:41.630
 the result was super good that I 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.630
 I just let the flash off 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.110
 Now I go, I'm going to turn the panel on. 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.540
 you see how you have an idea 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.540
 how was his lighting with led 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:05.400
 this was the result of led 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:09.000
 it was much more expensive the panel for a 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.650
 relatively low cost because it is 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.560
 a final meter is to be able to do the 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.650
 all panel of him right? 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.030
 what I did I put the led around 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.570
 of the two dials here on the display 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.330
 Arctic is a bit dark on video 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.669
 phone as a result 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.740
 So let's say next to the 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:37.909
 as the relatively low light 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:42.469
 however they must in the live venom and 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:46.270
 colors with a bit more light than this is 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:46.270
 the radio also i put a led tape 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:57.469
 and it was very clear in the video also does not give 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.770
 to have such a good idea but it stayed 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.770
 pretty cool 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.500
 became clear it was very close to the well 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:14.500
 gives the original coloring of the illumination and 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:20.560
 It was very good, it was very cool, leaving. 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.560
 now cases of vehicle indication 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:36.080
 these are the battery oil lights 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:43.490
 headlamp flashing arrows may 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:46.219
 to come here works the alert to 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.300
 the boss of the owner of the flashing alert 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.629
 red 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.879
 but according to the 36 years of use of this 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.129
 her car probably will only have 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.629
 sold off 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.300
 so I 'll have to do it, I'll have to 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.889
 change a led by a red color 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.900
 because the led that the white led yard 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.759
 I found it by the back and red it 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.729
 it would turn red but it did not stay 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:16.960
 I'm going to show you it was clear, though. 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.960
 not with red 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.910
 that's what this was the result of the panel 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.910
 from paulo 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.300
 a hug
