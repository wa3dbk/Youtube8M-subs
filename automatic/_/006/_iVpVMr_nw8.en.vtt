00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.679
 the end of summer and the beginning of autumn is the time 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.230
 to put the garden in order to harvest 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.390
 collected and nothing prevents propagate and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.109
 we will replant bushes today 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.109
 work with gooseberry 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.130
 please tell me full how 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.510
 prepare the gooseberries correctly 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.380
 pit here pits size probably 50 to 30 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.129
 Here we lay the compost will enter height 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.280
 fertilizer with such a fertilizer we need 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.700
 comprehensive 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.300
 nitrogen to phosphorus-potassium to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.190
 roots are rooted to the ground prepared 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.950
 for growth that's why I used 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.510
 complex fertilizer glass at home 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.940
 grapes after fertilizing for killing for 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.690
 what do we need ash like fertilizer like 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.960
 damps the soil sour here almost you 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.119
 acid soil 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.720
 Now I will mix all the bucket of water 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.720
 see 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:20.370
 then we take q and put it in water 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:26.190
 years of reception now we fall asleep with earth and 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:33.790
 stomp and stomp I have you so 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:39.610
 once again need to water to moisten 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:43.810
 the earth here is my business there it grew to him 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:51.130
 it was dark and the place to develop him 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 it was probably not enough and well 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.940
 dry twigs need to cut fikar 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.050
 update it update wai go new 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.210
 shoots in the spring and now we fall asleep sawdust 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.080
 but for what we did it was like 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.360
 Mulching can save will be well on 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.730
 winter must somehow cover the gooseberries 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.060
 cook it like you are still in the ground 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.670
 he only needs a pile of a spring already 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.320
 will need to see his condition 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.750
 if you cut the dry branches again 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.209
 need these dry branches and it is already starting 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.769
 again and nests jumping at the grooms but i 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:35.320
 use the room always sprinkle right in 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:37.600
 pledge the whole bush 3 and other fungi have 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.390
 another gooseberry breeding method 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.070
 bend down one of the branches in the fall and 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.440
 fix it in this place with something like 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.580
 slingshot a small stretch of branch 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.620
 sprinkle with earth 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.870
 in the spring you will see that appear here 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.550
 the roots of a new bush can be dug and 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.550
 transplant to any convenient place
