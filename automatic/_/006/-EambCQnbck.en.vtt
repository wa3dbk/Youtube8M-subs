00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.150
 the telescope passages that you can is 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.290
 designed but they look for similar planets 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.849
 to the earth orbiting stars 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.400
 similar to the sun in a temperate zone 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.230
 known as the gold enclosures area of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.150
 the temperature is ideal for not 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.160
 exist in its liquid state that 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.570
 they predetermine a set of 156,000 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.820
 stars in the constellations of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.250
 cygnus and lyra among their discoveries 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.980
 more interesting is kepler 10b 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.769
 kepler 10b is a tense rocky planet and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.269
 similar to hell it has only 1.4 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.830
 times the mass of the earth and is not in 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.120
 the temperate zone since wii is 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.489
 too close to his star as to 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.780
 that there is life on the planet is so 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.030
 hot that as the temperature of 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.410
 1,370 degrees celsius has iron 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 molten and silicates provided in the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.340
 wind this side pretty similar to the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.930
 tail of a comet that I'm ten times 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.180
 I was interested closer to his star 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 of what mercury is from the sun and has 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.079
 a translation pib of just one 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 point 84 days the nasa says that they tend 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.920
 be oppressed comparable to that of a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.360
 Iron weight is about 8.8 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.060
 grams per cubic centimeter 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.290
 the system kepler-11 this system 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.330
 includes a star similar to our 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.790
 sun or consists of these orbits just very 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.050
 up close at times two lots the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.980
 they pass by in front of the stars not 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.300
 weather 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.890
 this event was observed by the 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.960
 Kepler space telescope 26 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.070
 August 2010 that find a 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.870
 variety of ends arrangements 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.430
 planetariums suggesting that our 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.750
 solar system is not the only way in 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 which planets can be organized 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.280
 in the system of four planets today 730 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.050
 It is located on two bridges that 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.660
 they share the same orbit while 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.250
 always at 120 degrees one from the other 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.229
 adjusting permanently in their 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.490
 respective skies astronomers believe 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.720
 that the moon was formed from a collision 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.060
 between the earth and another planet that 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.920
 shared or that in several its orbit without 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.600
 However, until this find, nobody has 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.700
 found evidence in the universe of 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.340
 that this was possible 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.750
 kingler 16 bo the real tatooine this 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.250
 discovery with some more famous of 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.990
 want and neither more nor less than 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.750
 become science fiction in science 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.310
 real the planet kepler-16b forgot a 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.770
 star system looks just like 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.270
 replanted wind in star wars 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.159
 it looks like its turn over in 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.420
 gaseous composition and its orbit is 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.579
 analogous to that of venus in our system 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.920
 solar the two stars of the system are 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.200
 20 and 79 % as massive as our sun 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.759
 since its mass still combined is smaller 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.739
 that the this the orbit of the planet 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.959
 inside the cold mind placing it outside of 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.250
 the room area this system also 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.840
 special in the way they can 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.489
 Sexually control information 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.930
 coming from binary systems going 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.870
 directly to the trash because these 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.150
 hinder chrysler observations 22 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.890
 of only 2.4 times the size of the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.780
 earth this first planet that is known 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.910
 circulate comfortably in the habitable zone 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.590
 a sun - like star 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.630
 scientists do not know yet if really 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.790
 has a gaseous or rocky composition 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.260
 liquid it is possible that this world has 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.120
 clouds and their atmosphere 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.500
 douglas hudgins scientist of the problem 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.390
 at the headquarters of the nasa in 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.010
 Washington says that this is a great 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.910
 advance to find twin planets of 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.970
 the earth crs2 of the darkest planet 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.160
 of this planet until in its 350 years of 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.290
 distance is very, very dark and 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.500
 hard to see is black that reflects 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.750
 only 1% of the light that reaches 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.280
 tres-2b is so dark that it is more black 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.819
 that coal or any other planet or 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.430
 satelite 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.019
 Sloppy is less effective than 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.170
 black acrylic paint is 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.299
 definitely very dark but also 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.189
 found a planet only 1500 years old 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.530
 of the earth that appears evaporating 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.180
 before our very eyes throughout 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.310
 the next 100 million years the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.750
 planet will completely disintegrate the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.709
 planet orbits a cataloged star 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.389
 as caisse 12 55 75 48 so 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.430
 nearby that completed the circuit in so 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.590
 only 15 hours one of the said only 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.730
 shorter interests observed that 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.290
 possibility so close to its star 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.049
 generates temperatures on the surface of the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.519
 planet up to 3,600 degrees the heat 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.200
 extreme is causing material 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.030
 rocky evaporate directly from the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.349
 surface forming a wind that loads 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.269
 all the gas composite material and 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.629
 dust into space 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.819
 system 75 seems to be kepler 16b 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.709
 novelty announced after all that 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.449
 presents and 5 is a planet the size of 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.919
 saturn orbiting a couple of stars 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:59.169
 with sizes similar to ours 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.909
 eyes the star mother of the system 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.669
 same size times as the smallest 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.109
 has a radius 79% here the sun 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.239
 Stars let and used to 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.769
 the other every 21 days but the difficult ones 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.670
 they do not happen precisely in a 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.380
 periodic 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.150
 this version is of his christs motivated the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.819
 search of the planet which orbital 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.160
 boat gives 131 miles the discovery of 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.060
 which belongs 4 and meets 35 establishes 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.950
 a new class of planets 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.690
 circumbinarians suggesting that there are 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.200
 millions of these systems on the way 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.260
 milk that is 20 g20 that really 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.150
 orbit your star every 6.1 days to tan 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.560
 only 7.5 million kilometers from his 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.070
 star the temperature of its surface 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.889
 is 760 degrees celsius jeter 20 efe 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.540
 they have 1.0 three times the size of the 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.889
 earth one of the planets sso 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.530
 discovered so far with greater 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.240
 similarity to the size of this has less 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.710
 three times the mass of the earth and it 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.750
 finds only 16 million 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.669
 kilometers of your star the comparison 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.470
 the earth is 150 million 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.780
 of kilometers of soil and therefore 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.910
 complete one orbit every 19 points of 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.400
 ideas its surface has a 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.990
 temperature of 426 of the absence but 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.880
 astronomers believe that it can be capable 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.880
 of having water vapor in its atmosphere 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.619
 the kepler telescope was launched in 2009 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:13.389
 with a budget of 600 million 

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:15.129
 dollars and since then discovered the 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.889
 existence of 800 planets and remains for 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.639
 confirm the existence another two thousand 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.749
 Unfortunately past May 14 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.309
 discovered that the wheels that help 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:22.689
 position the instruments stopped 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:25.149
 work and the future of the ship is 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.680
 uncertain that has been all for today not 

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:29.080
