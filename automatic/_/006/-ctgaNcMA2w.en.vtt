you want to start with is find your
green<00:00:29.400> block<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.170> refer<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> green

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
green block I refer to it as a green

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.319 
green block I refer to it as a green
block<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.219> got<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.550> green<00:00:32.880> squares

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
block it's got two green squares

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.490 
block it's got two green squares
together<00:00:34.940> okay

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
together okay

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.160 
together okay
this<00:00:37.500> will<00:00:38.090> this<00:00:39.090> will<00:00:39.149> be<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.750> block

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
this will this will be your first block

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
this will this will be your first block
so<00:00:40.350> identify<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.219> put<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.550> this

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
so identify that and put it in this

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.510 
so identify that and put it in this
orientation<00:00:42.030> green<00:00:43.020> green<00:00:43.440> purple<00:00:44.100> yellow

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
orientation green green purple yellow

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
orientation green green purple yellow
and<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:46.760> want<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> put<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.680> that<00:00:51.350> will<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and you want to put it that will be the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.790 
and you want to put it that will be the
first<00:00:52.739> block<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.160> find<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> want

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
first block that you find and you want

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.189 
first block that you find and you want
to<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.309> yellow<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.329> top<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:58.020> green

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
to have it with yellow on top in green

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.150 
to have it with yellow on top in green
on<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.859> front<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.140> see<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.680> don't

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
on the front so as you can see I don't

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.520 
on the front so as you can see I don't
really<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.820> order<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.629> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
really get that order there with that so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.539 
really get that order there with that so
it's<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> matter<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.010> changing<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
it's a matter of changing the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.870 
it's a matter of changing the
orientation<00:01:06.020> like<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:08.610> I've<00:01:08.700> got

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
orientation like so so now I've got

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.690 
orientation like so so now I've got
green<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.540> front<00:01:09.570> yellow<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:10.700> green

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
green on the front yellow on top green

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.450 
green on the front yellow on top green
on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> bottom<00:01:12.030> purple<00:01:12.750> at<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.960> back<00:01:13.460> okay

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
on the bottom purple at the back okay

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.460 
on the bottom purple at the back okay
that's<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.619> that's<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> starting<00:01:17.130> point

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
that's the that's the starting point

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.530 
that's the that's the starting point
now<00:01:19.470> next<00:01:19.770> cube<00:01:20.100> what<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.670> need<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> find<00:01:21.210> is

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
now next cube what you need to find is

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.460 
now next cube what you need to find is
the<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.860> two<00:01:23.100> blue<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the the one with two blue on it so the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.640 
the the one with two blue on it so the
orientation<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.490> blue<00:01:26.939> blue<00:01:27.390> purple<00:01:28.020> yellow
