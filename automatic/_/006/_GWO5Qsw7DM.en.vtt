00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.710 
see what the change logs will be and all
of<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.400> bugs<00:00:42.610> that<00:00:42.730> were<00:00:42.880> fixed<00:00:43.270> but

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
of the bugs that were fixed but

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.300 
of the bugs that were fixed but
essentially<00:00:44.230> this<00:00:44.350> should<00:00:44.590> fix<00:00:44.800> all<00:00:45.040> of<00:00:45.070> the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
essentially this should fix all of the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.950 
essentially this should fix all of the
major<00:00:45.550> problems<00:00:46.120> that<00:00:46.240> everybody<00:00:46.600> was<00:00:46.750> having

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
major problems that everybody was having

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.200 
major problems that everybody was having
in<00:00:47.260> their<00:00:47.800> games<00:00:48.190> on<00:00:48.430> minecraft<00:00:49.000> for<00:00:49.180> the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
in their games on minecraft for the

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.510 
in their games on minecraft for the
console<00:00:49.690> so<00:00:50.650> I<00:00:50.680> think<00:00:50.829> that<00:00:51.040> probably<00:00:51.280> the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
console so I think that probably the

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.250 
console so I think that probably the
most<00:00:51.670> major<00:00:51.910> one<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.750> one<00:00:52.900> that<00:00:52.989> I<00:00:53.050> heard

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
most major one and the one that I heard

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.229 
most major one and the one that I heard
the<00:00:53.410> most<00:00:53.650> about<00:00:54.010> was<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.670> problem<00:00:54.910> people

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
the most about was the problem people

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.030 
the most about was the problem people
are<00:00:55.360> having<00:00:55.720> with<00:00:55.810> D<00:00:56.050> spawning<00:00:56.380> horses<00:00:56.890> and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
are having with D spawning horses and

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.130 
are having with D spawning horses and
horses<00:00:57.220> to<00:00:57.460> spawning<00:00:57.730> from<00:00:58.329> their<00:00:58.510> world<00:00:58.810> and

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
horses to spawning from their world and

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.490 
horses to spawning from their world and
so<00:00:59.800> that<00:01:00.130> will<00:01:00.370> be<00:01:00.550> fixed<00:01:00.760> into<00:01:01.210> u20<00:01:01.720> so<00:01:02.170> some

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
so that will be fixed into u20 so some

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.960 
so that will be fixed into u20 so some
of<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.680> other<00:01:02.860> smaller<00:01:03.340> things<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:03.880> were

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
of the other smaller things that were

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.569 
of the other smaller things that were
fixed<00:01:04.360> include<00:01:04.899> you<00:01:05.740> know<00:01:05.829> like<00:01:06.009> when<00:01:06.220> the

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
fixed include you know like when the

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.580 
fixed include you know like when the
host<00:01:06.790> options<00:01:07.240> were<00:01:07.360> changed<00:01:07.750> in<00:01:07.840> adventure

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
host options were changed in adventure

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.020 
host options were changed in adventure
mode<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:08.890> would<00:01:09.009> be<00:01:09.100> in<00:01:09.189> creative<00:01:09.610> mode<00:01:09.640> I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
mode you would be in creative mode I

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.550 
mode you would be in creative mode I
think<00:01:10.450> they're<00:01:10.540> going<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.689> fix<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:11.049> I'm<00:01:11.350> sure

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
think they're going to fix that I'm sure

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.300 
think they're going to fix that I'm sure
they're<00:01:11.680> going<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.829> fix<00:01:12.040> some<00:01:12.189> of<00:01:12.219> the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
they're going to fix some of the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.620 
they're going to fix some of the
glitches<00:01:12.579> that<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:12.850> showed<00:01:13.119> you<00:01:13.149> guys<00:01:13.390> in<00:01:13.570> the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
glitches that I showed you guys in the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.539 
glitches that I showed you guys in the
past<00:01:13.870> maybe<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.650> flashing<00:01:15.100> black<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.430> white

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
past maybe the flashing black and white

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.270 
past maybe the flashing black and white
beacon<00:01:16.060> in<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.659> maybe<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.170> TNT<00:01:17.620> mega<00:01:17.830> bomb<00:01:18.040> as

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
beacon in the maybe the TNT mega bomb as

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.910 
beacon in the maybe the TNT mega bomb as
well<00:01:18.820> as<00:01:19.060> they<00:01:19.270> also<00:01:19.450> fix<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:19.990> TNT<00:01:20.380> minecart

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
well as they also fix the TNT minecart

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.240 
well as they also fix the TNT minecart
exploding<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.810> tnt<00:01:22.810> exploding<00:01:23.530> despite

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
exploding the tnt exploding despite

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.100 
exploding the tnt exploding despite
having<00:01:24.520> TNT<00:01:25.000> explodes<00:01:25.330> off<00:01:25.600> which<00:01:25.810> I<00:01:25.900> think

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
having TNT explodes off which I think

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.500 
having TNT explodes off which I think
caused<00:01:26.650> some<00:01:27.520> people's<00:01:27.760> worlds<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.299> glitch

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
caused some people's worlds the glitch

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.390 
caused some people's worlds the glitch
and<00:01:28.750> different<00:01:29.680> things<00:01:29.710> like<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.100> as<00:01:30.280> well

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
and different things like that as well

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.890 
and different things like that as well
as<00:01:30.520> different<00:01:30.700> problems<00:01:31.180> with<00:01:31.330> villagers<00:01:31.690> and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
as different problems with villagers and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.020 
as different problems with villagers and
name<00:01:32.080> tags<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.680> all<00:01:33.220> kinds<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.729> other<00:01:33.909> things

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
name tags and all kinds of other things

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.030 
name tags and all kinds of other things
that<00:01:34.570> were<00:01:34.869> causing<00:01:35.080> issues<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:35.650> all<00:01:35.830> of<00:01:35.860> these

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
that were causing issues so all of these

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.950 
that were causing issues so all of these
things<00:01:36.220> should<00:01:36.460> be<00:01:36.490> addressed<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.060> fixed<00:01:37.690> in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
things should be addressed and fixed in

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.570 
things should be addressed and fixed in
the<00:01:38.170> next<00:01:38.200> update<00:01:38.560> for<00:01:38.979> Minecraft<00:01:39.100> on<00:01:39.430> the

about the Simpsons skin pack I didn't

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.290 
about the Simpsons skin pack I didn't
make<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.650> video<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.400> itself<00:02:27.730> because<00:02:28.270> I

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
make a video on that on itself because I

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.460 
make a video on that on itself because I
didn't<00:02:28.630> know<00:02:28.660> how<00:02:28.720> many<00:02:29.020> people<00:02:29.200> were<00:02:29.260> really

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
didn't know how many people were really

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.410 
didn't know how many people were really
interested<00:02:29.620> in<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.460> like<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:30.970> said<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.180> did

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
interested in that but like I said I did

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.850 
interested in that but like I said I did
think<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.660> was<00:02:31.720> worth<00:02:31.930> noting<00:02:32.350> at<00:02:32.470> least<00:02:32.680> for

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860

think it was worth noting at least for
those<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.130> guys<00:02:33.250> who<00:02:33.310> are<00:02:33.430> really<00:02:33.550> huge
