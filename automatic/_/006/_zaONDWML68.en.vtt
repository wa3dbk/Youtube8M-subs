so many colors 75 colors that are
available<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:22.590> colors<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.730> adjusted<00:02:24.090> as

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
available the colors can be adjusted as

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.980 
available the colors can be adjusted as
far<00:02:25.260> as<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:26.100> only<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.610> i<00:02:26.730> use<00:02:26.940> water<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.540> thin

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
far as not only can i use water to thin

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.560 
far as not only can i use water to thin
them<00:02:28.290> but<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> also<00:02:29.070> use<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.910> slow<00:02:30.300> medium

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
them but I also use the slow medium

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.720 
them but I also use the slow medium
that's<00:02:30.959> available<00:02:31.260> as<00:02:31.739> well<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.310> what<00:02:32.489> that

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
that's available as well and what that

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.720 
that's available as well and what that
does<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.330> slows<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.810> drying<00:02:34.260> time<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
does is it slows the drying time so the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.870 
does is it slows the drying time so the
painting<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.420> more<00:02:36.720> predictable<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:38.550> so

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
painting is more predictable that's so

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.090 
painting is more predictable that's so
important<00:02:39.570> one<00:02:40.080> thing<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.620> run<00:02:40.920> into

when you're using watercolors is that a

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.750 
when you're using watercolors is that a

your painting experience I'm going to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.810 
your painting experience I'm going to
show<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.730> how<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.810> go<00:03:13.530> about<00:03:13.560> doing<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.370> and

so<00:03:14.970> there's<00:03:15.209> some<00:03:15.360> techniques<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.140> use

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
so there's some techniques that I use

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.610 
so there's some techniques that I use
that<00:03:16.500> are<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> bit<00:03:16.980> different<00:03:18.170> but<00:03:19.170> in<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.440> long

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
that are a bit different but in the long

this is a fun technique to use you get
some<00:03:26.070> great<00:03:26.310> results<00:03:26.850> out<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.750> thing<00:03:28.079> the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030

that I'm using our synthetic brushes I

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.130 
that I'm using our synthetic brushes I
don't<00:04:14.220> normally<00:04:14.700> use<00:04:14.730> sable<00:04:15.510> brushes<00:04:15.989> because

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
don't normally use sable brushes because

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.539 
don't normally use sable brushes because
they're<00:04:16.440> little<00:04:16.650> on<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.799> expensive

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
they're little on the expensive

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.119 
they're little on the expensive
side<00:04:17.699> and<00:04:18.030> these<00:04:18.539> seem<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.840> work<00:04:19.109> real<00:04:19.470> well<00:04:19.500> if

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:20.129 
side and these seem to work real well if

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.700 
side and these seem to work real well if
you<00:04:20.579> do<00:04:20.789> have<00:04:21.060> sable<00:04:21.629> brushes<00:04:22.139> it's<00:04:22.349> not<00:04:22.530> to

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
you do have sable brushes it's not to

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.529 
you do have sable brushes it's not to
worry<00:04:22.949> because<00:04:24.289> interactive<00:04:25.289> will<00:04:25.919> clean<00:04:26.280> out

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
worry because interactive will clean out

interactive has transparent I use some

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.570 
interactive has transparent I use some
truth<00:04:51.300> semi-transparent<00:04:52.199> and<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:53.370> use<00:04:53.550> a
