00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
keyboard is not mechanical and it's a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.519 
keyboard is not mechanical and it's a
traditional<00:00:29.939> layout

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
traditional layout

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
traditional layout
almost<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.859> honest<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.520> than<00:00:33.270> any

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
almost to be honest of you and than any

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.049 
almost to be honest of you and than any
other<00:00:33.690> keyboards<00:00:34.399> but<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.850> not

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
other keyboards but this is not

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.000 
other keyboards but this is not
mechanical<00:00:36.210> by<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.930> probably<00:00:37.500> one<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
mechanical by is probably one of the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.130 
mechanical by is probably one of the
better<00:00:38.309> gaming<00:00:39.059> keyboards<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.809> isn't

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
better gaming keyboards that isn't

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.389 
better gaming keyboards that isn't
mechanical<00:00:40.680> if<00:00:40.739> you're<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> mean<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.250> is

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
mechanical if you're not I mean this is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.369 
mechanical if you're not I mean this is
the<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.270> top<00:00:42.450> end<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.200> get

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the this is the top end of what you get

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.479 
the this is the top end of what you get
when<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.710> not<00:00:43.890> mechanical

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
when it's not mechanical

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
when it's not mechanical
obviously<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.239> days<00:00:45.420> mechanical<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.020> huge

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
obviously these days mechanical is huge

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.080 
obviously these days mechanical is huge
but<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> features<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.879> keyboard

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
but for the features that this keyboard

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
but for the features that this keyboard
has<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.539> think<00:00:48.719> over<00:00:49.050> weighs<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.649> being

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
has I think over weighs not being

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.040 
has I think over weighs not being
mechanical<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.730> really<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.629> hope<00:00:51.750> they<00:00:51.899> come

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
mechanical I really do hope they come

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
mechanical I really do hope they come
out<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:52.559> soon<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
out with one soon that is I just want a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.939 
out with one soon that is I just want a
couple<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.140> don't<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.469> like

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
couple one thing I don't really like

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.410 
couple one thing I don't really like
about<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.340> key<00:00:56.550> before<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.149> started

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
about this key before we get started

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
about this key before we get started
into<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> awesome<00:00:58.440> features<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.489> cable

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
into the awesome features is the cable

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.330 
into the awesome features is the cable
is<00:01:00.030> still<00:01:00.270> plastic<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.170> braided<00:01:01.680> me

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
is still plastic and it's not braided me

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.560 
is still plastic and it's not braided me
myself<00:01:02.579> would<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.000> loved<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> seen<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
myself would have loved to seen a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.179 
myself would have loved to seen a
braided<00:01:03.840> cable<00:01:04.350> because<00:01:04.619> I'll<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.769> think<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
braided cable because I'll just think it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.370 
braided cable because I'll just think it
adds<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.430> bit<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:06.150> doesn't<00:01:06.720> seem<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:06.960> messy

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
adds a bit more it doesn't seem as messy

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.670 
adds a bit more it doesn't seem as messy
when<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.740> braided<00:01:08.070> cable<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.680> keyboard

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
when it's a braided cable the keyboard

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.740 
when it's a braided cable the keyboard
itself<00:01:10.920> has<00:01:11.159> some<00:01:11.280> amazing<00:01:11.610> amazing<00:01:12.000> features

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
itself has some amazing amazing features

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 
itself has some amazing amazing features
and<00:01:12.930> before<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> start<00:01:13.830> I'll<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and before I start I'll just want to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.550 
and before I start I'll just want to
show<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> key<00:01:14.970> profiles<00:01:15.540> they<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.259> very

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
show you the key profiles they are very

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.590 
show you the key profiles they are very
very<00:01:16.830> low<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.369> keyboard<00:01:17.759> which<00:01:18.270> obviously

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
very low to the keyboard which obviously

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
very low to the keyboard which obviously
adds<00:01:18.930> sensitivity<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:20.159> obviously<00:01:20.340> means

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
adds sensitivity then obviously means

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
adds sensitivity then obviously means
the<00:01:20.909> buttons<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.600> pressed<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:22.229> lot<00:01:22.409> quicker

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the buttons can be pressed a lot quicker

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.710 
the buttons can be pressed a lot quicker
rather<00:01:23.369> than<00:01:23.640> pressing<00:01:24.060> down<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.479> full

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
rather than pressing down a full

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.149 
rather than pressing down a full
mechanical<00:01:24.960> key

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
mechanical key

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.920

some awesome little keys on the top and
I<00:02:55.420> do<00:02:55.480> think<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.800> actual<00:02:57.100> keys<00:02:57.340> where

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
I do think that the actual keys where

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.490 
I do think that the actual keys where
they're<00:02:57.850> low<00:02:57.970> profile<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.630> key<00:02:58.780> bits<00:02:59.380> of

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
they're low profile to the key bits of

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.680 
they're low profile to the key bits of
the<00:02:59.560> keyboard<00:02:59.980> base<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.880> does<00:03:01.090> actually<00:03:01.450> and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
the keyboard base it does actually and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.420 
the keyboard base it does actually and
they<00:03:01.900> do<00:03:02.110> feel<00:03:02.290> quite<00:03:02.500> bouncy<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.070> be<00:03:03.190> honest
