00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:15.080
 That's how X-MEN should have come to an end 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.740
 Charles! 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.900
 I'm sorry, so sorry! 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.140
 This society will not accept us. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.200
 We create our own. 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.100
 People played their cards, 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
 now we come. 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.180
 Who is with me? 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.360
 No, you really are not. 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.552
 Nobody likes it. 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.480
 I meant the winning team. 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.880
 What to do with you? 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.520
 Why not? 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.020
 Because Charlest was shot! 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.420
 Someone would take you to the hospital? I think I was paralyzed. 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.080
 Charles, that's important now. Wait a minute. 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.380
 So this is not it? 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.180
 None of you want to come with me? 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.380
 I'm going with you. 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.000
 I grew up with Charles and he's the only thing I can call a family, but yes, 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.680
 I'll leave you lying down on the sand right now. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.760
 Thanks, Raven. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.740
 Beautiful. 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.300
 Why does this happen? We suffered so much to overcome Shaw, and you want to be like him. 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.620
 Choose a page! 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.600
 NO! 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.360
 Okay, Erik is right, 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.460
 we should join it. 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.080
 REALLY? 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.580
 Yeah. Come on, everyone! Let's go with Erik! 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.340
 That's great, we'll be a good team! 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.780
 The Mutant Forces ... 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.400
 Come on, you just say, let's go through, but aren't you going to end up? 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.100
 Yes. 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.280
 Come on. 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.220
 Okay, just tell me you're here if you're really with me! 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.300
 Okay? You can't change your mind! You have to decide here and now, brothers and sisters. 

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:48.044
 On this Cuban coast, 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.280
 where the Russians and America are fighting over us, 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.440
 where Charles lies paralyzed in the sand. Okay? Who is with me? 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.380
 Or just don't use our skills smoothly for bad things. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.420
 Yeah, maybe people will be happy to be there. 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.040
 It will never happen! Enough of the asshole! 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.260
 Magneto, you wear the helmet that killed your mother! 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.100
 This helmet is fantastic, don't dare to scream! 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.700
 Why didn't you kill Shaw when you were 10 years old? 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.084
 Do you know how hard I can be? 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.780
 This is madness! 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.940
 Enough! 

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:22.577
 Charles, what's going on? What are you doing? 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.720
 They were shot, you selfish s-hole. 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.780
 Well, now how do we get home? 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.140
 My goodness. The devil brings people to the emergency! 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.360
 Now I'm in a wheelchair, Magneto and me 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.060
 we are old friends who are still playing chess at times, 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.580
 but we are also ancient ancestors. 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.380
 Ancient Friendlies. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.500
 And sometimes we play chess with real people. 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.480
 It doesn't look like you get ahead ... 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.480
 Try to get to the vineyard with this. 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.400
 The mutants are the future! 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.080
 We can live in peace! 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.814
 No, we can't live! 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.140
 God, we have been debating this for nearly 50 years! 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.420
 Wow. 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.800
 X menus are stubborn. 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.360
 Don't tell me. 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.720
 END 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.180
 And Bestia! Mutants and pride! 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.740
 Anyone you can pick up is my blue hair on my body. 

00:03:32.973 --> 00:03:34.973
 What you say doesn't mean anything to me! 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
 Hey, this is where you say: 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.700
 Thanks for watching, sign up! 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.520
 Get it? 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.760
 Check out the other videos as well ... 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.660
 No. 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.420
 Okay. 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.000
 Hi guys. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.860
 Hey, Batman. 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.200
 You want to know who's under the mask? 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.580
 Are you Bruce Wayne? 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.740
 Bass, I forgot to read in my mind. 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.325
 Your coffee is your breath.
