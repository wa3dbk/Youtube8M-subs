section four for two example seven this

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.960 
section four for two example seven this
example<00:00:04.890> has<00:00:05.220> an<00:00:05.810> initial<00:00:06.810> electric<00:00:07.379> field

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
example has an initial electric field

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.040 
example has an initial electric field
which<00:00:08.970> I'll<00:00:09.150> represent<00:00:09.269> with<00:00:09.599> field<00:00:09.840> lines

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
which I'll represent with field lines

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.400 
which I'll represent with field lines
and<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.349> draw<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.530> middle<00:00:10.769> yet<00:00:10.950> of

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
and I can draw the middle yet of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.170 
and I can draw the middle yet of
intensity<00:00:13.410> not<00:00:14.330> pointing<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:17.000> okay

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
intensity not pointing up okay

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.840 
intensity not pointing up okay
you're<00:00:18.510> not<00:00:18.630> vector<00:00:18.960> actually<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:20.760> we

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
you're not vector actually and what we

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.870 
you're not vector actually and what we
do<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.539> kind<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.529> like<00:00:22.830> example<00:00:23.400> eight<00:00:23.730> in

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
do here is kind of like example eight in

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.080 
do here is kind of like example eight in
Chapter<00:00:24.269> three<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.930> I'll<00:00:25.019> write<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.350> here

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.140 

we're<00:00:33.090> bringing<00:00:33.330> in<00:00:33.810> a<00:00:34.140> sphere<00:00:34.910> but<00:00:35.910> this

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
we're bringing in a sphere but this

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.640 
we're bringing in a sphere but this
sphere<00:00:36.420> isn't<00:00:36.600> conducting<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.290> sphere<00:00:37.530> is

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
sphere isn't conducting this sphere is

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.850 
sphere isn't conducting this sphere is
actually<00:00:37.830> a<00:00:38.040> dielectric<00:00:38.640> linear<00:00:39.240> dielectric

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.950 

I'm<00:00:43.860> pretty<00:00:44.100> happy<00:00:44.220> with<00:00:44.400> that<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.900> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
I'm pretty happy with that and as you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
I'm pretty happy with that and as you
can<00:00:46.050> probably<00:00:46.170> guess<00:00:46.560> you're<00:00:46.890> gonna<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.220> some

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
can probably guess you're gonna get some

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.680 
can probably guess you're gonna get some
electric<00:00:47.850> field<00:00:47.880> going<00:00:48.540> through<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.140> sphere

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.270 

magnitude<00:00:57.690> E<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.170> then<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.650> things<00:00:59.070> around

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
magnitude E and then the things around

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.260 
magnitude E and then the things around
that<00:00:59.400> are<00:00:59.580> probably<00:00:59.790> going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> bend<00:01:00.210> around

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that are probably going to bend around

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.140 
that are probably going to bend around
in<00:01:01.040> some<00:01:02.570> interesting<00:01:03.589> configuration<00:01:05.150> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
in some interesting configuration and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
in some interesting configuration and
paying<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.450> whatever<00:01:06.630> happens<00:01:06.840> inside<00:01:07.200> there

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
paying on whatever happens inside there

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.530 
paying on whatever happens inside there
so<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.560> question<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.430> find<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.300> field

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so on the question is is find the field

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.680 
so on the question is is find the field
inside<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> sphere<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:15.060> where<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.300> conductor

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
inside the sphere this where a conductor

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.060 
inside the sphere this where a conductor
would<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.840> easy<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.140> field<00:01:16.440> zero<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:16.950> it's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
would be easy that field zero but it's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.800 
would be easy that field zero but it's
not<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.220> conductor<00:01:17.550> two<00:01:17.790> dielectrics<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.600> we

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
not a conductor two dielectrics so we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.290 
not a conductor two dielectrics so we
have<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.229> use<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> tools<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.270> have

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
have to use the tools that we have

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.530 
have to use the tools that we have
available<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.960> us<00:01:22.820> one<00:01:23.820> way<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> approach<00:01:24.210> this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
available to us one way to approach this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.600 
available to us one way to approach this
problem<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.190> works<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.520> this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
problem and it actually works for this

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.930 
problem and it actually works for this
problem<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.720> say<00:01:27.930> well<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.160> we<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.610> an

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
problem is you say well if we have an

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.749 
problem is you say well if we have an
electric<00:01:30.210> field<00:01:30.270> inside<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> sphere<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.229> anat

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
electric field inside the sphere of anat

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.580 
electric field inside the sphere of anat
what's<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.910> polarization<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.780> sphere<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
what's the polarization of the sphere so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.040 
what's the polarization of the sphere so
we<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.860> write<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:36.030> polarization<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
we can write the polarization of the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.380 
we can write the polarization of the
sphere<00:01:37.290> due<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.620> e<00:01:37.650> naught<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.120> to<00:01:39.270> be

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
sphere due to e naught is going to be

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.030 
sphere due to e naught is going to be
it's<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.900> linear<00:01:40.050> dielectric<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.770> epsilon

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it's a linear dielectric so epsilon

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.550 
it's a linear dielectric so epsilon
naught<00:01:42.320> kyyy<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.600> initial<00:01:46.020> electric

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
naught kyyy of the initial electric

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.810 
naught kyyy of the initial electric
field<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:48.830> then<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.920> question<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.370> what<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
field and then the question is what is

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.610 
field and then the question is what is
the<00:01:50.880> electric<00:01:51.150> field<00:01:51.299> produced<00:01:51.810> by<00:01:51.930> that

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
the electric field produced by that

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.500 
the electric field produced by that
polarization<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> call<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.299> e

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
polarization so I'm going to call this e

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
1 is produced by the polarization we

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.060 
1 is produced by the polarization we

in this original term here there we get

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.030 
in this original term here there we get

susceptibility divided by three of the
original<00:02:28.620> electric<00:02:29.489> field<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.739> were

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
original electric field so if you were

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.319 
original electric field so if you were
to<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.069> what<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.519> new<00:02:32.730> electric<00:02:33.120> field

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
to see what this new electric field

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.759 
to see what this new electric field
would<00:02:33.569> produce<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:34.019> terms<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.319> polarization

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
would produce in terms of polarization

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.940 
would produce in terms of polarization
and<00:02:35.099> what<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> resulting<00:02:36.470> electric<00:02:37.470> field

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
and what the resulting electric field

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.160 
and what the resulting electric field
from<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.280> new<00:02:38.459> polarization<00:02:39.030> would<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.269> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
from that new polarization would be you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
from that new polarization would be you
just<00:02:40.319> basically<00:02:40.530> do<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.310> did<00:02:41.549> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
just basically do what you just did and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.199 
just basically do what you just did and
you<00:02:42.329> end<00:02:42.540> up<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:43.189> negative<00:02:44.189> Chi<00:02:44.700> E<00:02:44.730> over

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
you end up with negative Chi E over

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.080 
you end up with negative Chi E over
three<00:02:45.890> squared<00:02:46.890> times<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.519> original<00:02:47.670> ectric

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
three squared times the original ectric

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.680 
three squared times the original ectric
field<00:02:48.329> and<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:50.819> idea<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.329> you're<00:02:51.569> going

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
field and the idea is that you're going

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.030 
field and the idea is that you're going
to<00:02:51.720> add<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:51.900> all<00:02:52.170> these<00:02:52.290> fields<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.709> top<00:02:52.889> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
to add up all these fields on top of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.319 
to add up all these fields on top of
each<00:02:53.159> other<00:02:53.280> using<00:02:53.549> principles<00:02:54.239> of

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
each other using principles of

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.430 
each other using principles of
superposition<00:02:54.599> so<00:02:55.019> we're<00:02:55.109> gonna<00:02:55.200> take<00:02:55.349> the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
superposition so we're gonna take the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.289 
superposition so we're gonna take the
sum<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:56.269> all<00:02:57.269> these<00:02:57.690> electric<00:02:58.139> fields<00:02:59.000> from<00:03:00.000> 0

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
sum of all these electric fields from 0

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.599 
sum of all these electric fields from 0
to<00:03:00.389> infinity<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:02.040> we're<00:03:02.159> gonna<00:03:02.250> get<00:03:02.430> some

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
to infinity and we're gonna get some

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.910 
to infinity and we're gonna get some
answer<00:03:02.970> now<00:03:03.540> looking<00:03:04.109> at<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.409> this<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
answer now looking at this this is a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.940 
answer now looking at this this is a
geometric<00:03:07.920> series<00:03:08.069> where<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.959> number<00:03:10.560> itself

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
geometric series where the number itself

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.430 
geometric series where the number itself
is<00:03:11.129> less<00:03:11.340> than<00:03:11.459> 1<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:11.879> we<00:03:12.030> can<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.359> apply<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
is less than 1 so we can just apply the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.869 
is less than 1 so we can just apply the
simple<00:03:13.950> rule<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.819> equal<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.329> 1<00:03:15.629> over

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
simple rule that this is equal to 1 over

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.500 
simple rule that this is equal to 1 over
1<00:03:17.879> minus<00:03:18.980> Chi<00:03:19.980> e<00:03:20.040> over<00:03:20.549> 3<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.060> thing<00:03:21.329> that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
1 minus Chi e over 3 the thing that

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.409 
1 minus Chi e over 3 the thing that
we're<00:03:21.629> taking<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.260> exponential<00:03:22.829> of<00:03:23.419> times

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
we're taking the exponential of times

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.780 
we're taking the exponential of times
the<00:03:24.569> electric<00:03:24.840> field<00:03:24.980> ok<00:03:26.010> that's<00:03:26.609> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
the electric field ok that's the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.360 
the electric field ok that's the
geometric<00:03:28.040> series<00:03:29.040> result<00:03:29.519> there<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:31.370> another

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
geometric series result there so another

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.819 
geometric series result there so another
way<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.579> write<00:03:32.699> this<00:03:32.970> could<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:34.440> multiply

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
way to write this could be you multiply

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.000 
way to write this could be you multiply
top<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.099> bottom<00:03:35.250> by<00:03:35.459> 3<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.349> get<00:03:37.500> 3<00:03:37.799> minus

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
top and bottom by 3 and you get 3 minus

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.300 
top and bottom by 3 and you get 3 minus
Chi<00:03:38.400> e<00:03:38.430> well<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.840> know<00:03:39.959> K<00:03:40.379> is<00:03:40.560> equal<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.829> 1<00:03:41.040> plus

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
Chi e well you know K is equal to 1 plus

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.569 
Chi e well you know K is equal to 1 plus
Chi<00:03:41.639> e<00:03:41.669> so<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.269> famous<00:03:42.419> t<00:03:42.720> plus<00:03:43.250> K<00:03:44.250> times

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
Chi e so this is famous t plus K times

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.909 
Chi e so this is famous t plus K times
the<00:03:44.819> original<00:03:45.030> electric<00:03:45.870> field<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.739> this

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
the original electric field so this

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.589 
the original electric field so this
turns<00:03:47.280> out<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.459> be<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.000> resulting<00:03:48.510> electric

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
turns out to be the resulting electric

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.159 
turns out to be the resulting electric
field<00:03:49.109> after<00:03:49.889> doing<00:03:50.609> this<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.790> an<00:03:51.690> infinite

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
field after doing this a an infinite

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.110 
field after doing this a an infinite
number<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.410> times<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:53.549> get<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:53.819> electric

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
number of times you get the electric

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.750 
number of times you get the electric
field<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.449> you<00:03:54.540> end<00:03:54.690> up<00:03:54.780> with<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.609> if<00:03:56.609> you're

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
field that you end up with and if you're

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.390 
field that you end up with and if you're
not<00:03:57.319> if<00:03:58.319> you're<00:03:58.530> not<00:03:58.590> happy<00:03:59.010> with<00:03:59.280> that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
not if you're not happy with that

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.280 
not if you're not happy with that
solution<00:03:59.970> then<00:04:00.329> what<00:04:00.419> we<00:04:00.540> can<00:04:00.690> do<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.049> we<00:04:01.169> can

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
solution then what we can do is we can

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.020 
solution then what we can do is we can
say<00:04:01.470> well<00:04:01.620> what's<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.030> resulting

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
say well what's the resulting

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.080 
say well what's the resulting
polarization<00:04:03.690> from<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.079> electric<00:04:04.440> field<00:04:05.090> so

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
polarization from this electric field so

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.270 
polarization from this electric field so
let's<00:04:06.239> calculate<00:04:06.419> that<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:08.010> polarization

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
let's calculate that so the polarization

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.059 
let's calculate that so the polarization
is<00:04:08.879> going<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.180> be<00:04:09.269> epsilon<00:04:09.659> naught<00:04:09.870> kayi

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.150 
electric field does this change the
field<00:04:54.090> at<00:04:54.330> all<00:04:54.539> so<00:04:55.169> really<00:04:55.470> we<00:04:55.590> want<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.860> see<00:04:55.979> if

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
field at all so really we want to see if

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.810 
field at all so really we want to see if
this<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.370> zero<00:04:57.240> or<00:04:57.479> nonzero<00:04:57.630> or<00:04:58.050> what<00:04:58.229> it<00:04:58.320> is

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.020 

and<00:05:03.350> so<00:05:04.350> let's<00:05:05.220> see<00:05:05.370> how<00:05:05.520> did<00:05:05.639> they<00:05:05.729> do<00:05:05.789> this

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
and so let's see how did they do this

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.430 
and so let's see how did they do this
they<00:05:06.300> they<00:05:06.660> kind<00:05:06.870> of<00:05:06.900> made<00:05:07.050> these<00:05:07.169> numbers

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
they they kind of made these numbers

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.790 
they they kind of made these numbers
danced<00:05:07.650> all<00:05:07.800> around<00:05:09.380> okay<00:05:10.380> so<00:05:10.440> we<00:05:10.650> could

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
danced all around okay so we could

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.129 
danced all around okay so we could
Caillou<00:05:11.039> over<00:05:11.550> 3<00:05:11.820> minus<00:05:12.030> Chi<00:05:12.360> E<00:05:12.389> so<00:05:12.900> this<00:05:12.930> is

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
Caillou over 3 minus Chi E so this is

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:19.090 
Caillou over 3 minus Chi E so this is
equal<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.610> minus<00:05:14.610> PI<00:05:15.030> over<00:05:15.570> 3<00:05:16.199> minus<00:05:17.100> Chi<00:05:17.520> he

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
equal to minus PI over 3 minus Chi he

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.159 
equal to minus PI over 3 minus Chi he
and<00:05:20.100> so<00:05:20.940> if<00:05:21.150> we<00:05:21.330> combine<00:05:21.510> that<00:05:21.720> with<00:05:21.930> the

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
and so if we combine that with the

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.370 
and so if we combine that with the
background<00:05:22.650> field<00:05:23.630> you<00:05:24.630> recover<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.169> field

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
background field you recover the field

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.070 
background field you recover the field
you<00:05:25.530> started<00:05:25.830> with<00:05:28.280> so

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
you started with so

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.350 
you started with so
and<00:05:31.169> so<00:05:31.979> you<00:05:32.069> add<00:05:32.310> in<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.580> background<00:05:33.150> filled

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
and so you add in the background filled

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.680 
and so you add in the background filled
there

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.860 

so<00:05:39.350> the<00:05:39.590> new<00:05:39.710> electric<00:05:40.040> field<00:05:40.810> plus<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
so the new electric field plus the

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.270 
so the new electric field plus the
electric<00:05:42.320> field<00:05:42.590> equals<00:05:43.340> e<00:05:43.790> naught<00:05:44.680> minus<00:05:45.680> Chi

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
electric field equals e naught minus Chi

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.590 
electric field equals e naught minus Chi
e<00:05:46.310> over<00:05:47.000> 3<00:05:47.240> minus<00:05:47.420> Chi<00:05:47.750> epsilon<00:05:48.440> naught<00:05:49.600> and

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
e over 3 minus Chi epsilon naught and

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.160 
e over 3 minus Chi epsilon naught and
that<00:05:51.160> is<00:05:52.160> going<00:05:52.430> to<00:05:52.580> be<00:05:52.990> 1<00:05:53.990> over<00:05:54.260> 1<00:05:55.150> plus<00:05:56.150> Chi<00:05:57.110> e

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
that is going to be 1 over 1 plus Chi e

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.950 
that is going to be 1 over 1 plus Chi e
over<00:05:57.710> three<00:05:57.980> of<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:59.210> original<00:05:59.300> ectric<00:05:59.720> field

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
over three of the original ectric field

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.360 
over three of the original ectric field
so<00:06:00.170> the<00:06:00.260> resulting<00:06:00.680> electric<00:06:00.770> field<00:06:01.190> from

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
so the resulting electric field from

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.970 
so the resulting electric field from
adding<00:06:01.790> in<00:06:01.970> additional<00:06:02.960> polarization<00:06:03.650> duty

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
adding in additional polarization duty

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.860 
adding in additional polarization duty
electric<00:06:04.250> field<00:06:04.460> we<00:06:04.520> just<00:06:04.700> calculated<00:06:05.270> is

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
electric field we just calculated is

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.540 
electric field we just calculated is
basically<00:06:06.230> nothing<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:06.920> doesn't<00:06:07.070> amount<00:06:07.430> to

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
basically nothing it doesn't amount to

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.940 
basically nothing it doesn't amount to
anything<00:06:08.110> so<00:06:09.110> we've<00:06:09.350> kind<00:06:09.620> of<00:06:09.650> reached<00:06:09.800> a

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
anything so we've kind of reached a

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.130 
anything so we've kind of reached a
stabilization<00:06:10.280> point<00:06:10.790> where<00:06:10.970> you<00:06:11.780> know<00:06:11.870> doing

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
stabilization point where you know doing

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.800 
stabilization point where you know doing
this<00:06:12.230> additional<00:06:12.620> times<00:06:12.980> doesn't<00:06:13.430> get<00:06:13.550> you

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
this additional times doesn't get you

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.930 
this additional times doesn't get you
any<00:06:14.810> different<00:06:15.170> of<00:06:15.260> an<00:06:15.350> answer<00:06:15.590> so<00:06:16.220> the

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
any different of an answer so the

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.430 
any different of an answer so the
interesting<00:06:17.180> thing<00:06:17.390> is<00:06:17.660> this<00:06:17.750> only<00:06:18.020> works<00:06:18.230> for

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
interesting thing is this only works for

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.680 
interesting thing is this only works for
Sears<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:19.550> works<00:06:19.760> for<00:06:19.970> ellipsoids<00:06:20.480> and<00:06:20.630> it

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
Sears it works for ellipsoids and it

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.350 
Sears it works for ellipsoids and it
works<00:06:20.840> for<00:06:20.990> cylinders<00:06:21.520> so<00:06:22.520> it<00:06:22.910> doesn't<00:06:23.240> work

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
works for cylinders so it doesn't work

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.420 
works for cylinders so it doesn't work
for<00:06:23.570> cubes<00:06:24.080> or<00:06:24.410> different<00:06:24.920> shapes<00:06:25.100> like<00:06:25.250> that

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
for cubes or different shapes like that

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.110 
for cubes or different shapes like that
and<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:25.670> reason<00:06:25.940> why<00:06:26.170> is<00:06:27.170> because<00:06:27.230> as<00:06:27.830> you

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
and the reason why is because as you

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.030 
and the reason why is because as you
apply<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.900> polarization<00:06:30.530> due<00:06:30.650> to<00:06:30.740> electric

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
apply the polarization due to electric

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.110 
apply the polarization due to electric
field<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.520> get<00:06:31.640> a<00:06:31.670> more<00:06:31.940> and<00:06:32.000> more

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
field you get a more and more

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.760 
field you get a more and more
complicated<00:06:32.420> field<00:06:32.960> and<00:06:33.260> polarization

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
complicated field and polarization

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.140 
complicated field and polarization
inside<00:06:34.340> of<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.700> object<00:06:35.210> and<00:06:35.680> it's<00:06:36.680> not

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
inside of the object and it's not

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.720 
inside of the object and it's not
possible<00:06:38.150> to<00:06:38.270> really<00:06:38.480> see<00:06:38.630> where<00:06:38.900> it<00:06:39.050> goes

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
possible to really see where it goes

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.310 
possible to really see where it goes
after<00:06:40.730> applying<00:06:41.240> it<00:06:41.420> several<00:06:41.660> times<00:06:41.900> it<00:06:42.110> just

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
after applying it several times it just

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.140 
after applying it several times it just
becomes<00:06:42.770> infinitely<00:06:43.190> like<00:06:43.430> a<00:06:43.460> fractal

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
becomes infinitely like a fractal

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.020 
becomes infinitely like a fractal
so<00:06:44.570> not<00:06:45.470> really<00:06:45.680> useful<00:06:45.800> anyway<00:06:46.490> I<00:06:46.670> hope<00:06:46.940> that

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
so not really useful anyway I hope that

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.440 
so not really useful anyway I hope that
helps

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
helps

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.140 
helps
take<00:06:47.990> care
