00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.679
 take a video I finally have kitchen like this 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.990
 that we are going to train kitchen today in 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.839
 vegan dimension let's make a pudding 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.200
 of chia to learn to use chia a 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.700
 dessert or a breakfast with why I'm going 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.260
 to put raspberries in this case but what 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.650
 you can make strawberries with strawberries 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.990
 Blueberries here we do not care milk 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.640
 almonds that I have made you can 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.410
 see how to make it to our blog by 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.730
 course we're going to put two and a half cups 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.540
 of almond milk in a blender 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.540
 but cups 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.890
 I liked the squares and half 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.450
 well here we are going to throw some good in 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.570
 this case raspberries 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.290
 you can throw strawberries a third of 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.290
 cup is fine 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.000
 and I'm going to take a little bit of grated 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.570
 lemon but you can also throw 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.640
 cardamom if you like cinnamon cinnamon here 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.400
 It's not going well because it's like this 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.550
 lemon of berries perfect there is a little touch 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.400
 nothing else 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:25.010
 and he saw if that is to everyone's liking 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.350
 two tablespoons a lot of people ask that 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:32.600
 that is a syrup made with the plant the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.680
 same plant where tequila is made if 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.470
 a sweet substance comes out 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.660
 and is done with that is less has less 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.970
 can blues and what sugar with what 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.760
 which for people who can not take 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.670
 sugar comes in handy then I use it 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.200
 quite in the kitchen I do not count on passing 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.690
 also for sugar that does not have in return 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.690
 for example let's beat this 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.960
 and it will have happened with the lid never again 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.090
 and you checking it as you want 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.099
 let's put half a cup of seeds 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.069
 chia at the party pretty easy to 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.349
 get has a lot of omega-3 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.349
 we are then our milkshake here 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.239
 we mix it 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.540
 a little more 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.540
 but I talked done in liquid pumps 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.210
 He spent half an hour in the fridge and we're going 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.030
 to stir 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.610
 to know to mix so that it is integrated 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.610
 homogeneously and the gel is formed 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.010
 and this as well as breakfast is great 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.010
 right a little bit of cornflakes 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.860
 inflated amaranth and there's nothing 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.810
 that a recess 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.010
 and refrigerate for two or three hours 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.600
 ok let's keep making our cream 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.280
 of coconut remember that we put a can 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.280
 from coconut to the slope and we take it 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.760
 and we use only the oily part 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.370
 of that can 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.870
 can see the recipe on the cake 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.390
 our carrot 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.170
 the bowl has to be cold also for 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.540
 that mountain will be a mountain 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.770
 for a little sugar a little bit of 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.770
 stevia is also the 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.160
 let's do a little bit of riding 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.160
 toughen a little 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:26.030
 although there is a time we beat a little 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:29.800
 so we're going to serve in a glass 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.800
 a little bit of our pudding 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.760
 the smaller vessels would be ideal 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.020
 good we have 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.020
 a little bit up 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.770
 and the raspberries 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.789
 and that has been all easy fast rich 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.250
 d 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.240
 overcome 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.349
 when
