00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
Christianity and Judaism I actually

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.850 
Christianity and Judaism I actually
don't<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.840> should<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.380> honest<00:01:55.740> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.020 
don't think they should to be honest I
don't<00:01:55.920> think<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.310> should<00:01:56.460> even<00:01:56.549> teach<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
don't think they should even teach that

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.880 
don't think they should even teach that
because<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> history<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.079> yeah<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.770> I'll

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
okay am I in favor of teaching a history

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.740 
okay am I in favor of teaching a history
of<00:02:07.619> course<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.340> don't<00:02:08.489> want<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.910> my<00:02:09.300> point<00:02:09.569> is

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
of course I don't want that my point is

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.930 
of course I don't want that my point is
to<00:02:10.200> fight<00:02:10.410> against<00:02:10.770> ignorance<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to fight against ignorance right the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.410 
to fight against ignorance right the
problem<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.510> when<00:02:12.629> we<00:02:12.660> teach<00:02:12.989> it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
problem is that when we teach it

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.840 
problem is that when we teach it
we<00:02:13.660> sugarcoat<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.410> if<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.069> taught<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.460> real

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
we sugarcoat it if you taught the real

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.300 
we sugarcoat it if you taught the real
history<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.510> religion<00:02:16.960> oh<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.200> would<00:02:17.680> love<00:02:18.069> it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
in his head would explode right so if

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.080 
in his head would explode right so if
you<00:02:20.500> taught<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.890> kids<00:02:21.130> there<00:02:21.400> was<00:02:21.580> no<00:02:21.760> Abraham

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
speak well of them by the way because we

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.830 
speak well of them by the way because we
know<00:03:06.489> what<00:03:06.670> they<00:03:06.790> did<00:03:07.030> they<00:03:07.060> mean<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:07.630> way

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
know what they did they mean this way

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.600 
know what they did they mean this way
with<00:03:08.260> Muhammad<00:03:08.739> we<00:03:08.860> know<00:03:08.980> what<00:03:09.130> he<00:03:09.220> did<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.519> it

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
with Muhammad we know what he did and it

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.009 
with Muhammad we know what he did and it
wasn't<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:09.910> pretty<00:03:10.120> in<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.420> lot<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.570> respects

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
wasn't that pretty in a lot of respects

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.110 
wasn't that pretty in a lot of respects
and<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:12.010> Jesus<00:03:12.459> said<00:03:12.580> he's<00:03:12.730> gonna<00:03:12.820> take<00:03:13.000> over

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
and and Jesus said he's gonna take over

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.090 
and and Jesus said he's gonna take over
the<00:03:13.330> world<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.810> then<00:03:13.989> he<00:03:14.230> could<00:03:14.890> barely

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
the world and then he could barely

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.720 
the world and then he could barely
convince<00:03:15.489> 12<00:03:15.610> people<00:03:15.790> before<00:03:16.300> he<00:03:16.360> was<00:03:16.480> killed

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
convince 12 people before he was killed

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.759 
convince 12 people before he was killed
so<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.060> then<00:03:19.209> how<00:03:19.480> did<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.810> Bible<00:03:19.989> get<00:03:20.260> put

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
so and then how did the Bible get put

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.670 
so and then how did the Bible get put
together<00:03:20.920> like<00:03:21.400> three<00:03:21.640> hundred<00:03:21.760> years<00:03:22.390> after

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
together like three hundred years after

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.670 
together like three hundred years after
Jesus<00:03:23.680> with<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.400> think<00:03:24.910> Bob<00:03:25.180> said<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.870> he<00:03:26.380> told

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
Jesus with I think Bob said that he told

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.810 
Jesus with I think Bob said that he told
John<00:03:27.250> he<00:03:27.910> told<00:03:28.180> Susie<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.860> think<00:03:30.160> let's<00:03:30.670> all

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
whisp and even if they're atheists I

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.340 
whisp and even if they're atheists I
always<00:06:10.390> think<00:06:10.570> it's<00:06:10.660> interesting<00:06:10.930> that<00:06:11.169> they

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
always think it's interesting that they

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.530 
always think it's interesting that they
think<00:06:11.410> that<00:06:11.770> atheists<00:06:12.520> who<00:06:12.820> do<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.390> only

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
thing that makes them atheists is that

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.530 
thing that makes them atheists is that
they<00:06:15.280> don't<00:06:15.580> believe<00:06:15.760> any<00:06:15.940> of<00:06:16.030> this<00:06:16.090> bullshit

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
they don't believe any of this bullshit

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.440 
they don't believe any of this bullshit
