00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
because I'm not driving what will not be

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.470 
because I'm not driving what will not be
as<00:00:30.779> good<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.009> know<00:00:32.130> nonetheless<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:33.059> will

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
as good but you know nonetheless we will

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.049 
as good but you know nonetheless we will
see<00:00:34.260> where<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.579> might<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.850> little

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
see where it's like it might be a little

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.760 
see where it's like it might be a little
bumpy<00:00:36.210> because<00:00:36.630> living<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.350> we're<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.530> going

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
bumpy because living out we're not going

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.650 
bumpy because living out we're not going
to<00:00:37.860> go<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.010> fast<00:00:38.219> he<00:00:38.640> gets<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.940> lot<00:00:39.059> bumpier<00:00:39.270> I

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
to go as fast he gets a lot bumpier I

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.979 
to go as fast he gets a lot bumpier I
don't<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.230> why<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:41.129> seems<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.989> also

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
don't know why but it seems to also

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.440 
don't know why but it seems to also
going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> see<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> Lumia<00:00:43.770> 925<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.910> any<00:00:45.180> good

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
going to see the Lumia 925 is any good

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.100 
going to see the Lumia 925 is any good
with<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.610> optical<00:00:47.610> image<00:00:47.910> stabilisation<00:00:48.510> see

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
with the optical image stabilisation see

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.260 
with the optical image stabilisation see
how<00:00:49.170> does<00:00:49.350> perform<00:00:49.940> post-assad<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> run<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
how does perform post-assad the run is

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.090 
how does perform post-assad the run is
going<00:00:51.360> past<00:00:51.629> there<00:00:51.840> don't<00:00:52.829> know<00:00:52.890> why<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
going past there don't know why the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.290 
going past there don't know why the
camera<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.820> where<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.149> could

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
camera up here where they could

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.049 
camera up here where they could
potentially<00:00:54.840> probably<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.320> killed<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
potentially probably get killed but you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.479 
potentially probably get killed but you
know<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.420> how<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.949> we'll<00:00:59.250> try<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
know that's how it is so we'll try and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.549 
know that's how it is so we'll try and
go<00:00:59.609> faster<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.390> my<00:01:00.719> driver<00:01:00.989> will<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> little

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
go faster so my driver will go a little

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.890 
go faster so my driver will go a little
bit<00:01:01.710> faster<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.930> be<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:04.110> very<00:01:04.320> conservative

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
bit faster now be very very conservative

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.850 
bit faster now be very very conservative
and<00:01:07.900> what<00:01:08.080> does<00:01:08.170> it<00:01:08.230> look<00:01:08.320> like<00:01:08.380> what's<00:01:08.800> the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
and what does it look like what's the

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.310 
and what does it look like what's the
video<00:01:09.100> test<00:01:09.310> look<00:01:09.460> like<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.930> say<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.200> would

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
video test look like got to say it would

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.600 
video test look like got to say it would
pretty<00:01:11.620> cool<00:01:11.830> if<00:01:11.980> i<00:01:12.070> did<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.250> head-on<00:01:12.430> collision

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
pretty cool if i did a head-on collision

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.240 
pretty cool if i did a head-on collision
or<00:01:13.060> filming<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:14.440> would<00:01:14.560> be<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.710> million

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
or filming this that would be a million
