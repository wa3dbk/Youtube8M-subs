00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.770
 hello friends here we are with the ipad 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.650
 mini and also with is founded subraye 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.289
 board of the garmin brand from now 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.589
 we are going to talk to you about more or 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.520
 less the cost how do you install what 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:21.650
 what is your use 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 good here is this is divided into 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.039
 Two parts 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.390
 is if they realize more or less like this 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.440
 this 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.450
 on par with a part of these that is 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.590
 this part is hard plastic 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.380
 and the other would not know how to say what 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.780
 what material is 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.880
 here that's pure plastic what is it 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.330
 it is put to who of the epa of the 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.490
 then in the to protest to protect 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.040
 the screen 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.300
 and obviously it gets when not 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.600
 because this 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.430
 well this costs 60 dollars in the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.090
 U.S 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.180
 this the truth if we protect you already what 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.460
 Sometimes it has fallen down and if I give it to you 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:22.620
 protects very well then here I am going to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.620
 install the ipad here 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.350
 and 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.740
 we are up to the year 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.160
 makeup 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.720
 already six soldiers were already that is 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.740
 on the other side more 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:00.010
 ok already put this part and this is what 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.920
 what are we going to put next this is 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:08.320
 the part that will cover the screen 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.750
 to this part because if you do not want it then 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.480
 yes it would be fine only that you should 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.250
 to take into account this that is a vote 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.300
 that is here it gets 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.020
 on the button that the truth cinema without this 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.390
 I would not like how it would look good 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.390
 then we are going to install this 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.969
 when I do that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.969
 it means 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.080
 and it is already 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.189
 that's it, I was lucky because the truth is not 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.180
 it's so easy the first time I could not 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.340
 It took me a long time 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.140
 and this time I was lucky because in fact 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.409
 This time is the time I've done it the most 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.409
 Quick 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.120
 and then let's talk about these and how 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.319
 can see 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:14.720
 it is handled well 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:17.720
 and it does not affect the screen 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.549
 and then this is going on that I do not remember 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:26.030
 if you mention to them that you put here that 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.150
 have spaces for that and they are given 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.150
 account 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.500
 and here is this space and here it is 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.500
 places 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.250
 later that can also be left here 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.500
 only not so here they stay 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.100
 getting ready not charging elsewhere or 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.130
 something like this will not tell you why 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.560
 it serves but this is a stand as 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.370
 let's say a smart cover only that 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.850
 are smart are the covers are 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.540
 can you put me like this example here for 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.540
 watch a movie 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.040
 to see a movie for example 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.699
 and then also 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.639
 also walk that which is for and also 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:24.810
 you can put it in this position that is 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:28.080
 rather to send to write or to send 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.530
 an account heart to see here I'm going to 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.690
 put my name and here for example 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:39.270
 we can also send ourselves I do not know what 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.090
 who want also if it is for you 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.330
 give them preference they like to have it like that 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.240
 to watch movies I do not know but more or 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.539
 except that is what is supposed to 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.940
 what is this 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:58.020
 and then it's only when you do not 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.349
 they 're going to use you're just like that and pull it 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.349
 brand 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.650
 and because it comes in many colors 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:11.630
 example here we have it in pure black 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.800
 but there is black example with black with 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.129
 Gray 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.599
 and then there's black with black blue with 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:23.280
 red after there are ones that are green are 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.069
 completely and there are many colors 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.630
 example here we buy it in a 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.830
 best buy 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:34.180
 go down 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:38.140
 and the price is 60 dollars I think that already 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.170
 I said it three times for $ 60 and then 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:45.120
 that's all if they are so good waves dale 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.120
