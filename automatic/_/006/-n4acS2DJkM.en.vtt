didn't hear the noise it could be faulty
and<00:00:34.829> another<00:00:35.160> thing<00:00:36.140> for<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> faulty<00:00:37.710> chime

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and another thing for a faulty chime

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.639 
and another thing for a faulty chime
module<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.650> defroster<00:00:40.650> doesn't<00:00:41.280> work<00:00:42.649> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
module is a defroster doesn't work so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.500 
module is a defroster doesn't work so
we're<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.300> we're

now the first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> remove<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.489> negative

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
we're going to remove the negative

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.770 
we're going to remove the negative
battery<00:00:55.079> cable<00:00:55.500> from<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> battery<00:00:59.780> next

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
battery cable from the battery next

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.709 
battery cable from the battery next
thing<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.020> need<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.820> inside<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
thing we need to do is to go inside the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.920 
thing we need to do is to go inside the
car<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.140> remove<00:01:04.759> this<00:01:05.759> panel<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.899> here

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
car and remove this panel right here

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.160 
car and remove this panel right here
which<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.469> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.009> left<00:01:08.249> side<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.450> console

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
which is on the left side of the console

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.399 
which is on the left side of the console
it's<00:01:10.859> held<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.340> by<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.329> velcro<00:01:12.569> fastener

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
it's held on by a little velcro fastener

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.949 
it's held on by a little velcro fastener
so<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.709> just<00:01:13.889> grab<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.969> front<00:01:15.389> of<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.630> like

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959 
so we just grab the front of it like

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:18.980 
so we just grab the front of it like
this<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:17.240> pull<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.359> right<00:01:18.389> out<00:01:18.600> like

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
this and just pull it right out like

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.469 
this and just pull it right out like
that<00:01:23.719> now<00:01:24.719> after<00:01:24.929> you<00:01:25.139> get<00:01:25.319> the<00:01:25.529> panel<00:01:26.130> off

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
that now after you get the panel off

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.919 
that now after you get the panel off
you'll<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.709> orange<00:01:29.609> piece<00:01:30.329> right<00:01:30.869> here

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
you'll see this orange piece right here

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:37.819 
you'll see this orange piece right here
that<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.670> chime<00:01:32.969> module<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.529> now<00:01:37.529> that<00:01:37.590> we

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that is the chime module so now that we

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.849 
that is the chime module so now that we
know<00:01:37.859> where<00:01:38.609> it<00:01:38.789> is<00:01:39.259> let's<00:01:40.259> remove<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:42.859> next

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
know where it is let's remove it next

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.039 
know where it is let's remove it next
thing<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.130> need<00:01:44.279> to<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.609> is<00:01:44.849> to<00:01:45.630> find<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
thing we need to do is to find the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.919 
thing we need to do is to find the
little<00:01:46.259> lock<00:01:46.759> that<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.939> underneath<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
little lock that is underneath the

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.389 
little lock that is underneath the
module<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:52.289> we<00:01:52.439> need<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:53.099> in<00:01:53.219> with<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
module and we need to go in with a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.699 
module and we need to go in with a
screwdriver<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:56.719> push<00:01:57.719> down<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.349> it<00:01:58.529> like

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
screwdriver and push down on it like

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:07.960 
screwdriver and push down on it like
that<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:01.009> now<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.849> can<00:02:03.319> pull<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:04.469> module<00:02:04.679> out

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:24.970 

okay<00:02:08.970> let's<00:02:09.180> take<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.540> module<00:02:10.020> out<00:02:10.350> now<00:02:23.690> okay

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
okay let's take the module out now okay

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:35.440 
okay let's take the module out now okay
there<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:29.210> there<00:02:30.210> is<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.600> chime<00:02:30.840> module

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.199 

now<00:02:37.970> what<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.120> go<00:02:39.270> wrong<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.810> these<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
now what can go wrong on these is the

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.220 
now what can go wrong on these is the
pins<00:02:42.860> can<00:02:43.860> corrode<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.810> want<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.140> look

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
pins can corrode so you want to look

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.180 
pins can corrode so you want to look
very<00:02:47.450> closely<00:02:48.450> at<00:02:50.750> those<00:02:51.750> pins<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.950> lot<00:02:53.160> of

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
very closely at those pins and a lot of

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.080 
very closely at those pins and a lot of
times<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:54.050> unplugging<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:56.340> module<00:02:56.940> and

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
times just unplugging this module and

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.870 
times just unplugging this module and
plugging<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.750> back<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:58.410> will<00:02:59.190> cure<00:02:59.580> all<00:02:59.820> your

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
plugging it back in will cure all your

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.060 
plugging it back in will cure all your
problems<00:03:02.330> if<00:03:03.330> not<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:04.050> would<00:03:04.380> go<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.740> junkie

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
problems if not I would go to the junkie

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.870 
problems if not I would go to the junkie
I'd<00:03:05.160> pick<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.610> spare<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.120> try<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:10.880> this

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
I'd pick up a spare and try that so this

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.130 
I'd pick up a spare and try that so this
one<00:03:12.060> right<00:03:12.209> here<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:13.500> pins<00:03:13.769> look<00:03:14.040> good<00:03:14.310> it's

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
one right here the pins look good it's

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.160 
one right here the pins look good it's
been<00:03:16.140> working<00:03:16.500> properly<00:03:16.769> anyways<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:21.170> you

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
been working properly anyways but you

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.500 
been working properly anyways but you
can<00:03:22.380> use<00:03:22.590> some<00:03:22.950> contact<00:03:23.760> cleaner<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.330> there

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
can use some contact cleaner in there

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.310 
can use some contact cleaner in there
clean<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:24.989> up<00:03:25.110> if<00:03:25.769> it's<00:03:26.100> dirty<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:27.330> when

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
clean it up if it's dirty and when

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:37.430 
clean it up if it's dirty and when
you're<00:03:28.470> done<00:03:31.430> just<00:03:32.430> put<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.910> module<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:36.440> you
