as<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.210> can<00:01:23.329> see<00:01:23.540> this<00:01:23.689> is<00:01:23.840> our<00:01:23.990> electricity

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
as you can see this is our electricity

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.920 
as you can see this is our electricity
meter<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.210> meter<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.299> actually<00:01:26.659> still

meter and the meter is actually still
going<00:01:27.189> forwards<00:01:28.189> because<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.299> only<00:01:29.479> about

system at the moment heading back into
the<00:01:33.649> grid<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:35.030> afternoon<00:01:35.570> at<00:01:36.110> lunchtime

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
the grid this afternoon at lunchtime

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.249 
the grid this afternoon at lunchtime
I'll<00:01:37.030> have<00:01:38.030> an<00:01:38.119> uptake<00:01:38.390> another<00:01:38.659> recording<00:01:39.110> of

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
I'll have an uptake another recording of

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.380 
I'll have an uptake another recording of
this<00:01:39.380> meter<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.070> you'll<00:01:40.850> see<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.149> going

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
this meter and you'll see it going

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.279 
this meter and you'll see it going
backwards<00:01:42.280> eventually<00:01:43.280> we'll<00:01:43.429> be<00:01:43.549> having<00:01:43.880> a

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
backwards eventually we'll be having a

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.899 
backwards eventually we'll be having a
import-export<00:01:45.289> meter<00:01:45.500> installed<00:01:46.039> so<00:01:46.880> that

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
import-export meter installed so that

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.800 
import-export meter installed so that
all<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.780> power<00:01:47.960> going<00:01:48.140> back<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.590> grid<00:01:49.810> can

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
all the power going back to the grid can

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.810 
all the power going back to the grid can
be<00:01:50.840> registered<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.649> then<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.399> government<00:01:52.759> is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
be registered and then the government is

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.550 
be registered and then the government is
going<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.000> pay<00:01:53.149> us<00:01:53.179> a<00:01:53.420> nice<00:01:53.570> 40<00:01:54.020> cents<00:01:54.380> for

going to pay us a nice 40 cents for

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.199 
going to pay us a nice 40 cents for
every<00:01:54.619> kilowatt<00:01:55.250> hour<00:01:55.429> that<00:01:55.700> we<00:01:55.819> feed<00:01:56.030> back
