00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
horror movies and I think that the jump

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.390 
horror movies and I think that the jump
scares<00:02:01.530> get<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> bad<00:02:01.890> name

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
scares get a bad name

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.550 
scares get a bad name
they're<00:02:02.790> very<00:02:02.940> exciting<00:02:03.480> things<00:02:03.720> in<00:02:03.930> films<00:02:04.470> as

they're very exciting things in films as

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.050 
they're very exciting things in films as
long<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.920> entire<00:02:05.100> film<00:02:05.520> doesn't<00:02:05.670> rely<00:02:06.030> on

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
long as the entire film doesn't rely on

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.120 
long as the entire film doesn't rely on
nothing<00:02:06.690> but<00:02:06.720> jump<00:02:07.110> scares<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.830> far<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.040> a

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
nothing but jump scares but as far as a
