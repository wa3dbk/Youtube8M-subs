big<00:03:54.780> you're<00:03:55.049> higher<00:03:55.230> off<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.530> ground<00:03:55.709> it

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
big you're higher off the ground it

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.860 
big you're higher off the ground it
feels<00:03:56.400> slightly<00:03:56.700> bloated<00:03:57.360> you<00:03:57.390> look<00:03:57.660> in<00:03:57.780> your

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
feels slightly bloated you look in your

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.150 
feels slightly bloated you look in your
rear<00:03:58.110> view<00:03:58.170> mirror<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.620> realize<00:03:58.920> that

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
rear view mirror and you realize that

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.190 
rear view mirror and you realize that
that<00:03:59.610> back<00:03:59.940> window<00:04:00.360> is<00:04:00.390> way<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.810> heck<00:04:00.959> back

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
that back window is way the heck back

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.949 
that back window is way the heck back
there<00:04:01.849> but<00:04:02.849> after<00:04:02.970> driving<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.720> day<00:04:03.840> it

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
there but after driving it for a day it

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.390 
there but after driving it for a day it
becomes<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.349> lot<00:04:04.530> more<00:04:04.680> comfortable<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.190> drive

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
becomes a lot more comfortable to drive

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.130 
becomes a lot more comfortable to drive
you<00:04:06.090> know<00:04:06.209> you're<00:04:06.360> driving<00:04:06.629> something<00:04:06.810> big

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
you know you're driving something big

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.630 
you know you're driving something big
but<00:04:07.379> not<00:04:07.470> nearly<00:04:07.769> as<00:04:07.920> big<00:04:08.069> as<00:04:08.099> I<00:04:08.310> thought<00:04:08.489> it

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
but not nearly as big as I thought it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.309 
but not nearly as big as I thought it
would<00:04:08.760> feel<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.510> think<00:04:09.720> that's<00:04:09.870> due<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.170> its

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
would feel and I think that's due to its

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.080 
would feel and I think that's due to its
suspension<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:10.920> doesn't<00:04:11.190> feel<00:04:11.430> like<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.670> big

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
suspension it doesn't feel like a big

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.360 
suspension it doesn't feel like a big
truck<00:04:12.540> kind<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.110> wonky<00:04:13.980> when<00:04:14.099> you're<00:04:14.220> going

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
truck kind of wonky when you're going

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.370 
truck kind of wonky when you're going
over<00:04:14.519> bumps<00:04:14.879> and<00:04:15.120> cracks<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:15.690> road<00:04:15.840> it

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
over bumps and cracks in the road it

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.370 
over bumps and cracks in the road it
feels<00:04:16.680> even<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:18.150> doesn't<00:04:18.329> feel<00:04:18.539> too<00:04:18.600> tight<00:04:19.019> to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
feels even it doesn't feel too tight to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.840 
feels even it doesn't feel too tight to
loose<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.829> just<00:04:20.100> feels<00:04:20.280> right

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
loose it just feels right

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.480 
loose it just feels right
and<00:04:21.419> with<00:04:21.660> such<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:21.870> quiet<00:04:22.079> cabin<00:04:22.650> it's<00:04:23.130> super

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
and with such a quiet cabin it's super

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.030 
and with such a quiet cabin it's super
easy<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.789> drive<00:04:24.090> for<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.360> longer<00:04:24.720> trip

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
easy to drive for a longer trip

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.260 
easy to drive for a longer trip
so<00:04:26.580> what<00:04:26.700> do<00:04:26.760> we<00:04:26.820> think<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> new

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
so what do we think of the new

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.760 
so what do we think of the new
Highlander<00:04:27.840> well<00:04:27.990> it's<00:04:28.140> reasonably<00:04:28.680> priced

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
Highlander well it's reasonably priced

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.910 
Highlander well it's reasonably priced
up<00:04:29.250> against<00:04:29.580> its<00:04:29.730> competitors<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:31.410> looks<00:04:31.710> good

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
up against its competitors it looks good

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.040 
up against its competitors it looks good
for<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.220> vehicle<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.640> this<00:04:32.670> size<00:04:32.900> it's<00:04:33.900> very

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
for a vehicle of this size it's very

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.100 
for a vehicle of this size it's very
quiet<00:04:34.590> inside<00:04:34.950> which<00:04:35.160> is<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.310> huge<00:04:35.850> plus<00:04:36.120> the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
quiet inside which is a huge plus the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.300 
quiet inside which is a huge plus the
interior<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.680> beautiful

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
interior is beautiful

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.890 
interior is beautiful
and<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:38.730> drives<00:04:38.970> great<00:04:39.590> but<00:04:41.450> there<00:04:42.450> are<00:04:42.600> a<00:04:42.630> few

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
and it drives great but there are a few

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.770 
and it drives great but there are a few
things<00:04:43.200> that<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.440> do<00:04:43.560> not<00:04:43.920> like<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.610> do<00:04:45.210> not<00:04:45.570> like

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
things that I do not like I do not like

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.630 
things that I do not like I do not like
this<00:04:45.930> power<00:04:46.200> liftgate<00:04:46.500> system<00:04:47.010> it's<00:04:47.340> really

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
this power liftgate system it's really

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.710 
this power liftgate system it's really
nice<00:04:47.790> having<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.150> convenience<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:48.630> being

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
nice having the convenience of being

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.150 
nice having the convenience of being
able<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:49.020> push<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.230> button<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.650> have<00:04:49.680> it<00:04:49.860> open

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
able to push a button to have it open

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.090 
able to push a button to have it open
and<00:04:50.250> close<00:04:50.490> but<00:04:51.410> if<00:04:52.410> someone<00:04:52.740> gets<00:04:52.830> stuck

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
and close but if someone gets stuck

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.010 
and close but if someone gets stuck
under<00:04:53.340> here<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.180> push<00:04:54.420> this<00:04:54.600> thing<00:04:54.870> down

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
under here and you push this thing down

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.590 
under here and you push this thing down
it's<00:04:55.650> not<00:04:55.860> nearly<00:04:56.130> sensitive<00:04:56.760> enough<00:04:56.970> it

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
it's not nearly sensitive enough it

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.210 
it's not nearly sensitive enough it
really<00:04:57.900> starts<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:58.290> come<00:04:58.380> down<00:04:58.560> hard<00:04:59.070> on

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
really starts to come down hard on

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.070 
really starts to come down hard on
someone<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.820> it<00:04:59.910> doesn't<00:05:00.300> always<00:05:00.390> pop<00:05:00.720> up<00:05:00.930> as

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
someone and it doesn't always pop up as

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.080 
someone and it doesn't always pop up as
quick<00:05:01.260> as<00:05:01.380> you'd<00:05:01.560> want<00:05:01.680> it<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.220> do<00:05:02.580> not<00:05:02.880> like

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
quick as you'd want it to I do not like

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.210 
quick as you'd want it to I do not like
the<00:05:03.240> infotainment<00:05:03.660> system<00:05:04.200> at<00:05:04.410> all<00:05:04.650> it's

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
the infotainment system at all it's

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.460 
the infotainment system at all it's
clunky<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.970> doesn't<00:05:06.630> look<00:05:06.870> good<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
clunky it doesn't look good and the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.470 
clunky it doesn't look good and the
general<00:05:07.830> design<00:05:07.980> is<00:05:08.340> just<00:05:08.370> unappealing<00:05:09.270> and

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
general design is just unappealing and

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.570 
general design is just unappealing and
that<00:05:10.110> power<00:05:10.380> liftgate<00:05:10.740> worries<00:05:11.190> me<00:05:11.340> a<00:05:11.370> little

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
that power liftgate worries me a little

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.160 
that power liftgate worries me a little
bit<00:05:11.730> it<00:05:11.940> should<00:05:12.120> be<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.270> lot<00:05:12.570> more<00:05:12.600> sensitive

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
bit it should be a lot more sensitive

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.870 
bit it should be a lot more sensitive
just<00:05:13.500> in<00:05:13.620> case<00:05:13.800> someone<00:05:14.130> gets<00:05:14.310> a<00:05:14.400> hand<00:05:14.610> stuck

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
just in case someone gets a hand stuck

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.300 
just in case someone gets a hand stuck
in<00:05:15.000> there<00:05:15.210> all<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:16.650> said<00:05:16.950> if<00:05:17.160> you're<00:05:17.280> looking

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
in there all that said if you're looking

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.160 
in there all that said if you're looking
for<00:05:17.820> a<00:05:17.850> vehicle<00:05:18.030> that<00:05:18.270> can<00:05:18.510> fit<00:05:18.720> seven<00:05:19.020> to

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.040 
eight passengers this 2014 highlander
could<00:05:22.110> certainly<00:05:22.440> do<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.800> trick
