00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.500 

so<00:00:01.110> I<00:00:01.140> have<00:00:01.530> finished<00:00:01.740> my<00:00:02.550> hair<00:00:02.760> my<00:00:02.970> crochet

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
so I have finished my hair my crochet

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.140 
so I have finished my hair my crochet
sew-in<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.279> reason<00:00:05.520> why<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.609> call<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:05.879> that

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
sew-in and the reason why I call it that

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.100 
sew-in and the reason why I call it that
is<00:00:06.359> because<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:07.730> crocheted<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:09.179> around<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
is because I crocheted that around the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.220 
is because I crocheted that around the
edges<00:00:11.000> and<00:00:12.000> then<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.570> sold<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.679> middle<00:00:13.980> and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
edges and then I sold the middle and

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.500 
edges and then I sold the middle and
this<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.320> my<00:00:16.470> first<00:00:16.680> time<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.730> anything<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.300> far

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this is my first time do anything so far

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.840 
this is my first time do anything so far
I<00:00:18.570> think<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.580> two

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
I think I like it I just have two

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.349 
I think I like it I just have two
concerns<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.050> though<00:00:22.939> one<00:00:23.939> concern<00:00:24.330> is

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
concerns with it though one concern is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.880 
concerns with it though one concern is
that<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.170> synthetic<00:00:25.439> care<00:00:26.150> so<00:00:27.470> as<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.680> gets

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that it is synthetic care so as it gets

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.460 
that it is synthetic care so as it gets
tangled<00:00:29.300> it<00:00:30.300> want<00:00:30.570> me<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> whole<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:31.289> but

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.520 
tangled it want me not a whole lot but
more<00:00:31.710> than<00:00:31.859> human<00:00:32.369> hair<00:00:32.870> what<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> know<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
more than human hair what I know this is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.220 
more than human hair what I know this is
I<00:00:35.300> don't<00:00:36.300> know<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.020> these

a<00:01:55.220> braided<00:01:56.220> smaller<00:01:56.790> around<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.690> edges<00:01:58.470> so

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
a braided smaller around the edges so

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.380 
a braided smaller around the edges so
that<00:01:59.970> there<00:02:00.690> won't<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.930> any<00:02:00.990> spaces<00:02:01.740> in

that one B in the fact I use the 30 at
the<00:04:27.730> top<00:04:27.940> as<00:04:28.150> well<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.780> couple<00:04:29.140> inches<00:04:29.440> off<00:04:29.650> the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
bottom and then I cut the top in half so

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.490

as<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.250> got<00:04:36.430> higher<00:04:36.970> so<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:37.930> can<00:04:38.110> get<00:04:38.350> that

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
as I got higher so I can get that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.980

layered effect I probably should have

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.960
