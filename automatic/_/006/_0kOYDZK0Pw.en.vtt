00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.920
 dream is a dirty word for many people 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.240
 is incorrectly used in the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.860
 comments often have entire discussions 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.900
 premium it does not exist what is it 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.340
 it's a fictional thing that we uphold 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.240
 keep them all we journalists too 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.439
 Is that right 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.330
 but good living proof that it 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.609
 is not fictional is the success of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.930
 bmw audi and mercedes that show that 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.970
 are also on a different platform that do 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.470
 it just structurally incredibly good 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.359
 and those are now building it again from china 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.679
 explodes and you may like your portion 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.210
 count on it because she makes it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.250
 now nothing more sports watersports 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 they were just participating in the premium brand 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.329
 actually scored what also does very well 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.739
 and then in a number of brands that want 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.110
 so happy when it actually works 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.230
 just not apparently in europe 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.300
 hopeless lexus well try it already it is 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.789
 it 30 years 40 years europe it comes 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.039
 never really got off the ground and I like that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.809
 you do in america brand always long 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.730
 pretty good 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.840
 my europa's in 2008 it goes well 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.820
 once difficult this is the newest 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.649
 model the cow 50 and now with two liters 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.110
 turbo engine that the new block will be up to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.760
 today only a very big hybrid 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.590
 whom I was far too lavish for sure 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.030
 the Netherlands and a diesel and the laundry was not 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.680
 the most refined engine in the world 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.299
 tape it one from mercedes 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.920
 and with this car try is now a one 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.810
 breakthrough on the european market 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.549
 so we are going to see where miss the brand 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.759
 to what compared to that established 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.759
 order 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.970
 let's start with this engine 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.020
 had the most important news right away 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.299
 you just have fallen in love with 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.470
 who q50 because design john people think 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.549
 it fantastic 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.899
 then this is the engine that should have it 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.869
 the netherlands that that hybrid is common 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.080
 he will overkill you soon but a fine one 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.179
 misses something and he is too expensive with you too 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.580
 I have a little more film in terms of capacity 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.950
 you then enough this man quickly in that 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.539
 so stands out in mercedes block 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.890
 that two-liter turbo and he also drives like 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.049
 in the Mercedes ie expected 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.009
 no horny motorcycle locks second you 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.229
 television or a 2-liter bmw turbo 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.490
 but one that comes when you are higher 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.409
 not so much more about it you need it anymore 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.420
 have from his middle area 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.890
 and then you also notice switching the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.269
 sometimes happens very long x which is automatic 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.610
 7-stage 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.860
 for instance, I would row now so 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.560
 and sheep against back click click 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.170
 its back 32 it just takes a few 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.750
 seconds of responding 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.730
 so imitating stress decline is fine 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.480
 supple but once you've take over self 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.480
 you often argue with that bin 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.520
 but price wise had fun in greedy 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.590
 do things with that engine 40,000 euros 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.760
 then my opoptions that it anyway 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.830
 advantage of the merckx I find here 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.560
 that the car is often packed 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.330
 without having to pay a lot extra 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.860
 the offer pretty good 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.390
 and now not infiniti and also on that 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.250
 say yes before you get such a bmw 3 series 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.840
 is loaded with just 20,000 euros 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.160
 further than ours with the same with 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.080
 power 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.790
 but of course I don't like that 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.660
 come to the heart of the problem 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.340
 premium 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.900
 people who buy BMW who give 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.640
 not much with money everything went quickly 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.040
 Ford Mondeo driving and everything for shopping 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.660
 60% of the price fully loaded car 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.870
 much larger more luggage space more 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.310
 the space in the back so there is something more 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.140
 They are the logo and people are paying for it 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.019
 brand long known will I bring them 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.340
 I have a Mercedes number on you 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.660
 thus a stand drives for example 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.880
 unique 50 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.380
 they are also simply better where is there now 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.930
 in it is in everything it is in 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.760
 balance in refinement and air conditioning 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.500
 starter here all the time 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.820
 that is more blowing and it 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.560
 does not stop either 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.390
 one Mercedes BMW is that there are many 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.930
 through a whole room around not 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.799
 the web that has cold air in sight 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.420
 your controls 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.340
 Dependent on setting can be extreme 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.359
 direct and heavy are good at sports 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.620
 infinities 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.410
 I don't find it here at all like mine 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.959
 control we can go directness 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.670
 and adjust the gravity and sultan 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.010
 mistake that heavy steering is sporty 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.690
 no send ferrari's on maserati's 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.459
 of light for example when whole 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.200
 direct with a lot of feeling 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.060
 this then becomes heavy and then super direct 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.289
 and then so directly that you or domains the 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.039
 touches sidewalk on the inside and 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.900
 therefore you get a very spacious one 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.110
 imbalance in the cars of very unpleasant 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.240
 who drive this car and 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.009
 it just doesn't work and that's weird 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.689
 because in the g37 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.849
 kind of sad minister 370 set in luxury 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.750
 packaging was very good there 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.750
 business went down 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.310
 drive through you look at design two 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.450
 screens quite striking and it's handy 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.980
 Sometimes it gets you here 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.630
 navigation maps between will you want in 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.070
 arrange the radio and then first split 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.389
 do you still have a navigation to it 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.570
 keep an overview 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.100
 therefore just fine pure riding 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.200
 the balance is also becoming a problem again 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.880
 with it does not feel like a good whole 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.169
 as if it were like separate parts 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.430
 merged 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.320
 you can be very hard and direct 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.110
 control you get that to balance you 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.730
 sends a car too fast in often colony 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.620
 something too much comes out and you have to 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.600
 you compensated so quite smoothly 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.190
 steering is often better 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.870
 may your heart go then he says yes then 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.780
 Help your hearts go round 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.919
 by running down the 18th but think 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.150
 describe a little harder and and feel 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.490
 to almost support is gone 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.680
 porridge and brake surgery that do not stop 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.240
 dsp me then just tilt the car 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.800
 but as a result , the car also runs out again 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.510
 balance and then they fly that fine one 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.669
 cadence in the rows that disappears and that 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.800
 is often what makes driving a pleasure and that 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.500
 find the balance in an example in a BMW 3 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.510
 series or four see the reasons prepared more 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.470
 to pay for his car 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.700
 because if you don't feel it you have to 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.260
 do not 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.910
 it is that balance that refinement that 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.760
 Then missing in the car like this infiniti 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.950
 q50 the special design and beautiful leather 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.640
 the good value for money who does it 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.640
 nothing from it
