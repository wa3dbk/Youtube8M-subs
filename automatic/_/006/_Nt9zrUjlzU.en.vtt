00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.340
 now it is already a few classes 2 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.989
 that you just look in the chords 8 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.929
 I'll play you like that 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.929
 Company 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.749
 which is complicated too 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.580
 why I am in cash and therefore the best possible spotlight is to stay 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.909
 the did 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.310
 that I also include the song the following 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.930
 in The Hague 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.300
 after the match 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.350
 in the nba 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 ever grab it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.170
 medium points 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.910
 ever be through defeat 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.780
 where you what to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.190
 14 but not in the la time 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.290
 the first team 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.290
 the wolden hangs beer and w 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.140
 this is the day 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.810
 the union is green 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.810
 the netherlands is one 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.450
 3 what is this 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 I think so 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.330
 and that is forbidden 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.310
 and now a rotating grandstand 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.310
 if you come again 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.430
 Also this year, playing will be good again 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 something else I am embarrassed by the commission 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.270
 we say playing with the chords comes true 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 in the course of the years 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.420
 the reason why buy 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.000
 the 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 previously thought 2 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 around half past three 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.870
 a shoe 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.049
 zweeloo psv 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.049
 he announced that on Tuesday 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.799
 a return 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.799
 and that's it 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.799
 then runs is broken 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:27.740
 I fell 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.740
 or watch it again 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.540
 add to the debate even if you can do that but i also have a version that 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.540
 it goes like this 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.939
 dana winner 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.839
 today 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.180
 to watch colleagues of the pair 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.070
 breeders who really
