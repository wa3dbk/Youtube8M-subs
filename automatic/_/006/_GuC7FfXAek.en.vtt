00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
you could do this with a provisional

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.750 
you could do this with a provisional
crocheted<00:02:14.459> chain<00:02:14.780> cast<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.230> but<00:02:16.620> as<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.490> see

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
crocheted chain cast on but as you see

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.150 
crocheted chain cast on but as you see
this<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:19.080> necessary<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:22.230> possible<00:02:22.920> to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
this is not necessary it's possible to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.180 
this is not necessary it's possible to
knit<00:02:23.490> those<00:02:23.910> stitches<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.650> cast<00:02:25.920> on

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
knit those stitches out of the cast on

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.180 
knit those stitches out of the cast on
chain<00:02:29.060> just<00:02:30.060> one<00:02:30.450> round<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.350> knit<00:02:32.160> stitches

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
chain just one round of knit stitches

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.479 
chain just one round of knit stitches
and<00:02:33.140> then<00:02:34.140> we<00:02:34.350> start<00:02:34.709> again<00:02:34.860> with<00:02:35.280> our
