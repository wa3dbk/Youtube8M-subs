now<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.130> reason<00:01:24.400> behind<00:01:24.670> all<00:01:25.060> this<00:01:25.270> is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
now the reason behind all this is

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.350 
now the reason behind all this is
summarized<00:01:26.290> in<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.620> following<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:28.150> father

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
summarized in the following my father

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.090 
summarized in the following my father
had<00:01:28.600> Parkinson's<00:01:29.230> and<00:01:29.410> I<00:01:29.560> had<00:01:29.680> a<00:01:29.740> friend<00:01:29.980> with

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
had Parkinson's and I had a friend with

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.940 
had Parkinson's and I had a friend with
MS<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.870> I<00:01:31.870> had<00:01:32.020> all<00:01:32.140> these<00:01:32.260> great<00:01:32.470> things<00:01:32.530> and

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.470 
MS and I had all these great things and
I<00:01:32.980> figured<00:01:33.280> put<00:01:33.730> it<00:01:33.820> together<00:01:33.940> as<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.210> package

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
I figured put it together as a package

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.260 
I figured put it together as a package
so<00:01:34.840> I<00:01:34.870> did<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.950> although<00:01:36.460> people<00:01:36.760> told<00:01:37.150> her

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
so I did and although people told her

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.120 
so I did and although people told her
that<00:01:37.450> great<00:01:37.630> things<00:01:37.900> cannot<00:01:38.320> work<00:01:38.560> as<00:01:38.770> service

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
that great things cannot work as service

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.790 
that great things cannot work as service
dogs<00:01:39.160> she<00:01:40.150> followed<00:01:40.540> her<00:01:40.750> heart<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.590> did

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800
