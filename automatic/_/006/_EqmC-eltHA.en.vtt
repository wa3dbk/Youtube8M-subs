I'm<00:00:00.240> going<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.960> start<00:00:01.260> with<00:00:01.589> turning<00:00:02.159> on<00:00:02.310> and

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
I'm going to start with turning on and

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.670 
I'm going to start with turning on and
zeroing<00:00:02.909> out<00:00:03.090> my<00:00:03.240> scale<00:00:03.540> with<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.290> container

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
zeroing out my scale with the container

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.930 
zeroing out my scale with the container
on<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:04.980> scale<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:06.390> way<00:00:06.690> as<00:00:07.040> I<00:00:08.040> measure<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
on the scale that way as I measure the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.560 
on the scale that way as I measure the
water

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
water

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.629 
water
I'm<00:00:09.750> only<00:00:10.410> measuring<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.190> weight<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
I'm only measuring the weight of the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.370 
I'm only measuring the weight of the
water<00:00:15.500> my<00:00:16.500> advantage<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.949> being<00:00:17.250> outdoors<00:00:18.380> I'm

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
water my advantage to being outdoors I'm

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.250 
water my advantage to being outdoors I'm
setting<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:19.980> aside<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:21.750> next<00:00:21.990> thing<00:00:22.140> I'll

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
setting this aside the next thing I'll

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.700 
setting this aside the next thing I'll
do<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.590> measure<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.250> line<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:24.560> find<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
do is measure out the line I find that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.279 
do is measure out the line I find that
it's<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.980> convenient<00:00:26.519> step<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.539> measure<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.109> in

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
it's a convenient step to measure it in

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.279 
it's a convenient step to measure it in
a<00:00:28.349> baggie<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.050> carry

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
a baggie so that if you have to carry

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.290 
a baggie so that if you have to carry
this<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.769> handle<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.369> or<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
this or handle this or if you have to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.720 
this or handle this or if you have to
pause<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> process<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.040> close<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.460> up

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
pause in the process you can close it up

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:48.700 
pause in the process you can close it up
once<00:00:38.730> again<00:00:39.379> will<00:00:40.379> zero<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.920> scale<00:00:46.129> 6<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.370> 3/4

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
once again will zero the scale 6 and 3/4

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
once again will zero the scale 6 and 3/4
promptly<00:00:49.710> cover<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.280> line

water and the line now it's very
important<00:01:02.729> it's<00:01:02.850> critical<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.170> add<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
important it's critical that you add the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950 
important it's critical that you add the
lye<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.399> water<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> other<00:01:06.780> way

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
lye to the water and not the other way

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.719 
lye to the water and not the other way
around<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.740> other<00:01:07.860> way<00:01:08.070> around<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.549> is

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
around the other way around this is

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.450 
around the other way around this is
going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> produce<00:01:09.119> heat<00:01:09.509> this<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.130> pour

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to produce heat this as as I pour

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.430 
going to produce heat this as as I pour
this<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.360> near<00:01:12.630> boiling<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
this in is going to get near boiling and

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340 
this in is going to get near boiling and
so<00:01:14.039> if<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.610> poured<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.180> little<00:01:15.869> bit<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> water

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
so if you poured a little bit of water

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.730 
so if you poured a little bit of water
in<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.860> bag<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.310> lye<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.820> could<00:01:18.330> explode<00:01:18.810> so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
in this bag of lye it could explode so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.529 
in this bag of lye it could explode so
I'm<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.039> pour<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.850> slowly<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
I'm going to pour this very slowly and

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.620 
I'm going to pour this very slowly and
gradually<00:01:22.490> I'm<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.789> be<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:24.090> careful

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
gradually I'm going to be very careful

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.070 
gradually I'm going to be very careful
that<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:25.229> produce<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.799> lot<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.009> dust<00:01:26.399> as<00:01:27.080> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that I don't produce a lot of dust as I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.919 
that I don't produce a lot of dust as I
stir<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.830> want<00:01:29.429> to<00:01:29.520> make<00:01:29.700> sure<00:01:32.569> that<00:01:33.569> I<00:01:33.630> don't

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
stir it I want to make sure that I don't

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.600 
stir it I want to make sure that I don't
get<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> lump<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> bottom<00:01:35.130> because<00:01:35.460> it's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
get a lump in the bottom because it's

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.760 
get a lump in the bottom because it's
real<00:01:35.940> hard<00:01:36.330> to<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.750> rid<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.229> lump<00:01:37.500> once

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
real hard to get rid of a lump once

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.760 
real hard to get rid of a lump once
you've<00:01:37.950> created<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.899> also<00:01:39.899> lean<00:01:40.409> back<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you've created it I also lean back a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
you've created it I also lean back a
little<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.490> there's<00:01:41.729> no<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.479> I'm

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
little bit that there's no way that I'm

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.889 
little bit that there's no way that I'm
going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.959> be<00:01:43.140> breathing<00:01:43.500> these<00:01:43.890> fumes<00:01:44.899> it's

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
going to be breathing these fumes it's

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
going to be breathing these fumes it's
getting<00:01:46.289> very<00:01:46.470> hot<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.830> can<00:01:47.159> already<00:01:47.429> tell<00:01:47.700> just

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
getting very hot I can already tell just

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.180 
getting very hot I can already tell just
with<00:01:48.209> my<00:01:48.390> hands<00:01:48.869> even<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.289> gloves<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.890> I

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
with my hands even with gloves on I

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.760 
with my hands even with gloves on I
found<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.390> tends<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.899> cake<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
found it kind of tends to cake up on the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.800 
found it kind of tends to cake up on the
spoon<00:01:53.069> you<00:01:53.610> don't<00:01:53.789> want<00:01:53.940> any<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.179> of<00:01:54.360> buildup

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

of the lye the goggles and the gloves

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.420 
of the lye the goggles and the gloves
always<00:01:59.399> seem<00:01:59.729> awkward<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.930> unnecessary

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
always seem awkward and unnecessary

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.880 
always seem awkward and unnecessary
until<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> start<00:02:02.850> doing<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:04.530> breathe<00:02:04.859> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
until I start doing this you breathe a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.649 
until I start doing this you breathe a
little<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.369> those<00:02:05.549> fumes<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.390> start

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
little of those fumes and you start

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.539 
little of those fumes and you start
feeling<00:02:06.869> how<00:02:07.140> hot<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.560> gets<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.100> realize

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
feeling how hot it gets and you realize

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.759 
feeling how hot it gets and you realize
how<00:02:08.789> important<00:02:09.359> it<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.660> protect<00:02:10.289> yourself

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
how important it is to protect yourself

hundred and fifteen degrees and it'll
take<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.329> little<00:02:45.540> while<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.170> while<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.739> is

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799

take a little while so while this is
cooling<00:02:47.360> we're<00:02:48.360> going<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:49.849> mix<00:02:50.849> our<00:02:51.060> oils<00:02:51.480> and

cooling we're going to mix our oils and
warm<00:02:52.110> them<00:02:52.409> up<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.890> we're<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.519> prepare

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
warm them up and we're going to prepare
