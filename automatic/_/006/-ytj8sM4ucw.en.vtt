 footballer and you know who he is 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.959
 biological arturo vidal told us that 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.490
 he moved house here so let's go 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.889
 to talk with your family to know 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.449
 how his life changed what it is like to live in 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.660
 Germans who do not know a little about 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.660
 man 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.040
 yes 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.980
 I go to height account of how is how is 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.149
 your sports life in germany well 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.070
 I have not got used to what 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.610
 germany I think football is different 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.780
 and I'm already winning a position so I do not 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.920
 It's easy with Chilean but with my family 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.400
 and you think it's good to come to the 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.400
 selection 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.950
 super good because I also have with 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.720
 who to talk to every two can let go 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.530
 everything I have can demonstrate what 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.140
 I'm learning outside and people will 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.320
 recognizes in Germany and the course because 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.940
 there is a lot of equipment and language 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 hard 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.950
 I learned something speak a word hello 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.430
 how are we talking a bit about the game 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.560
 on Sunday 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.770
 how do you think he will go to Chile against 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770
 Uruguay 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.120
 but that's as I said until then 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.760
 they all come so I do not think that 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.220
 you see a new group a young group that 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.710
 he wants things so I think that very 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.450
 all right 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 3 that is so aggressive the Uruguayans 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.000
 that is the basis of it I think they think 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.200
 that the other team is going to have because 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.750
 they do things before the game in Tunisia 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.700
 I think it's that Chileans are hitting 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.890
 but we're not going with that we're going 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.430
 Take attention is what you do only 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.430
 I'll play 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.550
 how much how many goals can they have 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.680
 hands 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.680
 but play yours 1 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.290

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.370
 I still wanted to be 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.860
 I wanted to relax a bit, I think that 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.020
 is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.210
 people are as is 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.090
 pending there were many people in the 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.800
 house so we still prefer to take my 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.500

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.750
