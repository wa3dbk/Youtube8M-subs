00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.420
 the persecution usually at the helene investigation area 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.439
 treat this time by jean-louis

 she was unjustly mowed on Iran's closer experience 30m2 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.619
 at the risk of being out of step with the francisco calendar announced me if 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 spring it belongs to all rights 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.449
 it is not one but two books she will present georges michel tastet 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.560
 writer two very different others that are worth the detour 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.999
 he also wants to undoubtedly divert to his side on this board a good player 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:34.560
 still 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.780
 - nantes - from 15-20 merchant it is an honor of my wife and my story 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 kapisa 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.550
 some - in a club we aerate good game pastor activating the safest 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.370
 way like that because lagging active retirement 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.410
 former host of a TV series one on channel she forced 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.510
 a television station in switzerland 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.550
 you are passionate about 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.500
 the unique targeted profile and then everything that touches a little bit to the notice of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.620
 those whom you know by heart the 22 m chapter of the caliph 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.829
 but we talk about it is also one of the most emblematic places 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.280
 of the elite dog island that attracts the most expensive of readers 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.290
 first question of what are you in order to scatology a little bit 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.170
 the end of the world as a minority 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.740
 while the end of the world I do not think 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.040
 but the end in the world, that is, a system of things 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.060
 want it is likely 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.500
 things move forward makes it evolve quickly and I believe 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.700
 that indeed we are in a crucial period a kind of humanity 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.200
 people over 8 years old whose whose advertised on television and even 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.840
 aviation is arguing afp while we are on TV 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.630
 and the elected it matters who can see it 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.340
 in chapter 11 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.770
 the book of the apocalypse precisely there is talk of two 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.970
 characters 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.750
 who is he going to jerusalem and the text specifies more time than eventually 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.109
 we can see them his head is so surprising 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.099
 as for the 19th century a champion of the rationalist union and the coming do 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.470
 a lecture tour in switzerland and this date one of his arguments 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:18.060
 major this sme had to say yes it's ridiculous to believe in the bible because 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.640
 that she says that someday we will see all the earth 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.640
 what happens in july there must indeed be big 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.380
 he is then a clement pastor 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.670
 in the meantime today I wanted to go 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.110
 all those who see us right now they will have they have the longest tunnel 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.040
 to welcome them see see him anyway the man on the moon we'll see 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.749
 soon on march probably 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.850
 so me there the text 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.400
 which is still understandable in the 19th century and that is a reality for 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.080
 every teenager now and who has checked and rigorously accurate the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.270
 had that also about him of 2001 and the rest he proves it to us well 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.209
 the second place at the village hall m pastors and practices head la 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.850
 stat in the Cevennes other protester is dead 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.699
 so let's talk first about the what we 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:05.889
 a return to the sources 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.489
 it's a story that happens elsewhere 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 first in the Paris region in Morocco in paris xième and xiième 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.619
 % at the time made his success of many things and who 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.939
 and who succeeds him professionally 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.149
 in the first place 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:26.239
 and at the same time reality of debts relationships of his life story
