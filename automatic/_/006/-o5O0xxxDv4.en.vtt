The yokotap is a buttbounce yokohama with a backside spin

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
at first it may sound like your spine is gonna blow but if you follow some steps and go easy it's not that hard

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
let me take the mattress line as an example

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you are in a buttbounce

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
this little front foot tap people usually do between buttbounces

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
you should try and do this tap but on the other side of the line

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
at the same time you are kicking the line in a yokohama

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
go on the buttbounce ...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
do the yokohama right here ...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.500
and throw the other leg here ...

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.000
you tapped the line on the other side, then spin around it, and land a buttbounce again

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.500
your arms position may also help you

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.000
when you land the buttbounce ... throw your arms directed to the line

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and right after you do the yokohama you throw your arms on the other direction to help you spin

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that leg position back here will guide your spin so you won't miss the line when you are ready to land the second buttbounce
