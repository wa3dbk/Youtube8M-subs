00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 cry magazine the week 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.009
 daniel pierre i am a former student 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.900
 university of orleans 1998 to go out 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.840
 of college I created a company the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.489
 company runs a specialized company 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.570
 in information systems and the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.160
 water resource management 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.800
 today a little over thirty 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.410
 of people who for over a year and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.839
 half already joined antea group the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.659
 consulting and engineering company in 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.040
 environment and I am currently the 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.799
 Director Research and 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.690
 lace development or in France by 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:58.379
 actually the foundation I think of a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 essential role of implementation 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.489
 relationship of the world of business and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 world of the world university that 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.010
 so far live together live 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.710
 side by side but does not work 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.570
 necessarily always very well together I 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.180
 think that if the primary interest 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.920
 actually with a view to inserting 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.530
 young people trained by the university is in 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.240
 view for companies to find 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.770
 young people that they are qualified according to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.770
 needs of the economic world 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.039
 when you are a tm me I was chief 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.810
 corporate a sme that you are not going 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.899
 not university is a world 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.200
 still a little apart 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.480
 structurally and then with with 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.690
 codes and 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.250
 relationships a little bit peculiar 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.170
 but once you have it's 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.920
 penetrate this world of the university 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.630
 you see that there are opportunities to 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.550
 extremely important cooperation so 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.220
 the first phase vis-Ã -vis smes 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.710
 it's pedagogy and so we 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.990
 role is precisely to be engaged 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.090
 direct with the business world of 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.190
 to be able to explain to the university world 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.660
 what are the expectations of the world of 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.530
 the company to give our point of 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.930
 to make the link 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.240
 whether for internships or for 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.220
 jobs a lot of students in 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.750
 integrate start-ups for ideas 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.120
 do research in this direction 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.210
 for us it is an immense wealth 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.220
 because we are looking for all these 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.020
 small innovations these small 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.700
 technologies all that can be 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.750
 brought to the smart level for example 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.880
 our vocation our possibility is 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.260
 to accompany young people and that's 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.630
 to accompany companies for 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.830
 that they are found who know each other 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.540
 then the second is the setting 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.060
 music that is to say that finally 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.940
 when a theme is facing a 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.630
 problem one she does not hesitate to 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.670
 call an academic wii or 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.090
 the university that will then guide it 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.040
 to actually found the person or 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.340
 the group who are working or who can 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.870
 do applied research for the 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.670
 for sme today 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.049
 for us innovation is a small 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.260
 little new business new 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.440
 market is discovering and seeing 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.209
 how to approach the world differently 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.010
 it's not about training 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.450
 strictly adapted to the company but 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.030
 that this employability is 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.220
 actually succeeded 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.709
 so I know that the university of orleans 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.799
 and is very successful in this area 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.640
 there since they were classified in the 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.900
 top 10 I think they are third 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.410
 for the insertion of students 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.160
 so this year this is a 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.019
 program initialization 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.760
 investment of the foundation of 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.920
 the university so a lot of work from 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.920
 background you are already preparing a valuation 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.900
 at all patents all products 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.549
 that could be valuable in the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.659
 economic world it's a census 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.569
 which is going on today 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.349
 and then quite soon 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.850
 should take place the official announced 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.140
 organisation 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.300
 a prize rewarding works 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.490
 academic student work 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.470
 who have directly benefited 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.050
 companies from the territory to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.030
 local communities purpose being to 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.490
 show that the foundation diverscities 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.970
 Lorient is an important operator 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.160
 multi regional local economic su and 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.830
 that besides that the university can 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.980
 bring decisive elements 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.480
 regarding innovation in 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.990
 companies and innovation in 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.940
 services 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.650
 it is something that is important to me 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.350
 can not position this foundation 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.090
 in interaction between the world and the 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.050
 economic colts on the one hand and the world 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.050
 Academic goes there others
