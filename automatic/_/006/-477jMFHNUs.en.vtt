00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
school got in to San Diego and I think

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.820

over like 175 applied um but my school
is<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.280> very<00:02:38.670> well-known<00:02:39.240> school<00:02:39.630> like

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
is like a very well-known school like

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.650 
is like a very well-known school like
that<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.860> well<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.090> harder<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.510> get

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
that we do well so it's harder to get

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.900 
that we do well so it's harder to get
into<00:02:42.810> San<00:02:43.080> Diego<00:02:43.350> State<00:02:43.530> from<00:02:43.800> my<00:02:43.980> school<00:02:44.280> it's

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
San Diego State for my school had like

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.540 
San Diego State for my school had like

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.880 
only reason I got in with three point
eight<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:58.890> because<00:02:59.640> I'm<00:02:59.880> American<00:03:00.090> Indian<00:03:00.390> and

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
eight is because I'm American Indian and

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.050 
eight is because I'm American Indian and

friends that had a 3.8 and like the same

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.300 
friends that had a 3.8 and like the same
test<00:03:12.660> scores<00:03:12.840> even<00:03:13.110> better<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.380> CT<00:03:13.800> scores<00:03:14.100> than

me they got denied and they had the same

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.750 
me they got denied and they had the same
major<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.480> don't<00:03:19.380> think<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.950> because<00:03:20.610> of

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
major so I don't think it's because of

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.970 
major so I don't think it's because of
the<00:03:20.880> major<00:03:21.090> I'm<00:03:21.269> in<00:03:21.420> either<00:03:21.660> because<00:03:22.320> there's

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the major I'm in either because there's

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.789 
the major I'm in either because there's
people<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.310> did<00:03:23.430> way<00:03:23.610> better<00:03:23.790> than<00:03:24.000> me<00:03:24.150> so

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
people that did way better than me so

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.050

but I feel like I would have had a

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.059 
but I feel like I would have had a
harder<00:04:08.780> time<00:04:08.810> if<00:04:09.200> I<00:04:09.319> was<00:04:09.590> applying<00:04:09.799> to

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
harder time if I was applying to

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.330 
harder time if I was applying to
somewhere<00:04:10.700> where<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.060> needed<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:11.629> si<00:04:12.500> or<00:04:12.890> like<00:04:13.310> a

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
somewhere where I needed a si or like a

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.589 
somewhere where I needed a si or like a
common<00:04:13.730> app<00:04:13.849> school<00:04:14.090> like<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.299> private

common app school like the private

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.900 
common app school like the private
schools<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.950> don't<00:04:16.430> believe<00:04:16.519> it<00:04:16.699> was<00:04:16.789> that
