 no plan 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.250
 there knows always with half knowledge 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.679
 and that's good to test it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.849
 those who know each other 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.630
 It looks like that in here 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:34.200
 rocket launch base we also have ic 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.479
 Control We can to pencil it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.539
 brad lead story exactly then we have to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.069
 pencil here this camera because you can 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.330
 look back there we can into the 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.340
 look at the cafÃ© and wherever that is 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 you can look 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.869
 then we have a lot here 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.190
 so let me tell you you can 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.530
 everything a switch and somehow 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.910
 switch off 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.649
 s.besten press all look something 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.360
 then we can pass the window 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.830
 open up and best of all the whole 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.810
 turn it on now 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.020
 since I have no plan , I leave 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.030
 drive a helper and hope that it 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.900
 can and now we look at the whole 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.900
 mine action 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.860
 start motor that is definitely times 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 a good part 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.780
 so you can do it all 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.500
 ca 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.390
 looks really steep in any case 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.390
 that works out the whole again 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.250
 it is definitely killer part it is 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.250
 really cool 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.810
 so is the chaos itself where the teams 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.810
 we drive the thing 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.050
 already cool or we can here 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.319
 completely 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.939
 13 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.100
 neither down here, nor here then 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.750
 continues 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.760
 here about the chaos itself victims 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.760
 The land is so that's gigantic 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.709
 really great is 111 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.460
 you still have those too 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.210
 it is 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.210
 has failed 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.170
 the trail has come 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.920
 is definitely a great story 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.660
 as I said if you like that me 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.960
 says this is my new one 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.330
 or as I said think that 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.509
 to let in the dealership and have fun 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.509
 there 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.470
 I wanted to show that there really is 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.470
