thank you very much for joining us I
guess<00:00:16.960> we<00:00:17.500> could<00:00:17.590> start<00:00:17.710> off<00:00:17.950> with<00:00:18.100> just<00:00:18.280> a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
guess we could start off with just a

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.189 
guess we could start off with just a
very<00:00:18.699> brief<00:00:18.880> overview<00:00:19.330> of<00:00:19.570> sight<00:00:20.020> Terry

Cytori therapeutics and what you guys
are<00:00:23.019> developing<00:00:23.439> great<00:00:24.070> morning<00:00:24.460> people<00:00:24.640> the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
are developing great morning people the

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.120 
are developing great morning people the
the<00:00:25.660> field<00:00:25.869> of<00:00:25.990> regenerative<00:00:26.080> medicine<00:00:26.619> is

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
the field of regenerative medicine is

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.609 
the field of regenerative medicine is
just<00:00:28.060> beginning<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:28.689> this<00:00:28.960> whole<00:00:29.169> new<00:00:29.349> age

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
just beginning and this whole new age

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.760 
just beginning and this whole new age
has<00:00:29.919> begun<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.269> key<00:00:31.720> limitation<00:00:32.110> for

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
has begun but the key limitation for

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.860 
has begun but the key limitation for
cell-based<00:00:33.430> regenerative<00:00:34.060> medicine<00:00:34.270> is<00:00:34.570> that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
cell-based regenerative medicine is that

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.890 
cell-based regenerative medicine is that
access<00:00:35.829> to<00:00:35.980> cells<00:00:36.390> doesn't<00:00:37.390> exist<00:00:37.690> anywhere

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
access to cells doesn't exist anywhere

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.630 
access to cells doesn't exist anywhere
in<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.110> world<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:38.560> we've<00:00:39.220> effectively

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
in the world and we've effectively

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.850 
in the world and we've effectively
solved<00:00:40.120> that<00:00:40.240> problem<00:00:40.390> by<00:00:40.750> creating<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:41.530> point

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
solved that problem by creating a point

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.310 
solved that problem by creating a point
of<00:00:41.980> care<00:00:42.220> system<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:43.390> enables<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.870> doctor<00:00:44.200> to

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
of care system that enables a doctor to

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.810 
of care system that enables a doctor to
take<00:00:44.470> a<00:00:44.530> small<00:00:44.860> amount<00:00:45.010> of<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.250> patient's<00:00:45.640> own

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
and they're treating variety of things

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.810 
and they're treating variety of things
everything<00:00:56.530> from<00:00:56.680> heart<00:00:56.830> disease<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.250> a

breast reconstruction after cancer so

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.259 
breast reconstruction after cancer so
your<00:01:01.930> solution<00:01:02.260> system<00:01:03.070> is<00:01:03.190> what<00:01:04.119> you<00:01:04.210> were

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
your solution system is what you were

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.270 
your solution system is what you were
just<00:01:04.360> mentioning<00:01:04.750> is<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.320> point<00:01:05.619> of<00:01:05.710> care<00:01:06.009> in

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
just mentioning is a point of care in

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.640 
just mentioning is a point of care in
real<00:01:06.700> time<00:01:07.030> processing<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:07.990> adipose<00:01:08.380> tissue

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
real time processing of adipose tissue

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.260 
real time processing of adipose tissue
for<00:01:08.950> adult<00:01:09.310> stem<00:01:09.490> cells<00:01:09.790> for<00:01:10.300> reuse<00:01:10.720> I<00:01:11.710> guess

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
for adult stem cells for reuse I guess

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.240 
for adult stem cells for reuse I guess
lets<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.960> know<00:01:14.080> it's<00:01:14.320> already<00:01:14.530> being<00:01:14.650> used<00:01:14.710> in

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
lets you know it's already being used in

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.430 
lets you know it's already being used in
multiple<00:01:15.370> applications<00:01:16.240> let's<00:01:17.050> start<00:01:17.230> with

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
multiple applications let's start with

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.220 
multiple applications let's start with
the<00:01:17.980> breast<00:01:18.630> augmentation<00:01:19.630> and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
the breast augmentation and

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.500 
the breast augmentation and
reconstruction<00:01:20.920> what<00:01:21.490> countries<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.030> being

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
reconstruction what countries is being

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.080 
reconstruction what countries is being
used<00:01:22.870> in<00:01:23.050> currently<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:23.830> you<00:01:24.790> know<00:01:24.850> what<00:01:25.000> kind

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
used in currently and you know what kind

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.760 
used in currently and you know what kind
of<00:01:25.180> results<00:01:25.300> are<00:01:25.630> these<00:01:25.750> physicians<00:01:26.170> getting

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
of results are these physicians getting

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.770 
of results are these physicians getting
one<00:01:27.430> of<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.580> first<00:01:27.790> markets<00:01:28.210> for<00:01:28.360> us<00:01:28.480> and<00:01:28.720> the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
one of the first markets for us and the

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.390 
one of the first markets for us and the
place<00:01:29.200> we're<00:01:29.380> applying<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:29.800> technology

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
place we're applying this technology

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.120 
place we're applying this technology
initially<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.300> for<00:01:31.800> reconstructing<00:01:32.800> breasts

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
initially is for reconstructing breasts

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.399 
initially is for reconstructing breasts
after<00:01:33.250> breast<00:01:33.610> cancer<00:01:34.000> so<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.659> predominant

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
after breast cancer so the predominant

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.020 
after breast cancer so the predominant
way<00:01:35.530> that<00:01:35.920> women<00:01:36.220> are<00:01:36.460> treated<00:01:36.640> now<00:01:36.880> with

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
way that women are treated now with

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.730 
way that women are treated now with
breast<00:01:37.270> cancer<00:01:37.360> is<00:01:37.840> what<00:01:38.080> they<00:01:38.170> call<00:01:38.290> partial

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
breast cancer is what they call partial

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.469 
breast cancer is what they call partial
mastectomy<00:01:38.920> so<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.640> instead<00:01:40.120> of<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.300> full

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
mastectomy so it instead of a full

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.060 
mastectomy so it instead of a full
mastectomy<00:01:40.870> where<00:01:41.320> they<00:01:41.470> remove<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.800> whole

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
mastectomy where they remove the whole

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.610 
mastectomy where they remove the whole
breast<00:01:42.310> they<00:01:43.000> only<00:01:43.180> remove<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:44.200> area<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.530> the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
breast they only remove the area of the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.770 
breast they only remove the area of the
tumor<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.070> some<00:01:45.220> margin<00:01:45.610> thereby<00:01:46.540> preserving

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
tumor and some margin thereby preserving

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.240 
tumor and some margin thereby preserving
as<00:01:47.260> much<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.620> native<00:01:47.860> tissue<00:01:48.040> as<00:01:48.220> possible

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
as much of the native tissue as possible

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.940 
as much of the native tissue as possible
so<00:01:49.030> these<00:01:49.479> women<00:01:49.870> although<00:01:50.110> cured<00:01:50.799> of<00:01:50.920> cancer

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
so these women although cured of cancer

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.130 
so these women although cured of cancer
which<00:01:51.400> is<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.610> primary<00:01:51.820> objective<00:01:52.479> go<00:01:52.960> home

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
which is the primary objective go home

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.620 
which is the primary objective go home
with<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.470> deformity<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:55.120> know<00:01:55.210> this

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
with this deformity that you know this

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.360 
with this deformity that you know this
doesn't<00:01:55.840> seem<00:01:56.080> legit<00:01:56.440> then<00:01:56.560> maybe<00:01:57.130> could<00:01:57.340> be

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
doesn't seem legit then maybe could be

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.160

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670

they look in the mirror they're reminded
of<00:02:02.650> having<00:02:02.920> cancer<00:02:03.310> think<00:02:03.909> about<00:02:04.060> what

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
of having cancer think about what

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.430 
of having cancer think about what

interesting area for us we've seen

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.280 
interesting area for us we've seen

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
radical prostatectomies often end up

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.110 
radical prostatectomies often end up
with<00:04:03.110> incontinence<00:04:03.500> but<00:04:04.190> it's<00:04:04.370> kind<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.000> an

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
with incontinence but it's kind of an

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.460 
with incontinence but it's kind of an
embarrassing<00:04:05.600> condition<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:06.170> it's<00:04:06.290> not

i<00:04:46.350> guess<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:47.070> know<00:04:47.160> is<00:04:47.250> there<00:04:47.370> anything<00:04:47.550> that

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
i guess you know is there anything that

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.190 
i guess you know is there anything that
we<00:04:47.820> haven't<00:04:48.000> covered<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.540> this<00:04:48.690> point<00:04:48.930> that

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
we haven't covered to this point that

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.330 
we haven't covered to this point that
you<00:04:49.260> think<00:04:49.440> it's<00:04:49.560> important<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.860> note<00:04:50.040> this

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
you think it's important to note this

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.490 
you think it's important to note this
time<00:04:50.580> i<00:04:50.790> think<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.360> know<00:04:51.690> as<00:04:52.350> we

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
time i think that you know as we

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.840 
time i think that you know as we
captured<00:04:52.890> earlier<00:04:52.950> i<00:04:53.220> mean<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.490> healthcare

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
captured earlier i mean that healthcare

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.980 
captured earlier i mean that healthcare
is<00:04:53.880> changing<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.450> i'm<00:04:54.540> not<00:04:54.630> talking<00:04:54.690> about

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
is changing and i'm not talking about

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.390 
is changing and i'm not talking about
the<00:04:55.230> obama<00:04:55.500> plan<00:04:55.740> i'm<00:04:56.010> talking<00:04:56.340> about

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
the obama plan i'm talking about

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.850 
the obama plan i'm talking about
regenerative<00:04:57.120> medicine<00:04:57.330> cell<00:04:58.290> therapy<00:04:58.740> is

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
regenerative medicine cell therapy is

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.890 
regenerative medicine cell therapy is
now<00:04:59.100> beginning<00:04:59.670> to<00:04:59.940> affect<00:05:00.120> patients<00:05:00.690> lives

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
now beginning to affect patients lives

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.170 
now beginning to affect patients lives
we're<00:05:01.620> leading<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.010> charge<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.550> i<00:05:02.850> think<00:05:03.060> as

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
we're leading the charge and i think as

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.000 
we're leading the charge and i think as
you<00:05:03.210> look<00:05:03.330> around<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.810> world<00:05:03.960> we<00:05:04.590> have<00:05:04.830> the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
you look around the world we have the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.360 
you look around the world we have the
real<00:05:05.900> practical<00:05:06.900> business<00:05:07.110> model<00:05:07.620> using<00:05:08.280> the

real practical business model using the

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.500 
real practical business model using the
patient's<00:05:08.730> own<00:05:08.820> tissue<00:05:09.030> so<00:05:09.210> you're<00:05:09.390> not

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
patient's own tissue so you're not

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.700
