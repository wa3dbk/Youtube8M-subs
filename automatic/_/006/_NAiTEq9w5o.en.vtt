00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
little quicker than my greenhouse

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.600

just<00:00:51.820> fine<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:53.140> grow<00:00:53.350> bed<00:00:53.620> drains<00:00:54.010> through

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
just fine the grow bed drains through

just fine the grow bed drains through
this<00:00:54.489> trap<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.180> then<00:00:55.420> down<00:00:55.750> into<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.410> fish

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589

this trap and then down into the fish
tank<00:00:56.860> I<00:00:59.370> didn't<00:01:00.370> feel<00:01:00.489> like<00:01:00.610> drilling<00:01:01.059> an

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239

overflow hole through the side of my

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.070 
overflow hole through the side of my
tank<00:01:03.579> so<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:03.879> built<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.479> water<00:01:04.809> bridge

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
tank so I built this water bridge

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.460 
tank so I built this water bridge
instead<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.940> bridge<00:01:07.180> siphons<00:01:07.720> over<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.259> top

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
instead the bridge siphons over the top

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.609 
instead the bridge siphons over the top
of<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.680> tank<00:01:08.920> into<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.549> cup<00:01:10.000> which<00:01:10.899> then<00:01:11.259> has

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
of the tank into this cup which then has

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.830 
of the tank into this cup which then has
a<00:01:11.649> stand<00:01:12.399> pipe<00:01:12.640> in<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.240> set<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.659> water

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
a stand pipe in it to set the water

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.310 
a stand pipe in it to set the water
level<00:01:14.229> in<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.470> tank<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.700> then<00:01:16.030> flows<00:01:16.570> down

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
level in the tank it then flows down

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.419 
level in the tank it then flows down
into<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.880> sump<00:01:19.750> tank<00:01:20.020> underneath<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:21.250> fish

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
into the sump tank underneath the fish

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.320 
into the sump tank underneath the fish
tank

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.510 

this<00:01:24.870> is<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.050> close-up<00:01:25.620> of<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> overflow<00:01:26.370> in

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
this is a close-up of the overflow in

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.580 
this is a close-up of the overflow in
action<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.270> small<00:01:27.780> tube<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.320> comes

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
action there is a small tube that comes

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.920 
action there is a small tube that comes
out<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.980> top<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.850> main<00:01:30.030> siphon<00:01:30.690> which

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
out of the top of the main siphon which

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.590 
out of the top of the main siphon which
then<00:01:31.170> goes<00:01:31.470> into<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.980> overflow<00:01:32.280> pipe<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
then goes into the overflow pipe this is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.540 
then goes into the overflow pipe this is
used<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.050> sucking<00:01:34.410> air<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> overflow

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
used for sucking air out of the overflow

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.120 
used for sucking air out of the overflow
so<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.060> wasn't<00:01:36.330> available<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.740> overflow

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
so it wasn't available the overflow

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.670 
so it wasn't available the overflow
drains<00:01:38.460> back<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> sump<00:01:39.480> I<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
drains back into the sump I have it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.410 
drains back into the sump I have it

I<00:01:48.960> installed<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.530> pair<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> aluminum<00:01:50.280> cross

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
I installed a pair of aluminum cross

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.790 
I installed a pair of aluminum cross
