and see if we can find out if there's

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.230 
and see if we can find out if there's
any<00:00:12.719> performance<00:00:13.230> improvements<00:00:13.849> in<00:00:14.849> front<00:00:15.179> of

8 pretty handedly this is actually what
I<00:01:19.140> experienced<00:01:19.649> in<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> couple<00:01:20.100> different

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I experienced in a couple different

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.330 
I experienced in a couple different
tests<00:01:20.969> here<00:01:21.619> this<00:01:22.619> wasn't<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> first<00:01:23.039> time

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
tests here this wasn't the first time

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010 
tests here this wasn't the first time
I've<00:01:23.460> run<00:01:23.640> these<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> every<00:01:24.600> single<00:01:24.869> time

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I've run these and every single time

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.350 
I've run these and every single time
windows<00:01:25.319> phone<00:01:25.500> 8.1<00:01:26.119> bested<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> other

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
windows phone 8.1 bested the other

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.949 
windows phone 8.1 bested the other
device<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.039> try<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> simple<00:01:30.030> shut<00:01:30.689> down

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
device and we can try a simple shut down

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:47.580 
device and we can try a simple shut down
here

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.260 

and<00:01:47.950> as<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.609> can<00:01:48.729> see<00:01:48.759> they're<00:01:48.969> actually

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
and as you can see they're actually

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.080 
and as you can see they're actually
windows<00:01:49.539> phone<00:01:49.840> 8<00:01:50.109> did<00:01:51.039> shut<00:01:51.310> down<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.909> a

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
windows phone 8 did shut down just a

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.380 
windows phone 8 did shut down just a
little<00:01:52.359> bit<00:01:52.479> quicker<00:01:52.780> than<00:01:53.109> windows<00:01:53.409> from<00:01:53.590> 8.1

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
little bit quicker than windows from 8.1

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.359 
little bit quicker than windows from 8.1
and<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.570> saw<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.319> again<00:01:56.439> over<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.039> couple

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
and I saw it again over a couple

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.359 
and I saw it again over a couple
different<00:01:57.490> instances<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.679> testing<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.859> speed

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
different instances of testing the speed

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.050 
different instances of testing the speed
of<00:02:00.520> both<00:02:00.670> devices<00:02:02.429> alright<00:02:03.429> let's<00:02:03.670> get<00:02:03.819> these

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
of both devices alright let's get these

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.690 
of both devices alright let's get these
phones<00:02:04.899> booted<00:02:05.829> back<00:02:06.219> up<00:02:06.549> here<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.429> as<00:02:09.580> you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
phones booted back up here and as you

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.699 
phones booted back up here and as you
can<00:02:09.849> see<00:02:09.879> from<00:02:10.269> some<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.989> benchmarks<00:02:11.560> in

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
can see from some of the benchmarks in

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.199 
can see from some of the benchmarks in
the<00:02:12.010> post<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.989> devices<00:02:14.470> come<00:02:14.769> back<00:02:15.209> during

the post the devices come back during
application<00:02:16.480> use<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:18.099> synthetic

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549

benchmarking<00:02:19.410> pretty<00:02:20.410> close<00:02:20.739> there's<00:02:21.099> not

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
benchmarking pretty close there's not

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.470 
benchmarking pretty close there's not
it's<00:02:21.970> not<00:02:22.090> really<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.420> big<00:02:22.480> difference<00:02:23.110> it's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
it's not really a big difference it's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.550 
it's not really a big difference it's
it's<00:02:25.480> arguable<00:02:26.019> whether<00:02:26.079> or<00:02:26.349> not<00:02:26.410> you're

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
it's arguable whether or not you're

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.870 
it's arguable whether or not you're
going<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.739> see<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> huge<00:02:27.130> improvement<00:02:27.220> if<00:02:27.730> you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
going to see a huge improvement if you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.039 
going to see a huge improvement if you
feel<00:02:28.180> like<00:02:28.390> you're<00:02:28.540> seeing<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.870> large

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
feel like you're seeing a large

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
improvement over your previous install

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.430 
improvement over your previous install
it<00:02:31.569> could<00:02:31.750> be<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.870> couple<00:02:32.110> different<00:02:32.260> reasons

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
it could be a couple different reasons

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.740 
it could be a couple different reasons
one<00:02:32.860> if<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.099> did<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> clean<00:02:33.459> install<00:02:33.750> I'm

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
one if you did a clean install I'm

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.210 
one if you did a clean install I'm
you're<00:02:34.989> just<00:02:35.140> getting<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.410> new<00:02:35.590> fresh<00:02:35.950> OS

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
you're just getting that new fresh OS

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.300 
you're just getting that new fresh OS

going to be some and you can see that in

so<00:02:52.959> we<00:02:53.049> can<00:02:53.200> do<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.380> couple<00:02:53.920> just<00:02:54.400> other<00:02:54.579> quick

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
so we can do a couple just other quick

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.280 
so we can do a couple just other quick
tests<00:02:55.269> here<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:55.660> can<00:02:55.840> open<00:02:56.079> Internet<00:02:56.709> Explorer

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
tests here we can open Internet Explorer

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.900 
tests here we can open Internet Explorer
and<00:02:59.290> these<00:02:59.590> are<00:02:59.739> both<00:02:59.859> running<00:03:00.069> on<00:03:00.370> verizon

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
and these are both running on verizon

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.720 
and these are both running on verizon
LTE<00:03:01.060> they're<00:03:01.540> not<00:03:01.720> using<00:03:02.040> my<00:03:03.040> Wi-Fi<00:03:03.430> network

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
LTE they're not using my Wi-Fi network

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
LTE they're not using my Wi-Fi network
and<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:05.799> see<00:03:06.389> windows<00:03:07.389> phone<00:03:07.569> 8

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
and as you can see windows phone 8

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.150 
and as you can see windows phone 8
device<00:03:08.079> is<00:03:08.349> actually<00:03:08.470> taking<00:03:08.799> quite<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.010> bit

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
device is actually taking quite a bit

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:18.000 
device is actually taking quite a bit
longer<00:03:09.370> here<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.680> just<00:03:16.440> find<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.680> comparable

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
longer here so just find a comparable

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.120 
longer here so just find a comparable
story<00:03:18.700> here

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
story here

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.880 
story here
and<00:03:21.090> here<00:03:21.930> side<00:03:22.170> by<00:03:22.200> side<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.770> actually

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
and here side by side you can actually

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.680 
and here side by side you can actually
see<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.250> differences<00:03:23.670> between<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.660> two

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
see the differences between the two

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.130 
see the differences between the two
installs<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:26.450> ie11<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.440> we<00:03:28.680> can<00:03:28.830> just<00:03:29.010> tap<00:03:29.250> on

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
installs of ie11 so we can just tap on

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.110 
installs of ie11 so we can just tap on
like<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.620> see<00:03:31.950> which<00:03:32.100> one<00:03:32.310> loads<00:03:32.640> faster

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
like that and see which one loads faster

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.840 
like that and see which one loads faster
and<00:03:33.330> as<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.440> can<00:03:34.560> see<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.130> windows<00:03:35.820> phone

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
and as you can see it's a windows phone

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.450 
and as you can see it's a windows phone
8<00:03:36.120> popped<00:03:36.510> up<00:03:36.630> just<00:03:36.960> a<00:03:37.080> smidge<00:03:37.350> quicker<00:03:37.680> but

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
8 popped up just a smidge quicker but

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.100 
8 popped up just a smidge quicker but
really<00:03:38.700> again<00:03:38.820> no<00:03:39.390> differences<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.960> could

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
really again no differences you could

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.890 
really again no differences you could
probably<00:03:40.260> bring<00:03:40.950> that<00:03:41.160> back<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:42.600> network

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
probably bring that back to just network

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.600 
probably bring that back to just network
connectivity<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.740> all<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.370> other<00:03:44.520> good

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
connectivity and all that other good

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.700 
connectivity and all that other good
stuff<00:03:44.760> everything<00:03:45.690> else<00:03:45.840> though<00:03:46.050> it's<00:03:46.290> pretty

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
stuff everything else though it's pretty

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.040 
stuff everything else though it's pretty
much<00:03:46.890> in<00:03:47.040> line<00:03:47.070> with<00:03:47.510> your<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.900> know<00:03:49.020> your

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
much in line with your you know your

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.370 
much in line with your you know your
expectations<00:03:50.960> not<00:03:51.960> a<00:03:51.990> whole<00:03:52.200> lot<00:03:52.320> of

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
expectations not a whole lot of

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.200 
expectations not a whole lot of
difference<00:03:52.530> here<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.220> that's<00:03:53.970> what<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
difference here and that's what the

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.880 
difference here and that's what the
benchmarks<00:03:54.630> show<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.320> that's<00:03:55.620> what<00:03:55.770> we're

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
benchmarks show and that's what we're

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.710 
benchmarks show and that's what we're
experiencing<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.460> that<00:03:56.640> other<00:03:56.790> than<00:03:57.060> startup

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
experiencing is that other than startup

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.810 
experiencing is that other than startup
and<00:03:57.960> Windows<00:03:58.680> Phone<00:03:58.860> 8<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.130> pretty<00:03:59.400> much<00:03:59.550> on

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
and Windows Phone 8 is pretty much on

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.810 
and Windows Phone 8 is pretty much on
par<00:03:59.850> with<00:04:00.240> Windows<00:04:01.020> Phone<00:04:01.290> 8<00:04:01.470> which<00:04:02.460> is<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.610> good

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
par with Windows Phone 8 which is a good

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.970 
par with Windows Phone 8 which is a good
thing<00:04:02.880> if<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.810> were<00:04:03.840> thinking<00:04:04.410> wow<00:04:04.530> maybe<00:04:04.860> I

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
thing if you were thinking wow maybe I

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.400 
thing if you were thinking wow maybe I
should<00:04:05.220> see<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.460> big<00:04:05.790> improvement<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:07.140> need<00:04:07.290> to

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
should see a big improvement you need to

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.780 
should see a big improvement you need to
keep<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.740> mind<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.070> Windows<00:04:08.400> Phone<00:04:08.580> 8.1

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
keep in mind that Windows Phone 8.1

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.580 
keep in mind that Windows Phone 8.1
comes<00:04:09.330> with<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.540> lot<00:04:09.750> more<00:04:09.780> features<00:04:10.350> as<00:04:10.500> you

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
comes with a lot more features as you

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.260 
comes with a lot more features as you
can<00:04:10.680> see<00:04:10.800> Cortana<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.430> backgrounds<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.000> lot<00:04:12.180> of

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
can see Cortana the backgrounds a lot of

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.690 
can see Cortana the backgrounds a lot of
other<00:04:12.420> stuff<00:04:12.480> under<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.020> hood<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.550> so<00:04:14.550> what

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
other stuff under the hood and so what

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.430 
other stuff under the hood and so what
you're<00:04:14.850> getting<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.360> this<00:04:15.750> exact<00:04:16.230> same

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
you're getting is this exact same

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.110 
you're getting is this exact same
performance<00:04:16.830> experience<00:04:17.250> or<00:04:17.640> even<00:04:17.880> slightly

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
performance experience or even slightly

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.030 
performance experience or even slightly
better<00:04:18.390> in<00:04:18.570> some<00:04:18.780> cases<00:04:19.020> with<00:04:19.530> more<00:04:19.770> features

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
better in some cases with more features

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.830 
better in some cases with more features
which<00:04:20.790> means<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.060> Microsoft<00:04:21.570> has<00:04:21.630> done

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
which means that Microsoft has done

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.020 
which means that Microsoft has done
again<00:04:22.170> a<00:04:22.380> good<00:04:22.590> job<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:22.890> optimizing<00:04:23.190> the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
again a good job of optimizing the

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.150 
again a good job of optimizing the
hardware<00:04:24.420> and<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.660> software<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:25.890> you

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
hardware and the software so that you

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.040 
hardware and the software so that you
can<00:04:26.310> add<00:04:26.520> more<00:04:26.760> features<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.570> platform

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
can add more features to the platform

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.360 
can add more features to the platform
but<00:04:28.440> you're<00:04:28.560> not<00:04:28.710> going<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:28.920> degrade<00:04:29.250> the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
but you're not going to degrade the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.390 
but you're not going to degrade the
experience<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.180> here<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:30.990> go<00:04:31.160> that's<00:04:32.160> what<00:04:32.280> we

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
experience so here you go that's what we

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.390 
experience so here you go that's what we
got<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.850> thanks<00:04:33.240> for<00:04:33.360> watching
