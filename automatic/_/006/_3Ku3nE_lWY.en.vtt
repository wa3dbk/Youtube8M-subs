00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.269
 Haisai Higa It is sea Sir voice has taken on a different take 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.519
 Today I will introduce you the skateboard I always use 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.839
 After all, the width is big that width in comparison with the state aircraft carrier feature You know of other Is this curve stick 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.140
 With big things 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.180
 Closer to surfing stance because stance width is larger 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.070
 You can be the practice of surfing in a loud voice 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:32.380
 The curve stick can not turn unless you put weight on it with speed . 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:37.270
 It is a normal skateboard and for example I increase or of the move the tail 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:41.830
 A carver or sector 9 skateboard is a track with an ankle 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:47.140
 I think you have Recha teeth without too much weight shift since it is possible to move 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:50.380
 But this curve stick will not bend at all without that speed and weight shift 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.370
 You can practice basic turns 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.020
 That's why I hit people from the bottom 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.590
 It is a place that is difficult to cares I'm a woman of another recommended point 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:05.720
 Because my body is stable at the time of the monks 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.500
 It is unreasonable posture can be such fun Even if you skateboard graduates or rather desired 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.100
 Recommended It is the most 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.900
 is not it 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.070
 Well then because it came out a little 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.150
 Here it is: When the Intermediate surfers ride 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.480
 If you understand 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.480
 Is it okay 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.130
 Hmm 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.500
 I am 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.500
 e 4 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.730
 th 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.510
 there were 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.510
 Four days 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.430
 of 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 Hmm 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.630
 Hmm 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.130
