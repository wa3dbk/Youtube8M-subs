along here but I want to show you a
little<00:03:09.500> artifact<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.830> might<00:03:11.690> not<00:03:12.690> even

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
little artifact that you might not even

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.030 
little artifact that you might not even
notice<00:03:13.290> or<00:03:13.740> dismiss<00:03:14.280> if<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.670> came<00:03:14.850> across<00:03:15.000> it

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
notice or dismiss if you came across it

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.010

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
but what we have here is actually a core

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.710 
but what we have here is actually a core
and<00:03:22.670> what<00:03:23.670> they<00:03:23.850> would<00:03:24.030> have<00:03:24.060> been<00:03:24.240> doing<00:03:24.570> with

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
and what they would have been doing with

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.870 
and what they would have been doing with
this<00:03:24.840> piece<00:03:25.080> right<00:03:25.200> here<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:26.100> see<00:03:26.280> how<00:03:26.460> how

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
this piece right here you see how how

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.270 
this piece right here you see how how
straight<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.540> on<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.650> side<00:03:28.710> and<00:03:29.160> this

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
straight it is on that side and this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.060 
straight it is on that side and this
side<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.580> there<00:03:29.880> actually<00:03:30.360> we're<00:03:31.070> knocking

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
side is there actually we're knocking

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.199 
side is there actually we're knocking
big<00:03:32.910> flakes<00:03:33.270> off<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.770> nap<00:03:35.010> into<00:03:35.280> n<00:03:35.910> 2

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
big flakes off of this to nap into n 2

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.410 
big flakes off of this to nap into n 2
points<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.290> that's<00:03:37.680> that's<00:03:38.610> an<00:03:38.880> artifact<00:03:39.270> in

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
points so that's that's an artifact in

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.180 
points so that's that's an artifact in
itself<00:03:39.720> like<00:03:40.020> I<00:03:40.050> said<00:03:40.350> if<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.950> didn't<00:03:41.130> know

know<00:04:13.320> sometimes<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:14.160> go<00:04:14.550> out<00:04:14.700> with<00:04:14.880> one<00:04:14.910> plan

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
know sometimes you go out with one plan

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.659 
know sometimes you go out with one plan
it<00:04:15.510> ended<00:04:15.690> up<00:04:15.750> doing<00:04:16.020> something<00:04:16.260> else<00:04:16.669> but

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
it ended up doing something else but

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.750 
it ended up doing something else but
certainly<00:04:18.150> we<00:04:18.299> had<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.510> take<00:04:18.690> advantage<00:04:19.169> of

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
certainly we had to take advantage of

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.000 
certainly we had to take advantage of
the<00:04:20.760> artifact<00:04:21.299> evidence<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.320> we<00:04:22.530> came
