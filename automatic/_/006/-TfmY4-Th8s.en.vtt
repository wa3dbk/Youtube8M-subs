we<00:01:43.730> go<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.060> select<00:01:44.540> all<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.230> these<00:01:45.980> are<00:01:46.130> videos

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.010 
we go to select all and these are videos
right<00:01:46.670> now<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.030> they<00:01:47.150> will<00:01:47.270> take<00:01:47.480> some<00:01:47.510> time<00:01:47.900> to

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
right now so they will take some time to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.800 
right now so they will take some time to
download<00:01:48.140> I'm<00:01:48.710> going<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:48.980> click<00:01:49.250> on<00:01:49.460> download
