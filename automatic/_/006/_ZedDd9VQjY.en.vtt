it goes like this it only involves four

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.420 
it goes like this it only involves four
notes<00:00:15.740> initially<00:00:16.740> that's<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> initial

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
notes initially that's the initial

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.640 
notes initially that's the initial
sequence<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.970> going<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.240> four<00:00:18.480> notes<00:00:18.720> four

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
different notes okay so we're going to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890 
different notes okay so we're going to
start<00:00:22.830> out<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:22.980> our<00:00:23.189> first<00:00:23.490> finger<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.600> D

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
start out with our first finger on the D

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.590 
start out with our first finger on the D
string<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.550> twelfth<00:00:26.849> fret

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.290 

on<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.760> 15th<00:00:35.760> fret<00:00:36.060> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:37.260> B<00:00:37.350> string<00:00:38.300> and

on to the 15th fret of the B string and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.520 
on to the 15th fret of the B string and
then<00:00:39.480> we're<00:00:39.660> gonna<00:00:39.780> catch<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:42.239> 12th<00:00:43.140> fret<00:00:43.290> on

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
then we're gonna catch the 12th fret on

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.229 
then we're gonna catch the 12th fret on
the<00:00:43.590> high<00:00:43.800> E<00:00:43.830> string<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:44.670> our<00:00:44.790> first<00:00:45.030> finger

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
haha ok so I'm going to take that idea

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.800 
haha ok so I'm going to take that idea
i'm<00:02:36.640> going<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.850> speed<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.090> up<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.420> little<00:02:37.570> bit

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
i'm going to speed it up a little bit

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.480 
i'm going to speed it up a little bit
and<00:02:37.990> i'll<00:02:38.230> move<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.530> around<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> different

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
and i'll move it around in the different

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.300 
and i'll move it around in the different
pentatonic<00:02:40.350> positions<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.890> can<00:02:42.100> get<00:02:42.190> an

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
pentatonic positions so you can get an

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.780 
pentatonic positions so you can get an
idea<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.930> what<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.020> can<00:02:44.050> do<00:02:44.320> with<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:45.400> how

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
idea of what you can do with it and how

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.970 
idea of what you can do with it and how
you<00:02:45.850> can<00:02:46.030> move<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.270> around<00:02:46.470> ok<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.860> go

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
you can move it around ok you go

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.370 
you can move it around ok you go
something<00:02:48.220> like<00:02:48.250> this
