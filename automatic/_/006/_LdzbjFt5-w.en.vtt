00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.600
 adsense i think scientists should 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.760
 pay closer attention there a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.160
 that's how water interacts with 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440
 Mike molecules sometimes boom on 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.150
 molecular level it creates 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.630
 dna helix structure there would be no water 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.180
 there would be no spiral it creates 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 protein structure without water and this 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.289
 the structure would not work but only in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.100
 water begins its life any 7 and 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.010
 any embryo amniotic fluid 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.620
 participate in its development and in its 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.300
 preservation 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.969
 it is the surrounding water like 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.820
 universal computer 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.039
 reveals any biological program 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.610
 but it can change it 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.610
 only water 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:01.579
 There is something about what they say see here 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:06.189
 it is new but it was already in the centuries past 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.189
 before us once wrote ecclesiastes 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.920
 and the Jacob took for himself fresh twigs of white 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.440
 Poplar almond and chestnut and cuts on 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.100
 them white stripes exposing whiteness that 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.850
 opposite 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.630
 and put brute that cut into drains at 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.720
 watering places where sheep come to drink and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.660
 heated options and conceived there 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:36.070
 striped sheep and box did not give birth 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:39.660
 variegated we impacted water over 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:44.250
 weak pulsed magnetic fields 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.590
 these are fields which are tens of thousands of times 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.000
 weaker than natural magnetic field 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:56.710
 land meaning they are negligible with a point 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.170
 view of modern science into water 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.090
 processed in this way placed the fish 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.550
 who soon had an unusual 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.640
 brood of fry similar to each other 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.960
 like twins but dramatically 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.960
 different from their other relatives 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:21.350
 gray stripes appear 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:26.140
 on the abdomen of all males immediately appears 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.320
 color spots of which never before 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.550
 was observed 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:38.500
 this is called phenotypic change 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:42.400
 and it is crucial that these changes 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.700
 some representatives do not appear 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.530
 treated fish all at once in 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.720
 the result of the experiment has changed not 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.610
 only the appearance of the fish but their 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.110
 behavior 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.460
 they began to react equally to 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.250
 external stimuli 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.980
 it was like the whole pack appeared 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.500
 collective intelligence is so serious 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.100
 the problem domain is completely unexplored. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.300
 began to rise 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:18.290
 so we decided that that's enough 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:24.650
 fixing the very fact of possibility 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:28.130
 change the behavior and forms of animals 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.800
 using only water by itself this 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.190
 fact is serious 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.480
 if water is affected so much then yes 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.480
 full study and cannot be omitted on 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.480
 people
