00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:11.014
 Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it? 

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:13.661
 Today digital cameras do a lot for us 

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:16.398
 But there is no alternative to the human eye 

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:17.413
 It is important to study 

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:19.965
 How cameras work with light to form an image 

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:21.669
 That way we'll know what's going on 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.836
 When the time comes to pick up a moment. 

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:25.256
 There are three variables 

00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:27.462
 Determine whether you get the correct amount of light 

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.216
 To display correctly. 

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:30.342
 By hand camera, 

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:33.521
 We can change any of these variables ourselves. 

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.633
 Different settings will produce really different images. 

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:39.592
 Let's see the way together. 

00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:41.217
 First, you see this here? 

00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:42.944
 This is the aperture. 

00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:45.259
 It is the hole through which light passes. 

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:46.721
 If you make the aperture larger, 

00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:48.444
 You will get more light, true, 

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:50.358
 But the clarity of the picture will decrease 

00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:52.351
 Very quickly for your focus, 

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.701
 Progress and return. 

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.451
 This is what we call deep shallow field. 

00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:58.215
 If our slot is too small, 

00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:01.294
 We will have less light and deeper field depth. 

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.745
 For personal images, it may be good to have a sharp-edged shape 

00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:05.989
 Separate from a somewhat blurry background 

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:08.494
 So I suggest that the hole be large. 

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:10.720
 The aperture is measured by the number of stops (f-stops) 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.280
 This may cause some confusion 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.617
 Because low values ​​mean larger slots 

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:17.735
 Larger values ​​mean smaller slots. 

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:20.505
 After that, you should think about shutter speed. 

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:21.923
 The shutter performs the role of the curtain 

00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:23.386
 Which covers the sensor, 

00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:26.529
 It opens only when you release the shutter button. 

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:27.856
 If we are lighting less, 

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:30.016
 We open the shutter for a shorter period. 

00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:31.226
 If we want more lighting, 

00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:32.819
 We open it for longer, 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.197
 But we run the risk of getting 

00:01:34.197 --> 00:01:36.149
 Unmodified image. 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.863
 Speed ​​is measured in seconds 

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:40.415
 And fractions of seconds. 

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:43.319
 For shooting sports or anything that has a lot of movement, 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.118
 We will need higher speeds. 

00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:46.863
 To shoot wonderful night scenes, 

00:01:46.863 --> 00:01:48.739
 Big exposure will be better, 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.492
 But we will need tri-lists to install the snapshot 

00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:52.591
 Preventing movement blurry. 

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.952
 Another wonderful thing we can do with exposure to light 

00:01:54.952 --> 00:01:56.366
 Are drawing by light, 

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.667
 Drawing in the dark with a flame 

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.630
 Or light cell phone. 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.302
 Finally, the ISO sensitivity controls 

00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:04.864
 Sensitivity of light sensor. 

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:06.386
 If we use low sensitivity, 

00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:09.027
 We'll need more light to record a sound. 

00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:10.179
 With higher sensitivity, 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.452
 You will be able to get a picture 

00:02:11.452 --> 00:02:13.527
 With less light available. 

00:02:13.527 --> 00:02:16.184
 ISO 100 is low sensitivity, 

00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:19.355
 While the ISO 6400 is high. 

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.191
 If we grow allergic, 

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:22.835
 We will be able to use speeds 

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:24.202
 Smaller openings, 

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:26.698
 But we will get turbulent images 

00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:28.112
 It is good that we have a scale to know 

00:02:28.112 --> 00:02:29.990
 Whether we get the right amount of light 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.257
 For good exposure, 

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:32.865
 Lighting Scale. 

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:34.079
 Does this look good for you? 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.246
 Now is the time to come out 

00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:36.588
 And training on taking pictures 

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:38.350
 In different circumstances, 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.117
 And you know what you do 

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.994
 Anytime you want to take a better picture.
