fillings for you to sew a love triangle

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.240 
fillings for you to sew a love triangle
is<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> way<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.350> wonder<00:00:52.710> how<00:00:52.829> exactly

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
is on the way so I wonder how exactly

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
is on the way so I wonder how exactly
kill<00:00:53.520> Ani<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> guess<00:00:54.539> take<00:00:54.870> this

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
kill Ani is going to I guess take this

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.569 
kill Ani is going to I guess take this
path<00:00:55.260> whether<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.829> love<00:00:55.980> triangle<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
path whether you love triangle that is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
path whether you love triangle that is
most<00:00:56.789> likely<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> form<00:00:57.629> now<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.140> even

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
most likely going to form now so even

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.439 
most likely going to form now so even
though<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.829> now<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.460> Sofia<00:01:00.059> finally

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
though we now know that Sofia finally

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.849 
though we now know that Sofia finally
has<00:01:00.539> logged<00:01:00.780> back<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> too<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:01.829> can

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
it was handled properly the actual I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.200 
it was handled properly the actual I
guess<00:01:08.010> spark<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.490> love<00:01:08.640> coming<00:01:08.939> back<00:01:09.060> into

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
guess spark of love coming back into

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.390

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
feeling feelings for him again because

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.200 
feeling feelings for him again because
she<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.409> helping<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:13.950> Rica<00:01:14.400> remembering

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
she was helping out Rica remembering

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.850 
she was helping out Rica remembering
memories<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.720> how<00:01:15.960> she<00:01:16.020> felt<00:01:16.439> about<00:01:16.530> you

what<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.719> entire<00:02:04.049> series<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.530> about<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.070> think

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
what this entire series is about I think

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.889 
what this entire series is about I think
Rica<00:02:05.789> should<00:02:05.969> really<00:02:06.210> develop<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.750> this

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
Rica should really develop out of this

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.389 
Rica should really develop out of this
syndrome<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.469> actually<00:02:07.920> grow<00:02:08.160> as<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
syndrome and actually grow as a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.619 
syndrome and actually grow as a
character<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.940> that's<00:02:09.090> where<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:09.450> should

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
character and that's where they should

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.240 
character and that's where they should
end<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.899> series<00:02:10.200> because<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.220> exactly

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
end this series because that is exactly

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.729 
end this series because that is exactly
how<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.209> would<00:02:12.420> actually<00:02:12.810> love<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.379> ending<00:02:13.620> of

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
how I would actually love the ending of

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.350 
how I would actually love the ending of
this<00:02:13.830> series<00:02:14.040> getting<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.760> see<00:02:14.940> Marika

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.750 
thing this episode didn't feel exactly
like<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.079> filler<00:02:49.349> episode<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.579> quite

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
like a filler episode and this is quite

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.190 
like a filler episode and this is quite
one<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.000> best<00:02:51.180> plot<00:02:51.450> based<00:02:51.720> episodes

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
one of the best plot based episodes

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.259 
one of the best plot based episodes
we've<00:02:52.410> had<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.799> quite<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> couple<00:02:53.340> episodes<00:02:53.730> so

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
we've had and quite a couple episodes so

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.780 
we've had and quite a couple episodes so
honestly<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.220> episode<00:02:56.459> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
honestly do I like this episode of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.690 
honestly do I like this episode of
shooting<00:02:57.209> season<00:02:57.390> 2<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:58.170> i<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.560> really<00:02:58.920> do<00:02:59.340> i

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
shooting season 2 I do i I really do i

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.940 
shooting season 2 I do i I really do i
make<00:03:00.269> be<00:03:00.690> kind<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.049> upset<00:03:01.410> with<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.709> actual

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
make be kind of upset with the actual

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.559 
make be kind of upset with the actual
love<00:03:02.160> triangle<00:03:02.610> finally<00:03:02.940> starting<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.269> form

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
love triangle finally starting to form

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.000 
love triangle finally starting to form
but<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.019> guess<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:04.410> something<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.799> be

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
but I guess that's something to be

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.380 
but I guess that's something to be
expected<00:03:05.250> when<00:03:05.670> they<00:03:05.790> try<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> actually

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
expected when they try to actually

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.390 
expected when they try to actually
probably<00:03:06.810> focus<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.470> Sofia<00:03:07.829> earlier<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.370> and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
probably focus on Sofia earlier on and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.460 
probably focus on Sofia earlier on and
this<00:03:08.700> season<00:03:09.150> 2<00:03:09.299> acuity<00:03:09.660> since<00:03:10.170> she<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.380> going

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
this season 2 acuity since she is going

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.160 
this season 2 acuity since she is going
to<00:03:10.530> be<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> love<00:03:11.310> rival<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:12.030> Rica<00:03:12.389> so<00:03:12.900> I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
to be like a love rival to Rica so I

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.449 
to be like a love rival to Rica so I
feel<00:03:13.410> like<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> good<00:03:13.829> idea<00:03:13.950> but<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> same

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
feel like it's a good idea but the same

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.860 
feel like it's a good idea but the same
time<00:03:14.609> it's<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.790> bad<00:03:14.970> idea<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:15.600> really

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
time it's a bad idea it just really

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.809 
time it's a bad idea it just really
depends<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.560> way<00:03:16.709> they<00:03:16.889> decide<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.400> take

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
depends on the way they decide to take

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.059 
depends on the way they decide to take
it<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.269> way<00:03:18.720> how<00:03:18.959> sophia<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.410> most<00:03:19.470> likely

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
it in the way how sophia is most likely

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.620 
it in the way how sophia is most likely
going<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.430> interrupt<00:03:20.700> Rica<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.359> just<00:03:21.540> a
