to<00:01:32.850> play<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> game<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.439> reason<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to play the game so that's the reason I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.810

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.649 

well<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:45.280> more<00:01:45.490> about<00:01:45.609> discipline<00:01:46.450> as

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
well I think more about discipline as

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.660 
well I think more about discipline as
far<00:01:46.899> as<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> shots<00:01:47.469> I<00:01:47.740> mean<00:01:47.920> we<00:01:48.039> had<00:01:48.130> 10<00:01:48.399> power

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
far as the shots I mean we had 10 power

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.219 
far as the shots I mean we had 10 power
plays<00:01:48.909> against<00:01:49.360> this<00:01:49.450> so<00:01:49.659> he's<00:01:49.780> gonna<00:01:49.899> give<00:01:50.110> up

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
plays against this so he's gonna give up

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.130 
plays against this so he's gonna give up
a<00:01:50.350> lot<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.560> shots<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:52.329> want<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:52.659> make<00:01:52.810> sure<00:01:52.840> we

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
a lot of shots we want to make sure we

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.469 
a lot of shots we want to make sure we
were<00:01:53.200> smarter<00:01:53.679> defensively<00:01:54.280> as<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.490> team<00:01:54.789> by

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
were smarter defensively as a team by

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.870 
were smarter defensively as a team by
bleeding<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:55.899> lot<00:01:56.289> more<00:01:56.500> discipline<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:57.490> that's

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
bleeding a lot more discipline so that's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.230
