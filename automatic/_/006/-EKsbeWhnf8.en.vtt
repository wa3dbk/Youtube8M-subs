even human at all I put on my face and
it<00:03:34.489> just<00:03:34.669> it<00:03:34.879> felt<00:03:35.299> like<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.629> was<00:03:35.750> seriously

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
it just it felt like it was seriously

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.020 
it just it felt like it was seriously
like<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.650> mask<00:03:36.889> on<00:03:37.069> my<00:03:37.190> face<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.730> then<00:03:37.879> when<00:03:38.000> I

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
like a mask on my face and then when I

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.030 
like a mask on my face and then when I
wore<00:03:38.389> it<00:03:38.419> out<00:03:38.629> it<00:03:38.959> just<00:03:39.290> completely<00:03:39.680> went<00:03:39.889> away
