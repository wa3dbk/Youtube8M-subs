there but very cool looking very kinda
makes<00:04:12.690> me<00:04:12.810> understand<00:04:13.320> why<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:14.250> collector's

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
makes me understand why the collector's

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.009 
makes me understand why the collector's
edition<00:04:15.030> was<00:04:15.120> one<00:04:15.209> hundred<00:04:15.450> fifty<00:04:15.540> dollars

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
edition was one hundred fifty dollars

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.810 
edition was one hundred fifty dollars
because<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.380> lot<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.590> time<00:04:16.859> these<00:04:17.040> figurines<00:04:17.400> go

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
because a lot of time these figurines go

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.030 
because a lot of time these figurines go
450<00:04:18.780> +<00:04:18.930> dollars<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.680> gotta<00:04:19.830> figure

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
450 + dollars so you gotta figure

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.560 
450 + dollars so you gotta figure
getting<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.459> game<00:04:20.640> for<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:20.940> normal<00:04:21.239> 50

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
peripherals that razor over a hundred

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.710

dollars save ten box overall I think the

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.180 
dollars save ten box overall I think the
collectors<00:05:17.870> edition<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.350> performance<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:19.010> it

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
collectors edition the performance of it

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.650 
collectors edition the performance of it
or<00:05:19.400> not<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:19.880> performance<00:05:20.270> but<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.450> overall

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
or not the performance but the overall

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.480 
or not the performance but the overall
look<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.050> feel<00:05:21.140> it's<00:05:21.830> really<00:05:21.980> cool<00:05:22.250> I<00:05:22.310> think

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
look and feel it's really cool I think

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.710
