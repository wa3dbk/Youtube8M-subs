00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello friends and welcome once more to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.050
 channel today we are going to continue 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.550
 with the return to classes and I'm going to 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.179
 teach how to use an empty west e 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:22.350
 install a usb memory 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:26.869
 we will need polymer clay one 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.210
 that empty a pretty strong glue 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.660
 a usb the smallest they find 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.149
 I'll leave the link of this down and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.700
 white plastic all materials 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.690
 are going to be on my blog on the page 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.969
 information below 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.269
 The first thing we are going to do is mix 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:49.089
 the two clays I'm using white 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.940
 and lodging to obtain a clear color 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.070
 purple you can really use the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.100
 strong color or the color you like 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.559
 they come from a lot of colors then they go 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.769
 to grab a bit and they're going to form a 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.700
 little ball once they have grandma 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:11.039
 they are going to cut it in half and in the second 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.039
 half will make it again 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.340
 once they have done grandma go 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.860
 to grab the eo that emptiness and go to 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.810
 start to shape it as if it were a 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.000
 truth set 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.909
 here they will have to use their hands a lot 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.130
 and if you have to shape the good 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.470
 to be if it's already that one time when 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.750
 we are playing with our hands 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.229
 begins to be more like a little aguadita 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.390
 the plasticine but if it's super easy to 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.039
 handle and more or less you have to 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.039
 something like this 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.220
 once they have finished they will 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.939
 grab the usb and they will measure the contour 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.759
 from the bottom as you can see what 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:06.789
 I'm marking in the clay and then with 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.789
 an exact knife will cut the excess 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.239
 as I told you earlier this clay 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.790
 it gets a bit soft when the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.409
 we are playing for a long time so 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.299
 be very careful because maybe 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.610
 can lose shape what they 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:27.430
 recommend is to put it in a while 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.430
 the freezer and then keep digging 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.180
 once they have made the little hole 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.250
 grab the usb one more time and go back to 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.650
 measure because maybe they need to do the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.690
 hole a little bigger once 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.300
 that you do this as I mentioned in the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.570
 clay gets soft I recommend them 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.960
 that before taking out the mold they made 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.390
 of the eo s put it a little bit in the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.210
 freezer so you do not ruin the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.610
 work they have already done once 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.650
 take out as you can see there they have the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.620
 marks below so it's super easy 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.160
 to put it back on, they will take it to 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.430
 oven read very well the instructions of 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.180
 your package I put it by 275 degrees 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.450
 fahrenheit and I left it for 25 minutes a 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.210
 hard time they will grab the eo that emptiness and 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.270
 with the glue we will adhere to the 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.540
 surface of the eo s here I am using 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.450
 this glue that is super powerful that 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.420
 is the 6000, but if you do not have 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.930
 this glue where they live can use 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.629
 the crazy tail or the tail that you hit 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.049
 super strong that sticks metal and all that 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.049
 but if we are going to do the next step 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.420
 t 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.930
 d 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.659
 and now we have to paste the memory like this 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.030
 that we are going to do exactly the same 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:14.340
 let's put a little bit of glue 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.340
 about the usb and then inside the s 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.410
 and now it's just to incorporate usb 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.830
 inside the little hole that we made go to 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.470
 have to use a bit of force 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.090
 but if this is basically everything if 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.490
 they really did the little hole what 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.940
 big enough they will not have 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.300
 no problem for them to enter 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.090
 And that's as it should be is super 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.220
 super cute I loved them and now 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.460
 the last step is to put a little bit of 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.470
 white plastic or they also sell a 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.330
 special plastic that gives them shine and 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.460
 this is like to give you the illusion of 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.460
 It looks like a real west 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.729
 let's let it dry for a few 

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:16.669
 hours because you have to dry the 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.279
 glue inside and once dry already 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.979
 is ready to use what can you use in 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:24.439
 your computer is obviously that I 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.329
 I bought is extremely well because comes a 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:28.609
 adapter for the phone so 

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:31.249
 you can pass all the photos right there 

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:33.559
 but if friends that's basically everything 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.599
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:38.029
 let them share it in my 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:41.839
 social networks and share those of your 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:44.209
 family and friends thanks for all 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.499
 your support and see you until next time 

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:47.739
 luck in their classes 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:47.739
 bye
