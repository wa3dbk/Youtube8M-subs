00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello together I wanted you one 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.020
 small decoration holaus the last weeks 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.550
 and months I want to show you the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.809
 things but not easy in the camera 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.000
 but show you the same 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.370
 as I draped the things then 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 arranged and how they last 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.000
 I decorated and decorated the end 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.770
 Hope you like that in the way I am 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.539
 I tried so much color 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.640
 and shape my apartment 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.220
 a deco because I'm there a bit 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.400
 I did not dare and the result 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.900
 You see, then, just look here 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.210
 my my couch I thought so 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.670
 a bit boring and cuddly so only 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.100
 I broke down with these little ones 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.540
 but had not really trusted me 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.460
 have ikea and have me then 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.000
 so dare a little color and shape 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.000
 reinzubringen 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.690
 First of all , it's back to one 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.579
 woolen hand like this one 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.140
 is a bit disturbed and I found that 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.840
 a little something different and me 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.100
 thought sadly that and just that 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.809
 but I was not enough for me 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.329
 wanted to have such a small one with it 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.850
 create our little mix of colors but 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.890
 First of all, I have these first 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.960
 annoying pillows are quite cheap 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.580
 there you have to look and very much 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.700
 beautiful cushion covers that I have there then 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.390
 plugged in and the result you see 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.530
 then you have to fight right there 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.350
 also a bit ex prices 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.030
 compare within the ikea which have 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.100
 we under the pillow cases then this 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.900
 These single doses pillows where you the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.350
 cushion covers then this room is in the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.150
 network 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.060
 and they are quite expensive because of the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.770
 then real ones are partial 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.600
 and much further away they have a lot 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.880
 cheaper pillows but we to the anti 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.270
 curative purposes are also completely sufficient 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.219
 simple and super comfortable 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.869
 yes, they have already been that way 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.609
 a little bit of pop like that 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.109
 but I did not have it yet 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.509
 I wanted then one more 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.729
 pattern mix create this without I 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.170
 Just dare to strip wrestled 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.880
 bring the other side I have myself 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.969
 not yet married but yes maybe 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.469
 someday 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.969
 Personally, I definitely think that 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.469
 it was a pretty emperor before afterwards 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.209
 effect is when you consider that 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.069
 Now really only textiles are 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.140
 and very simple ways and means 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.950
 been, the couch to a little 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.230
 upgrade 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.420
 I have both jobs then this beautiful 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.610
 lamp gets hold that there is no paper 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.920
 lamp diego could shred son andi 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.720
 so has a firmer plastic and so on 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.430
 a color mix we can see how so 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.680
 another and you fits in color 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.840
 just perfect yes then I still have 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.700
 at ikea these three candles bought the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.900
 very old and me already 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.299
 did not quite know what I was doing with it 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.620
 The candles could make me colorful 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.599
 just liked it very much 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.489
 then you can get so weko stones 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.980
 her Baumarkt in each and every tg 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.989
 for very small money just so white 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.370
 stones tricked and concluded 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.470
 just two more munich 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.880
 I actually keep my decoration 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.910
 I like it very much I do not like it that way 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.889
 Much of it came and you and I found that 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.569
 then yes, that's what I really liked 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.549
 beautiful you catch it fits all colors 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.549
 good and it is still relatively simple 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.489
 then I still have to match 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.079
 Visited murals because of my walls 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.150
 just pretty naked and I was there 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.560
 wanted a bit of color and there 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.950
 I found it at mÃ¶bel boss 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.450
 actually had the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.069
 cheapest pictures and the price 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.410
 performance ratio was just right 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:18.060
 So these huge pictures he is there 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.730
 are really big who have 39 90 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.300
 tasted the little behind has 20 euros 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.510
 tasted 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.670
 yes and I thought it was great because you see, for example 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.080
 in love such a brother picture and there 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.060
 you should definitely browse 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.739
 if you have your son market in there you have 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.360
 If the images really cheap the 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:44.160
 had a large selection of which has me 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:46.110
 I really liked my mum 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.700
 we still such a beautiful wind light 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.530
 I'm not so sure 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 where did she get that from when I'm going to get her 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.610
 ask and then in the infobox 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.380
 Write like everything else you 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.870
 See there are three candles in there and that 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.370
 is such a glass with his brother in 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.349
 of course they darken that really 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.840
 insanely beautiful sofa cozy and 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.760
 had a good mood from the bathroom 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.950
 I have such a mosque there then 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.049
 just heaped up a bit of sand 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.180
 a candle put in very bad 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.590
 like that does not always do that and so 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.750
 mussels you can get in each one 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.489
 Depot load from the package here I have 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.280
 just as tricked and found that too 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.600
 very nice indeed in the bedroom 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.150
 I dared to do it a bit 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.190
 I was at Ikea and got that and 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.650
 Pillow shells bought and those in metz the 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.760
 I have already shown here too 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.520
 I tried a bit 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.260
 form and also some color 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.750
 I have probably decided 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.340
 I would also like to dare color blocking 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.139
 in the bedroom did not have me 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.330
 really dared if you maybe 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.460
 Ideas or suggestions then tell me 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.050
 that is the blanket and the two 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.100
 petrol-colored cushion which in turn 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.750
 are also from hydra I'm fine 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.030
 Please feedback as the makers of this 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.830
 I just wanted to watch videos 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.539
 a bit more interactive and 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.470
 the things are not just a camera 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.660
 I think that's a bit like holding it 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.130
 boring I thought you could get up 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.229
 this kind maybe much better 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.240
 imagine how the decoration works 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.160
 I did with it and you there 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.740
 maybe much better and easier 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.479
 Get suggestions 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.039
 tell me how it feels and if 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.509
 that is so successful or if it is 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.620
 The thing is just better in the 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.080
 to hold the camera 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.120
 yes, if you still have ideas tips 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.560
 and always have suggestions for me 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.690
 here in the comments I would 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.400
 I am very happy if you are there 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.229
 maybe also some ideas for me 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.090
 Like me, that's what I wanted to do 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.470
 could i possibly what still 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.780
 I could always be so 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.550
 bit unnecessary i wish you on 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.380
 every day a wonderful day i 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.860
 hope you had fun with the video and 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.860
 I'm telling you
