00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.980
 that can happen before you want to cut your hair looking for the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.800
 Scissors and notes that the little sister is having an adhesive party 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.620
 has celebrated 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.020
 and then she left on the balcony, on the other hand, left with it 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.760
 you do not need to combine it so not bad but 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.230
 cut but why actually 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.610
 you cut a pair of scissors at all 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.749
 A pair of scissors consists of three parts though a blade and a screw 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.089
 you just need to screw the three parts together and Verkic 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.170
 now the rehearsal 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.650
 how does not somehow the substance Klein between the cut firmly 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.880
 and the scissors do not cut 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.090
 That is because the edges of the ski instructor are not polished yet 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.400
 and that happens even before it's screwed together 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.990
 in the ski hall factory 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.990
 a grindstone can be sharpened really sharp 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.980
 if you cross a pair of scissors in the middle you can get the weird one 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.040
 well-sanded side 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.760
 The sharpness of Trotta Swinkels depends on our speed 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.450
 Winter the sharper the scissors you put now the two cut ones 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.330
 Halves on top of each other are the sharp edges on the inside of the scissors 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.430
 Now only the screwdrivers penetrate that makes it here at this hand crank 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.430
 and then another rehearsal 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.380
 but it still does not work the scissors cut though the front but 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 not until the end and that's why in the sheer half with one 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
 Hammer arched com beaten 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.840
 You can see that well if you look from the side through a closed clipper 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.790
 sees through 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.899
 There is a gap in the middle 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.770
 on the screw and on the top are the intersecting with each other 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.209
 The scissors on the whole length of their cuts must be cut equally well 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.209
 Pressure on the edges to be the same everywhere 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.650
 that is achieved through this soil Daly keeps sounds on tension 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.430
 Now she finally cuts the fabric is in the lead 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.230
 There is another reason for this to be a particularly important part of one 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.810
 Scissors, this route is a small crescent-shaped rhine mountain 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.129
 When closing, the right streaks half over this group 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.709
 As a result, both scissors staples are firmly defied everywhere 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.399
 again a rehearsal now the scissors cut this very well against the top 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:33.389
 However, fetish he often on the ground, it can happen that the 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.229
 bend and no longer close properly 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.869
 and if you use a pair of hairdressing scissors to remove the adhesive tober 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.549
 You should not be surprised if they are not really cutting anymore 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.500
 want to cut a pair of scissors is therefore a precision tool 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.200
 There are nearly 450 different types of duty each other's purpose 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.239
 there are nail clippers 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.319
 Porsche honors TP shave the difficult Basel scissors at one 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.599
 heavy fall nonsense of course 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.930
 but there are fish in heavy as I defend myself Knopfler shear poultry 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.530
 So you better use the reason for haircutting 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:13.480
 a scissors 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.620
 with which one really cuts hair
