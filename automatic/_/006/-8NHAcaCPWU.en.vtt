the game development tutorial from
scratch<00:00:05.910> with<00:00:06.660> me<00:00:06.779> Eddie<00:00:06.930> one<00:00:07.109> Hill<00:00:07.259> 98<00:00:07.740> and

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
scratch with me Eddie one Hill 98 and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.620 
scratch with me Eddie one Hill 98 and
today<00:00:08.820> we're<00:00:09.000> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.210> start<00:00:09.389> being

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
today we're going to start being

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.690 
today we're going to start being
efficient<00:00:10.200> instead<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.620> using<00:00:10.830> insult<00:00:11.429> time

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
efficient instead of using insult time

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.150 
efficient instead of using insult time
i'm<00:00:12.570> going<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.110> bites<00:00:13.530> because<00:00:13.799> there<00:00:14.130> i

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
i'm going to use bites because there i

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.960 
i'm going to use bites because there i
have<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> lot<00:00:14.790> smaller<00:00:15.379> so<00:00:16.460> we're<00:00:17.460> gonna<00:00:17.580> start

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
have a lot smaller so we're gonna start

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.480 
have a lot smaller so we're gonna start
with<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.810> program<00:00:19.020> by<00:00:19.439> using<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.949> bite<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
with this program by using a bite and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.189 
with this program by using a bite and
that's<00:00:20.699> give<00:00:20.880> me<00:00:20.970> your<00:00:21.180> score<00:00:21.570> ok<00:00:21.930> basically

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
that's give me your score ok basically

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.820 
that's give me your score ok basically
and<00:00:23.119> this<00:00:24.119> little<00:00:24.420> application<00:00:25.140> i'm<00:00:25.410> making

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and this little application i'm making

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.630 
and this little application i'm making
is<00:00:27.140> it's<00:00:28.140> gonna<00:00:28.320> ask<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.769> what<00:00:28.980> school<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.460> go

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
is it's gonna ask you what school you go

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.080 
is it's gonna ask you what school you go
on<00:00:29.910> say<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> game<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:32.719> on<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> test<00:00:34.260> even<00:00:35.090> we're

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
on say a game and on a test even we're

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.869 
on say a game and on a test even we're
gonna<00:00:36.180> use<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.600> switch<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.380> give<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:38.550> output

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
gonna use the switch to give to output

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.660 
gonna use the switch to give to output
various<00:00:39.239> answers<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.160> let's<00:00:41.160> go<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> bite

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
various answers so let's go in the bite

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.180 
various answers so let's go in the bite
school<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.690> got<00:00:42.899> an<00:00:42.960> eval<00:00:43.170> yet<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.739> we're

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
school and it's got an eval yet so we're

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.630

this school variable is going to equal
whatever<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> scanner<00:01:09.270> picks<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
whatever the scanner picks up to the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:23.530 
whatever the scanner picks up to the
next<00:01:10.920> int<00:01:11.390> sorry<00:01:12.390> next<00:01:12.689> byte<00:01:16.580> static<00:01:20.479> okay<00:01:21.479> and

to you called the switch statement okay
I<00:01:31.700> what<00:01:32.700> variable<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.329> want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.840> target<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I what variable do we want to target the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.840 
I what variable do we want to target the
score<00:01:35.520> verb<00:01:35.790> okay<00:01:36.979> ask<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.310> targeted

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
score verb okay ask the targeted

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.420 
score verb okay ask the targeted
variable<00:01:39.290> now<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> switch<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.159> are<00:01:41.280> many

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
variable now in a switch there are many

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.859 
variable now in a switch there are many
cases<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.659> case<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:44.189> equals<00:01:44.280> 1<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.659> can

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
cases so case if it equals 1 this can

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.359 
cases so case if it equals 1 this can
also<00:01:45.990> work<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> string<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.270 
also work with the string you can have a
string<00:01:48.030> variable<00:01:48.149> their<00:01:48.540> case<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:50.159> equal

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
string variable their case if it's equal
