00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.679
 if you are those people who find it uncomfortable to wear a tie 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:06.680
 be encouraged to wear an armor 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.760
 the armor lived its apogee in the warlike 15th century 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.699
 at first they were made of mail 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.710
 later to increase protection the knights started using another 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.710
 type of armor made with large pieces of steel 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.890
 today craftsmen manufacture these obsolete war apparel over 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.009
 everything for historical recreations 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.009
 This workshop specializes in custom-made armor 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.089
 the craftsman must perform 45 different measurements 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.010
 just to prepare the pattern 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.830
 Trace each piece of the pattern on a steel plate that has one millimeter 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.980
 and a half thick 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.300
 then cut the pieces using a band saw 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 This is the breastplate that covers the chest and abdomen 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.620
 then start to shape the piece with an automatic hammer 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 does not use any template molteni to guide 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.120
 once he has given something to perfect the piece with a hammer 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.390
 manual 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.500
 hits the metal against a vertical trunk 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.790
 A bag of lead beads cushion the blows its function is to prevent the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.260
 metal is misshapen 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
 then a few more touches to finish shaping 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.320
 so far he's been hammering inside the theater 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.450
 now the external part works 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.390
 softens the metal surface 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.390
 a process that is called smoothing 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.240
 using a little different from the automatic hammer works the base 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 of the breastplate to create a by biased out 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.289
 supports the piece in a yonque and then with a manual hammer 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.860
 alyssa the edge 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.409
 when you use this heavy metallic fetus 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.320
 the edge releases the shoulders part of the weight and distributes it over the 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.319
 hips 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.149
 the artisan reviews the piece and makes the necessary adjustments 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.569
 using again several hammers 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.569
 works the remaining areas of the fetus 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.989
 gradually roll the edge over itself to round it 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.439
 It is a slow process 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:53.149
 at all times the craftsman shaped the metal slowly and carefully 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.689
 The last thing he wants is for the gentleman to feel uncomfortable 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.839
 roll the metal on itself to make the cut 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.139
 reinforces the perimeter of the text 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.779
 and the rounded cut prevents the sharp metal cut the skin 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.199
 the text is ready for the final touches 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:27.279
 the craftsman softens the surface with a medium grain sandpaper 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.619
 then with fine grain sandpaper 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:37.959
 then the last phase with a fine-grained sandpaper and a compound for 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.269
 polished 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.439
 some breastplates have an articulated design 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.529
 In this model the craftsman uses three brass finials to assemble the 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.339
 sections 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:49.809
 Hold it with slack 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.809
 so that the pieces can move 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.059
 then using again rivets he attaches some leather straps 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.419
 an armor consists of about twenty different pieces 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 such as those that protect the pimples called spinels 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.579
 leather and metal gloves called gauntlets 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.599
 the piece that covers the shoulders yamada backs pt 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.259
 and of course the helmet and the viewfinder 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.520
 a gentleman will put on the armor starting at the feet 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.240
 otherwise the weight of the top pieces would make him fall to his knees 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.870
 half dressed 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.610
 in the middle ages an armor cost the same as a small farm 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.180
 a luxury that only the nobles could afford 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.430
 these armors cost thousands of euros 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.389
 so it will be today a knight in shining armor is also not 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:57.719
 cheap
