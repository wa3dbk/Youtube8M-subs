00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.959
 global warming and how 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.420
 consequence of this the reduction of 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:10.940
 habitat for the polar bears pushes to 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.830
 these mammals predators the most 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.500
 great of the earth to eat at 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.390
 members of their own species this 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.150
 growing trend worries the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.530
 scientists 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.119
 precisely the experts of the agency 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.369
 Canadian quality polar bear 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.650
 international polar bear international 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.360
 specialized in the study of bears 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.279
 Polar revealed the situation 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.399
 unfortunate that pursues these 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.860
 animals during the last weeks 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.020
 only in the province of Manitoba next 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.390
 from the western hudson bay it 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.399
 registered at least four cases in the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.730
 that a male polar bear killed and ate 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.649
 your puppies according to the report one of 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.210
 these cases occurred at the end of 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.190
 November and the scientists that 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.649
 They wanted to take pictures of polar bears 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.020
 in their natural habitat they became 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.780
 witnesses of the atrocious scene 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.850
 according to Canadian scientists the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.160
 biological cannibalism among bears 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.740
 polar is due to abnormal warm weather 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.540
 that now reigns in the area due to 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.700
 degree to climate warming the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.440
 formation of ice on the surface of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.870
 hudson bay occurs every time 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.700
 later as a result the 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.800
 predators are forced to 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.780
 stay longer on the continent and 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.140
 they can not hunt seals on the ice of the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.119
 bay in fact two decades ago the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.490
 light surface are are frozen 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.590
 totally for November 8th ago 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.500
 10 years this happened on November 20 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.899
 and this year the predators will not be able 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.940
 leave the continent before the second 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.000
 December week warn the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.430
 Canadian scientists in this 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.410
 season the polar bears have more 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.619
 hungry than ever since they are being 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.780
 finishing the remains of subcutaneous fat 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.640
 in summer and autumn when the Bay of 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.710
 hudson is ice free the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.140
 predators usually burn a kilogram of 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.060
 fat stored daily losing in 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.390
 this period a total of 30 per 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.320
 percent of body weight the problem does not 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.750
 it's just 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.250
 this fall there were cases of 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.530
 cannibalism among polar bears 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.020
 also in the Norwegian Arctic in the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.570
 archipelago of svalbard as well as in the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.520
 South coast of the Beaufort Sea a sector 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.520
 of the Arctic Ocean in North America
