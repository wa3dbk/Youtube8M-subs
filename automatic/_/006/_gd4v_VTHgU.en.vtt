00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.259
 good friends we continue with the chery 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.209
 face 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.380
 as I said earlier when I showed you 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:11.930
 the motor 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.170
 unfortunately it is a model that in 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.840
 Uruguay is not still selling and 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.210
 continuing with the motor topic I 'm going to 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.210
 show this low yale face chassis 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.950
 its front design 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.949
 tubular 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.950
 I think I designed to support this 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.739
 engine that looks like it would not have been 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.530
 made to put it in this body 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:44.070
 however do not get confused though 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.399
 look like a design made in the background of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.399
 home 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:54.230
 crushed tubes 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:01:00.070
 I think it's very well done 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.070
 because it gives it a rigidity 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:09.040
 to the front train 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:12.720
 look at the frame you designed 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.720
 if you want to weird not 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.549
 a design made to withstand this 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.400
 to some wells and 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:32.750
 well down here the kneecap that goes nailed 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:37.130
 in the frame has no screws 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:41.170
 the seat that said part of the pipe 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.170
 its front structure 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.750
 this is the engine 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.310
 with a good aluminum carter with good 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.040
 oil capacity 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.110
 look up the catalyst right here 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.060
 at the exit of the manifold escape well 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.399
 close 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.399
 what you see here is the alternator 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.039
 other part of the tubular design the support 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.140
 of the frame 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.840
 what you see here in the bar 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.170
 stabilizer 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.170
 then the exhaust pipe the flexible 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.570
 a a resonance chamber 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.610
 the heat insulator for the floor and 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.170
 other of the particularities as well 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.590
 that his brother the cucu has a good 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.900
 rust protection with a good shake 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.900
 stone or anti painting the villa 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.090
 and a structure that supports the floor with 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.660
 an interesting crossbar 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.680
 and then another of the things he has 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.510
 plastic naphtha tank 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.510
 like most cars 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.360
 a rear train 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.360
 of that rigid 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.569
 with a bar 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.299
 and stabilizer 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.299
 that one in the body 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.430
 the tip of the shaft then here can 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.780
 observe a spiral 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.680
 and separated from the spiral the shock absorber 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.890
 Independent 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.430
 of course he has drum brakes this 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.530
 model comes with a a bs 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.120
 another thing to highlight is the 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.970
 quality of the silencer to be initial 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.900
 and good in general terms this is the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.900
 face
