place it in the center if you start in
the<00:01:46.049> center<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.619> always<00:01:46.830> easier<00:01:47.190> than<00:01:47.340> just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the center it's always easier than just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.039 
the center it's always easier than just
to<00:01:47.700> work<00:01:47.909> your<00:01:48.119> way<00:01:48.240> around<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.630> outside<00:01:48.690> edge

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
and then i'm just going to place these

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.260 
and then i'm just going to place these
around<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:54.030> outside<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:56.030> should<00:01:57.030> need

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
around the outside like this should need

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.410 
around the outside like this should need
seven<00:01:58.080> going<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.830> outside<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> you'll

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
bits now is go to my circle so I've got

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.480 
bits now is go to my circle so I've got
21<00:04:07.420> on<00:04:07.570> 18<00:04:07.870> inch<00:04:08.140> circles<00:04:08.680> these<00:04:09.100> going<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.400> go

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
21 on 18 inch circles these going to go

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.670 
21 on 18 inch circles these going to go
on<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.670> back<00:04:10.080> it's<00:04:11.080> what<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.200> want<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.530> do<00:04:11.650> is
