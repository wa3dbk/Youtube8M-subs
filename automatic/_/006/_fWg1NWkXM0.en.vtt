00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.810
 two 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:14.030
 here people feel identified and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.250
 enjoyed it so much that so often 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.890
 the balance continues to grow and that's the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.939
 end of the positive that you need to 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.669
 responsibility also that the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.529
 basketball well go go more than the 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.110
 people have enjoyed and that's for 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.779
 we are in a great triumph to 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.390
 they will trust from the beginning there 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.059
 a very good human group of and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.710
 we work very well as a team we are 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.510
 very close to the city and I think that 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.770
 we make a great paper representing the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.170
 values ​​of our city 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.300
 they have placed a strong bet on us 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.429
 and my job is to keep growing with 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.129
 the same the fans feel 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:53.180
 identified with us from 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.829
 there everything else is secondary more 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.929
 down but as long as the players 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.129
 young people have a chance either 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.940
 on your computer that sometimes seems like 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.079
 you get your team to the top or barça 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.420
 poisonous and there is not always life after 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.399
 of our team in the maximum illusion 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.869
 when I reached 6 with 12 13 years old it is 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:13.010
 always the dream of getting to the first 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.470
 team the lower selections 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.880
 more already gave successes successes after 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.390
 successes both the male and the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.940
 I think that there is a team and 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.820
 works very well from the quarry from 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 the basis for there to be players to give 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.120
 Olympic years always a great achievement 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.150
 because it is very difficult to get it 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.770
 has worked many has suffered and I each 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.740
 year and each even if they are the same color 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.150
 of the same material 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.040
 they are complicated 2 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.830
 the successes are there we will go 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.100
 got two golds and one silver 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.070
 Olympic Games have been three or four 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.970
 years in many successes therefore 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.970
 they are not someone
