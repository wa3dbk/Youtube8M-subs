00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
out of crude oil without palladium it is

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.939 
out of crude oil without palladium it is
a<00:00:59.640> hydrogen<00:01:00.000> sponge<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.530> hear<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> lot

what other alice is saying that's a bit

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.590 
what other alice is saying that's a bit
conservative<00:02:18.250> even<00:02:19.250> though<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:20.030> returns<00:02:20.420> are

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
conservative even though the returns are

dynamics that existed in 2001 exist
right<00:02:29.750> now<00:02:29.810> that's<00:02:30.530> why<00:02:30.740> I'm<00:02:30.920> raising<00:02:31.100> the

right now that's why I'm raising the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.280 
right now that's why I'm raising the
levels<00:02:31.820> not<00:02:32.240> because<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.750> recent<00:02:32.960> price

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290

levels not because of the recent price
rise<00:02:33.560> are<00:02:33.920> all<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.190> talks<00:02:34.460> going<00:02:34.820> on<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.450> Wall

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050

because<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.990> dynamics<00:02:39.590> have<00:02:40.190> shifted

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
because the dynamics have shifted

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.810 
because the dynamics have shifted
regular<00:02:42.170> supply<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.650> demand<00:02:42.740> will<00:02:43.370> put<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.700> up

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
regular supply and demand will put it up

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.360 
regular supply and demand will put it up
between<00:02:43.970> four<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.390> five<00:02:44.630> hundred<00:02:45.130> can<00:02:46.130> we<00:02:46.220> see

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
between four and five hundred can we see

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.270 
between four and five hundred can we see
a<00:02:46.400> bigger<00:02:46.730> one<00:02:47.000> than<00:02:47.210> 450<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.020> 550<00:02:48.410> absolutely

international basis the North's mine is

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.290 
international basis the North's mine is
the<00:03:21.440> world's<00:03:21.709> largest<00:03:21.950> mind<00:03:22.370> for<00:03:22.820> nickel<00:03:23.120> and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
the world's largest mind for nickel and

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.750 
the world's largest mind for nickel and
palladium<00:03:23.680> now<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.709> found<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.070> out<00:03:25.250> about<00:03:25.370> six

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
palladium now I found this out about six

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.430 
palladium now I found this out about six
several<00:03:26.030> weeks<00:03:26.209> ago<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:27.050> in<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.230> first

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
several weeks ago that in the first

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.220 
several weeks ago that in the first
quarter<00:03:28.300> they<00:03:29.300> dropped<00:03:29.570> about<00:03:29.690> six<00:03:30.080> percent

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
quarter they dropped about six percent

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.460 
quarter they dropped about six percent
on<00:03:30.650> production<00:03:31.580> second<00:03:32.360> quarter<00:03:32.660> ten<00:03:33.110> percent

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
on production second quarter ten percent

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.590 
on production second quarter ten percent
so<00:03:34.160> they're<00:03:34.310> accelerating<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:35.030> but<00:03:35.570> a

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
so they're accelerating that but a

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.880 
so they're accelerating that but a
couple<00:03:35.810> weeks<00:03:36.050> ago<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.260> came<00:03:36.440> out<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.709> said

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
couple weeks ago that came out and said

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.740 
couple weeks ago that came out and said
they're<00:03:37.670> going<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.850> keep<00:03:37.970> domestic

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
they're going to keep domestic

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.410 
they're going to keep domestic
distribution<00:03:39.350> even<00:03:40.280> while<00:03:40.970> they<00:03:41.150> lower

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
distribution even while they lower

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.960 
distribution even while they lower
international<00:03:42.350> distribution<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:43.820> now

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
international distribution and so now

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.460 
international distribution and so now
we're<00:03:44.209> starting<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.510> see<00:03:44.570> a<00:03:44.630> lot<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:44.959> heat

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
we're starting to see a lot of heat

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.410 
we're starting to see a lot of heat
coming<00:03:46.010> into<00:03:46.340> palladium<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:46.880> there's<00:03:47.360> a

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
coming into palladium and there's a

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.810 
coming into palladium and there's a
little<00:03:48.080> bit<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.560> low<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:49.070> like<00:03:49.220> 6.4

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
little bit of a low it's like 6.4

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.110 
little bit of a low it's like 6.4

million ounces mind a year there's 670

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.690 
million ounces mind a year there's 670
million<00:03:53.300> of<00:03:53.480> silver<00:03:53.840> about<00:03:54.140> 90<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.620> gold<00:03:54.890> so

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
million of silver about 90 of gold so

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.430 
million of silver about 90 of gold so
it's<00:03:55.820> a<00:03:55.880> very<00:03:55.910> tiny<00:03:56.330> market<00:03:56.840> doesn't<00:03:57.200> take<00:03:57.410> a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
it's a very tiny market doesn't take a

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.060 
it's a very tiny market doesn't take a
lot<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.680> move<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:58.910> what<00:03:59.810> happens<00:04:00.260> if<00:04:00.860> the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
lot to move it so what happens if the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.550 
lot to move it so what happens if the
price<00:04:01.310> moves<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:02.270> four<00:04:02.510> fifty<00:04:02.870> five<00:04:03.320> fifty

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560
