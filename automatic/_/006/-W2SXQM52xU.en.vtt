00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.670
 I mean a little more in the aspect 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.010
 artistic as was his first contact 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.530
 with the movement be it hip hop or the 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.180
 rap the music properly or whatever 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.460
 better not be here in mexico because we are 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.340
 near us in a certain way you 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.020
 comes to know if those things are not 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.520
 lying down we are there of it is 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.140
 forming comes a little simpler by 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.600
 assist what the movement is not either 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.220
 so big there is in Peru as more or less 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.079
 is the hip hop movement in what way 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.050
 you have contact with the world 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.350
 hip hop in but entered by the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.700
 breakdance more or less 20 years ago by 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.480
 a group that was called flipping the 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.090
 Street 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.650
 the founder of let's say the moved 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.810
 it began to be called movement time 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.960
 Peruvian was the maximum solar that announces 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.840
 Active is a lively and active workshop 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.130
 of breakdance because that side began 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.610
 with the team dance the hip hop came through 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.910
 the dance then this some people who 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.930
 they had relatives abroad 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:14.290
 could this bring cassettes rap tapes 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.620
 from the USA 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 and it was so the collectors then 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.659
 they were exchanging ribbons 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.560
 at that time I was in agreement 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.020
 coyote was the one of pm car records 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.780
 bomb 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.780
 that until now is the only store 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.000
 current and producer of events of 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.240
 team 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.540
 and it was that we say that everyone went to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.760
 amphitheater traded ribbons 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.410
 they exchanged dance steps movies 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.410
 in that time of vhs 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.480
 that's your goal and that was starting 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.910
 a cousin in love lived in states 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.630
 united and sent gas from Cristeros 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.380
 barrels 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.289
 if equal with the machete control what 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.530
 first I heard Spanish my brother 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:12.110
 greater that is in Argentina was that 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.110
 I brought my house music and work 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.019
 and the first thing that happened 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200
 do not 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.050
 Ivan Amaya 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.470

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.469
 they will not miss out on that 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.680
