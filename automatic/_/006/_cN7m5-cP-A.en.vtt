 tell you how to install 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.000
 your programs and applications directly from 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.679
 computer while not throwing 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.010
 installation files on memory card 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.430
 Lina either on the phone's memory that we need 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.140
 this we need for this we need a native 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.510
 usb cable connected to computer 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.599
 installed drivers on your 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.330
 smartphone as well as the most important thing 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.719
 install program 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.910
 in the meantime , I have the latest version 0.5.2 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.010
 in this case, we have all connected 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.420
 I will install the program 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.260
 demonstrate how it works so well 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.780
 to start 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.210
 if you connect do it first 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.340
 again about the settings of our smartphone in 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.719
 security need to put unknowns 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.050
 sources tick unknown 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.090
 sources so that we can 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.439
 install applications not from play 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:11.580
 Market in this case, we have a tick already 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:16.159
 worth as well as in the developer options 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.240
 need to tick debugging by yusbi 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.960
 debug mode starts when 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.960
 connecting usb 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.049
 only after that you can run 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:34.350
 program and install and install 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:37.770
 pre- downloaded but for now files so 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.399
 must we launched our program 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.250
 the first connection, it will produce 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:48.479
 search for connected devices there 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.179
 peak computer here is the program and became 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.780
 attempt here also has settings 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:02:00.799
 which you can put yourself by 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:04.549
 default, that is, here are all the settings 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:09.539
 you can already put it as you wish 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:13.230
 there is nothing complicated there is all ours 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.690
 the program is ready to use all u 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.010
 we have pre- downloaded files for now 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.010
 that is, here they are 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:29.400
 The program that we need will be 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:32.750
 install it our phone so choose 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.750
 any program 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:45.650
 For example, the program ppsspp 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.650
 the program is installed here 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.860
 all installation is complete this window will be 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.540
 closed after 60 seconds in settings 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.459
 you can put less time of course 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.000
 so that the program immediately closed all 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.709
 demonstrate our phone 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:09.159
 that this application is successful 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:15.769
 So this program was installed 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:20.060
 and that anything else will install here 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.970
 example, we just need two times 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.920
 left- click and program 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.920
 will be automatically installed by itself 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.450
 So 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.819
 wait until it becomes 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.600
 So 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.580
 it's in the app all just about 40 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.570
 megabyte so a little more time 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:07.420
 takes to install the entire file 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.420
 installed will demonstrate 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:17.090
 so this milk program is alive 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.090
 wallpaper for your phone 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.780
