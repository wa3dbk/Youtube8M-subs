after<00:00:10.440> effects<00:00:10.740> now<00:00:11.400> cameras<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.300> After

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
after effects now cameras in After

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
after effects now cameras in After
Effects<00:00:13.080> at<00:00:13.440> pretty<00:00:14.280> much<00:00:14.309> just<00:00:14.639> like<00:00:14.790> real

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
Effects at pretty much just like real

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
Effects at pretty much just like real
cameras<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.660> know<00:00:15.690> they<00:00:15.870> can<00:00:15.900> zoom<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
cameras you know they can zoom in and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.670 
cameras you know they can zoom in and
out<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.430> move<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.789> around<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.680> they've

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
out you can move them around and they've

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
out you can move them around and they've
got<00:00:19.710> depth<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.369> field<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:20.850> well<00:00:21.000> pretty<00:00:21.660> cool

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
got depth of field as well pretty cool

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380 
got depth of field as well pretty cool
stuff<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:23.039> create<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> camera<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.090> After

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
stuff so to create a camera in After

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.029 
stuff so to create a camera in After
Effects<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.779> really<00:00:25.019> simple<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.740> I've<00:00:25.859> got

Effects is really simple what I've got
here<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.490> my<00:00:26.640> project<00:00:27.240> window<00:00:27.810> from<00:00:28.349> how<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
here is my project window from how to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.980 
here is my project window from how to
use<00:00:29.130> lights<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.820> after<00:00:30.090> effects<00:00:30.390> which<00:00:30.779> if

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
use lights and after effects which if

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.269 
use lights and after effects which if
you<00:00:31.080> haven't<00:00:31.140> seen<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> video<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> can

your<00:00:35.520> own<00:00:35.579> project<00:00:36.210> whatever<00:00:36.360> you've<00:00:36.690> got

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
your own project whatever you've got

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.060 
your own project whatever you've got
going<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.680> pretty<00:00:38.100> simple<00:00:39.290> if<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.890> up

going so pretty simple if you just go up
to<00:00:41.100> layer<00:00:41.879> new<00:00:43.040> camera<00:00:44.040> it'll<00:00:44.969> create<00:00:45.270> this

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
to layer new camera it'll create this

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
to layer new camera it'll create this
dialog<00:00:46.110> box<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.190> know<00:00:47.340> gives<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> a

dialog box that you know gives you a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.830 
dialog box that you know gives you a
number<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.910> different<00:00:48.090> options<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.750> can

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
with a 50 and that will change your

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.439 
with a 50 and that will change your
depth<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.680> field<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.030> some<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> your

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
depth of field you know some of your

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.329 
depth of field you know some of your
angle<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> view<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.710> math<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
angle of view and this is all math that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.820 
angle of view and this is all math that
you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.580> actually<00:01:05.729> change<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.420> well<00:01:06.680> but<00:01:07.680> for

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you can actually change as well but for

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.920 
you can actually change as well but for
right<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:07.979> I'm<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.930> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
right now I'm just going to go with the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320 
right now I'm just going to go with the
standard<00:01:10.350> parameters<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> 50<00:01:11.340> mil<00:01:11.520> okay

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
standard parameters of a 50 mil okay

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.870 
standard parameters of a 50 mil okay
great<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> camera<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.830> has<00:01:14.070> popped<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.549> here

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
great so a camera one has popped up here

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.390 
great so a camera one has popped up here
in<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.150> timeline<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.560> kind<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.130> where

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
in my timeline and I kind of like where

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
in my timeline and I kind of like where
it<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.670> right<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.840> light<00:01:19.110> passes

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it is right here as the light passes

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
it is right here as the light passes
over<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.860> center<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> text<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.330> we're

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
over the center of the text so we're

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050 
over the center of the text so we're
going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.619> sort<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.979> our<00:01:23.189> our

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
here to the camera button and select one

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.770 
here to the camera button and select one
of<00:01:47.340> these<00:01:47.520> options<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.090> did<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> unified

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
of these options you did a unified

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.270 
of these options you did a unified
camera<00:01:49.200> tool<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.619> orbit<00:01:50.040> tracking<00:01:50.850> X<00:01:51.210> Y<00:01:51.930> or<00:01:52.170> Z

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
camera tool the orbit tracking X Y or Z

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.460 
camera tool the orbit tracking X Y or Z
or<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> could<00:01:53.490> hit<00:01:53.640> C<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.170> keep

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
or you could hit C and if you just keep

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.670 
or you could hit C and if you just keep
hitting<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.759> here<00:01:57.000> I'll<00:01:57.119> show<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.390> if

hitting see so here I'll show you if

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.510 
hitting see so here I'll show you if
here<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.799> are<00:01:58.890> at<00:01:59.009> zero<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.060> hit<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:01.520> it'll

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
here we are at zero if I hit see it'll

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.600 
here we are at zero if I hit see it'll
toggle<00:02:02.759> through<00:02:03.149> these<00:02:03.509> options<00:02:04.610> pretty

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
toggle through these options pretty

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.580 
toggle through these options pretty
quick<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:05.969> easy<00:02:06.119> i<00:02:06.270> used<00:02:06.570> i<00:02:06.840> used<00:02:07.079> see<00:02:07.350> more

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
quick and easy i used i used see more

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.889 
quick and easy i used i used see more
often<00:02:07.890> than<00:02:08.009> i<00:02:08.129> actually<00:02:08.369> go<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.789> click<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.360> so

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
often than i actually go and click so so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.740 
often than i actually go and click so so
right<00:02:10.080> now<00:02:10.110> i<00:02:10.289> want<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.849> start<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> other

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
right now i want to start to the other

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.520 
right now i want to start to the other
side<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
side of the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.530 
side of the
frame<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> want<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.550> move<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.000> camera<00:02:15.240> to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
frame so I want to move the camera to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.809 
frame so I want to move the camera to
the<00:02:15.600> left<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.440> I'm<00:02:16.530> going<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.800> grab<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.610> one

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
the left so I'm going to grab this one

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.690 
the left so I'm going to grab this one
which<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.900> XY<00:02:19.370> I'm<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.459> going<00:02:20.640> to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
which is the the XY I'm just going to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.720 
which is the the XY I'm just going to
literally<00:02:21.209> drag<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.990> scene<00:02:22.230> over<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:22.890> while

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
literally drag the scene over here while

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.230 
literally drag the scene over here while
holding<00:02:24.030> shift<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:25.080> make<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> nice<00:02:26.240> perfect

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
holding shift to make a nice perfect

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.330 
holding shift to make a nice perfect
line<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.319> can<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.709> couple<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.190> key

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
line and you can see a couple of key

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.100 
line and you can see a couple of key
frames<00:02:29.610> we're<00:02:29.819> already<00:02:30.000> created<00:02:30.510> there<00:02:30.690> at<00:02:30.840> 0

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
frames we're already created there at 0

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.590 
frames we're already created there at 0
seconds<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.860> once<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.550> change<00:02:32.910> where<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.360> are

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
seconds so once you change where you are

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.300 
seconds so once you change where you are
in<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.840> timeline<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:34.920> move<00:02:35.160> a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
in the timeline and then move a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.520 
in the timeline and then move a
parameter<00:02:35.819> like<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.209> it'll<00:02:36.750> create<00:02:37.140> new<00:02:37.350> key

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
parameter like that it'll create new key

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
parameter like that it'll create new key
frames<00:02:37.770> for<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.489> don't<00:02:38.670> actually<00:02:38.850> have

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
frames for you you don't actually have

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.750 
frames for you you don't actually have
to<00:02:39.209> click<00:02:39.569> on<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.900> create<00:02:40.170> new<00:02:40.290> keyframe<00:02:40.890> okay

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
to click on the create new keyframe okay

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.479 
to click on the create new keyframe okay
so<00:02:41.819> now<00:02:42.209> we've<00:02:42.420> got<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:43.230> know<00:02:43.380> camera<00:02:44.280> left

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
so now we've got you know camera left

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.030 
so now we've got you know camera left
and<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.390> going<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.570> move<00:02:45.810> into<00:02:46.080> our<00:02:46.620> hero

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
and it's going to move into our hero

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.699 
and it's going to move into our hero
shot<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.730> stop<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:49.200> want<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.560> hold

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
shot and stop and I want it to hold

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.650 
shot and stop and I want it to hold
there<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.370> about<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.730> second<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.390> we'll<00:02:51.510> say

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
there for about a second so we'll say

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.240 
there for about a second so we'll say
three<00:02:51.930> seconds<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:52.920> where<00:02:53.070> you

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
three seconds and this is where you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770 
three seconds and this is where you
would<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.820> click<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.450> create<00:02:54.660> new

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
would have to click on the create new

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.920 
would have to click on the create new
keyframe<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.300> now<00:02:57.420> I've<00:02:57.540> got<00:02:57.720> two

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
keyframe like that so now I've got two

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.400 
keyframe like that so now I've got two
more<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.760> I'm<00:02:59.760> going<00:02:59.940> to<00:02:59.970> let's<00:03:00.720> say<00:03:01.019> let's

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
more and I'm going to let's say let's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.130 
more and I'm going to let's say let's
say<00:03:01.560> during<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.790> two<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.330> three<00:03:03.569> seconds

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
say during this two to three seconds

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.100 
say during this two to three seconds
let's<00:03:04.380> let's<00:03:04.950> add<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> little<00:03:05.400> zoom<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.390> I'm

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
let's let's add a little zoom so I'm

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.710 
let's let's add a little zoom so I'm
going<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.319> hit<00:03:07.440> see<00:03:07.769> again<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:09.330> now<00:03:09.420> I've<00:03:09.540> got

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
going to hit see again and now I've got

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.610 
going to hit see again and now I've got
my<00:03:09.840> little<00:03:10.019> zoom<00:03:10.410> button<00:03:10.709> here<00:03:12.170> let's<00:03:13.170> start

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
my little zoom button here let's start

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.100 
my little zoom button here let's start
here<00:03:14.510> like<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.560> just<00:03:17.299> punch<00:03:18.299> in<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.900> a

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
here like this and just punch in just a

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.150 
here like this and just punch in just a
little<00:03:19.290> bit<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.170> as<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.650> coming<00:03:22.860> up<00:03:23.040> to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
little bit so that as it's coming up to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.460 
little bit so that as it's coming up to
this<00:03:23.250> point<00:03:23.519> let<00:03:24.209> me<00:03:24.420> zoom<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.260> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
this point let me zoom it in just a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.840 
this point let me zoom it in just a
little<00:03:25.680> like<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:27.170> I'm<00:03:28.170> going<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.850> move

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
little like that I'm going to move

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.039 
little like that I'm going to move
forward<00:03:30.420> here<00:03:30.989> even<00:03:31.320> more<00:03:31.350> at<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.040> next<00:03:32.400> one

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
forward here even more at the next one

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.550 
forward here even more at the next one
and<00:03:34.760> then<00:03:35.760> let's<00:03:36.060> say<00:03:36.329> for<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.630> ending<00:03:37.049> will

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
and then let's say for the ending will

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.289 
and then let's say for the ending will
pull<00:03:37.860> off<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:38.700> we're<00:03:38.940> going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.120> i'm

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
pull off of it so we're going to i'm

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.920 
pull off of it so we're going to i'm
just<00:03:39.480> going<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.660> click<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.170> drag<00:03:40.470> backwards
