00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
a search and destroy for round when I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.520 
a search and destroy for round when I
think<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.219> was<00:00:11.340> just<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.580> clean<00:00:11.790> for<00:00:12.030> grounder

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
think it was just a clean for grounder

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.250 
think it was just a clean for grounder
I'm<00:00:13.530> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.250> using<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.849> kap-40<00:00:15.570> primary

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
I'm going to be using the kap-40 primary

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.750 
I'm going to be using the kap-40 primary
where<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.949> dsr-50<00:00:17.910> secondary<00:00:18.750> ah<00:00:19.010> I<00:00:20.010> jokingly

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
where the dsr-50 secondary ah I jokingly

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.759 
where the dsr-50 secondary ah I jokingly
say<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.210> but<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.779> know<00:00:21.960> i'm<00:00:22.109> using<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> sniper

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
say that but you know i'm using a sniper

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.609 
say that but you know i'm using a sniper
so<00:00:23.100> i'm<00:00:23.160> probably<00:00:23.519> acquired<00:00:24.439> most<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
so i'm probably acquired most of the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.630 
so i'm probably acquired most of the
killers<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:25.949> probably<00:00:26.189> gonna<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
killers are probably gonna be with the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.560 
killers are probably gonna be with the
cap<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:28.340> that's<00:00:29.340> how<00:00:29.519> snipers<00:00:30.000> work<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.449> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
cap so that's how snipers work in this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.450 
cap so that's how snipers work in this
game<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:31.470> good<00:00:31.619> enough<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.949> hit<00:00:32.070> someone<00:00:32.340> with

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
game not good enough to hit someone with

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.760 
game not good enough to hit someone with
a<00:00:32.610> sniper<00:00:32.850> rifle<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.690> not<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> cap<00:00:34.170> instantly

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
I mean Resident Evil 2 was number one

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
I mean Resident Evil 2 was number one
number<00:01:31.770> two<00:01:31.920> would<00:01:32.400> probably<00:01:32.460> be<00:01:33.210> final

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
number two would probably be final

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.289 
number two would probably be final
fantasy<00:01:34.350> 7<00:01:35.329> at<00:01:36.329> number<00:01:36.689> 3<00:01:37.020> i'm<00:01:38.090> kind<00:01:39.090> of

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
fantasy 7 at number 3 i'm kind of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
shifting between know it's cod4 its

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.670 
shifting between know it's cod4 its
can't<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.299> even<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.840> multiplayer

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
can't for and not even the multiplayer

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.510 
can't for and not even the multiplayer
in<00:01:46.920> cod4<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:48.329> actual<00:01:48.930> single<00:01:49.619> player<00:01:49.829> i<00:01:50.159> don't

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
in cod4 the actual single player i don't

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
in cod4 the actual single player i don't
know<00:01:50.610> why<00:01:50.820> i<00:01:50.850> love<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.570> game<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.049> much<00:01:52.229> i

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
know why i love that game so much i

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.639 
know why i love that game so much i
played<00:01:53.369> through<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.329> campaign<00:01:55.320> maybe

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
played through all the campaign maybe

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.789 
played through all the campaign maybe
like<00:01:56.390> nine<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.509> ten<00:01:57.840> times<00:01:58.170> which<00:01:58.770> is

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
like nine or ten times which is

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
like nine or ten times which is
ridiculous<00:01:59.610> for<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.850> first<00:02:00.329> person<00:02:00.570> shooter

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
ridiculous for a first person shooter

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.639 
ridiculous for a first person shooter
campaign<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.960> those<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.259> my<00:02:04.350> top<00:02:04.590> three
