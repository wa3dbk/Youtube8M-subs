00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
using an ax and a knife maybe you can

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
using an ax and a knife maybe you can
use<00:01:04.500> two<00:01:04.799> different<00:01:04.830> weapons<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> same

and also the use of the pistol in the
trailer<00:01:14.060> might<00:01:14.720> suggest<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:15.650> are<00:01:15.860> able
