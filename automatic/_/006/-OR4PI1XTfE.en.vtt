00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.609
 you are ready for the story children 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.750
 let's see what our friend tells us 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:13.450
 callus as it looks very interesting 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.190
 today's story is called fell the 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.190
 jungle explorer 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.630
 ah 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.820
 you want to help me in the garden that I 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.820
 the right shot will protect you from the sun 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.460
 I 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.770
 because gassing the plants for me fell 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.770
 I can the rosebush 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.010
 I think it's going to rain so it will not be 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.010
 necessary to water the flowers 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.660
 one 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.800
 two 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.970
 shut up 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.940
 since this 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.450
 and magical is called europe care is very 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.050
 fragile and that can be broken with 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.310
 ease but if it makes things 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.310
 they look bigger 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.570
 appear bigger 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.390
 I have an idea you want to play to be 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.270
 explorer of the jungle with the magnifying glass and 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.799
 how you play is the game 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.090
 see that we are two explorers of the 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.079
 jungle and we look at everything with the magnifying glass 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.079
 good 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:03.580
 the giant of the jungle was just right 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.580
 the witch looked like a huge monster 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.069
 It's as big as a bird 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.069
 It is gone 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.170
 and inside I think I can not go on and 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.550
 well I'm not afraid 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.490
 good luck I'll wait for you in the 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.920
 camp fell the explorer of the 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.490
 jungle went deeper and deeper into the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.490
 leafy jungle 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.880
 here and I thought that the gilbert cat 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.480
 CoruÃ±a like a fierce lion from the jungle of 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.850
 fear fell he was surprised when he heard 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.850
 the thunder and also got scared a little 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.030
 very strong I think are the fears of 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.950
 the jungle that send us a message 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.470
 drums 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.150
 it could well have been the drums of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.489
 the jungle but the safest thing is that it 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.260
 thunder and I was very excited with 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.989
 all the things that I had seen through 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.270
 of the magnifying glass and with all the adventures that 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.900
 he had imagined 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.900
 of sight 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.569
 and the jungle drums 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.080
 those drums send us a message 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.790
 if they say that if we do not hurry we 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.790
 let's look inside children
