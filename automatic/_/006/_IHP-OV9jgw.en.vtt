good a nice thing to test tractors on
see<00:03:16.370> what<00:03:16.520> they're<00:03:16.670> like

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
see what they're like

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.809 
see what they're like
mostly<00:03:18.470> maps<00:03:18.800> have<00:03:19.069> things<00:03:19.340> like<00:03:19.459> this<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:19.700> if

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
mostly maps have things like this and if

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.339 
mostly maps have things like this and if
your<00:03:19.940> truck<00:03:20.150> doesn't<00:03:20.330> perform<00:03:20.840> too<00:03:21.080> well<00:03:21.230> on

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
your truck doesn't perform too well on

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.920 
your truck doesn't perform too well on
this<00:03:22.209> it's<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.300> bit<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.569> shame<00:03:23.810> but<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:24.530> know

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
this it's a bit of a shame but you know

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.890 
this it's a bit of a shame but you know
these<00:03:26.930> are<00:03:26.989> easy<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:28.250> standard<00:03:28.670> map<00:03:28.900> so

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
these are easy and the standard map so

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.280 
these are easy and the standard map so
that<00:03:30.050> every<00:03:30.290> firm<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.650> fine<00:03:30.920> or<00:03:31.370> not<00:03:32.290> it's

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
that every firm is fine or not it's

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.119 
that every firm is fine or not it's
going<00:03:33.590> here<00:03:33.830> unfold<00:03:34.730> this

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.390 

Hiero<00:03:38.730> work

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.360 

so<00:03:43.970> eaters<00:03:44.239> are<00:03:44.390> fine

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
so eaters are fine

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.030 
so eaters are fine
so<00:03:46.940> looks<00:03:47.150> pretty<00:03:47.390> cool<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.870> think

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.030 

chumps<00:03:51.730> are<00:03:51.849> we<00:03:51.969> pity<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:53.590> could<00:03:53.769> just<00:03:53.980> be

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
chumps are we pity that could just be

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.150 
chumps are we pity that could just be
the<00:03:54.219> ground

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
the ground

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.070 
the ground
rather<00:03:56.730> than<00:03:56.910> attractor<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.690> can<00:03:57.810> see<00:03:57.960> on

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
rather than attractor you can see on

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.280 
rather than attractor you can see on
hydraulics<00:03:58.500> their<00:03:58.680> work<00:03:58.920> from<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.130> fine

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.370 

you<00:04:03.290> turn<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.800> product<00:04:04.280> they<00:04:04.400> hit<00:04:04.520> that<00:04:04.610> free

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
you turn a product they hit that free

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.630
