00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.960 

pretty<00:00:35.280> sweet<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.880> knives<00:00:36.620> they<00:00:37.620> are

pretty sweet little knives they are

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.610 
pretty sweet little knives they are
quite<00:00:38.970> a<00:00:39.030> bit<00:00:39.300> smaller<00:00:39.540> than<00:00:41.240> n<00:00:42.240> ezt<00:00:42.660> I've<00:00:43.200> ever

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
quite a bit smaller than n ezt I've ever

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.000 
quite a bit smaller than n ezt I've ever
seen<00:00:44.480> really<00:00:45.480> reminds<00:00:45.870> me<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.680> cross

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
seen really reminds me of a cross

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.150 
seen really reminds me of a cross
between<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:50.090> 560<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.960> 200<00:00:52.560> considering

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
between the 560 and the 200 considering

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.810 
between the 560 and the 200 considering
it's<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.970> a<00:00:54.000> frame<00:00:54.390> lock<00:00:54.660> has<00:00:55.530> more<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> 560

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it's not a frame lock has more of a 560

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's not a frame lock has more of a 560
pattern<00:00:57.240> but<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.630> a<00:00:57.660> frame<00:00:57.960> lock<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
pattern but it's not a frame lock and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.430 
pattern but it's not a frame lock and
it's<00:00:58.940> nowhere<00:00:59.940> near<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.450> size<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:03.440> 560

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
it's nowhere near the size of the 560

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.609 
it's nowhere near the size of the 560
but<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.770> just<00:01:04.949> seems<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.580> smaller<00:01:06.619> want

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
but it just seems to be a smaller want

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.340 
but it just seems to be a smaller want
to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.800> look<00:01:08.040> alike<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.390> liner<00:01:09.630> lock<00:01:09.930> so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to be look alike it's a liner lock so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.130 
to be look alike it's a liner lock so
that's<00:01:10.920> why<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.220> reminds<00:01:11.670> me<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:12.930> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that's why it reminds me a little bit of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.180 
that's why it reminds me a little bit of
the<00:01:13.320> zero<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.860> hundred<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> sort<00:01:15.510> of<00:01:15.600> has

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
the zero to hundred and it sort of has

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.340 
the zero to hundred and it sort of has
the<00:01:17.190> same<00:01:17.460> semi<00:01:17.850> pattern<00:01:18.270> morgue<00:01:18.540> more

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the same semi pattern morgue more

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
the same semi pattern morgue more
towards<00:01:19.710> those<00:01:19.890> 560<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:20.940> you<00:01:21.030> ask<00:01:21.210> me<00:01:21.650> but<00:01:23.000> for

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
towards those 560 if you ask me but for

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.540 
towards those 560 if you ask me but for
the<00:01:24.150> price<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.800> I<00:01:26.250> mean

compared to these ETS just because they

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
compared to these ETS just because they
