00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.590
 tell you I will give you my opinion about 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.050
 this game the pros and cons that 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.529
 has what good for what those who 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.530

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.350
 you are going to buy or not, then what 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.260
 leave some doubts good good 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:38.340
 set for this game I only have 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.800
 to tell you that they give you a note of a 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.930
 9.0 or 9.1 you know what it is 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.600
 that in a video game that's a 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.330
 barbarity the truth is that it deserves 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.710
 because graphically it 's amazing all 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.680
 the movements that the player has 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.170
 all the skills in the weapons that 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.200
 they have the damage they have there are weapons that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.350
 they have 700 damage that's a last 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.330
 because they tear directly you 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.670
 you can go up everywhere you can 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.260
 do as I said before thousand 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.780
 movements you get here in the 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.960
 game skills I will go up by 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.990
 here 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.020
 to get on top of me, you get in 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.610
 the skills and the skills I 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.590
 For example, I 've played a game but 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.750
 see what I still lack 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.140
 download me of skills by 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.979
 enable the let's say so set everything 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.720
 what he has after that would be in the range 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.030
 of survival after we have the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.890
 level of agility with a lot of 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:43.090
 agility is after we would have 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.500
 have removed later afterwards if we 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.450
 we put the power level here 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.880
 we would have the fixed power level 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.119
 all the things that we have is that there 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.979
 a lot of skills and apart from that 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.440
 Well, we have the designs what 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.900
 we can design a lot of things with 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.119
 the weapons in the inventory we have 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.040
 we can put a thousand thousand things in the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.090
 inventory now the missions that say 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.550
 or not the map is gigantic but it is that 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.260
 then, apart, not like I told you 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.390
 graphically that is that this game is 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.510
 one pass after 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.280
 with regards to what would be the the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.160
 reality of the game when we 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.510
 we are with the zombies look at the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.760
 real life 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.310
 when we are next to the zombies it 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.560
 supposes that we can not make noise the most 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.819
 minimal noise they are awakened or 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.510
 let's say what 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.909
 they hear the noise and go for the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.969
 noise, look, I just fell down 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:50.719
 ground and as you can see they all come for me 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:53.930
 The more noise there is, the more they go 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:57.109
 come as in the quotes between life 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.750
 real not as it would happen in these things not 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.210
 he just killed me in a blast the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.690
 unfortunate 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.330
 how real life quotes would be 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.450
 the more noise you make the more they will come 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.530
 while more zombies mate noisier 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.770
 does and more are going to come after you is that 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.230
 well there are zombies that have a 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.570
 Hardness has a devastating power 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.520
 not a part can you put in the water 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.220
 as you already know or get in the water 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.460
 be able to swim 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.440
 what is everything 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.410
 Now I have said all the good things about 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.510
 game is worth good I have one thing left 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.640
 say when it's night as you know 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:45.560
 at night the zombies have are more 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.870
 awake their hunting power let's say it 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.030
 A) Yes 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.150
 They are overcome 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.050
 that is, the level power rises 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.330
 his predator and then that's right 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.020
 that at the slightest noise they wake up 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.800
 they're after you they hui ling 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.930
 but now let's go next door 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.790
 negative of the game let's say it so good 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.190
 Well, as I see it 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.980
 as I see what is the negative side 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.100
 of the game I've spent the campaign in 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.549
 cooperative mode myself right now because a 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.260
 sometimes let's say it like this the game is revealed I 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.100
 right now I'm in the map part 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.980
 of the part of the game in a part of the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:36.280
 game that is the area of ​​the city 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.230
 that I could not have if it were not because 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.960
 I spent the game but as I have not 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.940
 past in cooperative right now I'm 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.630
 here but I tell you because it has been played 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.690
 the game if it could not be here but 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.880
 what a problem and with that to you 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.770
 pay you do it you pass it from the level 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.200
 that cooperatively so 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.840
 cooperative because if you pass it on 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.450
 cooperative mode when you give the 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.940
 map for your power to get into any 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.820
 side not in any area fix what 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.650
 it happens that the map looks dark 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.710
 you can not get in any area 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.020
 because everything else the part where 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.760
 you are in the dark and you say but 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.800
 how can this be if I have passed 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.440
 the game in cooperative mode because not what 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.140
 you have because when you pass everything in mode 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.210
 cooperative you do not have in mode 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.250
 individual everything you went through 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.650
 even if you have all the weapons though 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.170
 you have everything in the inventory you have it 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.840
 you have everything in the inventory but 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.960
 when you give him to look at the game in what 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.640
 level of history at what level are you from 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.900
 percentage of the story look at the 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:47.020
 upper right corner puts story 9 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.420
 % and you say but how can it be if 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.060
 I have passed if you have passed in mode 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.640
 cooperative and then in mode 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.220
 individual because it does not come to you that you have 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.290
 past one hundred percent that is the 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.300
 problem that I see this in the 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.920
 game and that's why I'm telling you 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.800
 because after ute minds on the map 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.590
 not to be able to go to any area not 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.780
 to be able to investigate any area and 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.700
 it does not leave you it does not leave you because it's supposed 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.670
 that you have passed 9% 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.280
 and there is something else that is worse 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.350
 still and that is the subject of the 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.220
 weapons when you spend it in mode 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:26.320
 individual if you have more advantages to the 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.450
 time to create new weapons of power 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.900
 improve them because they give you those 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:35.380
 skills or skills 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.690
 let's call him extra missions and skill and 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.610
 certain skills that they give you if you 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.830
 you pass it in individual mode but if you 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.050
 you pass it in cooperative mode to you 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.630
 get in individual mode because no 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.330
 you can improve those weapons as you could 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.630
 do it if you do it in individual mode 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.910
 in defining in defined accounts in 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.400
 defined since if you pass it on 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.410
 individual mode you will have many more 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.480
 advantages that doing it in mode 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.090
 cooperative than if in cooperative mode 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.270
 It is very good but I recommend you 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.250
 first you do it in individual mode and 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:13.240
 that's the only mistake that I see him 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:15.160
 this game for my big mistake because I do not 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.780
 It should be like this if you pass it on 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.360
 cooperative mode 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.420
 you should have everything enabled 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.850
 the game enabled and not that if you 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.860
 they happen in cooperative and you do not pass it on 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.470
 individual since when you get into 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.990
 individual match you do not have it is like 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.639
 if you had not passed these are the 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.370
 this is the only problem that I have 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:38.980
 the game is a great game 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:44.430
 has a thousand things to do has a 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:47.440
 a lot of hidden things of interest 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.450
 campaign a lot of missions the campaign 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.970
 it's amazing as I said before 

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:54.280
 graphically one pass in my 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.340
 recommendation well from my point of 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:01.330
 compared view what you can compare it 

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:03.790
 because it is a good investment is a 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.250
 I play here, you have my opinion about the 

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.620
 game and well you already know a good 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:11.610
 as always give you like to subscribe and 

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.610
 until the next video
