00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.580
 a new tutorial on how to do 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.430
 Hidden doors with slim blogs 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.529
 obviously and good what difference there is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.009
 between these hidden doors and the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.020
 normal that with these you arrays 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.180
 a lot of resources especially in 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.630
 pistons are worth here I have a normal one 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.340
 is worth 1 x 2 in and here I have a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.290
 expandable is worth it because these can be 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.210
 swing up 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.030
 using the same resources or 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.580
 practically the same thing is bad 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.560
 is that I will have to use a couple of blocks 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.990
 push them in each one of them and already 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.730
 was lens so we 're going to see how 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.680
 they work and good people like always 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.770
 let's start with our input that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.710
 will go here, and here we will start 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.200
 From our palanquita to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.300
 take us three blocks not in vowels 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.250
 here I use watermelons to change a 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.930
 little you already know obsidian ovens 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.630
 anything serves you that are not 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.759
 Wettable and we're going to put this on 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.409
 reston are worth three of reston and a 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.170
 repeater to 200 is practically done 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.200
 same as 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.110
 normal hidden door but here blocks 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.939
 does not push bless and here is simply 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.820
 you put a normal one that is not necessary and 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:26.000
 it's here we put our first piston 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.149
 sticky and here to see you wait that put 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.159
 this way you put another one seen a sticky 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:36.079
 here it's worth 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.850
 Here you will put on moto2 es line blogs 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.780
 is worth at least to make a two 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.180
 two and here the blocks that will cover the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.450
 door to the Iraqi door the marquito 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.980
 so perfect and it would already be working 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 with people how this works 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.500
 exactly fine let's go little by little 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.820
 so that you understand it, let's say that with 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.400
 this withdrawal of the tics 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
 although it is two tics the first one that goes 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.150
 to receive current is this voucher this 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.800
 harassment piston as it is here and 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.860
 as received is here because it does not 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.410
 affects are worth and then how does it 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.340
 first this one next to the s line blogs 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.680
 that there are two will drag these blocks and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.930
 also the piston this is very important 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.230
 that remains in the piston since what 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.080
 will push here where if they are installing 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.020
 current and will be extended when it reaches 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.820
 is therefore the order to wait for 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.210
 see if you can see it right here we go 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.230
 to put the lever here 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.690
 you see that when it reaches and extends 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.450
 perfect and to return to the position 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.640
 that was simply stop receiving 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.370
 point here and you see and let yourself be extended 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.870
 they are worth and then the current arrives here 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.300
 who collects it 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.820
 without more 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.980
 well perfect and this the country expand 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.290
 everything you want is worth everything 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.980
 that you want not because a piston only 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.500
 can push 12 blocks worth but what 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.880
 you can expand quite a lot I do not know until 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.770
 where exactly are we going to try 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.350
 it seems to me that this is the 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.110
 limit that effectively here no longer what 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.470
 you can use how many blocks are 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.980
 are 1 2 3 4 and 5 is not bad for a 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.870
 door just neither resources well the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.150
 theme is that there are now a lot of 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.530
 pistons in this design in the normal 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.950
 from 1 by 2 the arrays 4 pistons already 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.330
 which is the design are normal would be like that 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:40.370
 well like that and so a bunch of pistons 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.780
 ok and in this or 6 13 pistons is worth 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.040
 I think it's really worth it 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.140
 do it like this 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.520
 so I hope you liked this 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.350
 tutorial 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.860
 see you in the next episode people 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.860
 bye
