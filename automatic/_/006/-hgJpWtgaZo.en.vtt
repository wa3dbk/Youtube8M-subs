about<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.530> lot<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.920> free<00:03:17.220> radicals<00:03:17.850> okay<00:03:18.540> so

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
about a lot of free radicals okay so

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.210 
about a lot of free radicals okay so
you're<00:03:19.440> as<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.739> bury<00:03:20.160> which<00:03:20.700> has<00:03:22.190> potentially<00:03:23.190> a

you're as I bury which has potentially a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.540 
you're as I bury which has potentially a
lot<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.670> component<00:03:24.300> not<00:03:24.540> only<00:03:24.900> does<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.080> have

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
lot of component not only does it have

lot of component not only does it have
vitamin<00:03:26.550> B<00:03:26.700> complex<00:03:27.230> okay

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
vitamin B complex okay

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.940 
vitamin B complex okay
it<00:03:28.680> has<00:03:28.920> also<00:03:29.510> phytochemicals<00:03:30.510> okay<00:03:31.440> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
it has also phytochemicals okay the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.270 
it has also phytochemicals okay the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
the flavonoids and your phytochemicals

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.330 
the flavonoids and your phytochemicals
okay<00:04:31.280> this<00:04:31.790> one<00:04:32.260> stimulates<00:04:33.260> your<00:04:33.470> auto<00:04:33.710> foggy

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
okay this one stimulates your auto foggy

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.420 
okay this one stimulates your auto foggy
the<00:04:35.180> auto<00:04:35.360> foggy<00:04:35.720> effect<00:04:36.200> is<00:04:36.380> were<00:04:36.590> in<00:04:36.800> your

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
the auto foggy effect is were in your

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.290 
the auto foggy effect is were in your
brain<00:04:38.300> cells<00:04:38.920> starts<00:04:39.920> to<00:04:40.310> eliminate<00:04:41.030> your

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
brain cells starts to eliminate your

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.370 
brain cells starts to eliminate your
toxins<00:04:42.220> okay<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:43.940> your<00:04:44.120> phytochemicals<00:04:45.050> and

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
toxins okay so your phytochemicals and

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.730 
toxins okay so your phytochemicals and
your<00:04:45.800> flavonoids<00:04:46.460> will<00:04:47.300> stimulate<00:04:47.720> your<00:04:48.440> auto

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
your flavonoids will stimulate your auto

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.000 
your flavonoids will stimulate your auto
foggy<00:04:49.340> effect<00:04:49.970> okay<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:51.260> these<00:04:51.470> are<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.800> ones

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
foggy effect okay so these are the ones

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.060 
foggy effect okay so these are the ones
that<00:04:52.250> will<00:04:52.790> try<00:04:53.630> to<00:04:53.660> stimulate<00:04:54.590> your<00:04:54.800> brain

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
that will try to stimulate your brain

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.380 
that will try to stimulate your brain
cells<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:56.540> destroy<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.350> toxins<00:04:57.950> in<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:59.150> brain

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
cells to destroy the toxins in the brain

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.530 
cells to destroy the toxins in the brain
okay<00:05:00.200> this<00:05:00.980> is<00:05:01.130> created<00:05:01.700> by<00:05:01.910> when<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.330> have

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
okay this is created by when you have

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.250 
okay this is created by when you have
mental<00:05:03.050> stress<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:04.400> course<00:05:05.330> due<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:06.110> your

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
mental stress of course due to your

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.050 
mental stress of course due to your
oxidative<00:05:06.950> stress<00:05:07.160> meaning<00:05:07.670> over

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
oxidative stress meaning over

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.770 
oxidative stress meaning over
utilization<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:09.020> your<00:05:09.080> oxygen<00:05:09.760> okay<00:05:10.760> so<00:05:11.390> as

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
utilization of your oxygen okay so as

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.160 
utilization of your oxygen okay so as
you<00:05:12.230> take<00:05:12.560> in<00:05:12.800> your<00:05:13.160> acai<00:05:13.580> berry<00:05:14.000> there<00:05:14.870> is

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
you take in your acai berry there is

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.850 
you take in your acai berry there is
enough<00:05:15.950> oxygen<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:16.670> supply<00:05:17.330> your<00:05:17.630> blue<00:05:18.020> brain

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
enough oxygen to supply your blue brain

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.060 
enough oxygen to supply your blue brain
vascular<00:05:19.610> system<00:05:20.180> then<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:21.050> stress<00:05:21.470> will<00:05:21.830> be

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
vascular system then the stress will be

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.820 
vascular system then the stress will be
diminished
