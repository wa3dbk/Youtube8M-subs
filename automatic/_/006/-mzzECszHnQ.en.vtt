00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:13.400
 I would like to adjust the light on 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.260
 peugeot 307 2005 release 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 the fact is that the dipped beam shines very 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.880
 low and would like it a little bit 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.430
 raise because when switching from 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.980
 far to near well almost 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.160
 several meters only visible from the front and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.779
 very problematic when oncoming 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.559
 movement goes and switch to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.170
 it's very hard to tell where 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.600
 there are bumps in the road which is better which one 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.610
 the best trajectory to choose in our country 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.309
 this is relevant 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.660
 let's try how to do it 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.660
 and what will come of it 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.870
 up and down adjustment 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.170
 like that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.720
 screws this screw it goes a little bit with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.549
 gear I do not know if you can not see visible 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.890
 gearbox is the left headlight is not important 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:19.979
 the main thing is how to adjust them 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.080
 so that the light is not really 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.320
 was light as needed where needed 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.900
 and there was no such that if left at night 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 there is no horror to make out anything and then what 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.840
 do let's try what i suggest 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:44.030
 how is it I think is right 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:47.850
 adjust of course there is 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.890
 electronic headlight adjustment and at this 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.770
 the moment she stands at the top 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.829
 position then position 0 where 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.189
 couples should shine normally but they 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:03.780
 the light is very close I certainly donâ€™t want 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.149
 blind cars but here he is a little bit 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.720
 need to raise because practically 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.270
 you can see a few meters and no longer 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.010
 make out what's on as I 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.260
 I want to adjust them, that is, I don't want 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.860
 on regulate so then you can't 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.770
 it was to figure out what to do with it what am i 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.620
 I want to try here we have a drawing 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.349
 for as not suit me 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.349
 stain that is the plane itself from the thing 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.170
 lighting left shines below no one 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.510
 Blinding is fine but you need to raise a little 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.030
 what i want to do here we have me 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.150
 drove somewhere at a distance of half a meter 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.640
 meter lapel want now 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.750
 to outline 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.650
 this drawing is in the zero position that is 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.650
 I'll try now 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:14.030
 I lowered the headlights 1 division below and 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.460
 now also outline the way and now we 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.570
 there are two patterns in the first and in zero 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.030
 position and now i'm on position 1 them 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.210
 I will correct as for the position that is 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:35.680
 position to 1 I will correct how they 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:39.730
 used to shine on position 0 so 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.730
 hexagon and try 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.090
 Well, somewhere like this 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:12.290
 and try this second thing there 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:16.209
 a screwdriver I wanted to open raise 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.209
 up and then clockwise 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.800
 so now we are from the first position 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.750
 raised 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.840
 headlights as they were at zero 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.840
 position 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.580
 what is it for us long 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:53.310
 the fact that we put the position 0 and voila all 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.310
 as it should be 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.310
 and now there is something not like it 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.250
 if someone headlights will blind them 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.680
 you can always omit the position of the day then 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.800
 have back what they used to be 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.230
 position 0 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.230
 thanks to all who watched 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.230
 is happy
