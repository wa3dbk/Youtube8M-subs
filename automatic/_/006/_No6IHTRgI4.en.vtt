00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello you're lying today we get 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.750
 found for a new tutorial in 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.360
 partnership with pandore boutique 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.290
 to make this package with an effect 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 crackled I will first make some 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.370
 rectangles of transparent paste and I 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.680
 will come masters of the sheet 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.450
 money so simply with the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.800
 finger I'm going to come applied on 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.800
 the entire rectangles 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.170
 Then I will come to use 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.950
 felts and alcohol of two shades 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.200
 different 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.870
 but you can also use 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.370
 launch alcohol in the standard format and 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.840
 I will come to apply it on 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.840
 the entire date 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.300
 i will then passed united rectangle 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.970
 in the pasta machine to a notch 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.710
 end that the thickness of my paw 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.710
 what will give me the crackle effect 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.800
 and I will come next spread out a 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.160
 really the most transparent plate 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.160
 fine possible 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.230
 I will come then take some 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.110
 aluminum foil and I'm going 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.940
 start circling over the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.380
 first paste rectangle with effect 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.330
 cracked so I read on purpose to 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.910
 upside down so that the scoundrels him 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.070
 spring this of course the top I 'm going 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.670
 come roll a little bit to clear 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.470
 the demarcation and finished the spikes 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.690
 to be able to put on the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.520
 up-to- date connector and jory tuba and I 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.250
 will come and do the same thing 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.880
 the other side of the connector with the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.680
 second quarter and pasta 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.320
 that's what it should give you next 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.350
 the but come cut cleanly the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.289
 mogwai and tips and I can 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.390
 switch to cooking so after cooking 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.030
 I put the creation directly into 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.080
 the very cold water is to accentuate 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.300
 then transparency with aluminum 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.390
 I will come to form a ring I will 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.700
 simply mount a chain with 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.160
 bruce that your I go to my creation 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.070
 and that's the way the terminals are this 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.840
 who their nights is carried I hope 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.470
 that you will have liked it and claim it at 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.470
