the<00:02:05.040> game<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.520> coming<00:02:05.610> fast<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.090> him<00:02:06.180> right<00:02:06.330> now

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the game is coming fast to him right now

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.900 
the game is coming fast to him right now
so<00:02:06.630> he's<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.080> fast<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.560> offense

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
so he's going a little fast on offense

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.859 
so he's going a little fast on offense
but<00:02:08.910> he's<00:02:09.000> pretty<00:02:09.090> difference<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.660> stuff

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
but he's pretty difference of stuff

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.180 
but he's pretty difference of stuff
because<00:02:10.140> again<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.590> want<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> defensive

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
because again we want to be a defensive

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.460 
because again we want to be a defensive
first<00:02:11.340> team<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.880> once<00:02:12.810> he<00:02:12.870> learns<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.410> he

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
first team and once he learns I think he

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.600 
first team and once he learns I think he
could<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:13.620> outstanding<00:02:13.890> defender<00:02:14.370> too

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
could be outstanding defender too

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.550 
could be outstanding defender too
because<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.450> us<00:02:15.540> lengthen<00:02:15.930> his<00:02:16.020> athleticism

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
because of us lengthen his athleticism

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.680 
because of us lengthen his athleticism
but<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.580> know<00:02:17.670> he<00:02:17.790> works<00:02:18.000> hard<00:02:18.239> same<00:02:18.540> thing

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
