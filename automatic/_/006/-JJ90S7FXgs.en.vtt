00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
think it's bad girl um this this is a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.229 
think it's bad girl um this this is a
weird<00:00:59.850> series<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.629> talk<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.140> feel<00:01:01.829> like

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
weird series to talk about I feel like

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.160 
weird series to talk about I feel like
everything<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> say<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
everything I have to say about the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.219 
everything I have to say about the
series<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:06.119> saying<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.080> was

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
series I would not be saying if it was

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.950 
series I would not be saying if it was
written<00:01:07.350> by<00:01:07.500> Scott<00:01:07.710> Snyder<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:09.450> series<00:01:09.840> is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
written by Scott Snyder this series is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.950 
written by Scott Snyder this series is
kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.560> bland<00:01:10.979> um<00:01:11.810> there's<00:01:12.810> some

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
kind of bland um there's some

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
kind of bland um there's some
interesting<00:01:13.170> ideas<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> most<00:01:14.189> part

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
interesting ideas but for the most part

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
interesting ideas but for the most part
I<00:01:14.460> think<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.000> bland<00:01:15.439> particularly

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
I think it's kind of bland particularly

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.020 
I think it's kind of bland particularly
when<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.619> flashes<00:01:17.189> back<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> historical

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
when it flashes back to the historical

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
when it flashes back to the historical
stuff<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.479> Scott<00:01:18.960> Snyder<00:01:19.350> does<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.799> stuff

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
stuff and Scott Snyder does that stuff

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.160 
stuff and Scott Snyder does that stuff
so<00:01:20.369> well<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.330> wish<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.659> had<00:01:21.930> been

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
so well I really wish this had been

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.820 
so well I really wish this had been
written<00:01:22.380> by<00:01:22.619> him<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.119> it<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.530> because<00:01:25.530> i<00:01:25.619> read

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
written by him as it is because i read

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
written by him as it is because i read
this<00:01:25.979> series<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:27.240> i<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.930> under<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
this series because i was under the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
this series because i was under the
impression<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.770> would<00:01:29.070> inform<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
impression that this would inform the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.999 
impression that this would inform the
court<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.240> owls<00:01:30.329> story<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.829> doesn't<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.360> um

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
court of owls story it doesn't really um

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.609 
court of owls story it doesn't really um
I<00:01:35.009> think<00:01:35.820> CordeValle<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.810> opens<00:01:37.290> with

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
I think CordeValle was like opens with

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.920 
I think CordeValle was like opens with
like<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:39.320> reference<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.640> gates<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.720> that's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
like a reference to the gates but that's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.980 
like a reference to the gates but that's
kind<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.619> um<00:01:44.009> some<00:01:44.909> some<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> history

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
kind of it um some some of the history

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.710 
kind of it um some some of the history
is<00:01:46.170> actually<00:01:46.500> kind<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> interesting<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:48.420> for

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
is actually kind of interesting but for

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.670 
is actually kind of interesting but for
the<00:01:48.810> most<00:01:49.049> part<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:50.100> felt<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.590> felt<00:01:52.590> like

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the most part I I felt like I felt like

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.710 
the most part I I felt like I felt like
I<00:01:52.770> liked<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.159> story<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> actual<00:01:54.540> like

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
I liked the story but the actual like

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.530 
I liked the story but the actual like
nuts<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.200> bolts<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.710> all<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> big
