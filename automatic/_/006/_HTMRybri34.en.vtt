00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.920
 after successfully completing the 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.700
 first round of the world to the only energy 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.250
 of the sun 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.200
 the ms tûranor planetsolar the largest 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.940
 solar boat ever built was 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.369
 put in dry dock to undergo a 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.990
 important maintenance after more than 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.060
 two years of intense solar navigation 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.560
 we learned a lot from this ship 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.390
 is we wanted to optimize its 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.910
 performance in view of the challenges that 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.530
 expect it for 2013 one of 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.630
 main changes was the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.400
 change of the propulsion system the 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.470
 rudder has also been improved and 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.820
 bow thrusters now have 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.070
 more powerful electric motors 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.640
 so that the boat is faster and 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 more manoeuvrable 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.620
 the change of surface propellers 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.690
 is not an easy task it took 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.690
 totally disengaged from the engine the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.370
 existing axes and this in both 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.370
 cuts of the gigantic solar catamaran 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.079
 it is in the shipyard of Monaco 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.820
 navy at the ciotat in the south of the 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.770
 France that the boat was put in the hold 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 dry for several weeks the day 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.340
 from his exit from the water the stress could 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.049
 to read in the eyes of the workers of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.149
 responsible for maintenance and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.070
 the planet solar team 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.869
 indeed the ms tûranor planetsolar is 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.729
 a prototype and the dry method 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.890
 supporting the boat by its carrycot 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.330
 central has only been experimented 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.810
 only once during maintenance at 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.950
 singapore in autumn 2011 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.390
 this maintenance is also an opportunity 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.159
 to redo the layer of rust remover 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 the oil has stretched allowing 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.459
 limit the proliferation of algae and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.780
 shells on the floats so 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.780
 to keep the best performances 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.659
 the war has neither lloyd charles 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.069
 class organizations proceeded to 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.720
 the inspection of the boat ashore 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.610
 this must be the case twice every 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.709
 five years we took advantage of this 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.689
 exceptional grounding to improve 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.490
 also the cabins installed 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.080
 windshield wipers increase the capacity of 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.850
 water tanks strengthen the state dock 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.240
 mooring maintain the rails of the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240
 solar panels 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.070
 our ship serviced and optimize us 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.450
 can soon put it back in the water 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.700
 to undertake a great new 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.500
 adventure with the university of geneva 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.180
 the boat will embark a new crew 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.920
 and a team of scientists for 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.540
 study the gulf stream for the first 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.130
 times with a totally no boat 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.130
 pollutant allowing unprecedented measures
