00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.410
 they ask me people who do not play lol and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.170

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.039
 I want to make jungle it seems pretty 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.350
 fun and it's not for me it's one of the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.510
 funniest roles and it's the main thing 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.119
 I play everywhere with the jungle 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.940
 jungle and I'll explain how to do 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.739
 jungle if you are just new if 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.270
 they want to be very good jungles they want 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.910
 learn what we are going to do because 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 camp start by blue or by network to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.040
 who maite area who does not this video 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.930
 it can be quite enough 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.899
 easy and simple if you are already super 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 challengers master diamonds and ya 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.870
 they know everything about the jungle maybe this 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.610
 video is not as effective for you 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.039
 but maybe some tip that give them 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.899
 serve now because I'm playing with war 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.090
 with because in the end those who are going to see 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.760
 this video are people who want to know 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.890
 tips in the jungle that do not know it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.170
 that 's why I'm using warwick 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.820
 What can I recommend to you? 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 you are just going to learn to familiar 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 use a warwick 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.619
 teacher since they are incredibly 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.300
 easy they are very good and people 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.140
 fear even if you have a 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.330
 very powerful warwick are going to be the dread 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.280
 the terror of the bronzes all 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.500
 bronzes hate warwick because they do not know 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.360
 how to play against warwick and it's a 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.280
 super super easy champion that you can 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.590
 charge your team and leave bronze 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.780
 easily so that's why I'm going to 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.750
 bring in this video to warwick now very 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.979
 ok with what to start if your champion does not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.770
 has that way like in this case 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.390
 warwick let's start with the blues what 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 let's start with the camp 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.619
 blues and let's start with the frog 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.170
 when they appear then then you have to 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.149
 throw our smile to return the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.410
 poison that does that to us is something that 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.210
 we have to do we do not have to 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.009
 wait for us to already I like a room 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.170
 to throw the smile no no no now what 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.119
 they go to see and I start to give and then later 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.550
 she puts them in or as they can see in a 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.200
 poison symbol in his head they see it 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.329
 is the little symbol of how those little balls 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.560
 are ready that brings is that I already 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.020
 I am returning the poison 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.670
 that is already doing to me so that you 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.099
 I bring war with also because it's a 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.260
 champion who has too much assistant in 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.290
 the jungle and as it is I am with bots 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.500
 teaching him they are not taking many pots 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.260
 they do not have to worry about if they're going 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.599
 to kill there are songs like fidel six 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.580
 just like they are the kings of the jungle that 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.560
 they could spend all day in the jungle 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.870
 without hitting any time and having life 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.910
 completely full but there if not 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.280
 I recommend phillips ticks because 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.680
 you have tics and it's quite difficult and if 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.870
 you do not know how to use it can your team 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.480
 lose because you're practically from 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.880
 role a bit in the early game and in the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.739
 mid game but if you do not know how to use you can 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.750
 loading incredible games is one of the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.090
 best jungles but in short when 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.700
 and do all pass frog then 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.069
 let's come here to the little wolves and here 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.319
 let's focus on the grand hotel 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.819
 such wifi because here we focus on 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.670
 the big guy and again I do not know 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.680
 we focus on your digits 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.510
 and when we have the smile here 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.970
 prepared again in the stockings of 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.010
 charge let's come here to the logos and 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.780
 here is something I want to teach you that 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.670
 is a tip that not many know or much 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.950
 people know and lose too much life 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.140
 doing these papagallos have to 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.989
 focus focus forgiveness on all three 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.910
 little ones never never ever focus 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.800
 in the mother hen but I say the 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.569
 hen the parrots so let's go to 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.970
 We are going to give it to the kids 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.739
 there we are going to do the laps to have 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.750
 more speed also depends a lot if 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.090
 they know how to use their champion but always 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.920
 always focusing on the little ones and 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.989
 Now we can give the hen 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.790
 to the mother hen here I recommend them 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.799
 keep the enamel until now 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.319
 they think they're going to kill her to give them 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.090
 longer the group then it is here 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.330
 is ready and what needs to be done now 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.980
 it's quite up to you if you see 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.510
 that in your game for example here you can 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.549
 hook very easy to gray because it is 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.319
 run here can not launch bot 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.450
 because it is not supported at all they will have to 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.760
 enter by line and waste time or 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.580
 they could help you half spend the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.930
 flash is one thing they could do for 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.000
 example that I will not take the trapote and 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.040
 how do I have the smile of the parrots 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.980
 here there are no wards so I'm going to 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.840
 run with this wey and to spend the 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.690
 flash but since here is waterway it's not going to 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.060
 flash 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.860
 very well and now we're going with the part of the 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.980
 challenge of the champions who do not use mana 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.020
 as ' law without avenging rex there is that in 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.090
 this case show it I'm going to start 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.340
 by the golden always by the golems 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.800
 just as the frog let 's kill them 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.900
 then later to give to have the bufo 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.630
 that gives us that is was the group of 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.060
 this thing little by little is that we're going to 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.490
 study every five basic we're going to 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.810
 study the eyes monsters only 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.240
 serve the monsters 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.100
 do not believe that you will serve champions not 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.510
 no no no no no do not say what I 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.100
 I told them it would be with songs if 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.800
 they never studied them and killed them 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.110
 so we usually do it here 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.960
 tip is that your friends help you to 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.270
 that have the following title loaded 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.990
 then they come here by network but good 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.180
 how the bots here does not help 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.670
 after this here if there is something that 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.500
 change in the jungle as we are not here 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.810
 warwick we do not have an incredible livelihood 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.180
 we do not have to try a boat and here 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.550
 when we have about 400 lives 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.060
 fight the challenge in this case I'm going to 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.540
 do 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.150
 see that I'm going to hit 9 back and 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.940
 do not hit me and that's it, that's a guy like 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.950
 the blue as I told them of the 5 and 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.020
 Now the only thing that needs to be done is in 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.910
 what enamel is loaded here are already 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.220
 is going to load because nobody helps me 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.960
 but when your friends help you they go to 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.030
 take a while to download the smile because 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.420
 they do it too fast we come to 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.550
 that the little wolves here does not matter how 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.110
 warwick of forgiveness with that of the 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.690
 parrots here you have to give him then 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.100
 then the big mayoral here does not matter 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:02.110
 that if they kill the little ones first 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.910
 they are less well although it also depends 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.220
 a lot if you know a lot about the people in your 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.110
 song for example with rex there's that 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.670
 every five seconds you can go back to 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.310
 lift the same 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.630
 and when you get on the floor when you do not but 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.400
 anyway after this is on the route 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.470
 of network we come here again for the 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.350
 for cocks take off the kids 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.500
 we focus on the little ones needed to 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.900
 another where are these five artists and 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.790
 then we can give it to this without any 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.680
 problem you know you can pay it later 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:33.670
 then export it to the end however 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.560
 after this, we recharged ourselves like this 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.330
 of simple and easy we finish the route 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.430
 we also buy what we need in 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.590
 this case of this against ex ai and ready 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.990
 that's going to be all for the challenge 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.750
 and tell me if you want more tips I can 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.820
 teach them more tips of simple things 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.320
 quick things I like so much Lolas 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.570
 I want to start uploading it to my channel 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.250
 and I hope with this jungle guide 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.110
 has served to start doing 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.250
 jungle I am talents but I have them 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.940
 liked the video and see you in the 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.940
 next video
