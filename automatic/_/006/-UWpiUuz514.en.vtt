00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
of it the number one complaint is that

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.589 
of it the number one complaint is that
just<00:00:13.589> seems<00:00:13.830> like<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.129> longer<00:00:14.879> version<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.450> an

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
just seems like a longer version of an

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.170 
just seems like a longer version of an
episode<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.860> duck<00:00:17.010> tales<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.550> kind<00:00:18.000> of

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
episode but with duck tales it kind of

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.360 
episode but with duck tales it kind of
makes<00:00:18.450> sense<00:00:18.780> because<00:00:19.050> every<00:00:19.710> episode<00:00:20.190> was

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 
makes sense because every episode was

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.820 
makes sense because every episode was
kind<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.940> mini<00:00:21.210> movie<00:00:21.690> so<00:00:22.230> why<00:00:22.650> not

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
kind of like a mini movie so why not

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.680

make<00:00:23.010> an<00:00:23.100> actual<00:00:23.310> movie<00:00:23.640> out<00:00:23.790> of<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.030> in<00:00:24.510> this

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
make an actual movie out of it in this

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.630

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
