00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.830
 Good day, I want you today 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.780
 talk about how to improve quality 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.660
 sound during a telephone conversation on 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.150
 smartphone nexus 5 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.840
 have this smartphone in every sense 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.320
 wonderful few flaws 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.350
 some of which are plaguing one of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.720
 them it is incorrect work shumodava so 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.730
 called namely 2 microphone 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.880
 noise canceller 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.059
 in theory, he should cut the outsider 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.879
 noise and especially when you are 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.030
 noisy environment to do 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.460
 your voice is clearer and clearer to 2 interlocutor 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.379
 In general, however, in fact it is not 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.149
 correct work leads to the fact that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.730
 the other person hears you like you 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.120
 put a tin bucket on your head or 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.289
 talk out of the water and around you 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.559
 happens 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:01.440
 incomprehensible nature gurgle or just 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 2 which annoys your buddy 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.890
 therefore you because constantly 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.530
 I complain about this for a long time I was looking like 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.430
 problem finally solved at the end 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.290
 video I'll show you the source now 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.220
 let's move on to how everyone 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.950
 fix namely how to disable the second 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.040
 Noise-canceling microphone 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 that he did not work and did not work and did not 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.110
 tried in vain 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.880
 during a telephone conversation as soon as 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 I will make a reservation that for this the phone should 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.600
 to be ruled by regret if you donâ€™t 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.090
 provided not accessed in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.820
 root subfolder and all functions 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.369
 phone in admin mode 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.460
 I think that you can not this problem 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.930
 eliminate so easy however if your 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.329
 the phone has root access then go 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.180
 I use the solution to 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.060
 get to this function by the application 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.460
 rom toolbox pro where in subsection 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.340
 performance there editor will pop it 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.090
 the file actually contains 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.310
 some settings by changing which 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.709
 can seriously affect the work 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.670
 smartphone 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:24.239
 we are interested in the line persis tariffs 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.060
 learn a cop i.e. preserve density 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.730
 audio stream probably just 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.549
 implied works noise which 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.470
 must save audio stream 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:41.220
 after all , your voice was rolled in 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.220
 compared to the other noises for 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.150
 your buddy does not work correctly 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.640
 we have this theme from the clip than me 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.040
 already standing in the floor what is the function of the beam 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.150
 you will look like this 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.150
 way this line like this you again 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.599
 still click choose falls talk about 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.959
 Kay 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:07.410
 all now you have a persist audio flash drive from 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.519
 schools function disabled after that you 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.140
 you just need just 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.450
 reboot your mobile device 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 in order for the changes to take effect 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.260
 Before this file, in principle, you can 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.829
 get in a very simple way otherwise 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.859
 go to the root directory of the system 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.470
 but this very same file will be sampled 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:32.400
 open it with any text editor 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.549
 find the line we need here 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.040
 she stopped reference troops we already have 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.889
 worth it because we changed everything 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.590
 primer demand if we don't 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.220
 did was shod winning beaks should have been 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.660
 rewrite boss save exit 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:54.000
 reboot and voila after that nobody 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.299
 will no longer hear you as if you are 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.250
 put on a bucket and any other 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.109
 extraneous noise incomprehensible nature 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.790
 if you will be in the subway 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.939
 the person will hear 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.519
 the hum of a subway train as it is well or 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:11.790
 almost true if you walk along 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.790
 expensive than listen vehicle wherein 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.430
 you will hear it as clearly Russ 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.680
 a stranger will be added to your voice 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.820
 noise as if you were talking 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.699
 alongside the co-author of the motorway 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.330
 heard cars well of course mean 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:36.690
 let me show you where I took all 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:39.320
