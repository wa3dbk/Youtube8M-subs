00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the Golden Eagle allows you to work a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.740 
the Golden Eagle allows you to work a
hundred<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.079> fifty<00:01:40.439> percent<00:01:40.829> faster<00:01:41.750> use

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
hundred and fifty percent faster use

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.440 
hundred and fifty percent faster use
one-third<00:01:43.439> less<00:01:43.649> fuel<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.369> one-third<00:01:45.180> less

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
one-third less fuel and one-third less

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.990 
one-third less fuel and one-third less
labor<00:01:45.950> best<00:01:46.950> part<00:01:47.219> about<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:47.609> me<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
labor best part about it for me is that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
labor best part about it for me is that
it's<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.539> simple<00:01:48.750> there's<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.590> few

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
it's really simple there's just a few

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.550 
it's really simple there's just a few
moving<00:01:50.130> parts<00:01:50.719> all<00:01:51.719> the<00:01:51.780> bearings<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.320> sealed

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
moving parts all the bearings are sealed

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.800 
moving parts all the bearings are sealed
so<00:01:52.829> there's<00:01:52.979> nothing<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.399> grease<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.420> take<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
so there's nothing to grease just take a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.319 
so there's nothing to grease just take a
quick<00:01:55.079> once-over<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.039> morning<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> make

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
quick once-over in the morning and make

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.520 
quick once-over in the morning and make
sure<00:01:57.479> everything<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:57.929> in<00:01:58.109> proper<00:01:58.289> working

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
sure everything is in proper working

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.010 
sure everything is in proper working
order<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.429> you<00:02:00.090> know<00:02:00.179> go<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> field<00:02:00.750> set

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
order and you know go to the field set

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.929 
order and you know go to the field set
it<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.409> go<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.340> quick<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it up and go it's really quick and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:03.919 
it up and go it's really quick and
simple<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.450> set<00:02:03.689> up

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
simple to set up

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.230 
simple to set up
minimal<00:02:04.530> hydraulics<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.670> turn<00:02:05.909> them<00:02:06.090> on

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
minimal hydraulics you just turn them on

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
minimal hydraulics you just turn them on
when<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> want<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.200> move<00:02:07.439> something<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.250> then

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
when you want to move something and then

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.160 
when you want to move something and then
you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.729> turn<00:02:08.910> them<00:02:09.060> off

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
you can turn them off

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.660 
you can turn them off
so<00:02:10.590> you're<00:02:10.710> not<00:02:10.830> constantly<00:02:11.070> flowing

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so you're not constantly flowing

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.480 
so you're not constantly flowing
