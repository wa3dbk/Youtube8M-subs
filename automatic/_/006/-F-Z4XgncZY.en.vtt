00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
just cobbler keeps it together this is

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.729 
just cobbler keeps it together this is
the<00:00:45.110> pressure<00:00:48.040> for<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.130> other<00:00:49.250> side<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:51.290> the

the pressure for the other side the the
book<00:00:52.489> tells<00:00:52.850> people<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:54.530> had<00:00:54.710> these<00:00:54.890> bolts

book tells people you had these bolts

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.650 
book tells people you had these bolts
they<00:00:56.450> are<00:00:56.510> all<00:00:56.989> centered<00:00:58.180> these<00:00:59.180> bolts<00:00:59.540> are

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
they are all centered these bolts are

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.840 
they are all centered these bolts are
not<00:00:59.960> out<00:01:00.200> centered<00:01:00.620> they<00:01:00.950> are<00:01:01.100> perfect<00:01:01.700> in

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
not out centered they are perfect in

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.819 
not out centered they are perfect in
centers<00:01:02.300> or<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.660> old<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.230> distance<00:01:03.649> between

the<00:01:04.100> bolts<00:01:04.370> are<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.580> same<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:06.080> only

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
the bolts are the same and the only

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.160 
the bolts are the same and the only
thing<00:01:06.470> you<00:01:06.590> have<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.770> watch<00:01:07.240> this<00:01:08.240> grease<00:01:08.570> pipe

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
thing you have to watch this grease pipe

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.670 
thing you have to watch this grease pipe
it<00:01:09.470> brings<00:01:10.130> grease<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.729> this<00:01:11.090> side<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.680> but

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
it brings grease to this side and but

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.860 
it brings grease to this side and but
then<00:01:12.830> there<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:13.729> no<00:01:13.909> place<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.450> go<00:01:14.659> for<00:01:14.810> the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
then there is no place to go for the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.710 
then there is no place to go for the
grease<00:01:15.049> in<00:01:15.200> here<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:16.460> has<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.790> go<00:01:16.940> around<00:01:17.540> it

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
grease in here so it has to go around it

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.630 
grease in here so it has to go around it
if<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:18.680> look<00:01:18.799> inside<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.400> machine<00:01:21.640> inside

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
if you look inside the machine inside

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.190 
if you look inside the machine inside
the<00:01:22.790> machine<00:01:23.150> I<00:01:23.330> don't<00:01:23.960> know<00:01:24.020> if<00:01:24.140> the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
the machine I don't know if the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.510 
the machine I don't know if the
flashlight<00:01:24.619> will<00:01:24.770> do<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.060> again<00:01:26.060> it's<00:01:26.450> inside

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
flashlight will do it again it's inside

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.510 
flashlight will do it again it's inside
there<00:01:28.520> is<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.729> little<00:01:29.090> notch<00:01:29.630> over<00:01:30.080> there<00:01:30.520> for

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
there is a little notch over there for

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.719 
there is a little notch over there for
the<00:01:31.640> grease<00:01:33.010> to<00:01:34.010> go<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:36.100> that's<00:01:37.100> what<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.400> grease

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
the grease to go so that's what a grease

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.539 
the grease to go so that's what a grease
has<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.119> go<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.630> might<00:01:39.049> as<00:01:39.110> well<00:01:39.200> just<00:01:39.380> get<00:01:40.369> two

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
has to go so might as well just get two

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.859 
has to go so might as well just get two
centers<00:01:40.939> in<00:01:41.060> there<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.540> don't<00:01:41.659> get

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
centers in there so you don't get

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.039 
centers in there so you don't get
confused<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:43.210> clean<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.240> as<00:01:44.509> good<00:01:44.720> as<00:01:44.840> possible

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
confused I clean it as good as possible

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.130 
confused I clean it as good as possible
on<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.530> inside<00:01:45.830> but<00:01:46.070> it's<00:01:46.790> mean<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:47.390> it's

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
on the inside but it's mean it's it's

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.450 
on the inside but it's mean it's it's
dirty<00:01:48.650> I<00:01:48.920> don't<00:01:49.460> mean<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.710> have<00:01:51.710> probably<00:01:51.979> dirt

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
dirty I don't mean I have probably dirt

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.210 
dirty I don't mean I have probably dirt
but<00:01:53.150> this<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.420> oil<00:01:53.659> greasy<00:01:54.290> stuff<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.950> cannot

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
but this is oil greasy stuff you cannot

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.929 
but this is oil greasy stuff you cannot
get<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> perfect<00:01:56.000> green<00:01:56.180> clean<00:01:56.900> it's<00:01:57.640> but<00:01:58.640> I

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
get a perfect green clean it's but I

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.050 
get a perfect green clean it's but I
think<00:01:59.119> it's<00:01:59.240> good<00:01:59.420> enough<00:01:59.450> I<00:02:00.490> will<00:02:01.490> put<00:02:01.970> it

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
think it's good enough I will put it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.289 
think it's good enough I will put it
back<00:02:02.210> together<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:03.400> managed<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.430> get<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.759> culture

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
back together I managed to get a culture

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.680 
back together I managed to get a culture
going<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:06.049> made<00:02:06.740> two<00:02:06.979> compressor<00:02:07.610> tools<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.179> will

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
going I made two compressor tools I will

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.400 
going I made two compressor tools I will
show<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.140> other<00:02:09.229> side<00:02:10.989> that's<00:02:11.989> one<00:02:12.319> of

show you the other side that's one of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.600 
show you the other side that's one of
the<00:02:12.500> compressor<00:02:12.980> tools

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
the compressor tools

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.600 
the compressor tools
that's<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.690> other<00:02:14.780> one<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:16.010> book<00:02:16.220> counts

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
that's the other one the book counts

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.800 
that's the other one the book counts
compressor<00:02:17.180> tools<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:18.400> didn't<00:02:19.400> have<00:02:19.430> him<00:02:19.850> so

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
compressor tools in I didn't have him so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.590 
compressor tools in I didn't have him so
I<00:02:20.840> meet<00:02:21.230> him<00:02:21.320> by<00:02:21.470> myself<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.330> inch
