have your OS on the SSD for quick boot

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.040 
on the SSD in order to play them quickly
I'd<00:00:52.409> suggest<00:00:52.890> using<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.339> 750<00:00:54.269> hard<00:00:54.479> drive<00:00:54.690> for

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I'd suggest using the 750 hard drive for

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.899 
I'd suggest using the 750 hard drive for
mainly<00:00:55.500> storage<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.159> then<00:00:56.250> maybe<00:00:56.460> even<00:00:56.670> get

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
mainly storage and then maybe even get

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.689 
mainly storage and then maybe even get
an<00:00:57.000> external<00:00:57.589> in<00:00:58.589> terms<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.070> price<00:00:59.370> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
an external in terms of price it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
an external in terms of price it's
really<00:01:00.089> well<00:01:00.210> priced<00:01:00.510> especially<00:01:01.140> due<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
really well priced especially due to the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.560 
really well priced especially due to the
size<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> internal<00:01:02.760> drive<00:01:03.000> which<00:01:03.299> makes

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
size of the internal drive which makes

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.899 
size of the internal drive which makes
it<00:01:03.780> well<00:01:03.960> worth<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.890> 12<00:01:05.159> gigabytes<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.670> RAM

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it well worth it the 12 gigabytes of RAM

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
it well worth it the 12 gigabytes of RAM
will<00:01:06.090> run<00:01:06.299> any<00:01:06.540> game<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.290> date<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
will run any game up to date and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.820 
will run any game up to date and
probably<00:01:08.159> within<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.520> next<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:09.030> years<00:01:09.270> at<00:01:09.840> at

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
probably within the next two years at at

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.430 
probably within the next two years at at
least<00:01:11.400> high<00:01:11.880> graphics<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.630> probably<00:01:12.960> ultra

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
least high graphics and probably ultra

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.920 
least high graphics and probably ultra
almost<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.460> graphics<00:01:14.909> card<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.420> handle<00:01:15.780> all

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
almost the graphics card can handle all

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.920 
almost the graphics card can handle all
games<00:01:16.290> current<00:01:16.830> gen<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.400> probably<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
games current gen and probably a lot of

games current gen and probably a lot of
next-gen<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.680> medium<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.340> high<00:01:20.550> graphics<00:01:20.820> I

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
next-gen at medium or high graphics I

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.980 
next-gen at medium or high graphics I
suggest<00:01:23.120> having<00:01:24.120> a<00:01:24.270> look<00:01:24.390> around<00:01:24.510> and
