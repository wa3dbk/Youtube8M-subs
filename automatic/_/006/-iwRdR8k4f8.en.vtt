bringing you a review of the earthling
super<00:00:11.370> glitter<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.480> decided<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> review

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
super glitter and decided to do a review

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.350 
super glitter and decided to do a review
on<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.070> board<00:00:14.370> because<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.790> not<00:00:14.940> very<00:00:15.089> well

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
on this board because it's not very well

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.029 
on this board because it's not very well
known<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.990> i<00:00:16.710> guess<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.160> should<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:19.490> so<00:00:22.039> this

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
known and i guess it should be so this

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.410 
known and i guess it should be so this
was<00:00:23.400> my<00:00:23.550> first<00:00:23.730> board<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.359> i<00:00:24.840> got<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:26.420> like

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
was my first board and i got it in like

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.720 
was my first board and i got it in like
march<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.920> now<00:00:29.420> late<00:00:32.690> May<00:00:33.690> yeah<00:00:34.320> um<00:00:34.730> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
march and it's now late May yeah um and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.780 
march and it's now late May yeah um and
so<00:00:36.860> I've<00:00:37.860> been<00:00:38.040> writing<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.640> while<00:00:38.760> now

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
so I've been writing it for a while now

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.780 
so I've been writing it for a while now
but<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.800> generally<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:41.610> nice

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
but I generally like it it's pretty nice

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.950 
but I generally like it it's pretty nice
board<00:00:42.320> but<00:00:43.320> one<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.890> its<00:00:44.040> major<00:00:44.219> defects<00:00:44.960> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
board but one of its major defects you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.569 
board but one of its major defects you
can<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.739> chipping<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.190> lot<00:00:47.370> right

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
can see this is chipping a lot right

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.389 
can see this is chipping a lot right
here<00:00:47.930> my<00:00:48.930> kick<00:00:49.170> tail<00:00:49.879> but<00:00:50.879> aside<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
here my kick tail but aside from that I

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.830 
here my kick tail but aside from that I
like<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.610> especially<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.149> first<00:00:54.300> board<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
like it especially the first board a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
like it especially the first board a
kind<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.289> big<00:00:56.930> kick<00:00:57.930> tail<00:00:58.250> except<00:00:59.250> problem<00:00:59.879> is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
kind of big kick tail except problem is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.760 
kind of big kick tail except problem is
doesn't<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.480> anything<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> front<00:01:01.230> fact

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
doesn't have anything on the front fact

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.100 
doesn't have anything on the front fact
the<00:01:01.890> trucks<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.309> extremely<00:01:02.850> close<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.930> those

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the trucks are extremely close to those

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710 
the trucks are extremely close to those
of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.350> board<00:01:04.939> actually<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.420> downhill

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
of the board actually I think a downhill

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.580 
of the board actually I think a downhill
board<00:01:07.250> but<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.170> used<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.439> all

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
board but it on it can be used for all

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.039 
board but it on it can be used for all
around<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.420> tricks<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.840> stuff

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
around I like it for tricks and stuff

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
around I like it for tricks and stuff
and<00:01:13.850> my<00:01:14.850> setup<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.560> have<00:01:17.270> Randall<00:01:18.270> 180

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and my setup I have Randall 180

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.190 
and my setup I have Randall 180
millimeter<00:01:19.380> trucks<00:01:23.299> okay

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
millimeter trucks okay

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.499 
millimeter trucks okay
and<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:27.090> these<00:01:27.240> trucks<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:29.329> are<00:01:30.329> pretty

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and I like these trucks they are pretty

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
and I like these trucks they are pretty
nice<00:01:30.719> but<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.259> don't<00:01:31.439> turn<00:01:31.619> very<00:01:31.950> well<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.880> my

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
nice but they don't turn very well in my

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.660 
nice but they don't turn very well in my
opinion<00:01:36.439> in<00:01:37.439> fact<00:01:37.649> my<00:01:37.890> wheels<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.310> coming<00:01:38.340> up

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
opinion in fact my wheels are coming up

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
opinion in fact my wheels are coming up
and<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:38.939> doing<00:01:39.179> this<00:01:39.380> they<00:01:40.380> don't<00:01:40.560> turn<00:01:40.710> very

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and I'm doing this they don't turn very

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.090 
and I'm doing this they don't turn very
well<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.659> but<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.929> guess<00:01:43.679> I<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.829> need<00:01:44.069> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
well at all but I guess I just need to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.309 
well at all but I guess I just need to
loosen<00:01:44.310> them<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.360> I've<00:01:45.569> got<00:01:45.720> my<00:01:45.750> tan<00:01:46.049> Tien

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
loosen them but I've got my tan Tien

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:53.029 
loosen them but I've got my tan Tien
coming<00:01:46.679> soon<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:50.719> 70<00:01:51.719> millimeter<00:01:52.140> 80

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
coming soon and I have 70 millimeter 80

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.830 
coming soon and I have 70 millimeter 80
I<00:01:53.429> know<00:01:54.380> 77a<00:01:57.770> hey<00:01:58.770> Becky<00:01:59.039> live<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.280> zigzags

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
I know 77a hey Becky live in zigzags

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
I know 77a hey Becky live in zigzags
which<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:01.049> fairly<00:02:01.229> nice<00:02:01.530> wheels<00:02:02.209> sup<00:02:03.209> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
which are fairly nice wheels sup the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.889 
which are fairly nice wheels sup the
fact<00:02:03.539> that<00:02:03.720> they're<00:02:03.990> extremely<00:02:04.729> soft<00:02:05.899> can't

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
fact that they're extremely soft can't

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.139 
fact that they're extremely soft can't
get<00:02:07.049> very<00:02:07.229> much<00:02:07.319> speed<00:02:07.590> off<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.770> them<00:02:08.099> well<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
get very much speed off of them well the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.460 
get very much speed off of them well the
minus<00:02:09.420> started<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> harden<00:02:10.049> a<00:02:10.110> little<00:02:10.349> bit

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
minus started to harden a little bit

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.160 
minus started to harden a little bit
which<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.679> nice<00:02:11.329> but<00:02:12.329> um<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:15.690> obviously

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
which is nice but um you obviously

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.680 
which is nice but um you obviously
cannot<00:02:16.410> slide<00:02:16.799> with<00:02:16.980> them<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.370> all<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:17.849> they

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
cannot slide with them at all and they

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.949 
cannot slide with them at all and they
get<00:02:18.840> scuffed<00:02:19.140> up<00:02:19.319> real<00:02:19.560> easily<00:02:20.569> like<00:02:21.569> if<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.930> a

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
get scuffed up real easily like if you a

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.410 
get scuffed up real easily like if you a
screw-up<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.739> shove<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.340> they<00:02:24.180> bolt

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
screw-up on a shove it is they bolt

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.850 
screw-up on a shove it is they bolt
slide<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.930> ground<00:02:25.170> those<00:02:25.319> get<00:02:25.560> stuck

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
slide on the ground those get stuck

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.009 
slide on the ground those get stuck
there<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.280> made<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.610> nice<00:02:26.880> black<00:02:27.480> mark<00:02:27.750> across

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
there and made a nice black mark across

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:35.330 
there and made a nice black mark across
it<00:02:28.579> but<00:02:29.579> um<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:32.540> my<00:02:33.540> bearings<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.319> like<00:02:34.980> he's

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
it but um I my bearings I like he's

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.920 
it but um I my bearings I like he's
really<00:02:35.639> terrible<00:02:36.600> like<00:02:37.940> DBS<00:02:38.940> abec<00:02:39.510> seven

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
really terrible like DBS abec seven

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.670 
really terrible like DBS abec seven
things<00:02:40.430> there's<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:45.170> that's<00:02:46.170> how<00:02:46.380> big<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
things there's like that's how big of a

89<00:03:56.079> inches<00:03:56.489> actions<00:03:57.489> kind<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.760> odd<00:03:57.909> could<00:03:58.209> be

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
89 inches actions kind of odd could be

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.030 
89 inches actions kind of odd could be
time<00:03:58.540> but<00:03:59.530> um<00:04:01.019> yeah<00:04:02.019> not<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.439> best<00:04:02.470> board<00:04:02.919> in

the world but uh oh I guess this one

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.110 
the world but uh oh I guess this one
doesn't<00:04:08.620> matter<00:04:08.769> that<00:04:08.859> much<00:04:09.010> but<00:04:09.790> I've<00:04:09.939> got
