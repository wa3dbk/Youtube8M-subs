00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
Smackdown and it wouldn't work we just

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080

wish<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.470> downloaded<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.310> firmware<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
wish I have downloaded the firmware you

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.089 
wish I have downloaded the firmware you
know<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:26.250> gigabyte<00:00:26.670> Cruiser<00:00:28.099> I've

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
know on this one gigabyte Cruiser I've

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.139 
know on this one gigabyte Cruiser I've
tried<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.670> before<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.480> failed<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.199> work

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
tried it before and it failed to work

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.880 
tried it before and it failed to work
perhaps<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:33.870> they<00:00:34.200> failed<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.680> tell

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
perhaps it's because they failed to tell

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
perhaps it's because they failed to tell
me<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> might<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.910> unzip<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.570> zip

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
me that I might have to unzip the zip

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.060 
me that I might have to unzip the zip
file<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:38.840> we're<00:00:39.840> gonna<00:00:39.930> put<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
file so we're gonna put this in the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.910 
file so we're gonna put this in the
service<00:00:41.600> thing<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.200> before<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.890> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
service thing but before we do that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.889 
service thing but before we do that
what's<00:00:44.520> your<00:00:44.670> what's<00:00:44.940> your<00:00:45.000> what's<00:00:45.450> cetera

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
what's your what's your what's cetera

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.920 
what's your what's your what's cetera
just<00:00:46.590> assume<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.730> make<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> big<00:00:48.570> mistake<00:00:48.920> menu

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930

then<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.079> go<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.289> software<00:00:53.160> update<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.670> say<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
then we go to software update I say to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.569 
then we go to software update I say to
you<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.510> money<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.899> insert<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.010> USB

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
memory device containing the software in

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.470 
memory device containing the software in
relationships<00:01:00.199> like<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.379> said<00:01:01.820> I've<00:01:02.820> had<00:01:02.879> the

on<00:04:12.350> weak<00:04:12.500> stations<00:04:13.070> uh<00:04:18.010> well<00:04:19.010> by<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.549> we

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
on weak stations uh well by that we

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:27.490 
on weak stations uh well by that we
can't<00:04:20.660> tell<00:04:23.230> so<00:04:24.230> I'm<00:04:24.380> gonna<00:04:24.500> do<00:04:25.930> isn't<00:04:26.930> gonna

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
rotator we're gonna slowly turn it till

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
rotator we're gonna slowly turn it till
it<00:04:35.750> doesn't<00:04:35.960> work<00:04:36.200> anymore

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
video when it got to this level it just

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.450 
video when it got to this level it just
quit<00:05:04.669> working<00:05:05.210> or<00:05:05.390> failed<00:05:05.750> all<00:05:05.990> together<00:05:06.460> and

quit working or failed all together and

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.219 
quit working or failed all together and
here<00:05:07.640> we<00:05:07.729> are<00:05:07.790> at<00:05:07.910> 34<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.690> it's<00:05:08.900> working

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
flawlessly the software update is

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.090 
flawlessly the software update is
working<00:05:16.450> let's<00:05:17.450> turn<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.500> more<00:05:18.680> out<00:05:18.890> of<00:05:18.919> what

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
working let's turn it more out of what

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.290 
working let's turn it more out of what
how<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.580> sync<00:05:20.090> here<00:05:21.820> okay<00:05:22.820> now<00:05:23.030> it's<00:05:23.210> starting

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
how to sync here okay now it's starting

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:33.340 
how to sync here okay now it's starting
to<00:05:23.570> screw<00:05:23.900> up<00:05:28.870> it<00:05:29.950> 33<00:05:30.950> which<00:05:31.250> on<00:05:32.240> most<00:05:32.570> TVs<00:05:33.080> is

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
to screw up it 33 which on most TVs is

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.750 
to screw up it 33 which on most TVs is
threshold<00:05:33.979> of<00:05:34.780> perfection<00:05:36.370> it's<00:05:37.370> still

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
threshold of perfection it's still

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.960 
threshold of perfection it's still
falling<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.270> little<00:05:38.720> bit<00:05:38.900> sure<00:05:39.580> let's<00:05:40.580> turn<00:05:40.820> it

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
falling a little bit sure let's turn it

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:48.550 
falling a little bit sure let's turn it
back<00:05:41.120> up<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.660> one<00:05:41.870> knotch<00:05:42.140> 34<00:05:47.140> okay<00:05:48.140> it's<00:05:48.320> still

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
back up to one knotch 34 okay it's still

00:05:48.560 --> 00:06:00.260 
back up to one knotch 34 okay it's still
a<00:05:48.590> lot

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.240 

it's<00:06:01.270> a<00:06:01.389> little<00:06:01.660> better

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:27.469 

ok<00:06:06.250> it's<00:06:06.460> still<00:06:06.750> flickering<00:06:07.750> under<00:06:08.550> 34<00:06:19.590> that's

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.089 

it's<00:06:28.479> definitely<00:06:28.960> better<00:06:29.139> I<00:06:29.470> mean<00:06:29.740> everyone

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
it's definitely better I mean everyone

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.499 
it's definitely better I mean everyone
so<00:06:30.310> I<00:06:30.340> see<00:06:30.820> stray<00:06:31.240> broken<00:06:31.750> pixel<00:06:32.710> or<00:06:33.509> broken

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
so I see stray broken pixel or broken

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.740 
so I see stray broken pixel or broken
tile<00:06:34.780> but<00:06:35.400> it<00:06:36.400> is<00:06:36.580> working<00:06:36.940> a<00:06:37.030> lot<00:06:37.180> better<00:06:37.479> than

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
tile but it is working a lot better than

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.939 
tile but it is working a lot better than
it<00:06:37.870> did<00:06:38.020> before<00:06:38.490> would<00:06:39.490> take<00:06:39.729> about<00:06:39.880> 36<00:06:40.720> 37<00:06:41.320> %

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
it did before would take about 36 37 %

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.540 
it did before would take about 36 37 %
to<00:06:42.130> get<00:06:42.310> a<00:06:42.690> stable<00:06:43.690> picture<00:06:44.229> now<00:06:44.380> it<00:06:44.560> takes<00:06:44.770> 35

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
to get a stable picture now it takes 35

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.839 
to get a stable picture now it takes 35
doesn't<00:06:46.360> seem<00:06:46.570> like<00:06:46.780> much<00:06:47.020> but<00:06:47.349> on<00:06:48.039> a<00:06:48.099> weak

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 
doesn't seem like much but on a weak

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:51.990 
doesn't seem like much but on a weak
station<00:06:49.449> that's<00:06:49.660> on<00:06:50.220> the<00:06:51.220> fringe<00:06:51.490> area<00:06:51.820> it

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
station that's on the fringe area it

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.950 
station that's on the fringe area it
makes<00:06:52.270> a<00:06:52.570> world<00:06:52.960> of<00:06:53.320> difference<00:06:54.030> and<00:06:55.030> that<00:06:55.060> is

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
makes a world of difference and that is

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.180 
makes a world of difference and that is
the<00:06:56.380> update<00:06:56.830> on<00:06:56.860> this<00:06:57.310> TV<00:06:58.800> hope<00:06:59.800> you<00:06:59.919> enjoyed
