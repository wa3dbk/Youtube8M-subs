00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200 

I<00:00:00.740> think<00:00:01.740> that<00:00:01.860> when<00:00:01.979> you<00:00:02.100> make<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.760> decision

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
I think that when you make the decision

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.240 
I think that when you make the decision
to<00:00:03.240> go<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.600> when<00:00:04.319> we<00:00:04.410> made<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.650> decision<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:05.069> go

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
to go to when we made the decision to go

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.460 
to go to when we made the decision to go
through<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.520> MLS<00:00:05.850> obviously<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:07.230> take<00:00:07.440> a

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
through the MLS obviously you take a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.620 
through the MLS obviously you take a
look<00:00:07.680> at<00:00:07.799> some<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.099> success<00:00:08.519> sexual<00:00:09.389> teams

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
look back at the games that we had a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.420 
look back at the games that we had a
little<00:00:30.660> quick<00:00:30.779> statement<00:00:30.990> over<00:00:31.650> 60,000

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
little quick statement over 60,000

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
little quick statement over 60,000
58,000<00:00:33.149> or<00:00:33.270> whatnot<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:34.290> also<00:00:34.649> great<00:00:34.770> too

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so I've always said that much well as a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.869 
so I've always said that much well as a
soccer<00:00:37.290> city<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.489> year

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
soccer city and I think that this year

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.970 
soccer city and I think that this year
the<00:00:39.300> fans<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.750> prove<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.410> soccer

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

city<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> then<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.120> really

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
city and then it's and it's really

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.260 
city and then it's and it's really
exciting<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:44.190> me<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.090> fan

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
exciting to see that for me the the fan

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.330
