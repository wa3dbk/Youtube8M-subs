00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.190
 hello everyone I hope you are very well and 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.170
 well I want to share a peak with you 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.600
 I just read in lesson friends 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.029
 free a facebook group and what 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.350
 AgustÃ­n Arias shared with whom 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.779
 I also thank you for the 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.539
 information and good this trick consists 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.180
 basically on how to do to overtake 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.369
 the actions that last a long time of 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.170
 our sims but without spending so many 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.690
 lifestyle points 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.650
 well let's see you will need me 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.540
 what 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.580
 one of our sims that we're going to 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.830
 put to do the action be in a 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.900
 second or third floor of the house and the 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.640
 object with which we want to make it do 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.720
 the action for example we think that 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.660
 we want to make a 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 a birthday cake that lasts 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.930
 all day doing the stove has to 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.020
 being on the first floor can also be 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.170
 to apply for example with here not 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.350
 I have one but with the little things in 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.390
 what we sow 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.050
 here I will put one to show you 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.000
 nothing else 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.770
 the trick too and obviously good 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 these are always placed on the first floor 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.880
 then this good one we already have our 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.050
 our stove 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.970
 our little thing to plant 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.830
 or any other piece of furniture in which 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.100
 let's go to be able to do some activity 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.650
 long they have to be on the floor and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.120
 well since we did this that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.850
 our and I'm on the top floor 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.860
 it's very easy, we're just going to send it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.040
 to do the action 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.140
 and at the time I was going down 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.230
 the stairs just when they were 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:01.980
 going down now I'm going to show you we do 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:04.490
 than others without touch to which it is 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.490
 going down the stairs 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.360
 for example 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.530
 let's send him to do 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.530
 it's not birthday 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.300
 years and let's wait for it to come down as 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.760
 come here by default and I put the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.310
 control of the other 5 then we touch it 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.730
 As you can see, it costs a point of style 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.610
 life nothing more to advance the action already 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.790
 it does not cost us at 23 but it has to 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.769
 be just like that when you're going down 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.069
 the stairs touch it and turn it off color 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.290
 not wait for us until until 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.750
 the building because then no longer no longer 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.019
 it works they do not see I could advance the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.930
 action now let's try this trick 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:58.730
 let's try to do it with some 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.730
 another thing like for example planting 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.110
 well then we have there already we have 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.630
 back to our century 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.900
 on the second floor we are going to send you the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.730
 central and we're going to be going to put it 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.610
 to plant what lasts a long time that 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.120
 they like 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.500
 Well, the thorns that lasts one day we go to 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.870
 be on the lookout when I downloaded the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.000
 stairs again was already changed by 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.970
 default controlling others and the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.580
 we play paid and ready 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.050
 as you can see and only cost point 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.910
 lifestyle to advance the action 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.700
 that's all I hope you have served them 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.700
 and see you in the next video chat
