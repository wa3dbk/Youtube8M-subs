00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.860
 It is a simple floret made by cross knitting. 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.640
 I will start from the eye of the circle. 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.660
 We knit with a thick 8/0 crochet that the knitting pattern is easy to understand. 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.640
 Wind the thread around your forefinger twice. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.680
 Remove the thread from your finger and put it on your right hand 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.600
 The longer thread that leads to the thread ball, 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.900
 Through the space between the little finger and the ring finger, from between the middle finger and the index finger 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.820
 Wrap it on your forefinger, 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.540
 Hold the looped thread with your thumb and middle finger. 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.740
 Put the crochet in the ring and pull the thread out. 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.920
 Leave the thread on the needle and pull it out. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.320
 I was able to make a circle. 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.960
 Next, we will knit one piece. 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.240
 Put the needle in the ring, pull it out with a thread, 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.620
 With the thread on the needle, 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.700
 Thread and pull it out again. 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.560
 I could do one. 

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:07.134

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 Put the needle in the ring, pull it out with a thread, 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.000
 Put a thread on the needle and pull out both. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.720
