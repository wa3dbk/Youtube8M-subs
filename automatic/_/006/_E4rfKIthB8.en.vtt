00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.839
 today with you the mobile and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.240
 introduce free application of ac 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.190
 aci stands for auto in this case 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.980
 club europe around with this mobile 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.389
 application gets you a few 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.750
 functions and information at 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.550
 an accident or the other 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.289
 Road traffic use quite practical 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.519
 So you can be at the top of the list 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.650
 foreground is here completely 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.029
 big not and button can cling 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 you also click on it and then if you can 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 an iphone has the emergency call directly 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.550
 alarm if you for example a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.780
 had a car accident or an accident 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.149
 has observed and accordingly 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 would like to help but there are also 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.989
 still the possibilities on a few 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.280
 so find other things 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.350
 I'm very practical for example the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.059
 accident checklist you see already 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.739
 here in the matter if one on individual 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.420
 things click that is all in the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.829
 colors of aci held and power 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.079
 overall a pretty cool impression 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.120
 is also anne fit the new iphone and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.440
 I find the ipod touch pretty much here 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.230
 cool and here is a little one now 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.390
 checklist and that is of course that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.440
 first secure the accident site there can 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.510
 Of course you can also click on it 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.040
 were fatter turn on the car 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.140
 inevitably there behind the guardrail 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.689
 bring in safety and that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.930
 Setting up the warning triangle naturally 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.820
 that is very important after that it is necessary 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 to provide first aid there is one 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.210
 a few things you need to consider help 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 call is then step 3 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.159
 but for example as 12 sec afterwards 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.420
 prove that it already is one 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.930
 a little further, of course, the first three 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.280
 first score more important and then to 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.079
 dealing with the accident enemy is here 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.090
 Of course , one point is also important 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.530
 that you have name address order that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.100
 then later with the insurance everything 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.600
 to clarify 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.780
 an accident report there is still that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.270
 Sixth and yes that's all, of course 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.130
 which is pretty easy in stress 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.409
 especially first aid can be forgotten 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.750
 a thing to do with relatively simple 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.610
 possibilities and relative 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.280
 important ones know but easy too 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.140
 Achieve is a lot can reach 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.550
 Can save a lot and as natural 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.500
 too bad if that somehow gets lost 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.090
 because you are currently in stress 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.590
 afterwards there is one more point 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.640
 Gas stations as you can on one 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.170
 Search for a gas station 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.220
 Here we are already here and here 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.220
 now some are found 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.850
 Also, of course, a lot of day 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.050
 so it was one of them here 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.580
 possibility when looking at the map 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.080
 However, they can draw child 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.000
 also according to the location we just 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.080
 has seen and there were so with me in 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.880
 the region now already three 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 different ones make one 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.750
 whole amount for this little relate 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.280
 there is still traffic info that is 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.290
 here's a point there you have to 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.430
 start position enter target position and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.420
 accordingly, an then 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.040
 displayed which traffic problems 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.950
 if for example if you have the a1 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.860
 there are problems and so on thereafter 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.780
 there's a service center here you can 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.970
 look where the next as where the next 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.130
 is the nearest service center each 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.140
 the next, for example, 22 kilometers 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.850
 away and yes you can still here 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.190
 set richer 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.000
 in which circle to be displayed 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.459
 should then be natural 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.970
 Accordingly, but more so far 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.870
 Of course you usually do not drive 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.880
 attributed there's more 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.769
 Information about ten of this case is 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.590
 and only loose possibility there is one 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.930
 info service below trusted attorneys 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.790
 help here in this case is usual 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.820
 still info in which imprint's 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.540
 Of course you can also find the ones here 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.079
 info this is of course the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.150
 official app of the ac car club europe 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.910
 ev is a registered association 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.680
 and eventual fan is for you 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.739
 interesting especially at the current 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.180
 Incidents with the adac here to the doctor too 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.950
 I think the mobile application 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.900
 is already quite good there it gives up 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.640
 in any case, some important information 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.620
 and also find that else is completely 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.390
 important also on other autoclubs 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.640
 to point out because there is not only the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.019
 adac it is the biggest one in the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.060
 Region in any case in Germany 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.739
 but there is also a lot here 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.970
 others maybe not 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.680
 are worse and maybe im 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.330
 entry or even contribution 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.830
 a bit cheaper so look the best 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.870
 Just ran the application I can 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.780
 Incidentally, even if I do not use 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.350
 So I'm a member so far 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.350
 next time
