00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.520
 yes then it's about all these cases right here 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.170
 we are the best but most of the world and I welcome the rally 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.359
 drives Audi Liebherr of Verivox 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.719
 why will this stand for decades 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.170
 their creators is, so to speak, the declaration of solidarity of the 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:16.769
 Hanoverian 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.259
 singing music with Hannover and with 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.499
 Hannover 96 with the club 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:26.789
 it came about one time Flinders 6 90 did not go so well due to that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.159
 Death of Robert Enke Buddy crew fall into a deep hole 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.660
 seemed and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.430
 Flea I sat at home as know of Hannover 6 0 4 thought what can I 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.770
 Maybe as a musician from Hannover, maybe it will contribute 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.740
 goes up again 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.940
 how do you feel about how you can join forces between the music scene 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.550
 Hannovers and the club created and then, however, the idea arose with the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.320
 Sampler and then we have percent all bands contacts the idea and stuff 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.450
 came from Hannover and the response was great the people were immediately 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.240
 So people are free to move in at this time 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.280
 In other words, they provide their art for free in vain 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.520
 good cause for the club and not only that around you also has at the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.520
 Opportunity found that actually 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.030
 almost all bands and musicians from Hannover really have something with 6 90 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.030
 that means connecting 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.509
 for the people who want to know what's going on in Hannover so musically 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.530
 that's the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.229
 most representative self-service ever gave that's right 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.530
 Giant bandwidth 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.469
 by Terry Hoax Rock music has to be made 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.950
 In short, this is the biggest pop 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.330
 in the broadest sense then percent but still around here, however, for example 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.600
 Food has Acapella full year but unfortunately that's really true 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.660
 Specs Haslinger jump Specs it's Hip Hop so it's followed chunks we're to 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.049
 Example the representatives of the cockpit also representatives 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.759
 the very hard rock the internet agency Klarmann dazzles a love 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.280
 Sun solutions do so 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.100
 zol Pank Pop History in German Matt Cassel as the representative of the test 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.440
 the promises latin american pop 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.690
 Percent of Heinz Rudolf Kunze the percentage of stronger German 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.390
 pop music 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.770
 is yes and then I come with students Rossii because I am the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.520
 Representative of the animal because of it 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.240
 So, really, the whole range of Hanoverian is indeed drawing 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:11.890
 and s 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.469
 is also a good cause for the benefit of what 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.149
 The revenue will be donated to later 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.969
 percent 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.499
 eleven of the half so one half goes to the junior department of the red 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.169
 So, "I might have said before my press conference 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.319
 you can shape them in the district and buy new benches in the cabins or it 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.549
 would be necessary or in any case so it would be necessary because I had before Na 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.759
 that is now 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.770
 23 years for the same Benker 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.460
 and I believe in the brother that really had 8 years before then 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.779
 also think the same one 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.949
 So Genpact new benches were awesome and the second half goes to the 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.539
 robert-sink-Foundation 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.659
