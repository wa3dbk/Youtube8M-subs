00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
rotation to kind of be able to have like

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.900 
rotation to kind of be able to have like
a<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.620> bit<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.010> man<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.430> neutral

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
a little bit of a man in neutral

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.779 
a little bit of a man in neutral
rotation<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.410> came<00:00:40.920> up<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:42.440> atonement

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
rotation and I came up with a atonement

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.330 
rotation and I came up with a atonement
rotation<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.390> atonement<00:00:46.219> once<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
rotation because with atonement once you

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.479 
rotation because with atonement once you
get<00:00:47.430> 25<00:00:47.789> stacks<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.480> evangelism<00:00:49.200> your<00:00:50.129> smite

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
get 25 stacks of evangelism your smite

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.150 
get 25 stacks of evangelism your smite
and<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:51.120> holy<00:00:51.329> fire<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.170> penance<00:00:52.559> get

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and your holy fire and your penance get

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.590 
and your holy fire and your penance get
cheaper<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.340> my<00:00:56.340> atonement<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.360> those

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
cheaper and so my atonement and those

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.229 
cheaper and so my atonement and those
are<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:57.989> atonement<00:00:58.289> spells<00:00:58.829> might<00:00:59.370> pull<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
are your atonement spells might pull a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.480 
are your atonement spells might pull a
fire<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.870> penance<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:05.580> created<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.479> macro

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
fire in penance so I created a macro

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.940 
fire in penance so I created a macro
cast<00:01:08.490> sequence<00:01:08.970> macro<00:01:09.540> which<00:01:10.470> basically

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
cast sequence macro which basically

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.929 
cast sequence macro which basically
casts<00:01:11.670> penance<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.360> holy<00:01:13.140> fire<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:14.400> smite

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
casts penance and holy fire then smite

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.890 
casts penance and holy fire then smite
three<00:01:15.299> times<00:01:15.830> then<00:01:16.830> power<00:01:17.159> word<00:01:17.759> solace<00:01:18.450> twice

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
three times then power word solace twice

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.980 
three times then power word solace twice
and<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> end<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.030> you're<00:01:21.570> pretty

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and at the end of that you're pretty

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.740 
and at the end of that you're pretty
much<00:01:22.049> back<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> where<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.369> were<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.540> just

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
much back to where you were and it just

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
much back to where you were and it just
goes<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.140> back<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> penance<00:01:25.979> again<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
goes right back to penance again it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.149 
goes right back to penance again it
works<00:01:27.479> within<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.930> cooldown<00:01:28.729> actually<00:01:31.159> this

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
works within the cooldown actually this

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:41.390 
works within the cooldown actually this
is<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:34.380> character<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.600> high<00:01:36.600> level<00:01:38.930> 434<00:01:40.400> so

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
is this character is a high level 434 so

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.050 
is this character is a high level 434 so
it's<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:41.759> low<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.649> think<00:01:43.649> once<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.670> mana

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it's really low I think once my mana

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.969 
it's really low I think once my mana
regen<00:01:45.659> gets<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.140> little<00:01:46.259> bit<00:01:46.530> higher<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:48.979> should

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
regen gets a little bit higher I should

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.050 
regen gets a little bit higher I should
be<00:01:50.189> able<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:51.890> bring<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.070> down<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.549> only<00:01:53.729> one

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
be able to bring this down to only one

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.090 
be able to bring this down to only one
power<00:01:54.360> word<00:01:54.720> salas<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.530> add<00:01:55.799> back<00:01:56.159> in

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
power word salas and add back in
