00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
their mounting holes and I ended up

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.010 
their mounting holes and I ended up
having<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.250> unscrew<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:37.880> top<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.750> put<00:02:38.930> it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
back on again so that's the only tip
