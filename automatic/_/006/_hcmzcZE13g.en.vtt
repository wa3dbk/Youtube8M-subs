your key cap and what the o-ring does is

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.640 
your key cap and what the o-ring does is
a<00:02:14.240> sound<00:02:14.630> dampener<00:02:16.060> which<00:02:17.060> reduces<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.690> noise

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
a sound dampener which reduces the noise

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.350
