this<00:00:32.820> we're<00:00:33.570> speeding<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
this we're speeding this thing up the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
this we're speeding this thing up the
video<00:00:35.370> lasted<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.059> nine<00:00:36.210> minutes<00:00:36.449> we're

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
video lasted for nine minutes we're

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.930 
video lasted for nine minutes we're
cutting<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.470> to<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.860> minute<00:00:38.339> sped<00:00:38.790> up

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
cutting it down to a minute sped up

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.119 
cutting it down to a minute sped up
about<00:00:39.330> nine<00:00:39.570> hundred<00:00:39.600> percent<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.559> we're

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
about nine hundred percent and we're

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.619 
about nine hundred percent and we're
bringing<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.640> some<00:00:42.090> brightness<00:00:42.450> contrast

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
bringing it in some brightness contrast

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.110 
bringing it in some brightness contrast
so<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> good<00:00:43.559> look<00:00:43.770> at<00:00:44.010> what's<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.820> on

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
is tracking the ISS you know first what

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
is tracking the ISS you know first what
I<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.940> looking<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> didn't<00:01:01.109> know<00:01:01.140> what

I was looking at it I didn't know what

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.470 
I was looking at it I didn't know what
exactly<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:02.879> tasteless

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
exactly I was that it was tasteless

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630 
exactly I was that it was tasteless
particles<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> video<00:01:05.160> progressed

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
particles but then as a video progressed

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
particles but then as a video progressed
you<00:01:05.880> actually<00:01:06.300> see<00:01:06.570> things<00:01:06.780> starting<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.259> move

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you actually see things starting to move

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
you actually see things starting to move
in<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.250> very<00:01:08.460> beginning<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.270> these

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
in the very beginning you see these

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.389 
in the very beginning you see these
orange<00:01:09.840> dots<00:01:10.110> around<00:01:10.410> it<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.039> one<00:01:11.250> in

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
orange dots around it and one in

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.029 
orange dots around it and one in
particular<00:01:12.000> above<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.959> almost<00:01:13.649> as<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:13.890> it's

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
particular above it almost as if it's

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.730 
particular above it almost as if it's
going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.819> and<00:01:15.060> at<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> end<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
going to it and at the end of this the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.859 
going to it and at the end of this the
entire<00:01:17.160> thing<00:01:17.550> kind<00:01:17.789> of<00:01:17.910> shrinks<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.660> little

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
entire thing kind of shrinks up a little
bit<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:19.349> it's<00:01:19.500> almost<00:01:19.709> as<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.190> it's<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.490> giant<00:01:20.789> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
bit so it's almost as if it's a giant I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.930 
bit so it's almost as if it's a giant I
