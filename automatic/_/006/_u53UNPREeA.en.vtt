a<00:01:48.119> benefit<00:01:48.689> or<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.409> after<00:01:49.770> about<00:01:49.920> 10<00:01:50.909> 15

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
a benefit or not but after about 10 15

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.349 
a benefit or not but after about 10 15
seconds<00:01:51.960> my<00:01:52.590> skin<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.249> become<00:01:53.999> more

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
seconds my skin would be become more

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.599 
seconds my skin would be become more
smooth<00:01:54.719> I'd<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.380> skin<00:01:56.159> smoothing

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
smooth I'd have this skin smoothing

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.309 
smooth I'd have this skin smoothing
effect<00:01:56.850> something<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> would<00:01:57.840> find<00:01:58.109> in

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
effect something that you would find in

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.989 
effect something that you would find in
Photoshop<00:01:58.889> or<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> take<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.670> all<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
Photoshop or you take out all the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.539 
Photoshop or you take out all the
blemishes<00:02:00.359> so<00:02:01.109> I<00:02:01.139> go<00:02:01.350> from<00:02:01.560> blemishes<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.399> not

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
blemishes so I go from blemishes to not

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.569 
blemishes so I go from blemishes to not
having<00:02:02.789> blemishes<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.679> odd<00:02:04.829> again<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
having blemishes it's really odd again I

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.219 
having blemishes it's really odd again I
don't<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:05.999> who<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.420> fault<00:02:06.630> here<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.170> I'm

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
don't know who is at fault here but I'm

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.469 
don't know who is at fault here but I'm
going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> guess<00:02:07.709> this<00:02:08.009> more<00:02:08.670> might<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.300> more

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
going to guess this more might be more

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.600 
going to guess this more might be more

it's<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.190> lot<00:02:59.370> better<00:02:59.640> you<00:03:00.240> get<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.450> lot<00:03:00.630> more

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
it's a lot better you get a lot more

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.900 
it's a lot better you get a lot more

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.900 
used about 24%
so<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> little<00:03:37.500> bit<00:03:37.709> less<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.489> was<00:03:38.670> kind<00:03:38.850> of

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
so a little bit less so I was kind of

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.000 
so a little bit less so I was kind of
confused<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.930> always<00:03:40.560> thought<00:03:40.739> that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
confused on that I always thought that

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.820 
confused on that I always thought that
the<00:03:41.160> pro<00:03:41.519> res<00:03:41.790> was<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.630> lot<00:03:43.050> easier<00:03:43.560> on<00:03:43.620> your

the pro res was a lot easier on your

the pro res was a lot easier on your

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
little bit confused and all the people

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.199

with it and it's using more CPU power
many<00:04:18.930> people<00:04:19.290> before<00:04:19.650> me<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:19.859> tested<00:04:20.430> their

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
many people before me have tested their

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.970 
many people before me have tested their
internal<00:04:21.150> codec<00:04:21.539> of<00:04:21.720> their

camera to an animist product and

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.290 
camera to an animist product and
basically<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.680> general<00:04:24.860> outcome<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.640> there's

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
basically the general outcome is there's

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.850 
basically the general outcome is there's
really<00:04:26.690> not<00:04:26.930> that<00:04:26.990> much<00:04:27.320> difference<00:04:27.710> between

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
really not that much difference between

how<00:04:34.550> I<00:04:34.580> did<00:04:34.850> it<00:04:34.970> wrong<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.750> we<00:04:35.870> can<00:04:35.990> keep<00:04:36.140> this

how I did it wrong and we can keep this

I tried looking at all the different

I tried looking at all the different

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
me that you have to pull a really hard

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.680 
me that you have to pull a really hard
secondary<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:04.280> I'll<00:05:04.460> take<00:05:04.700> a<00:05:04.970> color<00:05:05.360> and

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
secondary so I'll take a color and

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.150 
secondary so I'll take a color and
totally<00:05:06.170> change<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.650> different<00:05:06.800> color

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
totally change it to a different color

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160 
totally change it to a different color
and<00:05:07.400> see<00:05:07.910> how<00:05:07.970> it<00:05:08.120> does<00:05:08.150> is<00:05:08.420> around<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.780> edges

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
and see how it does is around the edges

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.840 
and see how it does is around the edges
and<00:05:09.380> see<00:05:09.620> what<00:05:09.740> kind<00:05:09.890> of<00:05:09.950> chattering<00:05:10.430> is<00:05:10.580> going

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
and see what kind of chattering is going

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.180 
and see what kind of chattering is going
on<00:05:11.000> after<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:11.780> pull<00:05:11.960> your<00:05:12.110> secondary<00:05:12.560> well

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
on after you pull your secondary well

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.490 
on after you pull your secondary well
I've<00:05:13.280> done<00:05:13.460> that<00:05:13.640> with<00:05:13.850> this<00:05:14.000> WD<00:05:14.540> can<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.110> as

I've done that with this WD can and as

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.420 
I've done that with this WD can and as
you<00:05:15.620> can<00:05:15.740> see<00:05:15.860> I've<00:05:16.010> changed<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.400> color

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
you can see I've changed the color

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.490 
you can see I've changed the color
yellow<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.360> something<00:05:17.900> totally<00:05:18.200> different

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
yellow to something totally different

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.670 
yellow to something totally different
and<00:05:18.920> if<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.340> zoom<00:05:19.490> way<00:05:20.090> in<00:05:20.390> you<00:05:21.050> can<00:05:21.080> see<00:05:21.470> that

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
and if you zoom way in you can see that

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.100 
and if you zoom way in you can see that
the<00:05:21.830> chatter<00:05:22.130> and<00:05:22.520> what's<00:05:23.390> going<00:05:23.660> around<00:05:23.750> on

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
the chatter and what's going around on

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.190 
the chatter and what's going around on
the<00:05:24.200> edges<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.620> this<00:05:25.660> imperfect<00:05:26.660> key

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
the edges of this imperfect key

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.620 
the edges of this imperfect key
basically<00:05:27.710> of<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.130> secondary<00:05:28.610> you<00:05:29.210> can<00:05:29.390> see

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
basically of the secondary you can see

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.050 
basically of the secondary you can see
they<00:05:30.080> pretty<00:05:30.410> much<00:05:30.650> look<00:05:30.950> identical<00:05:31.250> if

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
they pretty much look identical if

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.720 
they pretty much look identical if
you're<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.600> owner<00:05:32.840> of<00:05:32.990> a<00:05:33.260> Panasonic<00:05:33.950> gh4<00:05:34.250> do
