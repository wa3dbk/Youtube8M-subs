00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello all the people with you frit today 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.099
 will we have something that did not do very, very 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.530
 podcast until podcasts did not take off 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.059
 already very, very long time ago probably the last 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.190
 once and filmed them then when i had 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.260
 20 thousand subscribers and since that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.270
 quite a lot has already passed 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.920
 time ladies. 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.910
 a little rose a little joke 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.980
 Of course, the podcast decided not to shoot 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.670
 just k because I wanted something up 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.439
 to bring you 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.390
 let's start with the fact that all my exams are already 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.279
 come to an end and I start the video 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.989
 shoot much more active also for that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.989
 you can put like essence 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.399
 Like, I won't kill you 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.899
 although essentially do what you want it 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.280
 decide also today is my birthday 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.079
 prior to shooting video judge our day and not 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.210
 very cool actually i wanted to take off 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.670
 very very cool video with skate like 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.260
 I ride my low all that but I 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.100
 I will go to the plan for my birthday 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.530
 I want to spend it a little differently 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.899
 a little bit different understand by the way 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.930
 about important events recently I provtykal 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:12.000
 year channel in principle i could too 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.970
 make a video but you understand me 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.619
 was the first exam it was Russian in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.200
 In principle, you yourself understand it all 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.939
 it was yes yes by the way I already noticed what 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.530
 number of subscribers on the channel and this is not 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.530
 I might not be happy thank you guys 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 Kancha 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.590
 I can no longer be the Japanese and by the way 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.649
 the guys got me very interesting 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.820
 idea how how about video 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:52.210
 go out more often 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:53.799
 but you will also be watching in general 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.899
 if you are ready to watch my videos every 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.990
 day I can release much more often I 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.000
 mean watching and here below it there 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.560
 that's there if the day is typed some 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.149
 a certain number of views i 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.100
 I understand that most of my audience 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:12.930
 already firing this video if there 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:17.140
 recruited about 10 thousand where truncated 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.730
 Generally there you there so guys not 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.590
 complain that the video is so rare you 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.390
 they just do not have time to watch so 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.569
 here is my offer, see the video 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.440
 more often and I will release them more often this 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.360
 is logical 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.700
 I think it will be very interesting and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.580
 saturated for this summer we will go very 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.290
 a lot of games in blue a lot of live video 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.910
 so it seems to me we will go this summer 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.160
 cool smoothly I have to run 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.040
 after all dnyuha after all so 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.609
 traditions sam was frit good luck everyone 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.609
