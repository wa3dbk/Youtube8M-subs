00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.249
 Halilovic welcome to a new issue of the month 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.989
 this time 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.050
 those against their concerns the way 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.800
 Beginning of the month surprising set with extensive restrictions in the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 winter sports 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.400
 now the fact that Konrad has recently joined this elite circle 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.180
 Most of them still met with surprise but ultimately in the end 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.510
 strange shrug 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.480
 however, the restriction of flash counteracts some importance 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.920
 however, that had been so for a long time to cede 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.140
 even something similar is happening and Mercks buyers are also still results 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.480
 consequent 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.389
 really is so blatant 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.140
 but that sincerely 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.219
 the brainstorming I've been in since the ARAG 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.140
 in every second of the group was represented four times 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.140
 now also reduced to a single copy 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.190
 this turns the tables upside down but this format is so 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.760
 moving slowly that we still do not have any information about that now 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.270
 Let's move on to the next step 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.050
 out 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.050
 Lam 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.060
 this symbol stands for all kinds of overthrow 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 fears 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.430
 and anything with b what I got to 1 1 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.530
 while the shape is absolute 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.229
 this is the expansion speed list 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.340
 October appearing Slapshot ch 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.360
 However, this means the Magic has gotten a new rarity game 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.170
 which, for example, in this hitherto extremely vocal and Fiege Planz 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.570
 will effect 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.630
 the fear is clearer that less cards mean more money 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.010
 go down the drain 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.649
 it does not necessarily have to be that way 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.990
 Schartz obviously not only brings this change with it 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.540
 These offenders are quasi balanced by the fact that there are fewer in the z4 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.990
 Will give edges altogether 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.039
 Much more crucial than the question of whether punk once Magic 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.159
 However, I find the question more expensive if Busch 2 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.379
 World hit nothing works 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.899
 Westerhoff does 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.649
 I'll just say what I said to myself from Mr. Koch formats 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:20.539
 Wishes 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:24.769
 On the one hand we are diverse but on the other hand manageable 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:25.549
 Unia 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.360
 "That's a fine line 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.749
 a balancing act 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.079
 but on both sides, as it were, the award had nothing 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.980
 Either there is no option to explore after a short time 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.739
 then the format stagnates and boring 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.540
 or 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.880
 the options are both numerous that you never exhaust all anyway 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.650
 At least in the last one, I could be as frustrating as the other 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.519
 extreme 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.309
 I have the impression that I have something in the lately lately 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.779
 latter direction wall 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.230
 or in the case of the current block contracts format in both directions 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.979
 at the same time 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.659
 There is alone there through the variegation 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.980
 endless possibilities we all bring nothing oh yes I am I in 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.999
 talking about options in this context 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.999
 Of course I always only relevant option 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.409
 have increased in recent years ever further 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.969
 For example, let's compare it on a Monday because that's just one of them 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.489
 Card sent again to become August 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.959
 with Stronghold for the simple reason that was about ten years earlier 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.539
 push 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.559
 the strongest probably more from Traunreut was Trulli word 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.379
 weakest values, however, was good I have not checked now whether 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.329
 I think it was locally 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.819
 and now the same for Monday 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:40.720
 at 1 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.890
 Minute place it could certainly be so Peter Ploß Mad Men animals 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.429
 next requested 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:49.889
 and the bad card 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.490
 what time an MS 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.080
 or maybe rather in the middle they would us anyway 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.209
 the next best card already in Graz said Becks lowered 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.019
 that means two things now 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.909
 once who has Fred Brathwaite these days 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.150
 Only good old times never experienced, besides, the shears work in between 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.829
 good and bad go on together 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.440
 and do not get me wrong 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.319
 it is alright that less and less toys and toys read samples 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.569
 but just as it just bucks from a huge barren 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:19.900
 a gigantic 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.170
 there you should counter the demand 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.690
 less cards pressure and if that I have to take that more speculative purchase 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.680
 literally 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.229
 then quaked 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.069
 and then there were the qualifying tournaments to the 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.409
 this year's pain 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.060
 these are finally the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.860
 Matti enough big quasi hien announced 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.599
 and with Lars Börge qualification possibility 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.699
 Two petit bugs and other events too should not be qualified 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.909
 quite worried 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.939
 but who has not already qualified everything 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.389
 the little one the animals 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.879
 not to be confused with the big title 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.300
 our darling too often a monopoly 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.699
 and even the one whose Norman and the spelling unsolicited 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.449
 promotional emails accordingly 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.569
 This year I will make a meeting of the whole community 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.969
 The man with the leather jacket branches is of course also there 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.110
 by the way 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.810
 this one had also been used in June to be in the internal ranking of the most active 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.979
 foren-user from fifth place either way to run in second place 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.610
 which he discusses with ten people at the same time and this one quite nicely 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.470
 to corner 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.590
 was not only impressive to watch but also Beust the entertaining 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.669
 but no one should say there was no warning 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.039
 The text could be here for a while 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.330
 under each of his posts 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.159
 and if you look closely 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.159
 you can even see the difference 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:51.760
 and like any good computer opponent specifically aimed at this his victories 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.509
 primarily by doing so 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:54.990
 the EDA show with 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.810
 Maybe you still know about the girl computer games shame from there 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.150
 The boss was not that difficult to defeat because his Khalid 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.009
 was better 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.319
 No, it just took talking special rules to itself 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.330
 In the case of the Ironman word that means the use of up to these symptoms 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
 count to talk to the other side in the ground 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:20.469
 and she says Schrell Shares last week in the total of 15 minutes 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.739
 she had edited from a video dry fist edited on the subject of rhetoric 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.080
 Rotterdam and noisy TBV Lemgo when talking about it I definately what 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.030
 I make myself good grades but also in it so long is not much succeeded 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.029
 us dollars 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.839
 At the end I am only dealing with the question in this category 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.740
 actually spells out Contentos right 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:49.189
 You can choose from two more characters and two Airbus despite a bit like 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:50.969
 you need him 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:54.389
 quick and comfort somehow does not make much sense 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:56.919
 and also in the variant weaknesses consolation 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.990
 I always ask only for the 1 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.569
 In turn, I can not think of it at all and then it finally gives over 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.930
 their course with less space 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.080
 protects the environment 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.860
 Fact I found all these spellings on my internet search 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.720
 but that does not count too much 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.660
 if you only look long enough, you will inevitably come up 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.159
 Spellings Lidice 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.779
 that's probably Klingon at best 

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:22.319
 My favorite option for writing this alias Sea is as follows 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:23.580
 out 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.110
 Where does the Deck Designer actually get their DAX for the next best 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.550
 Find food 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.630
 that's just him 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.099
 literally goes through your head 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:36.149
 only those who mean the least that one can look in a suitable place 

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:37.699
 if she did not know 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:40.699
 Kwick is testing Franko's Belgian counterpart 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:42.789
 that Frank's environment is spared 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:43.550
 Forbo 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.669
 to complain 

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:46.370
 Borgmann a little leaves 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.839
 and finally finds 

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.149
 Break in the 2 

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:52.919
 with first Mappus Prof followed by a space in the hands 

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:54.619
 and also at the time 

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:56.120
 which is not only interesting 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.069
 how does it taste? 

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:01.300
 in Belgium it was not on the menu but if you were the next one 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.389
 times in a coup in France says 

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:04.990
 give it another try 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.090
 of course only 

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.639
 if you mind a good match of pop 

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:11.430
 that would be the educational mission for this week 

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.279
 Fulfills 

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.550
 until the next day to you in the dark
