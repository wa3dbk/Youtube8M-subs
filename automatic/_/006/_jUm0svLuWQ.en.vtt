food the heat is on either side of the
food<00:00:45.659> and<00:00:45.960> when<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> put<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> lid<00:00:46.949> on<00:00:47.250> the

the food and that's what we're going to

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.660 
the food and that's what we're going to
do<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.930> once<00:00:55.559> you've<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> chimney<00:00:56.339> starter

this is very important when you're

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.060 
this is very important when you're
pouring<00:01:24.450> charcoal<00:01:25.080> because<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.860> want<00:01:26.010> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
pouring charcoal because you want to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.800 
pouring charcoal because you want to
protect<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:26.640> hands<00:01:26.910> from<00:01:27.060> any<00:01:27.390> flying

sparks<00:01:28.230> you<00:01:29.010> also<00:01:29.190> want<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> make<00:01:29.670> sure<00:01:29.910> if<00:01:30.060> you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
sparks you also want to make sure if you

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.960 
sparks you also want to make sure if you
have<00:01:30.420> animals<00:01:31.170> or<00:01:31.560> small<00:01:31.830> children<00:01:32.370> that<00:01:32.550> they

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
have animals or small children that they

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240 
have animals or small children that they
stay<00:01:33.300> about<00:01:33.690> six<00:01:34.110> feet<00:01:34.350> away<00:01:34.590> from<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.070> grill

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
stay about six feet away from the grill

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.590 
stay about six feet away from the grill
so<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.580> don't<00:01:35.760> get<00:01:35.940> burned<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.330> they're<00:01:36.450> any

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
so they don't get burned if they're any

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.560 
so they don't get burned if they're any
flying<00:01:36.960> sparks<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.830> let<00:01:38.670> me<00:01:38.790> take<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
flying sparks so let me take the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.470 
flying sparks so let me take the
charcoal<00:01:40.020> I'm<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.620> put<00:01:40.860> my<00:01:41.040> drip<00:01:41.880> pan<00:01:42.180> in

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
charcoal I'm going to put my drip pan in

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.649 
charcoal I'm going to put my drip pan in
your<00:01:42.540> plate<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:44.880> give<00:01:45.090> me<00:01:45.390> an

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
your plate and then that will give me an

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.370 
your plate and then that will give me an
idea<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.350> where<00:01:46.620> I<00:01:46.680> should<00:01:46.770> pour<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> charcoal

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
idea of where I should pour the charcoal

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.750 
idea of where I should pour the charcoal
I'm<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.650> try<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.250> close<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
I'm going to try to get as close to the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.440 
I'm going to try to get as close to the
charcoal<00:01:52.660> great<00:01:52.960> as<00:01:53.200> possible<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:54.190> try<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.610> be

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
charcoal great as possible and try to be

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.510 
charcoal great as possible and try to be
as<00:01:55.690> even<00:01:56.230> as<00:01:56.380> possible<00:01:56.410> as<00:01:57.100> well<00:01:59.370> the<00:02:00.370> next

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
as even as possible as well the next

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.140 
as even as possible as well the next
step<00:02:00.730> we<00:02:01.240> need<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.540> do<00:02:01.720> is<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.950> preheat<00:02:03.850> the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
step we need to do is to preheat the

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.240 
step we need to do is to preheat the
cooking<00:02:04.630> grade<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.410> I'm<00:02:05.500> going<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.680> put<00:02:06.100> the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
cooking grade so I'm going to put the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.139 
cooking grade so I'm going to put the
cooking<00:02:06.610> grate<00:02:06.790> on<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.500> want<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.800> make<00:02:08.950> sure

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
cooking grate on and I want to make sure

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.110 
cooking grate on and I want to make sure
that<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.450> have<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.990> holes<00:02:11.260> on<00:02:11.740> either<00:02:12.700> side

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
that I have the holes on either side

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.210 
that I have the holes on either side
where<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.540> charcoal<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.650> that's<00:02:14.800> because

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
where the charcoal is and that's because

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.980 
where the charcoal is and that's because
since<00:02:15.910> it's<00:02:16.090> going<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.300> take<00:02:16.510> me<00:02:16.660> about<00:02:16.750> an

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
since it's going to take me about an

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.750 
since it's going to take me about an
hour<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.320> half<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.680> cook<00:02:17.890> these<00:02:18.040> ribs<00:02:18.280> I'm

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
hour and a half to cook these ribs I'm

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.180 
hour and a half to cook these ribs I'm
going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.210> need<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.630> add<00:02:19.810> charcoal<00:02:20.470> after<00:02:21.070> the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
going to need to add charcoal after the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.130 
going to need to add charcoal after the
first<00:02:21.430> hour<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.420> I'm<00:02:22.480> going<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.660> put<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.930> lid

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
first hour so I'm going to put the lid

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.530 
first hour so I'm going to put the lid
on<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.440> grill<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.580> will<00:02:24.760> allow<00:02:25.030> me<00:02:25.270> to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
on the grill and this will allow me to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.570 
on the grill and this will allow me to
let<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.050> grill<00:02:26.230> preheat<00:02:26.800> before<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.250> put<00:02:27.550> my

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
let the grill preheat before I put my

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.940 
let the grill preheat before I put my
ribs<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.510> grill<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.960> want<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:29.770> make<00:02:29.920> sure

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
ribs on the grill you want to make sure

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.390 
ribs on the grill you want to make sure
that<00:02:30.940> your<00:02:31.090> vents<00:02:31.420> are<00:02:31.540> open<00:02:31.650> both<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.920> top

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
that your vents are open both in the top

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.570 
that your vents are open both in the top
and<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.360> bottom<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.520> think<00:02:36.700> it's<00:02:37.000> preheated

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
and the bottom so I think it's preheated

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.700 
and the bottom so I think it's preheated
let's<00:02:39.580> give<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:40.120> quick<00:02:40.330> brush<00:02:40.840> just<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.530> make

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
let's give it a quick brush just to make

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.080 
let's give it a quick brush just to make
sure<00:02:41.740> our<00:02:41.950> cooking<00:02:42.490> grates<00:02:42.730> are<00:02:43.030> clean<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
sure our cooking grates are clean and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.949 
sure our cooking grates are clean and
now<00:02:46.270> let's<00:02:46.750> put<00:02:46.990> our<00:02:47.430> ribs<00:02:48.430> on<00:02:48.730> see<00:02:49.540> we<00:02:49.720> want<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
now let's put our ribs on see we want to

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.530 
now let's put our ribs on see we want to
put<00:02:50.080> our<00:02:50.170> ribs<00:02:50.410> directly<00:02:51.040> over<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:52.209> cooking

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
put our ribs directly over the cooking

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.570 
put our ribs directly over the cooking
grate<00:02:52.780> where<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.470> don't<00:02:53.650> have<00:02:53.800> any<00:02:53.980> charcoal

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
grate where you don't have any charcoal

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.300 
grate where you don't have any charcoal
so<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.300> all<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.690> fats<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.170> juices<00:02:56.230> will<00:02:56.770> go

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
so that all the fats and juices will go

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.280 
so that all the fats and juices will go
into<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.700> drip<00:02:57.910> pan<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.540> can<00:02:58.720> see<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.260> I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
into the drip pan you can see that I

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.010 
into the drip pan you can see that I
have<00:02:59.470> my<00:02:59.620> ribs<00:02:59.920> on<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.700> rib<00:03:00.970> rack<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.840> rib

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
have my ribs on a rib rack and a rib

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.440 
have my ribs on a rib rack and a rib
rack<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.500> really<00:03:02.950> nice<00:03:03.280> element<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.239> use

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
rack is a really nice element to use

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.680 
rack is a really nice element to use
because<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.530> allows<00:03:05.800> me<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:06.160> cook<00:03:06.610> five<00:03:07.360> racks

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
because it allows me to cook five racks

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.120 
because it allows me to cook five racks
of<00:03:07.930> ribs<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.890> very<00:03:09.160> small<00:03:09.700> amount<00:03:10.360> of<00:03:10.570> space

ash briquettes
so<00:03:32.180> I'm<00:03:32.240> going<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.450> use<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.690> pair<00:03:33.020> of<00:03:33.050> very<00:03:33.380> long

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
so I'm going to use a pair of very long

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
so I'm going to use a pair of very long
metal<00:03:35.450> tongs<00:03:36.970> see<00:03:37.970> how<00:03:38.150> easy<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.900> just<00:03:38.959> to

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
metal tongs see how easy it is just to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.390 
metal tongs see how easy it is just to
put<00:03:39.770> them<00:03:39.920> right<00:03:40.190> through<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.520> hole<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:43.250> want

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
put them right through the hole you want

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.449 
put them right through the hole you want
to<00:03:43.489> put<00:03:43.640> about<00:03:43.880> eight<00:03:44.150> on<00:03:44.450> each<00:03:44.660> side<00:03:45.459> every

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
to put about eight on each side every

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.590 
to put about eight on each side every
hour<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:49.459> it's<00:03:49.580> been<00:03:49.730> about<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.030> half<00:03:50.239> an<00:03:50.450> hour

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
hour so it's been about a half an hour

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.900 
hour so it's been about a half an hour
