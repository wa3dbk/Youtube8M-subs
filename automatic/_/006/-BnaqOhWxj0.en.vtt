hi this is computer 22 today with a not
really<00:00:23.600> a<00:00:23.630> tutorial<00:00:23.960> more<00:00:24.470> like<00:00:24.770> a<00:00:24.800> short<00:00:25.099> talk

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
really a tutorial more like a short talk

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.019 
really a tutorial more like a short talk
on<00:00:25.960> syntax<00:00:26.960> of<00:00:27.260> custom<00:00:27.980> chops<00:00:28.250> in<00:00:28.430> darker<00:00:28.730> p<00:00:28.910> or

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
on syntax of custom chops in darker p or

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.240 
on syntax of custom chops in darker p or
generally<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.750> syntax<00:00:30.200> when<00:00:30.950> editing

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
generally the syntax when editing

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.500 
generally the syntax when editing
scripts<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:33.410> i<00:00:33.739> found<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.580> lot<00:00:34.879> of<00:00:35.030> dough<00:00:35.150> strats

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
scripts so i found a lot of dough strats

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.479 
scripts so i found a lot of dough strats
recently<00:00:36.110> where<00:00:36.410> people<00:00:36.980> are<00:00:37.070> complaining

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
recently where people are complaining

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.790 
recently where people are complaining
that<00:00:37.730> their<00:00:38.120> custom<00:00:38.720> shops<00:00:38.989> are<00:00:39.199> not<00:00:39.350> working

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
that their custom shops are not working

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.910 
that their custom shops are not working
or<00:00:40.040> all<00:00:40.460> their<00:00:41.180> jobs<00:00:41.510> are<00:00:41.720> broken<00:00:44.769> which<00:00:45.769> is

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
or all their jobs are broken which is

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.760 
or all their jobs are broken which is
basically<00:00:46.309> just<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.970> problem<00:00:47.660> with<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.260> syntax

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
basically just a problem with the syntax

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.420 
basically just a problem with the syntax
so<00:00:49.630> if<00:00:50.630> you<00:00:50.870> if<00:00:51.140> you<00:00:51.230> follow<00:00:51.469> to<00:00:51.649> syntax<00:00:52.190> which

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
so if you if you follow to syntax which

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.360 
so if you if you follow to syntax which
is<00:00:52.610> already<00:00:52.760> given<00:00:53.300> by<00:00:53.450> such<00:00:54.020> such<00:00:54.770> snippets

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
is already given by such such snippets

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.360 
is already given by such such snippets
like<00:00:56.180> this<00:00:56.329> one<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:56.809> I<00:00:57.350> assume<00:00:57.860> most<00:00:58.070> of<00:00:58.309> you

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
like this one and I assume most of you

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.440 
like this one and I assume most of you
will<00:00:58.550> not<00:00:58.879> start<00:00:59.829> coding<00:01:00.829> like<00:01:01.210> typing<00:01:02.210> down

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
will not start coding like typing down

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.299 
will not start coding like typing down
all<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.930> things<00:01:03.230> so<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:03.530> will<00:01:03.800> most<00:01:03.980> likely

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
all the things so you will most likely

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.940 
all the things so you will most likely
just<00:01:04.670> grab<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.000> snippet<00:01:05.360> unedited<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.800> your

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
just grab a snippet unedited to your

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.730 
just grab a snippet unedited to your
needs<00:01:07.509> so<00:01:08.509> when<00:01:08.930> you're<00:01:09.110> doing<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.530> you

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
needs so when you're doing that you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.350 
needs so when you're doing that you
should<00:01:09.920> first<00:01:10.190> take<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.640> look<00:01:10.759> at<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.149> syntax

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
should first take a look at the syntax

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.190 
should first take a look at the syntax
and<00:01:12.310> every<00:01:13.310> bracket<00:01:13.850> re<00:01:14.420> quotation<00:01:14.960> mark

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
and every bracket re quotation mark

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.430 
and every bracket re quotation mark
everything<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.250> needed<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.050> for<00:01:18.050> example<00:01:18.080> if

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
everything is needed so for example if

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.109 
everything is needed so for example if
or<00:01:18.649> good<00:01:18.830> for<00:01:19.009> if<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.220> forgot<00:01:19.550> this<00:01:19.759> quotation

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
or good for if you forgot this quotation

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.039 
or good for if you forgot this quotation
mark<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:21.049> comma<00:01:21.380> here<00:01:21.860> or<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:23.479> brackets

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
mark this comma here or the brackets

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.859 
mark this comma here or the brackets
here<00:01:24.140> then<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.250> will<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:26.119> will<00:01:26.180> render<00:01:26.510> your

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
here then it will it will render your

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.080 
here then it will it will render your
script<00:01:27.350> unusable<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.520> server<00:01:28.760> cannot

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
script unusable so the server cannot

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.480 
script unusable so the server cannot
detect<00:01:29.540> what<00:01:29.810> exactly<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.500> mean<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.340> will

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
detect what exactly you mean and will

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.910 
detect what exactly you mean and will
result<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.420> an<00:01:32.509> error<00:01:32.780> which<00:01:33.170> means<00:01:33.470> that<00:01:33.619> this

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
result in an error which means that this

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.480 
result in an error which means that this
file<00:01:34.189> cannot<00:01:34.640> be<00:01:34.850> loaded<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.189> this<00:01:37.189> is<00:01:37.220> usually

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
file cannot be loaded so this is usually

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.969 
file cannot be loaded so this is usually
pretty<00:01:37.970> uncool<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.799> you<00:01:39.799> want<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.159> avoid<00:01:40.369> that

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
pretty uncool and you want to avoid that

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.359 
pretty uncool and you want to avoid that
in<00:01:42.979> case<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.700> are<00:01:44.860> for<00:01:45.860> example<00:01:45.950> if

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
in case that you are for example if

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.760 
in case that you are for example if
we've<00:01:46.850> left<00:01:47.090> out<00:01:47.299> this<00:01:47.689> quotation<00:01:48.140> work<00:01:48.439> here

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
we've left out this quotation work here

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.760 
we've left out this quotation work here
then<00:01:49.610> your<00:01:50.540> server<00:01:50.810> will<00:01:50.930> not<00:01:51.229> be<00:01:51.350> use<00:01:51.470> able

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
then your server will not be use able

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.130 
then your server will not be use able
but<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.070> will<00:01:52.189> in<00:01:52.400> console<00:01:53.270> or<00:01:53.600> if<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.020> have

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
but it will in console or if you have

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.990 
but it will in console or if you have
access<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.799> locks<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.340> will<00:01:55.549> tell<00:01:55.790> you

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
access to the locks it will tell you

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.850 
access to the locks it will tell you
where<00:01:56.270> we're<00:01:56.600> exactly<00:01:56.930> failed<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:57.710> will

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
where we're exactly failed so it will

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.660 
where we're exactly failed so it will
will<00:01:58.490> say<00:01:58.729> in<00:01:59.030> what<00:01:59.240> line<00:01:59.540> it<00:01:59.720> is<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.520> then<00:02:01.520> you

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
will say in what line it is and then you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.179 
will say in what line it is and then you
can<00:02:01.939> correct<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:03.290> will<00:02:03.560> most<00:02:03.860> likely

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
can correct this you will most likely

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.300 
can correct this you will most likely
see<00:02:04.659> okay<00:02:05.659> in<00:02:05.960> case<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.409> don't<00:02:06.890> use<00:02:07.159> an

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
see okay in case you don't use an

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.219 
see okay in case you don't use an
adapter<00:02:07.700> which<00:02:07.939> has<00:02:08.149> syntax<00:02:08.450> highlighting

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
adapter which has syntax highlighting

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.000 
adapter which has syntax highlighting
yet<00:02:09.829> you<00:02:10.759> should<00:02:10.820> really<00:02:11.239> do<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.620> there's

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
yet you should really do so so there's

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.370 
yet you should really do so so there's
for<00:02:13.280> example<00:02:13.310> notepad<00:02:14.299> plus<00:02:14.450> plus<00:02:14.570> which<00:02:15.140> has

for example notepad plus plus which has

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.830 
for example notepad plus plus which has

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
displaying lewis syntax you can just go

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
displaying lewis syntax you can just go
into<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.540> injury

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.020 
your life easier well what else is
important<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:53.250> basically<00:02:54.250> if<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:54.909> if

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
important so it's basically if you if

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.569 
important so it's basically if you if
you're<00:02:55.209> looking<00:02:55.689> at<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.959> syntax<00:02:56.340> give<00:02:57.340> them

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
you're looking at the syntax give them

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.240 
you're looking at the syntax give them
almost<00:02:58.510> anything<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.409> could<00:02:59.739> do<00:02:59.889> but<00:03:00.040> also

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
almost anything you could do but also

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.170 
almost anything you could do but also
take<00:03:00.819> care<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.769> uppercase<00:03:02.769> letters<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:03.970> on

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
take care of uppercase letters and so on

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.460 
take care of uppercase letters and so on
so<00:03:04.680> case<00:03:05.680> sensitivity<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.819> important<00:03:07.720> just

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
so case sensitivity is important just

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.490 
so case sensitivity is important just
just<00:03:08.799> look<00:03:09.040> at<00:03:09.189> your<00:03:09.340> doing<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.329> as<00:03:10.510> described

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500
