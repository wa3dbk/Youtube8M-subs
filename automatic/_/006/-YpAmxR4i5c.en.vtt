00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
not making a lot of sense but I think

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.560 
not making a lot of sense but I think
you<00:04:11.280> guys<00:04:11.370> can<00:04:11.550> kind<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.790> see<00:04:11.970> what<00:04:12.180> I'm<00:04:12.270> going

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
you guys can kind of see what I'm going

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:29.080 
you guys can kind of see what I'm going
for<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.860> look<00:04:14.220> or<00:04:14.520> in<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.880> clip<00:04:15.270> I<00:04:15.480> guess

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.680 

and<00:04:30.620> then<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.830> get<00:04:31.949> my<00:04:32.160> bangs<00:04:32.970> i<00:04:33.360> guess<00:04:33.540> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
and then to get my bangs i guess the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.629 
and then to get my bangs i guess the
layers<00:04:33.930> out<00:04:34.169> of<00:04:34.260> my<00:04:34.350> face<00:04:34.620> I'm<00:04:34.979> kind<00:04:35.550> of

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
layers out of my face I'm kind of

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.850 
layers out of my face I'm kind of
attempting<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.330> French<00:04:36.660> braid<00:04:36.870> my<00:04:37.169> hair<00:04:37.199> I'm

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
attempting to French braid my hair I'm

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.590 
attempting to French braid my hair I'm
really<00:04:38.430> sure<00:04:38.699> if<00:04:38.729> I'm<00:04:38.880> doing<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.240> right<00:04:39.300> but<00:04:39.570> I

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
really sure if I'm doing it right but I

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.120 
really sure if I'm doing it right but I
really<00:04:40.050> liked<00:04:40.199> the<00:04:40.380> way<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.740> turned<00:04:40.949> out

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
really liked the way that it turned out

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.610 
really liked the way that it turned out
I'm<00:04:41.400> basically<00:04:41.880> just<00:04:42.180> like<00:04:42.870> doing<00:04:43.380> an

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
I'm basically just like doing an

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.040 
I'm basically just like doing an
opposite<00:04:44.400> braid<00:04:44.760> because<00:04:45.000> I'm<00:04:45.389> taking<00:04:45.840> just

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
opposite braid because I'm taking just

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.450 
opposite braid because I'm taking just
sections<00:04:46.470> from<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.740> front<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.130> then<00:04:47.250> going

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
sections from the front and then going

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.670 
sections from the front and then going
under<00:04:47.940> instead<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.419> over<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.320> I<00:04:49.350> guess<00:04:49.530> it's

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
under instead of over so I guess it's

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.800 
under instead of over so I guess it's
like<00:04:49.770> an<00:04:49.919> inverted<00:04:50.370> braid<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.180> don't<00:04:51.690> know<00:04:51.780> I

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
like an inverted braid I don't know I

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.780 
like an inverted braid I don't know I
like<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.260> way<00:04:52.350> it<00:04:52.470> turned<00:04:52.500> out<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.340> held

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
like the way it turned out and it held

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.340 
like the way it turned out and it held
all<00:04:54.000> night<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.419> I<00:04:54.510> like<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.780> how<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:54.990> got<00:04:55.139> the
