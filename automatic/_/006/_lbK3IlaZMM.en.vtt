00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:50.620
 I greet my partner my friend my soul and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.949
 very good thanks 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.969
 in this second opportunity I'm going to 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.090
 teach how to make a snowball 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.509
 Christmas these that move looks like the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.820
 snow is falling but if it is not going to be 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.850
 Christmas part referring to 14 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.850
 February 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.420
 for this craft we are going to need 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.930
 an empty glass vial coloring 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.630
 vegetable 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.820
 diamond two printed images for 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.409
 that the size is passed to the height and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
 width of your bottle take away a 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.610
 centimeter and those are the measures that you 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.850
 you must put the image paper contact 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.679
 water and a silicone gun for 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.479
 start paste the images you can 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.799
 use any type of glue in 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.799
 this case use silicone 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.549
 since it is also attached to the images 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.530
 we take our paper contact and 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.240
 we cut two squares of a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.960
 centimeter larger is that the image 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.940
 with those squares we will cover the area 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.250
 since we have the images covered 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.319
 on both sides we will take the lid and 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.700
 we will add enough silicone and 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.700
 we place the images 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.110
 add more silicon so that the images 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.510
 stay fixed we take our jar and 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.020
 we add the vegetable dye and the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.020
 diamond 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.180
 we also add the water almost to the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.370
 edge of the jar now we take our 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.890
 cover with our images and we put it 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.550
 inside the jar and we close with a lot 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.550
 a lot of strength 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.959
