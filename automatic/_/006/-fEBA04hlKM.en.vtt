00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 pano logic comes to a worker 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.300
 follow let's play gta 4 engine is almost 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.500
 The intro has already become popular 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.870
 at least I have my starting today do 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.139
 I do not want things from you anymore 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.550
 below in the description after entry 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.630
 Thoroughly he has in recent weeks 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.430
 below in the description applies to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.689
 enter a google forms wishes 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.410
 could this also has the two weeks 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.880
 pointed out 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.529
 The form is now 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.740
 closed and no people enter 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.869
 and now until the gta 5 release 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.440
 one day passes from fries to 26 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.670
 the first 2015 will now be nine 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.420
 you can imagine different things 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.379
 wished you started with the jeep 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.629
 grand cherokee 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.670
 no no that was completely wrong wrong 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.989
 starting with the range rover evoque 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.010
 but completely promised 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.090
 we also have it with the jeep grand 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.030
 cherokee So whatever the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.270
 has stood by and looked forward to it 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.859
 Although the virtual as well as they look 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.359
 So let's take a closer look here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.219
 not so perfect though is that everyone 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.559
 he has modeled very beautiful in front 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.559
 the swat valley is a sign for 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.619
 the government could say it could 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.470
 be more 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.759
 probably mega mega shit 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.020
 comments write because this can 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.479
 I see if that is not a texture 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.850
 or does not tear looks very schonmal 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.920
 fine made that there is one too 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.869
 texture courage made 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 The judges also look good that there 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:41.009
 top is not perfectly explored and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:44.360
 unfortunately only 2d yes that's a pity 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.180
 but this looks good too 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 info was by the way this dare the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.950
 I used to like I liked I 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.720
 liked the old race driver 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.869
 the next one especially this one 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 rear section here but then I have that way 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.780
 maybe make it possible 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.509
 and now after a while I like that 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.170
 but we do pretty well 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:09.420
 Kahlos so look at this 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.090
 completely flat 5 and ex tour provided 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.920
 engine but the engine is really somehow 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.350
 not in here at all 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.980
 same picture text so mediocre 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.420
 textures are not so well modulated or very good 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.810
 very little modeled out 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.100
 the same in here range rover 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.660
 shows, of course, and there 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:43.670
 two-dimensional ebooks and child 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:46.670
 trunk again the warning lights 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.670
 lb 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.380
 good if now but drive the times 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.490
 I have my pieces oranges that 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.850
 music and here we want a short time 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.850
 ancestors 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:12.030
 especially here should and here again the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.340
 Of course you do not light it that way now 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.340
 good looks but harmless 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.340
 I can play completely different 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.720
 she does not care much about accelerating 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.000
 speed up that much fat pretty well 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.850
 already in the shop 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.010
 then of course I am of course as always 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.420
 niko bellic first in the house here with the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.180
 dare thought in any case 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.939
 very many questions 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.140
 so finished such a dream that I 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.859
 not perfect but that's one too 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.930
 suv 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.710
 there one expects diverse 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.470
 unrealistic 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.710
 who kept well nicely 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.710
 acceleration over 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.769
 far too little only the camera pulls it 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.480
 know shit how is that 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.220
 in the front through the laundry look around everything 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.870
 see shapes like this and 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.739
 62 is a top speed 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.739
 I am also relatively close to 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:10.190
 164 under damage model looks ever 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.690
 good for gta 4 behaves that he 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.990
 So he already has a good job 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.990
 done 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.859
 of course, give gas again here 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.340
 and 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.340
 chip 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.810
 after the defeat come do not surrender 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.310
 but evil overall 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.410
 leads back 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.350
 that they first come back with zero and 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.569
 I have a moped from 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:45.969
 moved back 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:47.830
 such 285 against what, of course, then no 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.779
 big and I'm doing it's just gta4 it 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.460
 so here it is not a mature one 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:56.050
 damaged for burns expect 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.960
 that of course you pixel fast 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.819
 so 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:06.860
 a bit faster is also one 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.860
 bit of crashes with very good 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.830
 so 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.740
 and 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:34.850
 huge very many in any case 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:36.380
 damage in any case 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.820
 a very good damage model to me 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.800
 definitely like the motto down 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.170
 is of course in the video description 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.410
 the potsdamer for rating and indeed 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:50.930
 I would the mod of a so between 7 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.350
 and 8 out of 10 gb not one hundred percent 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.940
 for sure 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.220
 but I have the tendency to eight of 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.760
 ten the texturing is mainly 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.000
 good and let the modeling 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.040
 unfortunately something to be desired and that 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.810
 say texturizing point deduction and 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.400
 was modeling a point to deliver 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.620
 The enemies would bite too well 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.270
 it is generally the model here 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.500
 So the model of the vehicle is very good 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.050
 succeeded so with 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.940
 yes this stays with one 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.710
 eight out of ten was a very good one 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.270
 evaluations speak as I said down there in 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.310
 to describe the video 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.310
 if you down the fashion yourself 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.840
 learning it would be installed on the pc 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.690
 What do you care about the car for 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.220
 a maintenance yes and eat interest 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.790
 description given to funny gags 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.870
 on the left took plate almost play 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.690
 move because it gets 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.970
 play with the cheapest internet 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.010
 do I sell itself and the 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:50.790
 School study people will play your games 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:52.380
 more free online flight simulation too 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.810
 just the link to a video already 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.500
 enough advertising I am already looking forward to 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.420
 skepticism 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.420
 until the next time only the deep
