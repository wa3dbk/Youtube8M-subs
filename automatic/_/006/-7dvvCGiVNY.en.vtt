00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920

 welcome back to the channel the other way round and 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.280
 another brings us another analysis of a 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.530
 video game that promises a lot I bring 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.250
 a new trailer that has come out 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.070
 barely two or three days of the earth 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.920
 half shadows of motorcycles a game that 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.859
 I have reserved and that goes on sale the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.920

 one later for pc that will come out for 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.350
 November about December 10 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.930
 the game was enough to reserve it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.850
 but today I 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.520
 I'm happy due reserved with him 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.400
 so we do strikes dating from 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.830
 face and they do not fear over let's go 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.200
 watching the trailer so you can see what 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:55.720
 I'm going to talk to you in this little 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.100
 analysis as you can see is totally 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.320
 in Spanish 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.140
 subtitled and prescribes your answers 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.940
 voices and Spanish text is in another 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.160
 main character that we are going to handle 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.540
 that subscribe created speak suits 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.850
 specials or something else in the family 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.880
 yes sir chair media in the open world 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.619
 what I liked the most about the game is 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.040
 that by raising wind we can improve the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.470
 earth of moved whole practice in the 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.470
 map is a few dimensions so 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.660
 they say huge so huge 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.490
 and he had to do a kind of 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.350
 quick trip to perform as a 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.670
 map area of the engines and 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.130
 directly appears someone comes 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.580
 fast because we can make the play 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.420
 to get from a high point on the map 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.060
 because this basic Chinese map the town 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.880
 full around the tower my uncles 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.350
 auros this four rings 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.550
 indistinctly our of ours 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.690
 of good people from town 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.690
 spectacular so it seems 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.880
 we have the trailer as promised and two 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:07.349
 graphics a way to the true ones 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.190
 Peronists super guinness facts more 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.620
 striking of the game because the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.390
 expressions on the face of the penal 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.530
 can deliver it in four as 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.250
 you feel you feel fear you feel 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.840
 subsequent files 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.680
 it's awesome how we can fight 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.150
 against another one of the blow sauro and coma 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.150
 awesome extracted from rap 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.160
 a bunch of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.550
 and if the very improved 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.420
 in this game because we can see 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.260
 as 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.910
 you can directly make millions of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.470
 different practices to be able to pass 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.319
 three games is not that they force you 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.450
 to give and kill this person and they will 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.670
 They give a multitude of options as 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.430
 example you can go in stealth to go 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.770
 directly to chaos and seize that 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.900
 unjust town you have to look for the 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.720
 person and followed was in control and 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.350
 look for another great things in the system 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.560
 nemesis 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.260
 is that another character inside her 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.569
 soul let's say is that of a spirit 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.590
 then that soul of you you can leave 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.680
 of your body to for example see something 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.319
 before approaching or to look for a 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.410
 character or interact in a more 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.670
 simple and that character can also 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.739
 show that spirit to scare 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.250
 other characters still some ships by 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.269
 example 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.980
 another important thing is that in the world 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.019
 free 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.659
 it's awesome because everyone goes to their 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.150
 roll you can go and explore out there 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.650
 it's so easy for the world and we can 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.239
 tell you a pullover they are doing 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.010
 one thing and then come back and they're doing 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.599
 different value to another you can find 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.010
 Well, the steps on a mountain that 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.510
 can you find a creature reach no 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.519
 I was that statue can attack you 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.049
 attack again can be a very cell 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.060
 small in which in turn I slept can 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.860
 be a huge pain ta min 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.099
 and there are creatures we can try 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.980
 take them if they are wild and we can 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.870
 serve to transport us with it that 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.020
 take us over or use them too 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.079
 in battles to help us win 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.370
 even to scare cnr into a 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.980
 stagnant orc and dawn creature 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.530
 giant maybe if they are very brave like 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.290
 we know he can be a coward 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.890
 and run away and 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.160
 and they do not know about us this videogame 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.960
 has great things and the graphics like 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.480
 you can see are awesome gives you 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.160
 new huge duration the graphic and about 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.750
 all this open world is witnessing way 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.940
 and fighting system there are a lot of 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.770
 different combat bills for 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.830
 make different types of blow 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.300
 movement and we can make a pressure and 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.030
 a little parkour the logo people 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.310
 great in three for the mountains 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.830
 to be able to explore caves explore 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:02.360
 deposit 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.010
 underground areas of mordor where clear 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.350
 there is always danger that we are going to 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.420
 meet with creatures wherever 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.830
 gas but there are the times the game the 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.660
 character also as you progress 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.060
 the story is having more 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.630
 You can increase your confidence 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:21.440
 level will have new weapons and movements 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.150
 unlockable executions or very very 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.270
 very complete games I recommend it from 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.240
 truth and as soon as I have the game already 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.910
 in my hands I will bring gameplays to the channel 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.130
 of game so you can see it and you can 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.930
 take a little more complete analysis 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.760
 well these all the shades of mordor 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.230
