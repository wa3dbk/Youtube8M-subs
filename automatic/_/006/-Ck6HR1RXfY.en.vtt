00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.500
 Hello everyone, Alex and video on 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.140
 royal city on the line in this video i 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.210
 tell you about a bunch of leshrac plus this 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.210
 make the question who should I take and Shor 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.810
 can i take shadow daemon i can take 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.480
 scared at all you can take any camp 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.239
 any slowdown and a bundle will not 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.470
 they gave me quite well, but since I saw 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.470
 here is this fragment 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.570
 I decided to take a go plus I'm pretty 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.880
 not bad nuke on minus armor 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.770
 let's start as usual with the skills of Leshrak 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.100
 takes 3 diabolics for 20 takes grid for 2 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.230
 rip melts on two and one more skill point 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.990
 which stays you on the fifth level you 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.720
 will distribute dependencies on 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.750
 power is wide that is if he has time 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.810
 for 3 seconds kent machine skull then not 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.960
 time to swing too has set move 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.500
 to items Leshak buys two chicken 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.710
 gloves on strength and tango buys a lot 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.740
 hatchet shrimp for plus one stat 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.590
 tank game well now let's move on to tactics 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.510
 starting from the third level leg throws 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.520
 net on the opponent and starts towards him 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.380
 run up to give your ragtime 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.660
 but only the cancer begins to cast his 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.510
 become timing so that when the grid 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 finished page already learned to include 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.250
 your diabolics 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.790
 and starts using them to damage as well 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.040
 how much does it take off a piece of armor with its rip 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.190
 the ladies of the enemy because the principle is easy and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.350
 here's another plus foot why her 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.020
 I picked from the grid is impossible 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.019
 blink out so if you suddenly 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.260
 turned up on the line you can 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.230
 quietly kill antimag but most 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.019
 the main thing in conjunction is of course the conga 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.390
 have a little sat on the line a little 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.300
 killed opponents and go konretno 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.970
 other laziness do not need to get involved in farm 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.000
 better help your team 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.130
 gangs and pushes of towers with diabolik 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.709
 what are the objects set to finish 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.010
 the game will be the first sneaker for the player 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.310
 arcane boots which you then disassemble 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.820
 well, ie you will again arcane sphere 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.400
 Stages and from the arcane sphere collect power 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.180
 but gave this bill by turn or 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.120
 phases 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.720
 or castes which legs are convenient to buy 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.600
 hyphen play buy manta my secret and 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.180
