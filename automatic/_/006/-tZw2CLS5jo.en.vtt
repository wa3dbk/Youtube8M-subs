 the final version besides dj miller 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.920

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.320
 to confirm that your character will be the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.750
 then directed them by tim miller and they 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.970
 will premiere on February 12 , 2016 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 chimichangas possible spoilers for the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.860
 who are reading the series of comics 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.170
 ninja turtles double air publishing 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:26.820
 apparently of donatello has died 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 good not but more or less but who 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.560
 know in case they did not know the current series of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.540
 teenage mutant ninja turtles written by 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.659
 kevin eastman with creator of the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.690
 ninja turtles is a little darker and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.820
 we see a darker origin and not so 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.950
 happy as what we have always seen 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.659
 with these turtles eat pizza the most 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 recent number of this series the number 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.600
 44 we see that it drew and rocksteady it 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.210
 They face Donatello defeating him and 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.759
 giving him a hammer in the shell and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.940
 in the last image they make us think that 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.090
 is dead however one has already leaked 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.340
 image of the number 45 in which we see 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.200
 splinter taking care of donatello and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.450
 saying that he is between two 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.690
 worlds that your body is damaged but 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.760
 that his soul is trapped in a machine 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.920
 It is to be expected that they will revive Donatello 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.450
 because having three turtles is like 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.600
 they saw them climb they have continued without john 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.690
 lennon the return of 10 files is very 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.270
 close in January it was rumored that fox was 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.310
 planning a revival or return of the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.490
 series the x files but that was 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.140
 looking for the creator of the chris series 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.240
 carter iii to the protagonists 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.240
 original david duchovny and gillian 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.360
 Anderson appeared very far away but 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.930
 this week tibi wise reported that his ex 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.690
 plans to order a short season of the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.150
 series that includes about 6 to 10 episodes 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.090
 the reason why they would be so few 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.190
 episodes is because they educate and anderson 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.670
 they have very tight schedules 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.800
 also according to tiny wise this revival goes to 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.570
 clarify questions that do not 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.600
 clarified in the original series and in the 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.030
 two movies and that cris carter is going to be 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.620
 the scriptwriter and executive producer 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.800
 I hope that the revival we see something like 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.800
 this 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.480
 as you will know marvel comics is going to 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.110
 revisit the world the secret wars this 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.140
 event of the 80s in a new series that 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.690
 will come out in May but in addition to this great 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.700
 event are also going to revisit another great 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.710
 event of the publisher is to say if bill 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.840
 ward the new series of cinema wars be 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.120
 written by charles soul and will leave the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.640
 terrain ready for the premiere of captain 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.470
 america civil war on may 6, 2016 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.440
 as you will know the original story the 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.680
 civil war was written in 2006 by mark 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.420
 miller and in it we can see that the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.730
 superheroes are divided into two camps 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.550
 after a record of registration of 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.980
 superheroes and the sides are the 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.110
 america captain who wants freedom 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.050
 of the superheroes and the ironman that 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.820
 seeks more security and allying with the 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.310
 government according to said soul for a 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.230
 interview gets what you plan is 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.600
 have the same premise in which there is a 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.970
 debate between security and freedom 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.340
 but take this to make a story 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.780
 much larger in which the act of 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.040
 superhero record is thing of the 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.680
 past and more 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.600
 it's a world in which things have 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.700
 changed drastically after a 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.770
 war between superheroes and that is going to 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.140
 include all the characters 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.370
 existing marvel as it's going to be for 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.070
 include all the characters 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.810
 existing marvel I have no idea but 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.330
 probably marvel studios is going to 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.670
 be based on this new version of civil 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.590
 war and not in the 2006 for the script 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.780
 the movie and by the way talking about the 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.050
 movie this week with leader published 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.660
 an audition call that published more 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.820
 two studies in which it is confirmed that 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.950
 the date on which recordings will begin 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.320
 of this tape will be the first of April 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.330
 in Atlanta and together with this he published 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.920
 a synopsis of the movie which is 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.370
 basically the story that we already know 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.710
 but the interesting thing is that they are based more 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.360
 in the idea of registering the 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.370
 superheroes to work with the 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.070
 government but nothing is mentioned about 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.600
 reveal their secret identities so 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.700
 maybe you skip that part in the 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.710
 movie the truth is that if the next 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.140
 spider-man becomes peter parker 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.510
 It would be very odd if it only reaches the 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.620
 cinematic universe and already reveal its 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.139
 identity before the world 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.370
 in order what do you think of all these 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.960
 news received the same are 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.780
 excited about the movie and they 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.280
 like to read this new event 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.020
 related to secret wars tell me in the 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.210
 comments these were the news 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.490
