card<00:00:05.640> reader<00:00:06.089> problems<00:00:06.509> in<00:00:06.690> some<00:00:06.990> way<00:00:07.170> there

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
card reader problems in some way there

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.690 
card reader problems in some way there
is<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.680> SIM<00:00:08.069> card<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:08.940> right<00:00:09.150> now<00:00:10.099> but<00:00:11.099> if<00:00:11.639> we

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
is a SIM card in it right now but if we

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.570 
is a SIM card in it right now but if we
look<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.389> says<00:00:12.660> no<00:00:13.440> sim<00:00:13.740> now<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.280> tap

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
look here it says no sim now we can tap

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.970 
look here it says no sim now we can tap
on<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.059> look<00:00:15.929> at<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> certain<00:00:16.379> information

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
on it to look at the certain information

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.550 
on it to look at the certain information
it<00:00:17.369> also<00:00:17.520> says<00:00:17.880> notes<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.359> there<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.320> now<00:00:19.529> I

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
it also says notes in there and now I

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.920 
it also says notes in there and now I
have<00:00:19.859> had<00:00:20.100> some<00:00:20.670> problem<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.750> in

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
have had some problem like this in

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.960 
have had some problem like this in
before<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.500> did<00:00:22.680> find<00:00:22.980> out<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
before and I did find out what the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.720 
before and I did find out what the
problem<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.869> think<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> similar

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
problem was I think this is a similar

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.700 
problem was I think this is a similar
issue<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.170> I'm<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.560> is

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
issue and so what I'm going to do is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.529 
issue and so what I'm going to do is
just<00:00:28.830> switch<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.220> off<00:00:29.310> I'm<00:00:30.090> gonna<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.420> this

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
just switch it off I'm gonna get this

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.799 
just switch it off I'm gonna get this
screen<00:00:30.869> out<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.410> then<00:00:32.250> we'll<00:00:33.210> take<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.510> from

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
screen out and then we'll take it from

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.370 
screen out and then we'll take it from
there<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.399> now<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.059> new<00:00:36.450> case<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.809> that

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
there and now it is a new case and that

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.069 
there and now it is a new case and that
is<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.040> think<00:00:38.550> what<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> problem<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.899> because

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
is I think what the problem is because

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.350 
is I think what the problem is because
everything<00:00:40.590> until<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.489> case<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.700> changed

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
everything until the case was changed

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
everything until the case was changed
was<00:00:42.960> absolutely<00:00:43.500> fine<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> said<00:00:44.850> when

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
was absolutely fine but like I said when

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
was absolutely fine but like I said when
I<00:00:45.090> switch<00:00:45.300> off<00:00:45.480> I've<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> screen<00:00:47.039> off<00:00:47.219> as

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I switch off I've got the screen off as

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.600 
I switch off I've got the screen off as
you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.660> phone<00:00:49.309> SIM<00:00:50.309> card

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
you can see this is the phone SIM card

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.729 
you can see this is the phone SIM card
insider<00:00:51.090> oh<00:00:51.360> -<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> UK<00:00:53.610> SIM<00:00:53.850> card

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
insider oh - I think in the UK SIM card

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.150 
insider oh - I think in the UK SIM card
but<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.239> problem<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.719> M<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
but the problem is that M right what I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.819 
but the problem is that M right what I
was<00:00:59.280> thinking<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.660> same<00:01:00.809> account<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
was thinking the same account here it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.930 
was thinking the same account here it
goes<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> SIM<00:01:02.489> tray

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
goes in the SIM tray

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.490 
goes in the SIM tray
I'll<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.390> push<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> down<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.409> in

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
I'll just push it down so we can see in

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.200 
I'll just push it down so we can see in
a<00:01:04.530> bit<00:01:04.680> about<00:01:04.830> sir<00:01:05.040> okay<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> same

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a bit about sir okay that's the same

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.840 
a bit about sir okay that's the same
tray<00:01:06.479> what<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.740> SIM<00:01:07.920> tray<00:01:07.950> does<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:08.670> two

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
tray what the SIM tray does it's got two

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.149 
tray what the SIM tray does it's got two
jobs<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.689> he's<00:01:10.049> holding<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.680> SIM

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
jobs really one he's holding the SIM

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.700 
jobs really one he's holding the SIM
card<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:11.760> place<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.390> two<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:13.590> he

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
card in the right place and two as he

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.460 
card in the right place and two as he
goes<00:01:13.860> pushed<00:01:14.130> down<00:01:14.400> he<00:01:15.060> should<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.450> pushing<00:01:15.659> on

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
goes pushed down he should be pushing on

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
goes pushed down he should be pushing on
that<00:01:16.830> set<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.159> contacts<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.909> what<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that set of contacts there what that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.380 
that set of contacts there what that
does<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.320> open<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.070> contacts<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> phone

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
does is open so contacts up so the phone

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.590 
does is open so contacts up so the phone
knows<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.380> there's<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> SIM<00:01:22.890> card<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.340> there

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
knows that there's a SIM card in there

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
knows that there's a SIM card in there
but<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:25.320> can't<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.939> isn't

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
but it can't do that because it isn't

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.960 
but it can't do that because it isn't
going<00:01:27.360> down<00:01:27.479> far<00:01:27.900> enough<00:01:27.930> even<00:01:28.710> though<00:01:28.970> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
going down far enough even though the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.850 
going down far enough even though the
SIM<00:01:30.210> card<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.659> all<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> way<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> same

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
SIM card is all the way in the same

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.700 
SIM card is all the way in the same
counts<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> what's<00:01:33.930> happening<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
counts right so what's happening now I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.090 
counts right so what's happening now I
think<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> new<00:01:36.450> case<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
think is to do with the new case and the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.800 
think is to do with the new case and the
sort<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.400> placement<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> screw<00:01:39.509> holes

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
sort of placement of all the screw holes

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.980 
sort of placement of all the screw holes
for<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.250> mainboard

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
for the mainboard

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.999 
for the mainboard
now<00:01:42.990> they're<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.259> far<00:01:43.500> enough<00:01:43.619> up<00:01:43.829> they

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
now they're not far enough up they

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.760 
now they're not far enough up they
should<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.399> maybe<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:45.570> millimeter<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
should be maybe a millimeter to a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.010 
should be maybe a millimeter to a
millimeter<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> half<00:01:47.759> further<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.840> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
millimeter and a half further up so that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
millimeter and a half further up so that
that<00:01:49.049> gap<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.950> shouldn't<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.090> there

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that gap there shouldn't really be there

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.200 
that gap there shouldn't really be there
at<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.159> need<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:54.030> he's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
at all so what I need to do really he's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.050 
at all so what I need to do really he's
trying<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> close<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.439> gap<00:01:55.680> somehow<00:01:56.070> know

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
trying to close that gap somehow know

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.760 
trying to close that gap somehow know
what<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.079> put<00:01:58.290> something

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
what I'm going to do is put something

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
what I'm going to do is put something
very<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:59.369> thin<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.409> soft<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.540> top

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
very very thin and soft just on the top

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.660 
very very thin and soft just on the top
of<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.320> contact<00:02:04.770> there

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
of that contact there

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.719 
of that contact there
so<00:02:06.670> what<00:02:06.910> that'll<00:02:07.150> do<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.360> push<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:08.050> down<00:02:08.729> like

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
so what that'll do is push it down like

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.350 
so what that'll do is push it down like
that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
that

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.130 
that
as<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.830> sim<00:02:12.040> card<00:02:12.070> tray<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.640> pushed<00:02:12.940> down<00:02:13.140> open

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
as the sim card tray is pushed down open

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.930 
as the sim card tray is pushed down open
up<00:02:14.200> those<00:02:14.380> contacts<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.280> then<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> phone<00:02:15.760> all

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
up those contacts and then the phone all

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.680 
up those contacts and then the phone all
know<00:02:16.150> when<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:17.080> SIM<00:02:17.290> card<00:02:17.320> is<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.830> there<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.330> I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
know when a SIM card is in there so I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.270 
know when a SIM card is in there so I
just<00:02:20.020> need<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.230> look<00:02:20.470> for<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.710> solution<00:02:20.980> as<00:02:21.250> to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
just need to look for a solution as to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.460 
just need to look for a solution as to
how<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:21.520> do<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.180> then<00:02:22.750> we'll<00:02:22.990> show<00:02:23.140> here

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
how to do that and then we'll show here

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.090 
how to do that and then we'll show here
we<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.660> solution<00:02:25.660> that's<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:26.860> place

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
we have the solution that's in place

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.170 
we have the solution that's in place
right<00:02:27.340> now<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.080> see<00:02:29.730> hopefully<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
right now we can see hopefully in the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
right now we can see hopefully in the
light<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:32.760> sort<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.850> dark<00:02:34.090> area<00:02:34.570> there<00:02:34.810> above

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
light that sort of dark area there above

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.110 
light that sort of dark area there above
the<00:02:35.410> contacts<00:02:36.070> it's<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.310> small<00:02:36.580> bit<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.790> foam

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
the contacts it's a small bit of foam

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.950 
the contacts it's a small bit of foam
that's<00:02:38.460> it's<00:02:39.460> just<00:02:39.730> like<00:02:40.330> they<00:02:40.510> filled<00:02:40.810> out

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
that's it's just like they filled out

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.160 
that's it's just like they filled out
the<00:02:41.140> gap<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.970> allowed<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.420> bottom<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
the gap and allowed the bottom of the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.920 
the gap and allowed the bottom of the
SIM<00:02:44.350> card<00:02:44.380> tray<00:02:44.770> here<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:46.180> push<00:02:46.480> down<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
SIM card tray here to push down the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.040 
SIM card tray here to push down the
south<00:02:47.350> contacts<00:02:47.950> know<00:02:48.160> what<00:02:48.310> I'll<00:02:48.430> do

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
south contacts know what I'll do

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.820 
south contacts know what I'll do
-<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.950> gap<00:02:51.220> up<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:53.050> can<00:02:53.200> see<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.410> contacts

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
- that gap up you can see the contacts

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.030 
- that gap up you can see the contacts
move<00:02:54.040> up<00:02:54.870> right<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.080> just<00:02:56.620> pressing<00:02:56.950> him

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
move up right then just pressing him

should now know that the sim card is in

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.810 
should now know that the sim card is in
there<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.090> should<00:03:13.239> start<00:03:13.480> reading<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.989> now

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
there and it should start reading it now

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
come out just like usual so that isn't

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.660 
come out just like usual so that isn't
affected<00:03:28.020> will<00:03:29.020> it<00:03:29.140> be<00:03:29.230> stuck<00:03:29.560> there<00:03:29.800> or<00:03:30.640> just

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
affected will it be stuck there or just

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.930 
affected will it be stuck there or just
hold<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.060> upside<00:03:31.180> down<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.870> still<00:03:32.050> stays<00:03:32.320> there

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
hold it upside down it still stays there

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.470 
hold it upside down it still stays there
will<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.060> mean<00:03:34.180> stuck<00:03:34.420> now<00:03:34.800> it<00:03:36.209> isn't<00:03:37.209> going<00:03:37.390> to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
will it mean stuck now it isn't going to

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.290 
will it mean stuck now it isn't going to
come<00:03:37.630> out<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.930> isn't<00:03:38.080> going<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.440> ever<00:03:39.070> have

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
come out it isn't going to ever have

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.000 
come out it isn't going to ever have
problems<00:03:40.300> in<00:03:40.450> any<00:03:40.570> way<00:03:40.750> from<00:03:41.080> falling<00:03:41.920> out

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
problems in any way from falling out

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.470 
problems in any way from falling out
becoming<00:03:42.340> dislodged<00:03:42.580> getting<00:03:43.150> in<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.300> way<00:03:43.450> or

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
becoming dislodged getting in the way or

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.930 
becoming dislodged getting in the way or
anything<00:03:43.660> like<00:03:44.080> that<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.530> every<00:03:44.950> time<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
anything like that so every time the

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.699 
anything like that so every time the
same<00:03:46.090> candies<00:03:46.510> pots<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:46.930> as<00:03:47.230> I've<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.560> done

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
same candies pots in as I've just done

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.580 
same candies pots in as I've just done
it<00:03:47.830> again<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.820> opens<00:03:48.970> up<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.330> contacts<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.050> it

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
it again it opens up the contacts and it

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.620 
it again it opens up the contacts and it
should<00:03:50.739> work<00:03:50.769> properly<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.580> next<00:03:51.880> I'm<00:03:52.570> going

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
should work properly so next I'm going

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.600 
should work properly so next I'm going
to<00:03:52.810> put<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.959> screen<00:03:53.170> back<00:03:53.230> up<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.310> we'll<00:03:54.459> see

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
to put the screen back up and we'll see
