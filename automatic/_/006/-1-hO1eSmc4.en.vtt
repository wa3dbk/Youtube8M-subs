the end of the day these are rare cars

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
the end of the day these are rare cars
so<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> will<00:01:28.530> take<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.860> some<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.280> find

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so it will take you some time to find

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.920 
so it will take you some time to find
one<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> these<00:01:29.909> or<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.390> least<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
one of these or at least get one of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
one of these or at least get one of
these<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> spawn<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.490> want

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
these to spawn in but if you really want

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.950 
these to spawn in but if you really want
to<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.060> these<00:01:33.119> cars<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.630> born<00:01:33.840> in

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to get one of these cars that's born in

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.749 
to get one of these cars that's born in
my<00:01:34.350> only<00:01:34.530> recommendations<00:01:35.250> are<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
my only recommendations are that you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.219 
my only recommendations are that you
keep<00:01:35.909> driving<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.509> down<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> road<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
keep driving up and down the road and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
keep driving up and down the road and
eventually<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.100> spawn<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.460> another

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
eventually one will spawn in another

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.760 
eventually one will spawn in another
recommendation<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.049> will<00:01:40.200> also<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.590> if

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
recommendation that I will also have if

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.050 
recommendation that I will also have if
you<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.159> want<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.700> these<00:01:41.790> cars

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you really want to get one of these cars

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.700 
you really want to get one of these cars
to<00:01:42.210> spawn<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.659> its<00:01:43.020> keep<00:01:43.229> finding<00:01:43.470> new

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
to spawn in its keep finding new

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
to spawn in its keep finding new
sessions<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.340> by<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.670> from<00:01:44.759> game<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.180> game

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
sessions and by going from game to game

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.270 
sessions and by going from game to game
eventually<00:01:46.140> one<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.290> these<00:01:46.470> cars<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.979> spawn

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
eventually one of these cars will spawn

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.010 
eventually one of these cars will spawn
in<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.939> something<00:01:48.390> which<00:01:48.509> I'm<00:01:48.630> sure<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> lot<00:01:48.990> of
