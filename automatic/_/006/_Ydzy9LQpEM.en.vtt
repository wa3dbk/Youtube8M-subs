00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.330
 The 90s differed from the present day in that games at the time 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.500
 there was a concept of color. The games did not have to be gray-bored and sad. Pretty ironic 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.210
 is in this context aware that the Epic Games, which thanks to Gears of 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.480
 War has significantly contributed to the present state of affairs 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.610
 also responsible for one of the most colorful and positive 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.260
 platformers in history. Of course, you already know, assuming you can read 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.350
 labels of links in which you click, that we are talking about a cult and a little forgotten already 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.920
 Jazz Jackrabbit series. 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.860
 Jazz Jackrabbit 2 had everything to expect after a good one 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.520
 platformer, including a plethora of boards to choose from. The game has been divided 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.460
 for chapters. Each of them is played in a different land, and graphic designers can not 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.010
 refuse fantasy. Beaches, Easter lands, haunted houses, castles, 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.840
 laboratories, and even, like in Sonic, the intestines of the flippers. In addition 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.050
 Jazz is filled with references to pop culture, hidden locations, codes and 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 Easter eggs. In short: a paradise for seekers. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.500
 The main characters are Jazz, Spaz and if we have the addition "The Secret Files", 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.410
 Lori. Three rabbits traveling in time and space with the mission of saving Eve, 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.530
 Jazz fiancÃ©e kidnapped by the mega Devan Shell. Everyone from 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.250
 Heroes have a unique attack ability that distinguishes him from the background 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.180
 remained and allows you to get to places inaccessible to the rest. his 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.120
 we choose the character at the beginning of the game and unfortunately, excluding the special 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.200
 we will not be able to change it during the game. 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.310
 If built-in scenarios are not enough for us, we can also take advantage of 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.970
 an attached board editor to create your own, or download additional from the internet. 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.610
 Some editions also included a collection of the best scenarios 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.110
 created by players. 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.630
 Jazz focuses on collecting and breaking score records. During the game, we can 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.520
 collect jewels, new weapons, which in total are available in the game up to 9, 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.730
 find powerups, carrots and so on. 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.800
 Apart from Singles, Jazz also has a quite extended multi-mode mode. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.100
 We can play locally on one computer using the split-screen option 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.660
 and in this configuration, complete the campaign together or face yourself in 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.590
 one of the skirmish modes, or capture the flag. Also not forgotten 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.950
 Forever Alone players who can play on the internet in a skirmish, capture 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.770
 the flag, or the treasure hunt. Unfortunately, they can cooperate about the cooperative campaign 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.320
 only dream. This playable is only locally. 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.850
 For me personally, however, Jazz Jackrabbit 2 is quite specific 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.550
 a game case whose heart is not gameplay, but a sound setting. hearing 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.740
 title, I hint at the theme of the guide, and identify the screenshots with the path 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.280
 flying from the picture board in the background. Do you understand what I'm aiming for? My 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.250
 In a humble opinion, the soundtrack of this game is in the forefront 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.510
 the best gaming music of all time. Audio is just a great mix 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.430
 reminiscent of the classic chip-tuning works of the era 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.100
 amigi and komodorka mixed with modern samples. 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.570
 However, the most beautiful is that thanks to the stylized, hand-drawn graphics and 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.530
 deliberately oldschool Jazz music practically did not age. Although 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.510
 the younger generations will turn their noses on the slightly smashing resolution, 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.320
 every self-respecting player will appreciate great gameplay, tempo of action, humor and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.100
 artistic attachment to detail. I recommend it to all fans 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.380
 good retroplayers.
