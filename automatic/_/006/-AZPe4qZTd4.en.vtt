00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.900
 first warnings I had and now 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.549
 Let's talk about something else is a 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.950
 thing is relatively important and 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.849
 what does the board mean? 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.609
 what's that 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.709
 the law he did not die looks and have much 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.319
 year already gave up the project and who 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.390
 knows that they live poop and these days and 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.450
 Leave it to us these days we make some 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.659
 two days and left for us is a 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.549
 image on facebook and not on twitter 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.290
 I'll leave the background image for 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.060
 You certainly or in the description I do not know 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.889
 right what to do with this picture but 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.560
 He left an image of an image. 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.420
 cool, I find it interesting but it's good 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.430
 quote what he said twitter and spoke 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.950
 I'm sorry for the lack of post he is 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.500
 very busy and are busy at the moment 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.510
 what the botafogo is a progress of 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.909
 way a good way 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.370
 and here is a screenshot of what the board 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.290
 the recent mascot than the board then 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.629
 so you will notice that there is a class 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.579
 different looks like a kind of copper or 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.019
 a guy who is a skull 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.000
 I found the class very interesting. 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.400
 people it reminds me a little of that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.069
 bug that has in the kazooie banjo he speaks 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.019
 in itaporanga and but I found it a lot 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.900
 interesting precipitate mounted from this 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.239
 I remember you, I write, I write, and you. 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.030
 should also have in the screenshot or maybe 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.430
 joining all this upset me but they can 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.650
 have stayed there will show the life of the 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.799
 mount the pet if it did not want to 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.840
 right and this new class of him and I found 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.889
 well cool the look of the game also beautiful 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.060
 you can see that the lighting also 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:59.260
 best appearance game is well colored 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.879
 you can not see that a line is already 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.079
 making much progress with the game is a 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.370
 progress that I believe all of us 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.900
 we are waiting for you to continue 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.569
 happening until the moment the game 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.010
 bid and just as you guys continue 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.090
 Looking forward to the game's game launch 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.919
 did not advance 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.299

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.849

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.169

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.940
 São Paulo and I just wanted to leave this 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.919

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.840
 that he has not died yet 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.250

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.930
