 this is philips jessi 670 and today we 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.170
 look at what he is capable of it 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.570
 the design consists of two parts 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.750
 Main unit and hanger stand 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.980
 the design of the main unit reigns minimalism 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.289
 top small screen with two buttons 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 on the sides of these buttons is regulated 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 steam jet power and there are five 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.230
 possible positions on the screen 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.150
 power scale and others displayed 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.300
 signals near the installation hole 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.950
 hangers and hose hole in front 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 removable water tank 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.920
 with a volume of 2 and 1 liters below two buttons 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.170
 for feet like a vacuum cleaner 1 on off 2 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.390
 winding cord and worth the steamer on 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.440
 two legs and two wheels on which 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.969
 it is easy to transport 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.219
 there is still a secret department for 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.100
 accessories or just a place to 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.000
 stash top set 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.859
 telescopic hanger true 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.690
 the design will not allow to wear it 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.969
 children's things but in this case there is 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.510
 special clips right there holder for 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.360
 nozzles 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.610
 All this hanger collected so bad about what 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.530
 evidenced by squeaks and noises when 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.650
 the slightest physical impact 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.840
 all assembled from plastic and the hose has 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.990
 horse winding to avoid risk from 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.360
 him get burned hose length 125 meters and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.579
 rack height is about the same true 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.829
 not quite comfortable to iron the hem 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.200
 long dress and jumpsuit high 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.360
 of a man, but who is now wearing 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.740
 coveralls except children and archers and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.020
 auto locksmith and steam served 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.780
 directly from the nozzle at the end of the hose 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.180
 there are nozzles on them too 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.549
 several for collars and for shooters 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.590
 on the pants is still included thief 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.439
 so as not to get burned by steam 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.020
 brush and a small pillow of a nap if suddenly 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.060
 need to also clean your clothes smooth 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.979
 folds with this iron easier 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.290
 simple power is enough to 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.570
 level even coarse fabric for a couple 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.210
 movements can still not be afraid to iron 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.789
 wool made of strong silk and fine 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.009
 synthetics due to low temperature 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.350
 works about 100 degrees and and unreal 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.810

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.360
 cool that fluffy clothes aren't 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.790

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.060
 iron 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.590
 In general, irons and steamers are a bit 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.109
 specific device but specifically 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.719
 This is a very simple and straightforward and management 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:25.599
 his reasonableness and reliability overshadowed 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:28.150
 even minor bugs in the assembly therefore 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.420

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.760
