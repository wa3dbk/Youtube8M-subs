DMX address means and and then you can
choose<00:00:30.330> between<00:00:31.320> either<00:00:31.710> power<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:33.000> means

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
choose between either power which means

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.450 
choose between either power which means
that<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> gas<00:00:33.750> comes<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.590> straight<00:00:35.130> away<00:00:35.340> as

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that the gas comes on straight away as

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.100 
that the gas comes on straight away as
soon<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> apply<00:00:35.940> power<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> unit<00:00:36.390> off

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110

or<00:00:37.670> under<00:00:38.670> DMX<00:00:39.180> control<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> be

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
or under DMX control so I'm going to be

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.229 
or under DMX control so I'm going to be
in<00:00:40.649> power<00:00:41.160> mode<00:00:41.399> because<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> be

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
in power mode because I'm going to be

in power mode because I'm going to be
demonstrating<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.930> after<00:00:43.230> I've<00:00:43.290> shown<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
demonstrating this after I've shown you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.889 
demonstrating this after I've shown you
what's<00:00:43.800> inside<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.390> there's<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> baggage

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
what's inside it so there's a baggage

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.439 
what's inside it so there's a baggage
catch<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:47.360> when<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> open<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.010> a

releasing the liquid butane that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.350 
releasing the liquid butane that
propellant<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:36.090> would<00:01:36.270> have

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
propellant in here and it would have

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
propellant in here and it would have
been<00:01:36.420> nice<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.689> use<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.710> butane

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
been nice to use this little butane

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.160 
been nice to use this little butane
canister<00:01:38.759> that's<00:01:38.939> used<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.240> refilling

canister that's used for refilling

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
canister that's used for refilling
cigarette<00:01:40.590> later<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:42.150> doesn't<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
cigarette later but this doesn't have a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
cigarette later but this doesn't have a
depth<00:01:42.840> cube<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:43.439> quite<00:01:43.680> important<00:01:44.189> in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
depth cube and that's quite important in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.100 
depth cube and that's quite important in
aerosol<00:01:45.000> your<00:01:45.180> freshness<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:45.869> tube

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
aerosol your freshness as little tube

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.560 
aerosol your freshness as little tube
goes<00:01:46.290> down<00:01:46.470> inside<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> pressurized

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
goes down inside this so the pressurized

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
goes down inside this so the pressurized
gas<00:01:48.810> actually<00:01:49.259> blows<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> mixture<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.159> beauty

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
gas actually blows a mixture of beauty

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.499 
gas actually blows a mixture of beauty
and<00:01:51.020> aroma<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.790> important<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.390> this

one<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.690> case<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.400> it's<00:02:44.400> turned<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.940> at

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
one in this case and it's turned on at

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.710 
one in this case and it's turned on at
the<00:02:45.360> same<00:02:45.600> time<00:02:45.900> as<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.410> solenoid<00:02:46.799> valve<00:02:47.100> and

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the same time as the solenoid valve and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.680 
the same time as the solenoid valve and
in<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.920> unit<00:02:50.220> that's<00:02:50.430> got<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> DMX<00:02:51.090> facility

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
in this unit that's got a DMX facility

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.559 
in this unit that's got a DMX facility
so<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.709> DMX<00:02:53.100> controls<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.670> single<00:02:54.090> really<00:02:54.360> and

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
so the DMX controls a single really and

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.559 
so the DMX controls a single really and
when<00:02:55.410> there<00:02:55.530> really<00:02:55.560> comes<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.489> turns<00:02:57.360> on

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
when there really comes on it turns on

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.320 
when there really comes on it turns on
the<00:02:57.720> flame<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.580> obvious<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.730> course<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.120> showed

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
the flame and obvious of course I showed

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.150 
the flame and obvious of course I showed
you<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.569> front<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.080> it's<00:03:01.260> got<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.709> manual

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.680 
you the front that it's got the manual
override<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.790> that's<00:03:02.970> what<00:03:03.090> I've<00:03:03.209> got<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.450> set

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
override so that's what I've got it set

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.589 
override so that's what I've got it set
to<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.959> one<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.410> we've<00:03:05.069> got<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.400> DMX<00:03:06.060> by<00:03:06.540> the
