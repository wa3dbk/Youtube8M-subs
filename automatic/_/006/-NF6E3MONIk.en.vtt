that Christians perpetual agreement with

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.070 
that Christians perpetual agreement with
negative<00:01:19.650> past<00:01:19.890> experience<00:01:20.780> creates<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
negative past experience creates the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020 
negative past experience creates the
biggest<00:01:22.369> strongholds<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.460> block<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
biggest strongholds that block the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.249 
biggest strongholds that block the
purposes<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.720> God<00:01:25.250> now<00:01:27.049> what's<00:01:28.049> interesting

here<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.310> believe<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> main

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
here and I believe one of the main

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.170 
here and I believe one of the main
reasons<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.380> people<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.490> Christians

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
are pessimistic is because they're

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.100 
are pessimistic is because they're
actually<00:01:37.250> focusing<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> past<00:01:38.900> than<00:01:39.900> their

according to our future Romans 4:17 says

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.910 
according to our future Romans 4:17 says
God<00:01:59.130> who<00:01:59.460> gives<00:01:59.700> life<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.420> dead<00:02:00.710> he<00:02:01.710> does

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
God who gives life to the dead he does

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
God who gives life to the dead he does
that<00:02:02.130> by<00:02:02.280> calling<00:02:02.549> those<00:02:02.939> things<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.450> are

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
that by calling those things that are

that by calling those things that are
not<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:04.310> though<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> way<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
not as though they are so the way the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.619 
not as though they are so the way the
Lord<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:07.829> brings<00:02:08.489> transformation<00:02:09.450> is

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
Lord actually brings transformation is

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.229 
Lord actually brings transformation is
for<00:02:09.840> someone<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.500> call<00:02:11.160> themselves<00:02:11.730> by<00:02:12.030> their

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
for someone to call themselves by their

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.839 
for someone to call themselves by their
future<00:02:12.720> instead<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.170> their<00:02:13.290> past

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
future instead of their past

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.099 
future instead of their past
and<00:02:13.969> this<00:02:14.659> is<00:02:14.840> really<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:16.129> basis<00:02:16.730> of

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
and this is really the basis of

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.160 
and this is really the basis of
declarations<00:02:18.109> we<00:02:19.069> make<00:02:19.329> declarations<00:02:20.329> to
