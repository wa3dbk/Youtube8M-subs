00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
this is who we're looking at there and

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.380 
this is who we're looking at there and
as<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.549> mean<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:56.880> looks<00:01:57.119> quite

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
as you can see I mean it looks quite

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.899 
as you can see I mean it looks quite
dated<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.929> graphics<00:01:58.320> haven't<00:01:58.710> aged<00:01:59.490> very

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
dated the graphics haven't aged very

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.020 
dated the graphics haven't aged very
well<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.509> imagine<00:02:01.109> they've<00:02:01.469> done<00:02:02.030> decent

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
well I imagine they've done decent

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.300 
well I imagine they've done decent
upgrades<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.289> visual<00:02:04.679> style<00:02:04.950> over<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
upgrades to the visual style over the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.590 
upgrades to the visual style over the
years<00:02:05.659> but<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.130> know<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.160> mean<00:02:08.460> it's<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.450> so

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
years but you know I mean it's not so

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.999 
years but you know I mean it's not so
much<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> graphics<00:02:10.319> aren't<00:02:10.500> great<00:02:10.710> but<00:02:10.860> they

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
much the graphics aren't great but they

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.970 
much the graphics aren't great but they
don't<00:02:11.190> seem<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:11.460> optimized<00:02:12.530> my<00:02:13.530> computer

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
don't seem very optimized my computer

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.540 
don't seem very optimized my computer
will<00:02:14.130> play<00:02:14.280> metro<00:02:14.670> 2033<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:17.250> will<00:02:17.370> run<00:02:17.520> on

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
will play metro 2033 and it will run on

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.250 
will play metro 2033 and it will run on
the<00:02:17.790> high<00:02:17.910> settings<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.600> it'll<00:02:18.780> run<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:18.960> a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
the high settings and it'll run it a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.120 
the high settings and it'll run it a
decent<00:02:19.980> framerate<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.830> its<00:02:22.950> highest

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
decent framerate but this on its highest

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.820 
decent framerate but this on its highest
setting<00:02:23.430> even<00:02:23.850> though<00:02:23.940> I've<00:02:24.030> got<00:02:24.150> 16

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
setting even though I've got 16

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.630 
setting even though I've got 16
megabytes<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.099> RAM

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.520 

it<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:30.030> will<00:02:30.360> not<00:02:31.550> work<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:34.380> high

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
it just will not work on the high

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.970 
it just will not work on the high
settings<00:02:35.190> we<00:02:36.090> were<00:02:36.209> having<00:02:36.540> pretty<00:02:36.980> big

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
settings we were having pretty big

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.720 
settings we were having pretty big
issues<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:39.090> slow<00:02:39.480> right<00:02:39.510> down<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.580> this

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
issues it's slow right down so this

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.790 
issues it's slow right down so this
isn't<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.060> game<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.390> get<00:02:42.569> if<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.900> want<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
isn't a game to get if you want the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.890 
isn't a game to get if you want the
highest<00:02:44.310> graphical<00:02:44.880> power<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.180> mean<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
highest graphical power I mean it the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.270 
highest graphical power I mean it the
two<00:02:46.110> higher<00:02:46.350> settings<00:02:46.830> even<00:02:47.010> come<00:02:47.130> with<00:02:47.160> a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
two higher settings even come with a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.430 
two higher settings even come with a
warning<00:02:47.520> saying<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.690> higher<00:02:48.900> graphical

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
warning saying it the higher graphical

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.900 
warning saying it the higher graphical
settings<00:02:49.590> probably<00:02:50.069> won't<00:02:50.220> run<00:02:50.459> even<00:02:50.819> on

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
settings probably won't run even on

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.729 
settings probably won't run even on
