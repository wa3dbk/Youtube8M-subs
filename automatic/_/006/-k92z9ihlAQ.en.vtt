everyone<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.920> knew<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:26.210> then<00:01:27.210> yeah<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
everyone I knew and then yeah like I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.830 
everyone I knew and then yeah like I
wanted<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.640> go<00:01:29.790> straight<00:01:29.850> from<00:01:30.390> honest

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
wanted to just go straight from honest

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.179 
wanted to just go straight from honest
work<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:33.170> not<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.350> influenced<00:01:34.829> by<00:01:34.950> too<00:01:35.009> much

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
work and not be influenced by too much

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.140 
work and not be influenced by too much
because<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.970> too<00:01:36.119> much

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
because if I think about it too much

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.850 
because if I think about it too much
then<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.930> start<00:01:37.470> thinking<00:01:37.710> about<00:01:37.740> what

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
then I start thinking about what

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.710 
then I start thinking about what
everybody<00:01:38.280> else<00:01:38.460> wants<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.420> might

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
everybody else wants or what you might

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.999 
everybody else wants or what you might
want<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.229> don't<00:01:40.350> even<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.619> know<00:01:40.710> that

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
want but I don't even really know that

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.700 
want but I don't even really know that
for<00:01:41.189> sure<00:01:41.220> or<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.780> needed<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.439> get

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
