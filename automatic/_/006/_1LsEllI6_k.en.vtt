00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.640
 Mood 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.640
 Yup 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.100
 In Well Advantages Disadvantages road 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:48.699
 Say when the Well of Tteyuu that the first of the main are you a Well now I kinda pretty abstract 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.370
 Without permission Well little spirit but I might have some people think I only stable thinks so 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.750
 It can be obtained specific way strongly Well sense of fulfillment 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.180
 In Well cheese something like that I 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.810
 Waiting for the so-called wide-ranging academic ability 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.810
 Can get 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.470
 Well of course to Well it's amazing happy if through it can achieve the goals that they have standing 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.080
 The 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.700
 Ann is possible to say 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.280
 More 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.690
 Oh, it's a merit, so that side new 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.610
 Itself to pass the test and do I need a moment to say also say 6 hit 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.960
 I think I say 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.270
 After all, even to the Well basically had to say whether then take what course 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.280
 Where the department 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:38.380
 It is out of the Faculty of undergraduate university 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.380
 The viewer still a little but I do not want to say so much is to say is I thought often 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:48.140
 Somehow the university somehow It is the foundation cornerstone Even if you enter the graduate school 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:51.110
 For example, it is a strange story in the undergraduate school, but there are still 3 East and West if you can live today 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.480
 The power of grade 5 is similar 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.540
 Weiss is Yes to say after all honesty 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.740
 Well think here whether it is good 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.730
 Well not this year , but there is still a real problem 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.159
 I do not admit that 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:11.060
 If you think so, it's all right 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:14.810
 While I was studying in the same department 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.470
 Somewhat nice and good form is name value, but something like name value 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.010
 Oh dear 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.519
 You can get it 6 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.519
 That's it 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.190
 Oh, it was the reason for the most unpleasant feeling and it was filled and thrown and threw it but after all 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.550
 All right 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.840
 If you say what changes if it changes, of course that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.860
 When it comes back when the name value changes, it's different in undergraduate racers 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.750
 It is also good to say 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.350
 Even though there are now 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.830
 That 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:47.580
 University think to have in quite a long time university I 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.360
 It is a building , not a curriculum 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.600
 The first place and the people of Tteyuu do is I ne large medicine such collection is the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.340
 That person is making a university 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.490
 If you think about that, the base will not change but it will change 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.460
 People around me change 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.030
 It means that 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.519
 Or buy it is weaned 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:14.010
 All and involvement but so is in the teacher be up to Toka Well students to say it 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.420
 It wintering your there is a person referred to in the pre-university occult he Tteyuu I will because I'm gatherings of people 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.950
 Ugly 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.140
 As a feeling 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:23.260
 I see you 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:27.610
 The back is also only Goyama and the sea I mean Truly deep in the mountains of the mountains of that Fukui until the time of the high school students in 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 It is I had to Do Well the countryside by people has been finished tied to my between the though with it 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:37.040
 Well I came out to Kyoto Maa brother 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:41.990
 Boo Boo box in the Well but now is a big fire ball under Irun of but brother minute 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.770
 Well, I think I thought I'm Ya Na take such a day 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:50.210
 After all, it says university life Well in that 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:55.790
 Tteyuu not teamed people still say so, I think seeing me Furikami I was in undergraduate four years 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:04:00.080
 Softening Toka brothers how softening lesson is great because it is that was impressive best to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:05.220
 Well only the snow Kanaka of Tteyuu such do and say 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:09.260
 It is only a matter of making good use of those people. 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:13.909
 After all the last thing left in the impression is to meet the person 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:19.459
 Now that say it or was that your friend the senior junior 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:22.639
 Well around and go, such Fu say you Moso but you might be or a pre-emptive teachers 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.450
 That one encounter in the broadest sense is the best 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:32.380
 Was a movement that was that my own experience 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.380
 Says I'm the person difference because in the difference of the University Well done and Given such a thing 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.060
 So really 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:42.720
 It 's amazing, so that's a strange story, though 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.710
 I just studied and put it in Kyoto University 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:51.450
 I'm thinking I can study myself, but until I'm okay 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.230
 Toka There's that other kind What also But without such a thing Why do not you like that entered at all 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.100
 What do 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.880
 Wow Naa amazing to have Well many people Toka Do you know these 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.520
 Well then I did not do my best 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:08.330
 In I thought was in that way but Well is not that many doing or of one of them 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.199
 The fact that meeting is changing 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:17.420
 Well, it's a strange story, because the university is dating 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:20.510
 There may be more or less words but sweet with that person- 1 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.420
 I I'm making the university a person people person 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.120
 Positive to say I meet with people around 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.460
 Well that much 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.770
 Come different 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:34.280
 I tried to talk a little personally 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:38.389
 Is that rough So Well that it Advantages Disadvantages 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.250
 The Tteyuu roughly Well benefits increased roughly about 3 points Well softening influence 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.490
 I studied hard and did my best 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:48.060
 To de It marked with force glad shop name Yappa 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:52.740
 Say Nette you have names mayday name Barry of undergraduate 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.070
 The third point Dema is changing the environment in the sense Tteyuu people bran That is because'm making the university 1 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.070
 be able to 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:04.129
 In Well to Ma Kimon or Hiroki I thing it means mon though Well Well Is the Which 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.399
 I think it 's narrow I can buy it out 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:11.179
 I 'm out before you in general 

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:15.490
 In correct though that this is also it's depending on how to find 

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:19.780
 There may be a so-called pitfall 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.139
 There may be a separate consultation about that, though there is 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.600
 The degree to which you want to study 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:28.710
 As here it is Could harden the 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.230
 It is that voice It is recommended in the wind that there is such a thing well 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.920
 Report the result 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:37.910
 I think I can do it, so I like myself 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.800
 With this , there may be places where it seems that you can go to yourself 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.400
 It is information gathering including 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.840
 That 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.330
 If it's an entrance exam for an undergraduate school, something is pretty and the meat is pretty and say it's a deviation teakler 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.610
 I have calculated it by the police but 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:58.229
 So here but it is not not objective difficulty index in the case of the sides I test 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:01.520
 Where it is unknown so far and you have to judge for yourself 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.520
 Now come where there is 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:09.070
 It is a mystery Seramachi south or Hilo basic Kumar 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:13.150
 I can not separate strong opponents, but there may be holes 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.770
 It also depends on the information whether you can find it in 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.129
 It is a place 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.129
 Yes 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.070
 annoying 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.070
