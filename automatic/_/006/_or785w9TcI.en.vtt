00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 yes hello people I welcome 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.750
 to a new video of me and that 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.679
 Today with the update video for gta 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.500
 online 1.13 patch or high life bsc 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.309
 that's what she's called next 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 should come 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.470
 is supposed to include new cars today 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.410
 Rockstar on the side where I'm on it 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.900
 The two cars were accessed in the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.300
 foreground and indeed the ducati 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.309
 masako and the patient whether loud now 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.829
 rumored to be still a huntley 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.850
 to come if there is one 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.670
 to be left open 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.680
 It should, I believe, open up 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 definitely be an off-road vehicle 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.530
 or several speak of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.450
 a SUV 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.030
 it may perhaps be the old hand 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.250
 because he's split from several gta than 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.250
 sporty suv was put there 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.820
 then of course more garage and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.270
 Apartments should also have two garages 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.530
 and two appartements with garages 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.500
 Of course that means you can own one 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.180
 can go up to and i do not even know 20 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.369
 Garages I do not know 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.510
 how much the most of the garages if the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.729
 pitches.ids most I think 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.600
 that was 10 I think mine 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.049
 garage ten pitches and it should be one 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.990
 give new tires and that the castle 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.439
 grab that's just a new weapon 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.390
 his 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.650
 Of course I think long range a lot 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.320
 to have a long ranger 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.659
 then there will be a new bike 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.780
 namely the banker trust or the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.610
 tinker trust mike was also the one 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.360
 speech 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.299
 and it should be new clothes 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 So give some for the new wardrobe 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.759
 things new clothes new suits 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 I think we could do that 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.939
 whole complete set of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.290
 kraillings accessories maybe there's yes 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.119
 new hairstyles and stuff 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.580
 you will see it all if the patch 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.160
 stars or 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.950
 if the steelers i am looking forward to 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.140
 Most on the two new vehicles 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.360
 I actually like the masako 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.740
 I would very much like to have that 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.090
 wonder what will happen and how 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.620
 long that still lasts there 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.420
 no official releasetermin and 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.340
 That's why it's just that 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.750
 wait over yes I hope you have that 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.340

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.170
