the old brick before we add any of our

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.039 
the old brick before we add any of our
new<00:00:11.309> base<00:00:11.610> material<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.480> run<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> plate

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
new base material we run the plate

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.670 
new base material we run the plate
compactor<00:00:13.290> over<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.099> subgrade<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.590> let<00:00:16.590> me

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
compactor over the subgrade and let me

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.500 
compactor over the subgrade and let me
show<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.920> our<00:00:17.130> new<00:00:17.160> base<00:00:17.550> material<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
show you our new base material this is

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.560 
show you our new base material this is
called<00:00:18.779> graded<00:00:19.410> base<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.310> goes<00:00:20.520> from<00:00:20.789> 3/4

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
called graded base that goes from 3/4

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.470 
called graded base that goes from 3/4
inch<00:00:21.750> stone<00:00:22.080> down<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.070> stone<00:00:23.400> does<00:00:23.699> want<00:00:24.330> you

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
inch stone down the stone does want you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.029 
inch stone down the stone does want you
to<00:00:24.570> spread<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.990> about<00:00:25.260> two<00:00:25.500> inches<00:00:25.800> thick

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
to spread this about two inches thick

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.439 
to spread this about two inches thick
and<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:26.550> we'll<00:00:26.699> run<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> plate<00:00:27.210> compactor

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and then we'll run the plate compactor

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.090 
and then we'll run the plate compactor
over

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.100 

the<00:00:31.520> next<00:00:31.790> step<00:00:31.970> was<00:00:32.210> to<00:00:32.240> put<00:00:32.450> in<00:00:32.720> a<00:00:32.810> string

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
the next step was to put in a string

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.530 
the next step was to put in a string
line<00:00:33.320> this<00:00:34.280> string<00:00:34.580> line<00:00:34.760> starts<00:00:35.330> at<00:00:35.450> a

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
line this string line starts at a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.750 
line this string line starts at a
baseline<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.470> it's<00:00:36.740> the<00:00:36.890> same<00:00:37.160> height<00:00:37.460> which

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
baseline and it's the same height which

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.390 
baseline and it's the same height which
is<00:00:37.790> 6<00:00:38.240> and<00:00:38.420> 3/4<00:00:38.990> inches<00:00:39.020> below<00:00:39.650> the<00:00:39.800> top<00:00:40.130> of<00:00:40.160> the

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
is 6 and 3/4 inches below the top of the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.420 
is 6 and 3/4 inches below the top of the
step<00:00:40.640> runs<00:00:41.420> across<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:41.840> patio<00:00:42.440> all<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.340> way

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
step runs across the patio all the way

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.880 
step runs across the patio all the way
over<00:00:43.700> to<00:00:43.850> our<00:00:43.880> back<00:00:44.180> line<00:00:44.450> now<00:00:45.290> this<00:00:45.500> is<00:00:45.680> here

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
over to our back line now this is here

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.119 
over to our back line now this is here
because<00:00:46.130> I<00:00:46.550> wanted<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:47.030> graded<00:00:47.450> base<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.930> be

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
because I wanted the graded base to be

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.750 
because I wanted the graded base to be
exactly<00:00:49.150> 3<00:00:50.150> inches<00:00:50.770> below<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:51.949> string<00:00:52.580> line

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
exactly 3 inches below the string line

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.310 
exactly 3 inches below the string line

on that rail we're going to go over it
again<00:01:43.000> this<00:01:43.360> is<00:01:43.420> just<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.840> first<00:01:44.020> pass

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
again this is just the first pass

getting it close this is the one that

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.520 
getting it close this is the one that
counts<00:01:48.570> okay<00:01:49.570> we<00:01:49.720> got<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.900> go<00:01:49.990> back<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.380> see

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
counts okay we got to go back and see

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.080 
counts okay we got to go back and see
how<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.680> have<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.890> hole<00:01:51.130> if<00:01:51.430> there's<00:01:51.970> a

how I have a hole if there's a
depression<00:01:52.420> it's<00:01:52.960> lower<00:01:53.410> than<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.830> screen

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
depression it's lower than the screen

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.980 
depression it's lower than the screen
that<00:01:54.400> means<00:01:54.610> if<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:54.850> put<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.119> paper<00:01:55.420> on<00:01:55.540> top<00:01:55.840> of

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
that means if we put a paper on top of

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.660 
that means if we put a paper on top of
that<00:01:56.110> we'd<00:01:56.259> have<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.409> depression<00:01:56.979> in<00:01:57.100> our<00:01:57.190> patio

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
that we'd have a depression in our patio

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.760 
that we'd have a depression in our patio
so<00:01:58.180> what<00:01:58.300> I<00:01:58.330> want<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:58.600> do<00:01:58.690> is<00:01:58.810> back<00:01:59.050> up<00:01:59.320> I'm

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
so what I want to do is back up I'm

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.520 
so what I want to do is back up I'm
going<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.009> put<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.220> little<00:02:00.400> more<00:02:00.610> sand<00:02:00.940> in<00:02:01.530> let's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
going to put a little more sand in let's

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
going to put a little more sand in let's
run<00:02:02.710> over<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:03.100> again<00:02:03.220> right<00:02:04.920> beautiful

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
run over that again right beautiful

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.300 
run over that again right beautiful
this<00:02:07.390> step<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.990> super<00:02:08.619> important<00:02:09.070> this<00:02:09.190> is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
this step is super important this is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.610 
this step is super important this is
going<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.520> determine<00:02:09.700> how<00:02:10.239> you<00:02:10.720> pay<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.320> sit

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
going to determine how you pay the sit

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.320 
going to determine how you pay the sit
so<00:02:11.769> we're<00:02:11.920> going<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.070> take<00:02:12.250> our<00:02:12.430> time<00:02:12.640> get<00:02:13.120> this

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
so we're going to take our time get this

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.390 
so we're going to take our time get this
right<00:02:13.600> putting<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.260> pavers<00:02:14.650> down<00:02:14.830> that's

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
right putting the pavers down that's

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.520 
right putting the pavers down that's
going<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.640> go<00:02:15.730> quick<00:02:16.019> I'm<00:02:17.019> going<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.230> come<00:02:17.380> down

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
going to go quick I'm going to come down

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.320 
going to go quick I'm going to come down
here<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.250> I'm<00:02:18.489> going<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.670> go<00:02:18.850> right<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.300> my

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
here and I'm going to go right to my

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.470 
here and I'm going to go right to my
90-degree<00:02:20.140> corner<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:21.030> there's<00:02:22.030> my<00:02:22.239> first

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
90-degree corner and there's my first

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.400 
90-degree corner and there's my first
paver<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.620> place<00:02:24.489> now<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.750> trick<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.140> pavers

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
paver in place now the trick to pavers

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.710 
paver in place now the trick to pavers
is<00:02:26.769> not<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.370> drag<00:02:27.700> them<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.120> sand<00:02:28.420> what<00:02:28.630> you

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
is not to drag them in the sand what you

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.800 
is not to drag them in the sand what you
want<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.019> do<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.290> click<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.220> drop<00:02:30.730> okay<00:02:31.480> you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
want to do is click it and drop okay you
