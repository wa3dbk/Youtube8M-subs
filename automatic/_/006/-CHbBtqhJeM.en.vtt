00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the past so you know they're just kind

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.720 
the past so you know they're just kind
of<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.039> they're<00:00:59.219> getting<00:00:59.370> into<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of not now they're getting into the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.679 
think it turned a lot of pressure off
Chad<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.729> he<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.090> behind

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
Chad you know because now he is behind

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
Chad you know because now he is behind

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
so something happens that you know he

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910
