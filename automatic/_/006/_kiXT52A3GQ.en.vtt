00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.410 
look at this it shoots all over the
place<00:03:25.510> see<00:03:26.200> two<00:03:26.770> in<00:03:26.950> three<00:03:27.250> shoots<00:03:27.910> at<00:03:28.120> every

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
place see two in three shoots at every

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.450 
place see two in three shoots at every
branches<00:03:29.820> okay<00:03:30.820> so<00:03:31.330> that<00:03:31.510> makes<00:03:31.780> four<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:33.280> can

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
branches okay so that makes four you can

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.930 
branches okay so that makes four you can
see<00:03:33.730> already<00:03:34.090> it's<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.930> lot<00:03:35.200> bush<00:03:35.800> here<00:03:37.230> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
see already it's a lot bush here and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.790 
see already it's a lot bush here and
maybe<00:03:39.940> not<00:03:40.210> quite<00:03:40.510> as<00:03:40.780> tall<00:03:41.610> almost<00:03:42.870> as<00:03:43.870> tall

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
maybe not quite as tall almost as tall

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.910 
maybe not quite as tall almost as tall
but<00:03:45.160> not<00:03:45.310> quite<00:03:45.640> okay<00:03:46.330> but<00:03:47.200> it's<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.560> lot

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
but not quite okay but it's a lot

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.170 
but not quite okay but it's a lot
bushier<00:03:50.340> so<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.550> means<00:03:51.790> there's<00:03:52.000> going<00:03:52.120> to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
bushier so that means there's going to

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.040 
bushier so that means there's going to
be<00:03:52.240> peppers<00:03:52.870> all<00:03:53.170> around<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.160> thing<00:03:56.040> versus

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
be peppers all around this thing versus

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.390 
be peppers all around this thing versus
this<00:03:59.050> one<00:04:00.120> that's<00:04:01.120> got<00:04:01.360> nothing<00:04:01.810> happening

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
this one that's got nothing happening

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.920 
this one that's got nothing happening
except<00:04:03.400> for<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.700> top<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:04.240> all<00:04:04.270> the<00:04:04.540> peppers

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
except for the top so all the peppers

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.030 
except for the top so all the peppers
are<00:04:05.080> going<00:04:05.230> to<00:04:05.320> be<00:04:05.440> just<00:04:05.680> on<00:04:05.860> top<00:04:06.450> okay<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:08.040> the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
are going to be just on top okay and the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.550 
are going to be just on top okay and the
one<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.250> chopped<00:04:09.730> off<00:04:10.030> here<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:11.320> should<00:04:11.500> be

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
one I chopped off here it should be

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.150 
one I chopped off here it should be
peppers<00:04:12.100> all<00:04:12.310> over<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.090> place<00:04:13.390> because<00:04:14.160> this

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
peppers all over the place because this

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.500 
peppers all over the place because this
branch<00:04:15.760> is<00:04:16.030> all<00:04:16.239> over<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.989> place<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:18.510> mold

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
branch is all over the place that mold

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.800 
branch is all over the place that mold
and<00:04:19.660> triple<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:20.940> that's<00:04:21.940> what<00:04:22.150> happens<00:04:22.570> when

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
and triple so that's what happens when

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.960 
and triple so that's what happens when
you<00:04:23.070> chopped<00:04:24.070> off<00:04:24.340> your<00:04:24.550> top<00:04:24.900> matter<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:26.140> fact

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
you chopped off your top matter of fact

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.090 
you chopped off your top matter of fact
when<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.000> chopped<00:04:28.420> it<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.870> don't<00:04:29.470> fight<00:04:29.680> six<00:04:29.920> days

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
when I chopped it I don't fight six days

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.580 
when I chopped it I don't fight six days
ago<00:04:30.280> look<00:04:30.580> at<00:04:30.670> that<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.120> already<00:04:31.900> have<00:04:32.350> one

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
ago look at that I already have one

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.060 
ago look at that I already have one
pepper<00:04:32.890> drone<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.990> doesn't<00:04:35.440> take<00:04:35.620> long

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.980 

but<00:04:38.820> as<00:04:39.000> you<00:04:39.150> can<00:04:39.330> see<00:04:39.570> right<00:04:39.990> there<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:41.990> chopped

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
but as you can see right there I chopped

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.350 
but as you can see right there I chopped
it<00:04:43.170> off<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:45.870> just<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.610> guess<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.790> had<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:47.970> put

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
it off and it just I guess it had to put

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.080 
it off and it just I guess it had to put
all<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.540> energy<00:04:49.050> somewhere<00:04:49.800> else<00:04:50.090> instead

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
all that energy somewhere else instead

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.300 
all that energy somewhere else instead
of<00:04:51.390> growing<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:52.020> started<00:04:52.500> widening

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
of growing it started widening

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.000 
of growing it started widening
so<00:04:53.970> all<00:04:54.450> those<00:04:54.750> shoots<00:04:55.110> can't<00:04:55.410> came<00:04:55.680> right<00:04:55.980> out

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
so all those shoots can't came right out

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.310 
so all those shoots can't came right out
so<00:04:56.970> there<00:04:57.240> you<00:04:57.360> go<00:04:57.510> folks<00:04:57.750> that's<00:04:58.140> what

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
so there you go folks that's what

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.640 
so there you go folks that's what
happens<00:04:58.740> when<00:04:58.920> you<00:04:59.070> chop<00:04:59.430> off<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:01.080> top<00:05:01.110> half

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
happens when you chop off the top half

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.870 
happens when you chop off the top half
of<00:05:01.920> your<00:05:03.260> pepper<00:05:04.260> plant<00:05:04.650> or<00:05:04.890> tomato<00:05:05.280> plant<00:05:05.640> is

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
of your pepper plant or tomato plant is

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.460 
of your pepper plant or tomato plant is
exactly<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.840> same<00:05:07.080> thing<00:05:08.630> okay<00:05:09.630> guys<00:05:10.050> thanks
