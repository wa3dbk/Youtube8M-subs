00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 a magnitude is welcome to the mind to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.540
 my channel in this short video can 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.220
 teach an application that needs to be 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.010
 recently launched which is going to 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.900
 Let us know if our mobile phone 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.719
 is original or not in this case I have 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.590
 The Samsung Galaxy S 6 and it makes phone 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.410
 I will do the test 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.140
 the application corresponds to the ones in 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 February 2015 has suddenly little 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.789
 downloads has about 50,000 downloads 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.380
 with moments were very surely is 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.510
 the way to grow because the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.090
 developers the developers 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.470
 that application are very good 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.450
 the name of the application is called 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.570
 Cantu 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.430
 official of the same creators of 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.490
 youtube on sounding as an application 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.080
 to know how good our 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.270
 phone to compare it with others 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.850
 phones that is started what 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.220
 they do so before officers of the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.030
 application that we are going to download 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.030
 we enter the play store 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.000
 and here we have it is this 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.710
 and this application what it does is 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.580
 compare with your databases me 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.020
 I imagine and we also have to have a 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.240
 laptop or a computer over 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.970
 desk to the bad since we need 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.729
 scanning a QR code that's going us 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.350
 generate on the computer screen 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.420
 so here we can see that it has 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 barely 50,000 downloads in a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.350
 young application 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:34.070
 the version version 4 2.1 and was released 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.840
 On February 11 , 2015 we are going to 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.140
 enter then with the mind mind to 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.240
 We opened the application when we just 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.220
 they install it in the soon it will be another 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.620
 another update to download to others 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.190
 add-ons and it does not tell you that we should 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.160
 enter our computer to this to 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.160
 this woman in our computer 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:59.720
 we enter that url and on the screen we 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.910
 will take out a small code qr which 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.100
 we must scan and we do it 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.980
 scanning you can do it we give here 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.890
 down tells us to be and scan the 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.200
 qr code that is on the screen we are going to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.820
 do this quickly accommodate the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.410
 camera for you to see how I'm doing 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.450
 to do good this what we see in 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.420
 our computer right now what I 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.770
 I give here is and scan the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.510
 QR code 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.860
 I have on screen 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.650
 in exit of the thief I left and ready 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.739
 we copy the code qr we are waiting for the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.209
 result on screen here as the 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.209
 Application is soon in development 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.670
 highlights a very simple vision of jesse 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.920
 the version of the team that I have 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.050
 to the extent that your databases go 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.940
 growing and we will have better 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:57.830
 results here tell us that I have 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.960
 that option sm 92 0 which is the one 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.330
 corresponds to the phone that I have here 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.700
