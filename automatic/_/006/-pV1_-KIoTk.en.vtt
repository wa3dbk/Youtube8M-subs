some heat because he couldn't win that
game<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.570> they<00:01:51.780> changed<00:01:52.290> their<00:01:52.409> focus<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
game and they changed their focus a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.800 
game and they changed their focus a
little<00:01:52.979> bit<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:53.729> started<00:01:54.030> focusing<00:01:54.270> in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
little bit and they started focusing in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.289 
little bit and they started focusing in
on<00:01:55.430> Oklahoma<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> that's<00:01:56.820> kind<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.210> they

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
on Oklahoma and that's kind of what they

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.399 
on Oklahoma and that's kind of what they
built<00:01:57.540> their<00:01:57.689> whole<00:01:57.810> year<00:01:57.840> around<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.320> think

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
built their whole year around I think

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.260 
built their whole year around I think
they've<00:01:58.590> made<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.250> focus<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.149> will

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
they've made it more of a focus and will

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.600 
they've made it more of a focus and will
be<00:02:00.390> interesting<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.840> watch<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.439> year<00:02:01.890> when

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
