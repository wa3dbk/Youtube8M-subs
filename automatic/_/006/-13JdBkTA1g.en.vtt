arclight<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.049> ability<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.740> pretty<00:01:47.040> much

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
arclight was the ability to pretty much

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.139 
arclight was the ability to pretty much
cause<00:01:47.549> seismic<00:01:48.540> tremors<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:50.070> stuff<00:01:51.000> like

cause seismic tremors and stuff like

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.249 
cause seismic tremors and stuff like
that<00:01:51.210> she<00:01:51.540> also<00:01:51.659> has<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.110> ability<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:53.100> arm

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
that she also has the ability to arm

that she also has the ability to arm
well<00:01:55.259> she<00:01:55.500> has<00:01:55.590> super<00:01:55.920> strength<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> since<00:01:57.329> her

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
well she has super strength so since her

and thirdly we have blockbuster who is
the<00:02:08.660> Michael<00:02:09.020> Baer<00:02:09.350> one<00:02:09.650> who's<00:02:10.190> also

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
the Michael Baer one who's also

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.770 
the Michael Baer one who's also
memorized<00:02:11.120> basically<00:02:11.780> he<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.440> an<00:02:12.830> assassin<00:02:13.780> on

off against the Marauders as other
bosses<00:02:31.060> which<00:02:32.060> i<00:02:32.210> think<00:02:32.270> is<00:02:32.510> pretty<00:02:32.840> cool<00:02:32.960> and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
bosses which i think is pretty cool and

we got three new pictures won't move for
me<00:02:36.530> at<00:02:36.680> least<00:02:36.710> this<00:02:37.100> one<00:02:37.370> pretty<00:02:38.150> cool<00:02:38.420> it's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
me at least this one pretty cool it's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.840

you<00:02:39.170> know<00:02:39.230> Deadpool<00:02:39.680> talking<00:02:40.250> here<00:02:40.490> as<00:02:40.640> well

that<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.900> me<00:02:42.110> looks<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:43.040> sentinel<00:02:43.670> head<00:02:43.940> so

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510
