with the core i3 ulv processor but we

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.289 
with the core i3 ulv processor but we
actually<00:00:14.309> just<00:00:14.549> wanted<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> give<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.150> look

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
at the touch here actually what we have

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.250 
at the touch here actually what we have
the<00:00:17.880> camera<00:00:18.180> will<00:00:18.330> show<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:19.050> thing

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
the camera will show you just one thing

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.290 
the camera will show you just one thing
with<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.640> ergonomics<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.090> fact

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
with the ergonomics here and the fact

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.550 
with the ergonomics here and the fact
that<00:00:21.420> when<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.199> your<00:00:22.289> lap<00:00:22.529> and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
that when you have it on your lap and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560 
that when you have it on your lap and
you<00:00:22.859> know<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.189> reach<00:00:23.760> over<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.240> something

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
you know you reach over and do something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.570 
you know you reach over and do something
else<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.260> actually<00:00:25.410> helps<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
else it actually helps like this and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.769 
else it actually helps like this and
we're<00:00:26.760> sitting<00:00:26.910> forward<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.539> will<00:00:27.630> already

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
we're sitting forward it will already

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.859 
we're sitting forward it will already
tilt<00:00:28.230> over<00:00:28.590> which<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> best<00:00:30.599> thing

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
tilt over which is not the best thing

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.190 
tilt over which is not the best thing
that's<00:00:31.080> because<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.529> pom-pom<00:00:32.369> back<00:00:33.079> not<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that's because this pom-pom back not the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
that's because this pom-pom back not the
best<00:00:34.320> ergonomic<00:00:34.980> decision<00:00:35.399> there<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.700> wanted

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
best ergonomic decision there but wanted

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.340 
best ergonomic decision there but wanted
to<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.210> quickly<00:00:36.390> show<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.719> sort<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.260> the
