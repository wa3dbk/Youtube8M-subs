00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
okay I don't think likes playing on

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.410 
okay I don't think likes playing on
multi-core<00:00:07.280> more<00:00:08.280> uh<00:00:08.309> chunk<00:00:08.970> loading<00:00:09.120> with

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
multi-core more uh chunk loading with

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.080 
multi-core more uh chunk loading with
multi-core<00:00:10.730> something<00:00:11.730> wrong<00:00:11.849> with<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
multi-core something wrong with the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.799 
multi-core something wrong with the
textures

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809

I<00:00:19.430> just<00:00:20.430> noticed<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.180> when<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.539> downloaded

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I just noticed this when I downloaded

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.269 
I just noticed this when I downloaded
Optifine<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.189> then<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:24.410> started<00:00:25.410> playing<00:00:25.680> with

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
Optifine and then I started playing with

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.650 
Optifine and then I started playing with
the<00:00:26.519> multi-core<00:00:27.330> chunk<00:00:27.750> loading<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:29.660> also

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the multi-core chunk loading I also

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
the multi-core chunk loading I also
notice<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.289> blender<00:00:31.769> when<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.099> put<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.550> on

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
notice this in blender when I put it on

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
notice this in blender when I put it on
GLSL<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.140> huge<00:00:34.800> meshes<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:36.260> uses<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
GLSL and I have huge meshes that uses a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:48.420 
GLSL and I have huge meshes that uses a
lot<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.710> textures

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:01:22.560 

mhm

let's<00:01:23.170> see

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
let's see

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.749 
let's see
let's<00:01:25.340> try<00:01:25.759> this<00:01:26.229> without<00:01:27.340> multicore<00:01:28.340> chuckle

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
let's try this without multicore chuckle

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:45.470 
let's try this without multicore chuckle
oh<00:01:28.820> game

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.160 

I<00:01:45.570> don't<00:01:46.260> see<00:01:46.440> which<00:01:46.800> it<00:01:46.980> is<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.370> far<00:01:51.020> what<00:01:52.020> in

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
I don't see which it is so far what in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
I don't see which it is so far what in
the<00:01:52.320> world<00:01:55.130> move<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:56.460> how<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.850> has

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the world move and that's how that has

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:09.410 
the world move and that's how that has
nothing<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.480> do<00:01:57.660> with<00:01:57.690> us<00:02:01.520> hmm

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.110 

must<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.440> because<00:02:10.740> of<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.430> multi-core

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
must be because of the multi-core

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.050 
must be because of the multi-core
chuckling<00:02:12.690> oh<00:02:13.110> well<00:02:14.070> now<00:02:14.460> something<00:02:15.030> strange

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
I found I'll direct you to redirect you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.830 
I found I'll direct you to redirect you
to<00:02:19.890> another<00:02:20.190> video<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:21.150> shows<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.630> same

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
to another video that shows the same

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.140 
to another video that shows the same
thing<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.320> I'm<00:02:22.440> wonder<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.210> yeah<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.870> I
