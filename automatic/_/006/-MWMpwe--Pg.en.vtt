00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.830
 break today with protests 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.000
 please 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.019
 thanks when you do not scale cast the 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.800
 I mail a postman on the everest of his 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.160
 wait 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.460
 great you are experienced climbers if 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.110
 you would not be here but the everest is 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.110
 the most dangerous place in the city 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.400
 good next time we climb together 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.640
 the three that your wife says 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.150
 It's been good since we divorced very 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.150
 good ones 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.670
 Mayor base camp feels 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.670
 witnesses get used to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.689
 the human being is not prepared to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.670
 support the flight altitude of a 747 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.009
 our body will begin to die 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.540
 the question is can we climb to the top 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.800
 and descend 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.800
 before it happens 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.070
 this time a few days suffering and 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.520
 You will be one of the few who have crowned the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.520
 Everest 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.160
 what 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.570
 no answer a storm is coming 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.260
 the valley my strong 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.260
 my god 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.000
 with people trapped and naturally 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:05.360
 now we have a problem is not left 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.360
 oxygen you will not leave you just go 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.940
 I do not want to die 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.140
 I liked it 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.140
 you have to go back 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.150
 if the subjects can you also I love you
