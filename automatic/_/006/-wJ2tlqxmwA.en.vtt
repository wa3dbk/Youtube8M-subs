me<00:01:48.539> about<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.740> makes<00:01:50.219> a<00:01:50.340> good<00:01:50.459> fight<00:01:50.729> in

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
me about what what makes a good fight in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.309 
me about what what makes a good fight in
this<00:01:51.179> game<00:01:51.389> so<00:01:52.429> basically<00:01:53.429> I<00:01:53.549> think<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.849> very

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
this game so basically I think a very

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.429 
this game so basically I think a very
intuitive<00:01:55.319> way<00:01:56.039> of<00:01:56.159> country<00:01:56.459> the<00:01:56.579> game<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
intuitive way of country the game is to

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.199 
intuitive way of country the game is to
provide<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.709> each<00:01:59.069> button<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.609> action<00:01:59.969> so

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
provide for each button one action so

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.199 
provide for each button one action so
you<00:02:00.270> will<00:02:00.539> have<00:02:01.189> one<00:02:02.189> button<00:02:02.639> for<00:02:02.789> jump<00:02:03.029> on

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
you will have one button for jump on

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.649 
you will have one button for jump on
bottom<00:02:03.419> for<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.569> chakra<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.289> forth<00:02:04.529> and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
bottom for the chakra and forth and

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.660 
bottom for the chakra and forth and
other<00:02:06.659> than<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.590> very<00:02:07.979> high

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
other than that we have the very high

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.270 
other than that we have the very high
quality<00:02:08.880> super<00:02:09.720> techniques<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.160> used

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
quality super techniques that are used

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.580 
quality super techniques that are used
with<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.030> chakra<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.819> this<00:02:14.819> gameplay<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
with the chakra and this gameplay is to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.490 
with the chakra and this gameplay is to
me<00:02:16.709> very<00:02:16.980> intuitive<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:19.140> tried<00:02:19.440> to

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500
