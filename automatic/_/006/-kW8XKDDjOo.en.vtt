00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.719
 Hello everyone so let's go straight to go to 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.420
 parse 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.750
 Metro in the intro itself is played like this 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.750
 figure 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.540
 she's very simple forefinger 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.610
 we clamp the fifth string on the fifth fret 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.010
 play it alone then we clamp the same 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.380
 the fifth string is better with the ring finger 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.950
 the seventh year and now we play just such 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.950
 rhythmic figure 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.520
 it's all easy the hardest thing starts 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.520
 then 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.830
 well here it is and so what we do 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.700
 pinch the fifth finger 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.710
 string in the seventh year and middle finger 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.620
 we clamp 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.750
 third string on the seventh fret first we 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.520
 let's play a more lightweight version then 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.790
 let's move on to how 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.790
 but in principle, the original is played and 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:02:00.250
 so we play two times the fifth string 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:03.810
 quickly continue to play the third string 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.810
 there we play the third in the ninth year 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.940
 yes we play heel three more times 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.290
 then play third again on 7 3 9 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.120
 and again we play the fifth three times 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.940
 Next, move the index finger by 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.730
 the fifth fret that is on the 5th string the fifth fret 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.430
 a little inconvenient but it is necessary to keep and 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.870
 we play all the same thing only here 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.870
 now 5 string at 5 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.720
 then hold the index finger 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.970
 the sixth string in the seventh fret play all 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.970
 same thing from the sixth string and 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.890
 then we change positions we just need 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.329
 clamp the sixth on the eighth fret but so it 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.970
 make it uncomfortable therefore a little bit 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.930
 change the position we hold the sixth string on 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.280
 the eighth fret middle fingers hell third 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.049
 the string that held hold 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.260
 index finger all the same 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.260
 edge 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.470
 now move on to the more original 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.470
 option 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.040
 here to this we basically left hand 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.760
 we play all the same but we are right 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.290
 all beats down a and just we still have volume 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.680
 its muffled strings i.e. 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.580
 It turns out here let's say the first chord 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.540
 we beat on 6 5 4 3 strings 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.770
 along these strings but 6 and 4 strings on 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:07.380
 drowned out and these should sound all the same 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:11.860
 same very first two hits 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.950
 then hit on the seventh fret 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.580
 kill the third string with another 5 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.630
 we fall on it and then here it is on 9 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.630
 video position 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.630
 further all the same we shift our 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.080
 forefinger on the fifth fret play 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.080
 all the same 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.790
 then at 7 okay that string 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.250
 and then also change the position and all 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.250
 we play everything absolutely the same 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.850
 Only a small note is here first 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.130
 chord can in principle fall on 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.130
 the sixth string is that it will be in the octave 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.480
 but then you need to turn off feel 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.780
 string well naturally here on the second 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.780
 chord 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.600
 in this lesson is over all thank you for
