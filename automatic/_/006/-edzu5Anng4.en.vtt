 similar to that of very 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.900
 interesting 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.119

 strong protection a well reinforced cage 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.640
 to ensure the safety of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.850
 survival of the pilot 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.330
 in the case of a very good collision right 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.950
