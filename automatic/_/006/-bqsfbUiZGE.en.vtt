00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
washer that holds all this it eventually

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.290 
washer that holds all this it eventually
starts<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.210> peel<00:01:34.420> all<00:01:34.510> over<00:01:34.870> and<00:01:35.620> of<00:01:35.710> course

the whole lot comes off and then you
lose<00:01:38.830> hub<00:01:40.500> bearings<00:01:41.970> tire<00:01:43.500> rim<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.800> that's<00:01:45.550> a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
lose hub bearings tire rim and that's a

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.380 
lose hub bearings tire rim and that's a
big<00:01:46.060> hassle<00:01:46.360> then<00:01:46.780> because<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:48.910> starters

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
big hassle then because the starters

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.970 
big hassle then because the starters
