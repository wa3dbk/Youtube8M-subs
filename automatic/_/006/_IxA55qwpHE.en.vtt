00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.789
 hello youtube is that such greetings very 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.740
 good I'm conical and today finally starts 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.289
 the great match and many you will ask 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.680
 What is great play can be great game 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 they will be videos where to simulate a match 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.289
 real of each league day and in this 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.380
 occasion to start I have chosen the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.019
 match between Sevilla and Valencia 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.790
 the party I have to tell you what 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.010
 I will choose the one that seems to me the most 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.119
 attractive of each day and I'll put it 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.699
 well midweek before that 

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:47.489
 start the next day 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.799
 said this how does it work I will open three 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.830
 envelopes to simulate the first part and 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.150
 three envelopes to simulate the second by 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.159
 example I'm going to start with the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.920
 sevilla-valencia and each player that 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:02.010
 leave a seville envelope as it will be 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.530
 a goal valid for Sevilla and each 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.260
 player who leaves for valencia 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.920
 It will be a goal for Valencia to say that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.520
 does not count coaches or shields 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.350
 only the players play and nothing to say 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.270
 what 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.650
 I'm going to open three envelopes for the first 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.460
 part I repeat and three hours for the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.790
 second and the final result will be 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.259
 for a mere anecdote member because not 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.259
 there are neither prizes nor anything simply 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.700
 Well, if you want, then look to see 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.799
 how is the game finally and if 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.539
 matches the one of the great game but it is 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.920
 more than anything a game to make them 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.799
 videos different from the channel and that 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.690
 you always have the same thing so we're going to 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.570
 start with the great game I remind you that 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.119
 this week's on Saturday is the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.069
 de sevilla valencia that I think is one 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.369
 of the most interesting matches of the 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:55.990
 day so let's go with the first 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.990
 part of the party 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.190
 of increase no seville chrome ni 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.190
 Valencia 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.830
 and the last 1 Atletico Madrid 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.480
 No goal for any of the players 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.460
 two teams 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.570
 to see what comes out in the center 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.570
 the shield of málaga 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.640
 and players 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.920
 At the moment nothing juanmi of málaga and 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.569
 last the numancy shield of second 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.740
 and the last chance for the first 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.810
 part 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.810
 to see if it marks one of the types 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.340
 shield of the elche 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.799
 and the first goal of trochowsky's 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.030
 seville or at the moment 10 the first 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.340
 part 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.560
 we leave it on the left that is 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.410
 the local ruben eliseu brown and you make the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.280
 almería because the first part concludes 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.959
 with the goal of trochowski 110 in favor of 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.959
 the Sevillian set 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.810
 and now we are going with the envelopes of the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.810
 second part 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.760
 10 in the first 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.890
 the last one chrome of the athletic of 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.890
 frames of moment 10 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.500
 he has two valenciá envelopes left to 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.670
 draw or to seville to mark the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.670
 second let's see 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.220
 the attention comes the draw of the valence 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.030
 by facebook 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.910
 11 but instantly another goal from Sevilla 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.320
 in this occasion of vítolo of moment 2 to 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.740
 one 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.900
 interesting this 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.240
 this half part of the second part is 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:43.030
 say only 30 minutes of society 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.430
 camacho and moya of the atletico de madrid 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.650
 moment 2 to 1 missing in the last 15 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.569
 minutes of the match and the result is 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.569
 2 to 1 in favor of sevilla 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.350
 let's see if it matches the valence remain 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.350
 very few chromos 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.220
 those of the getafe 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.590
 the Celtic trainer and the last 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.620
 chrome 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.570
 the summary of the athletic one of madrid then 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.390
 there has not been a goal of valence that is 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.390
 the result has ended as you see in a 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.700
 two to one in favor of sevilla 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.730

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:32.840
 first trochowsky goal by the 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:36.770
 seville and the second vítolo and on the 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.650
 of valencia because it would mark foul and 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.280

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.350
