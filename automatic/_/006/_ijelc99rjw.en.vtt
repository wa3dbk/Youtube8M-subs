00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.510 
really really fast so I'm trying to
desensitize<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.530> do<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.130> change<00:03:07.400> it

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
desensitize to do that and I change it

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.370 
desensitize to do that and I change it
up<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.790> little<00:03:07.910> bit<00:03:08.210> just<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.840> see<00:03:08.990> how<00:03:09.170> far

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
up a little bit just to see how far

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.310 
up a little bit just to see how far
she's<00:03:09.650> getting<00:03:09.920> used<00:03:10.070> to<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.550> stuff<00:03:10.790> Oh

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.750 

drop<00:03:15.710> that<00:03:15.740> one<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.590> I'm<00:03:22.010> going<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.280> stop<00:03:22.520> right

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
drop that one so I'm going to stop right

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.570 
drop that one so I'm going to stop right
here<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.560> introduce<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.860> touch<00:03:25.100> training

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
here and introduce the touch training

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.940
