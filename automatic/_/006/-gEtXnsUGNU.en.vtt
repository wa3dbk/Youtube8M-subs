to<00:00:28.859> me<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.810> over<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> years<00:00:31.289> I've

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

to me to do that and over the years I've
been<00:00:31.859> noticing<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:32.700> candies<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.120> get

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329

been noticing like what candies you get
more<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.620> less<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.790> um

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
I guess I can do some sciency with that

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.510
