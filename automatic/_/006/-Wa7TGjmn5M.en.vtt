three we want to go to recovery and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.510 
three we want to go to recovery and
again<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.450> three<00:00:36.840> more<00:00:37.050> options<00:00:37.399> we<00:00:38.399> have

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520

refresh<00:00:38.969> remove<00:00:39.809> an<00:00:40.140> advanced<00:00:40.860> startup<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
refresh remove an advanced startup and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.770 
refresh remove an advanced startup and
we<00:00:42.300> want<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> advanced<00:00:43.559> startup<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> now

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
we want to go to advanced startup so now

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360 
we want to go to advanced startup so now
I<00:00:45.809> will<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.350> switching<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.160> different

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
I will be switching to a different

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.510 
I will be switching to a different
camera<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.629> since<00:00:48.989> BIOS<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:50.250> stands

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
camera because since BIOS which stands

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060 
camera because since BIOS which stands
for<00:00:50.760> basic<00:00:50.969> input/output<00:00:51.600> system<00:00:52.140> controls

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
for basic input/output system controls

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250 
for basic input/output system controls
the<00:00:53.309> very<00:00:53.550> basic<00:00:54.030> things<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.539> computer<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the very basic things of your computer I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.290 
the very basic things of your computer I
won't<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.219> able<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> screen<00:00:57.390> recorder

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.560 

all<00:01:02.559> right<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:03.920> now<00:01:04.159> from<00:01:04.519> here<00:01:04.850> we<00:01:05.180> are<00:01:05.299> going

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
all right so now from here we are going

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.940 
all right so now from here we are going
to<00:01:05.750> click<00:01:05.960> restart<00:01:06.619> now

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
to click restart now

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.249 
to click restart now
and<00:01:07.250> from<00:01:07.640> restart<00:01:08.149> now<00:01:08.360> we<00:01:08.420> will<00:01:08.780> get<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.229> a

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
and from restart now we will get to a

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:22.539 
and from restart now we will get to a
menu<00:01:09.560> which<00:01:10.130> will<00:01:10.340> help<00:01:10.490> us<00:01:10.700> get<00:01:10.939> to<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.240> BIOS

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.550 

all<00:01:23.060> right<00:01:23.329> so<00:01:23.570> now<00:01:23.689> we<00:01:23.750> have<00:01:24.079> three<00:01:24.530> options

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
all right so now we have three options

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.380 
all right so now we have three options
and<00:01:25.399> we<00:01:25.969> want<00:01:26.179> to<00:01:26.359> go<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.539> troubleshoot<00:01:27.500> and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
and we want to go to troubleshoot and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.149 
and we want to go to troubleshoot and
here<00:01:29.390> we<00:01:29.479> have<00:01:29.630> three<00:01:29.960> more<00:01:30.109> options<00:01:30.289> and<00:01:30.890> we

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
here we have three more options and we

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.080 
here we have three more options and we
want<00:01:31.369> to<00:01:31.549> go<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.729> Advanced<00:01:32.719> Options<00:01:33.820> now<00:01:34.820> out

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
want to go to Advanced Options now out

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.590 
want to go to Advanced Options now out
of<00:01:35.119> all<00:01:35.450> these<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.319> one<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:37.009> want<00:01:37.280> is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
of all these the one that we want is

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.199 
of all these the one that we want is
UEFI<00:01:38.600> firmware<00:01:39.229> settings<00:01:42.579> now<00:01:43.579> once<00:01:43.909> we<00:01:44.060> click

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
UEFI firmware settings now once we click

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.809 
UEFI firmware settings now once we click
restart<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.929> computer<00:01:45.110> will<00:01:45.469> restart<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:46.159> it

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
restart the computer will restart and it

00:01:46.819 --> 00:02:00.760 
restart the computer will restart and it
will<00:01:46.939> go<00:01:47.090> directly<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.530> BIOS

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.910 

so<00:02:01.310> here<00:02:01.700> we<00:02:01.850> are<00:02:01.880> this<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:03.049> what<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.530> BIOS

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
so here we are this is what the BIOS

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.999 
so here we are this is what the BIOS
looks<00:02:04.220> like<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:05.479> control<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.259> BIOS<00:02:06.649> you

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
looks like and to control the BIOS you

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.919 
looks like and to control the BIOS you
will<00:02:07.159> be<00:02:07.280> using<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.939> arrow<00:02:08.179> keys<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.840> your

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
will be using the arrow keys on your

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.220 
will be using the arrow keys on your
keyboard<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.780> reason<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.959> lot<00:02:12.200> of

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
keyboard so a reason that a lot of

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.699 
keyboard so a reason that a lot of
people<00:02:12.680> want<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.950> get<00:02:13.190> here<00:02:13.489> is<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.120> enable

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
people want to get here is to enable

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.890 
people want to get here is to enable
virtualization<00:02:15.709> technology<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.790> do<00:02:17.569> that<00:02:17.720> we

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
virtualization technology and do that we

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.339 
virtualization technology and do that we
need<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.140> go<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.590> advanced<00:02:19.250> menu<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.349> on

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
need to go to the advanced menu and on

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.839 
need to go to the advanced menu and on
the<00:02:21.620> bottom<00:02:21.980> here<00:02:22.310> we<00:02:22.430> can<00:02:22.580> see<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:24.849> Intel

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
the bottom here we can see it Intel

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.839 
the bottom here we can see it Intel
virtualization<00:02:26.500> technology<00:02:27.500> now<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.160> already

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
virtualization technology now I already

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.820 
virtualization technology now I already
have<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> enabled<00:02:29.660> but<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.260> don't<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.769> is

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
have it enabled but if you don't this is

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.320 
have it enabled but if you don't this is
where<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.340> would<00:02:31.430> be<00:02:31.519> able<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.760> enable<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.300> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
where you would be able to enable it and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.850 
where you would be able to enable it and
here<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.019> bunch<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.380> other<00:02:33.590> options

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
here we have a bunch of other options

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.570 
here we have a bunch of other options
and<00:02:34.430> we<00:02:35.180> have<00:02:35.299> all<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.720> rest<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.200> menu<00:02:36.580> so

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580
