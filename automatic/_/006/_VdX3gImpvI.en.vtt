00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello where are you welcome once again 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.920
 to this his channel I know it is not Saturday 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.330
 but still I did not want to miss the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.919
 opportunity again is that I have 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 come the time over today 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.910
 I bring you a very cool idea, good to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.830
 I liked it a lot because it reminds me 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.509
 to my childhood who as a child did not make a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.180
 cinema of a whole box that basically 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.340
 it was a box with sticks and it moved the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.090
 tape with the same sticks very well then 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.090
 here they have it 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.490
 obviously it 's the cool samuel version 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.770
 ideal for mothers day for the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.150
 father's day or for kim you want 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.670
 as mothers day approaches 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.140
 I wanted to give that vintage retro touch 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.420
 are you saying that mothers day 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.309
 it means old clear that we do not go without 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.440
 But it's a style that I like a lot 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.150
 and it's good that it's very fashionable in that 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.400
 with me to see how this is done 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.080
 tutorial to see how this cinema is made 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.420
 what good in diversity is rather 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.460
 it would be a television and inside it has the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.200
 movie of your life I titled you 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.300
 memories of yesterday I taxes that I'm 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.489
 using old photos and new photos 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.620
 the team two old photos that I 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.720
 They bring back very pleasant memories and well I did 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.880
 a photo shoot to recreate those 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.710
 photos then for example in this photo 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.900
 this on some swings with my sisters 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.690
 and well what I did you can recreate this 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.610
 same photograph but in the present it is 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.440
 a very nice detail and I assure you that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 your mom that your dad will like and 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.190
 well you do not have to do it identical 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.840
 you know that you can change it you can 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.820
 do it with other photos even with 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.650
 drawings and good to not extend more 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.880
 let's see the materials that we are going to 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.780
 need 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.579
 black shoes a shoe box 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.619
 printed photographs I recreate photos 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.720
 of my childhood for this way the sea 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.549
 a before and after but remember that 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.590
 you can use the photos you like 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.750
 You can even make drawings too 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.520
 we need the cover of television 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.170
 are you going to find it in the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.759
 description of the video along with other 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.259
 more so that downloads and 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.380
 subprimes according to the size that 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.189
 choose color paint you like two 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.170
 soda lids and two wooden sticks 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.450
 the first step is to cut the cover 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.369
 retro all over the edge and also by the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.229
 part of the screen 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.909
 immediately we draw the outline of the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.319
 screen on the lid of the box 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.569
 shoes and cut with an exact cutter 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.939
 Now we can paint the color box 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.709
 that we want, remember that it is not 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.629
 necessary to paint the front of the 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.909
 television since there we are going to put 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.829
 the cover and well said this we are going to 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.239
 paste with adhesive pencil the cover of 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.689
 the television that you chose to 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.689
 to download 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.640
 now trims several strips of paper 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.540
 black based on the thickness of the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.540
 screen of your TV 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.670
 you are going to paste all these strips of such 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.450
 way that you form a strip of ones 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.450
 how many meters 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.640
 in this part it's time to inspire the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.280
 drawing is written emotive words and 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.160
 stick your photos together you use skis 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.750
 or chalk dominoes is spray rossi 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.750
 the hair so it does not erase 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.170
 for this part you can use the 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.130
 TV to guide you and know where 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.130
 paste things 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.170
 since you have the film reel 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.569
 ready we proceed to put it in the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.549
 television for this you have two holes 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.760
 in the upper part and in the part 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.799
 bottom of the box introduces the sticks 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.530
 of wood and with the help of adhesive tape 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.090
 transparent sticks the start of the reel 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.069
 in the stick that is on the side 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.519
 left and begins to roll the 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.519
 movie 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.440
 once you get to the end hits of 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.830
 same way the end to the other stick of 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.170
 wood 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.950
 Now you can close the box and rewind 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.950
 the movie 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.470
 do not 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.260
 very well we have already finished if you notice 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.239
 these soda caps 20 black 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.760
 and place them in this place to bulk up 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.799
 the holes that I made others too 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.310
 paint the wooden sticks black 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.470
 with a down 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.660
 on the bottom , the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.580
 sticks but do not worry these are 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.980
 to help you roll up and develop 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.570
 the reel and good in passing serve as 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.570
 the legs of the retro television 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.470

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.750

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.390
 great is in fact an activity that 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.430
