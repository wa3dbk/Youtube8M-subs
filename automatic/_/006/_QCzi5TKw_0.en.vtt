wand<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.070> used<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:14.970> from

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
wand I used this is this one from

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.480 
wand I used this is this one from
Remington<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.409> use<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.100> one

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
Remington and I use this one

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.450 
Remington and I use this one
specifically<00:01:18.270> because<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> has<00:01:19.140> an<00:01:19.680> oval

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
specifically because it has an oval

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.380 
specifically because it has an oval
shape<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.030> not<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:22.490> circle<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
while I do other pieces and I like to do

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.740 
while I do other pieces and I like to do
one<00:01:43.590> piece<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.280> toward<00:01:44.820> my<00:01:45.060> face<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.540> one

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
one piece going toward my face and one
piece<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.350> away<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> gives<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
piece going away because it gives it a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.480 
piece going away because it gives it a
Messier<00:01:48.450> look<00:01:48.810> also<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.619> don't<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
Messier look also I don't do this to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.190 
Messier look also I don't do this to
every<00:01:50.759> single<00:01:50.820> part<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> hair<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> only<00:01:51.899> do

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
every single part of the hair I only do

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.359 
every single part of the hair I only do
it<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.680> certain<00:01:52.920> sections<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> think<00:01:56.250> this

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
it to certain sections and I think this

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.700 
it to certain sections and I think this
