00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
usable engine in terms of the gearing

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
usable engine in terms of the gearing

and the way the power is made similarly
the<00:01:22.740> chassis<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.759> very<00:01:24.119> sweet<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.020> ride

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the chassis is very sweet the ride

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
breaker it's very strange but to the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.399 
breaker it's very strange but to the
credit<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.299> motorcycle<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> didn't<00:01:37.259> lose

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
credit of the motorcycle it didn't lose

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
credit of the motorcycle it didn't lose
its<00:01:37.590> line<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.009> didn't<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.340> upset<00:01:38.490> no<00:01:38.970> portion

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
its line it didn't get upset no portion

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
its line it didn't get upset no portion
loss<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.290> went<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.650> hard<00:01:40.950> through

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
loss was there you went as hard through

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.859 
loss was there you went as hard through
the<00:01:41.220> corner<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.700> absorbed<00:01:42.060> everything<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the corner it absorbed everything and I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.030 
the corner it absorbed everything and I
think<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> ride<00:01:43.710> quality<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
think that kind of ride quality and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
think that kind of ride quality and
handling<00:01:44.159> balance<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.880> segment

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
handling balance in this segment

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.149 
handling balance in this segment
difficult<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.960> achieve<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.320> somehow<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:46.950> nose

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
difficult to achieve but somehow my nose

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.620 
difficult to achieve but somehow my nose
done<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.759> am<00:01:47.850> super<00:01:48.119> happy<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
done it and I am super happy with the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.609 
done it and I am super happy with the
motorcycle<00:01:49.200> overall

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
motorcycle overall

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.069 
motorcycle overall
so<00:01:50.490> overall<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.450> motorcycle<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.930> not

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
so overall the motorcycle is not

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.109 
so overall the motorcycle is not
launched<00:01:52.439> yet<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.770> will<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.979> launched<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.399> July

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
