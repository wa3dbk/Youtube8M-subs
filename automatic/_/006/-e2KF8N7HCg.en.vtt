remnants of different materials my
materials<00:00:30.610> that<00:00:30.760> I'm<00:00:30.850> using<00:00:31.030> to<00:00:31.420> design<00:00:31.720> this

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
materials that I'm using to design this

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.010 
materials that I'm using to design this
shoe<00:00:32.379> our<00:00:32.800> salmon<00:00:33.430> leather<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.090> cow<00:00:34.750> leather

and amusing the salmon leather

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.900 
and amusing the salmon leather
especially<00:00:38.140> because<00:00:38.470> it<00:00:38.620> ties<00:00:38.800> into<00:00:39.100> a<00:00:39.309> lot<00:00:39.430> of

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
especially because it ties into a lot of

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.750

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
of the materials that they're used to

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.040 
of the materials that they're used to
using<00:00:45.150> seeing<00:00:46.150> this<00:00:46.269> shoe<00:00:46.449> for<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.780> first

using seeing this shoe for the first
time<00:00:47.350> he<00:00:47.559> was<00:00:47.739> really<00:00:48.400> exciting<00:00:48.970> it<00:00:49.390> was

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
time he was really exciting it was

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.979 
time he was really exciting it was
incredible<00:00:50.199> to<00:00:50.260> see<00:00:50.739> my<00:00:51.190> design<00:00:51.610> realized<00:00:52.390> in

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
incredible to see my design realized in

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.520 
incredible to see my design realized in
an<00:00:53.290> actual<00:00:53.769> 3d<00:00:54.100> form<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:55.360> see<00:00:55.600> that<00:00:55.809> someone

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
an actual 3d form to see that someone

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.439 
an actual 3d form to see that someone
had<00:00:56.890> taken<00:00:57.070> like<00:00:57.460> account<00:00:57.940> all<00:00:58.269> the

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
had taken like account all the

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:59.729 
had taken like account all the
measurements<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.140> materials<00:00:59.589> and

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
measurements and the materials and

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.789 
measurements and the materials and
actually<00:01:00.309> produced<00:01:00.519> it<00:01:01.470> collaborations<00:01:02.470> are

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
actually produced it collaborations are

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.070 
actually produced it collaborations are
so<00:01:03.070> important<00:01:03.580> and<00:01:03.760> for<00:01:04.269> me<00:01:04.420> as<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.690> student

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
so important and for me as a student

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.380 
so important and for me as a student
it's<00:01:05.710> not<00:01:05.950> necessarily<00:01:06.760> knowledge<00:01:07.120> that<00:01:07.360> I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
it's not necessarily knowledge that I

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.260 
it's not necessarily knowledge that I
would<00:01:07.630> have<00:01:07.720> gained<00:01:07.960> in<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.950> classroom<00:01:09.270> so

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
would have gained in the classroom so

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.719 
would have gained in the classroom so
that<00:01:10.299> definitely<00:01:11.080> was<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.010> most<00:01:12.400> valuable

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
that definitely was the most valuable

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.030 
that definitely was the most valuable
part<00:01:13.090> of<00:01:13.150> this<00:01:13.299> experience<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.350> lot<00:01:14.920> of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
part of this experience a lot of

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.830 
part of this experience a lot of
companies<00:01:15.490> say<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:16.240> they're<00:01:16.390> like<00:01:16.600> family

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
companies say that they're like family

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.260 
companies say that they're like family
but<00:01:17.380> we<00:01:17.530> really<00:01:18.010> felt<00:01:18.430> that<00:01:18.550> when<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:19.000> went

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
but we really felt that when we went

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.020 
but we really felt that when we went
there<00:01:19.540> that<00:01:19.870> it<00:01:19.990> was<00:01:20.320> like<00:01:20.830> family<00:01:21.550> and<00:01:21.730> like

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
there that it was like family and like

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.330 
there that it was like family and like
coming<00:01:22.390> home<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.870> leaving<00:01:23.200> home<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.680> could

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
coming home and leaving home I could

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.820 
coming home and leaving home I could
definitely<00:01:24.550> see<00:01:25.090> my<00:01:25.270> shoe<00:01:25.510> being<00:01:25.840> produced<00:01:26.290> by

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
definitely see my shoe being produced by

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.610 
definitely see my shoe being produced by
Allen<00:01:27.160> Edmonds<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.850> think<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.780> I'm<00:01:29.260> kind<00:01:29.560> of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
Allen Edmonds I think that I'm kind of

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.500 
Allen Edmonds I think that I'm kind of
aiming<00:01:29.950> at<00:01:30.070> a<00:01:30.100> customer<00:01:30.730> that's<00:01:30.970> already<00:01:31.360> a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
aiming at a customer that's already a

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.980 
aiming at a customer that's already a
huge<00:01:31.780> Allen<00:01:32.380> Edmonds<00:01:32.710> fan<00:01:33.120> but<00:01:34.120> he's<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.360> little

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
huge Allen Edmonds fan but he's a little

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.410 
huge Allen Edmonds fan but he's a little
bit<00:01:35.170> younger<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.860> he<00:01:36.070> wants<00:01:36.610> kind<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.060> fun

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
bit younger and he wants kind of a fun

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.900 
bit younger and he wants kind of a fun
men's<00:01:37.720> shoe<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.350> hope<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:39.130> my<00:01:39.220> design<00:01:39.580> wins

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
men's shoe I hope that my design wins

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.270 
men's shoe I hope that my design wins
the<00:01:40.300> Ellen<00:01:40.630> Evans<00:01:40.960> competition<00:01:41.710> mostly

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
the Ellen Evans competition mostly

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.490 
the Ellen Evans competition mostly
because<00:01:42.610> it's<00:01:43.180> really<00:01:43.450> about<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.780> story<00:01:44.200> about

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
because it's really about a story about

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.770 
because it's really about a story about
the<00:01:44.650> people<00:01:44.950> from<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.220> last<00:01:45.460> frontier<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.330> I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
the people from the last frontier and I

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.870 
the people from the last frontier and I
feel<00:01:47.020> like<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.290> mirrors<00:01:47.710> Allen<00:01:48.250> Edmonds<00:01:48.640> so

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
feel like it mirrors Allen Edmonds so

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.310 
feel like it mirrors Allen Edmonds so
much<00:01:49.150> in<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.870> aspects<00:01:50.410> of<00:01:50.770> craftsmanship

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
much in the aspects of craftsmanship

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.810 
much in the aspects of craftsmanship
perseverance<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.650> also<00:01:54.100> engine

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
perseverance and also engine

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.420 
perseverance and also engine
and<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.930> think<00:01:56.260> that<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.530> stories<00:01:56.920> one<00:01:57.190> worth

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
and I think that that stories one worth

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.540 
and I think that that stories one worth
fatality

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:13.260 

you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.330 

you
