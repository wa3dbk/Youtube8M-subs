 Current parents of San Diego 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.000
 from anaheim where he debuted as 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.950
 great delicate 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.470

 in more than 100 games with a performance 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.410
 that although I guarantee your position for 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.900
 the 2013 was not of its total satisfaction 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.620
 I am very focused on my work 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.809
 past all things have come to me 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.629
 well in all the positions of I have 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.600
 put and the truth that I am made to order 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.600
 sister is where she needs me if I win 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.500
 fine anywhere in the infield I 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.300
 I will be available 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 I try to do it work to be 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.740
 happy not to Marist came to play in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.380
 2012 up to six positions including 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.420
 the three gardens its versatility 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 defensive opens up possibilities in a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.130
 team that seeks to restructure itself to 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 to be a winner but a Marist does not hesitate 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.650
 when he talks about what his 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.900
 defensive preferences 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.770
 and so he always played in 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.130
 second base the position that I feel 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.950
 a little more like unlike the other 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.470
 the truth second base but where the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.930
 manager can use me so much in the show 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.210
 like in the gardens I can be 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.800
 work equal the speed of the player 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.080
 file of the AnzoÃ¡tegui Caribs in 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.060
 Venezuela is an element in the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.750
 which parents seek to get the most out of 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.040
 offensive advantage I try to be more than 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.930
 all in base try to steal be in 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.750
 scoring position which is what the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:14.170
 team wants it and personally look 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:17.450
 the best year that last year try to 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.870
 stop good you'll see find a little more 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.270
 of stealing base that's my goal not this one 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.240
 year have a good base percentage 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.610
 stolen, I've worked hard on that and 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.720
 look I felt quite comfortable I 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.450
 run well 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.910
 and the truth but have a season 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.010
 aware of that their offensive resources 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.420
 they come to be a necessity of 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.400
 subsistence 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.740
 for that reason in fundamentals moment that of 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.320
 balls stand up as indispensable weapons 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.170
 to be in the lineup and in situations 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.660
 of particular games if the few times 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.560
 have situations of everything that 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.540
 Thank God it went well and manel 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.400
 he knows I can do the job coming 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.760
 of the bank to do to touch the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.740
 ball in any situation 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.410
 look always have to be focused 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.360
 at any time they are used 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.820
 during the game improve your performance 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.520
 offensive will be the key to establishing 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.740
 as a record of the parents their defense is not 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.280
 leave doubts but kick as he has done 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.380

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.600
