container
I<00:00:33.780> wanted<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> keep<00:00:34.650> growing<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:36.390> that's

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
I wanted it to keep growing so that's

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.140 
I wanted it to keep growing so that's
what<00:00:36.720> I'm<00:00:36.780> gonna<00:00:36.870> transplant<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.620> again<00:00:38.150> into

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
what I'm gonna transplant it again into

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.500 
what I'm gonna transplant it again into
these<00:00:39.740> and<00:00:40.740> with<00:00:41.520> these<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.090> pull

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
these and with these I can actually pull

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.920 
these and with these I can actually pull
them<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.720> a<00:00:42.780> lot<00:00:43.080> easier<00:00:43.140> than<00:00:44.630> then<00:00:45.630> with<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
them out a lot easier than then with the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.930 
them out a lot easier than then with the
water<00:00:46.140> bottles<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:47.130> you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.580> this<00:00:47.790> one

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
water bottles as you can see this one

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.720 
water bottles as you can see this one
has<00:00:48.060> a<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.990> a<00:00:49.230> root<00:00:49.440> ball<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> then

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
has a bit more of a root ball and then

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.650 
has a bit more of a root ball and then
the<00:00:51.690> worst<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.330> this<00:00:54.330> one<00:00:54.510> right

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the worst one really is this one right

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.230 
the worst one really is this one right
here<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:58.040> that's<00:00:59.040> why<00:00:59.580> I<00:00:59.610> wanted<00:01:00.150> to

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.540 
here so that's why I wanted to
transplant<00:01:00.750> these<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.400> it's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
transplant these as you can see it's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.990 
transplant these as you can see it's
bringing<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.600> new<00:01:03.630> root<00:01:04.260> shoots<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.760> stem

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
bringing up new root shoots up the stem

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.850

from the AeroGarden that is that was
basically<00:05:21.170> being<00:05:21.440> wasted<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:21.980> I<00:05:22.040> have

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
everything kind of piled up around it

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.050 
everything kind of piled up around it
and<00:05:24.220> everything<00:05:25.220> seems<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.580> be<00:05:25.670> doing<00:05:25.940> pretty

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
and everything seems to be doing pretty

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
well I've got these Buju locusts that

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.350 
well I've got these Buju locusts that
are<00:05:32.300> doing<00:05:32.540> very<00:05:32.840> well<00:05:33.220> actually<00:05:34.330> some<00:05:35.330> of

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
are doing very well actually some of

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.290 
are doing very well actually some of
them<00:05:35.510> are<00:05:35.720> starting<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:36.340> produce<00:05:37.340> little<00:05:38.000> side

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
them are starting to produce little side

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.660 
them are starting to produce little side
shoots<00:05:38.720> from<00:05:39.080> right<00:05:39.320> there<00:05:39.350> from<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.490> leaf

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
shoots from right there from the leaf

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:49.300 
shoots from right there from the leaf
nodes<00:05:44.650> there<00:05:45.650> as<00:05:45.830> you<00:05:45.980> can<00:05:46.160> see<00:05:47.800> again<00:05:48.800> sorry<00:05:49.220> I

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
nodes there as you can see again sorry I

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.880 
nodes there as you can see again sorry I
have<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.810> kind<00:05:50.810> of<00:05:50.870> a<00:05:50.960> crappy<00:05:51.260> camera<00:05:51.770> it's

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
have a kind of a crappy camera it's

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.570 
have a kind of a crappy camera it's
opposed<00:05:52.130> to<00:05:52.160> the<00:05:52.340> HD<00:05:52.670> but<00:05:53.860> not<00:05:54.860> much<00:05:55.010> HD<00:05:55.340> about

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
opposed to the HD but not much HD about

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.040 
opposed to the HD but not much HD about
it<00:05:55.730> and<00:05:56.420> then<00:05:56.630> this<00:05:56.750> is<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:57.200> the<00:05:57.830> one<00:05:57.950> that<00:05:58.190> has

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
it and then this is the the one that has

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.230 
it and then this is the the one that has
the<00:06:00.050> most<00:06:00.080> shoots<00:06:01.010> or<00:06:01.940> side<00:06:02.510> plants<00:06:04.240> right

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
the most shoots or side plants right

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.200 
the most shoots or side plants right
there<00:06:05.450> so<00:06:06.410> this<00:06:06.560> is<00:06:06.620> actually<00:06:07.100> a<00:06:07.130> new<00:06:07.430> a<00:06:07.730> new

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
there so this is actually a new a new

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.870 
there so this is actually a new a new
plant<00:06:08.510> growing<00:06:08.750> off<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.170> side<00:06:09.550> once<00:06:10.550> it<00:06:10.730> gets

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
plant growing off the side once it gets

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.460 
plant growing off the side once it gets
long<00:06:11.120> enough<00:06:11.390> I'm<00:06:11.600> thinking<00:06:11.870> about<00:06:12.080> cutting

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
long enough I'm thinking about cutting

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.510 
long enough I'm thinking about cutting
it<00:06:12.590> and<00:06:12.770> starting<00:06:13.580> a<00:06:13.670> new<00:06:13.820> one<00:06:14.950> but<00:06:15.950> I'll

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
it and starting a new one but I'll

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.029 
it and starting a new one but I'll
decide<00:06:16.820> that<00:06:16.850> a<00:06:17.030> little<00:06:17.240> bit<00:06:17.360> later

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
decide that a little bit later

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.219 
decide that a little bit later
and<00:06:19.249> then<00:06:19.999> here<00:06:20.180> we<00:06:20.270> have<00:06:20.300> a<00:06:20.449> slightly<00:06:20.930> better

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
and then here we have a slightly better

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:26.320 
and then here we have a slightly better
view<00:06:21.650> of<00:06:22.300> what<00:06:23.300> the<00:06:24.099> pepper<00:06:25.099> plant<00:06:25.520> I<00:06:25.819> believe

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
view of what the pepper plant I believe

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.339 
view of what the pepper plant I believe
is<00:06:26.449> Thai<00:06:26.990> pepper<00:06:27.520> I've<00:06:28.520> got<00:06:28.849> four<00:06:29.809> leaves

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.349

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:33.999 
is Thai pepper I've got four leaves
coming<00:06:30.889> off<00:06:31.039> the<00:06:31.249> same<00:06:31.779> off<00:06:32.779> of<00:06:33.169> the<00:06:33.469> very<00:06:33.710> tops

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
coming off the same off of the very tops

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.639 
coming off the same off of the very tops
I've<00:06:34.279> got<00:06:34.520> this<00:06:34.819> one<00:06:34.969> right<00:06:35.059> here<00:06:35.330> is<00:06:35.649> attached

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:36.649 
I've got this one right here is attached
