00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
outside the map well I mean I did that

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.970 
outside the map well I mean I did that
but<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.870> might<00:03:34.050> read<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.530> happens<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.890> best

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980
