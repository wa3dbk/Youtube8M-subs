like a couple hundred steps at it on
most<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> time<00:01:44.960> yeah<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.320> today

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
most the time yeah so just today

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.030 
most the time yeah so just today
forty-one<00:01:48.180> thousand<00:01:48.840> steps<00:01:49.170> i<00:01:49.530> haven't<00:01:49.950> even

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
forty-one thousand steps i haven't even

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.660 
forty-one thousand steps i haven't even
moved<00:01:50.280> an<00:01:50.490> inch<00:01:50.610> oh<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.720> gone<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:51.930> again<00:01:52.670> here

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
moved an inch oh it's gone up again here

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
moved an inch oh it's gone up again here
we<00:01:53.759> go<00:01:54.049> here's<00:01:55.049> go<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.590> oh<00:01:55.770> right<00:01:56.340> scream<00:01:57.229> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
we go here's go at oh right scream it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
we go here's go at oh right scream it
also<00:01:58.409> works<00:01:58.590> well<00:01:59.189> too<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> white

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
also works well too out in the white

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.280 
also works well too out in the white
screen<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.689> doesn't<00:02:00.960> waste<00:02:01.140> battery<00:02:01.619> power

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
screen so it doesn't waste battery power

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.520 
screen so it doesn't waste battery power
which<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.439> even<00:02:04.710> better<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:07.229> think

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
which is even better but you think

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.369 
which is even better but you think
putting<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.069> near<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> electric<00:02:09.420> lamp<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
putting it near the electric lamp is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.260 
putting it near the electric lamp is
going<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> substitute<00:02:11.550> for<00:02:11.849> quicker

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
going to be a substitute for quicker

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.440 
going to be a substitute for quicker
yes<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:14.140> are<00:02:14.500> wrong<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:17.410> not<00:02:18.130> work<00:02:18.910> like

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
yes you are wrong this is not work like

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.410 
yes you are wrong this is not work like
that<00:02:19.710> if<00:02:20.710> you<00:02:20.830> put<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.220> near<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.580> which<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.120> tried

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
that if you put it near it which I tried

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.950 
that if you put it near it which I tried
once<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:23.530> wiped<00:02:24.070> out<00:02:24.250> all<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.360> steps<00:02:25.630> i<00:02:25.780> had<00:02:25.930> a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
once it wiped out all the steps i had a

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.710 
once it wiped out all the steps i had a
little<00:02:26.140> bit<00:02:26.440> longer<00:02:26.560> i<00:02:26.970> guess<00:02:27.970> if<00:02:28.150> it's<00:02:28.300> you've

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
little bit longer i guess if it's you've

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.060 
little bit longer i guess if it's you've
got<00:02:30.570> 99999<00:02:31.570> steps<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.410> want<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.740> get<00:02:32.950> it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
got 99999 steps on it you want to get it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.600 
got 99999 steps on it you want to get it
more<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.500> could<00:02:35.830> what<00:02:36.070> if<00:02:36.190> you're<00:02:36.400> there

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
more then you could what if you're there

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.920 
more then you could what if you're there
