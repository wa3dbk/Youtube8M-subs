but it's not any inventory editor in a

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.290 
but it's not any inventory editor in a
way<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.130> new<00:02:15.430> program<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.240> computer

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
way it is a new program on the computer

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.450 
way it is a new program on the computer
and<00:02:16.960> then<00:02:17.110> not<00:02:17.350> only<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.280> would<00:02:18.430> just

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
and then not only that that would just

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.400 
and then not only that that would just
get<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.030> blocks<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.630> order<00:02:20.200> for<00:02:20.320> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
get you the blocks in order for the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.030 
get you the blocks in order for the
blocks<00:02:20.650> actually<00:02:21.010> work<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:22.210> would<00:02:22.330> need<00:02:22.540> to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
blocks actually work you would need to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.310 
blocks actually work you would need to
screw<00:02:24.040> around<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.400> code<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.120> just<00:02:25.750> basically

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
screw around the code and just basically

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.680 
screw around the code and just basically
copy<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.280> paste<00:02:27.520> different<00:02:27.940> bits<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.330> pieces

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
copy and paste different bits and pieces

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.760 
copy and paste different bits and pieces
from<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.960> pc<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:29.980> xbox<00:02:31.620> coating<00:02:32.620> is

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
from the pc to the xbox coating is

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.120 
from the pc to the xbox coating is
different<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:34.630> support<00:02:35.110> what<00:02:35.950> i<00:02:35.980> am

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130

you can go ahead and check out this

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.130 
you can go ahead and check out this
other<00:02:39.310> youtuber<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.570> which<00:02:40.720> i<00:02:40.840> will<00:02:40.900> figure

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
other youtuber in which i will figure

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.740 
other youtuber in which i will figure
out<00:02:41.260> later<00:02:41.710> but<00:02:41.830> he<00:02:42.310> also<00:02:42.640> messes<00:02:43.390> around<00:02:43.420> with

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
out later but he also messes around with

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.130 
out later but he also messes around with
code<00:02:44.050> from<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.290> pc<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.330> xbox<00:02:46.900> and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
code from the pc and to the xbox and

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.890 
code from the pc and to the xbox and
result<00:02:47.740> he<00:02:47.950> can<00:02:48.130> get<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.640> whole<00:02:49.480> bunch<00:02:49.750> of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
result he can get a whole bunch of

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.130 
result he can get a whole bunch of
custom<00:02:50.350> skins<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:51.510> texture<00:02:52.510> packs<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:52.990> not

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
custom skins and texture packs but not

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.230 
custom skins and texture packs but not
just<00:02:53.320> any<00:02:53.500> texture<00:02:53.890> packs<00:02:54.130> just<00:02:54.250> customizing

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
just any texture packs just customizing

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.110 
just any texture packs just customizing
the<00:02:55.450> color<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.020> stuff<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.740> just<00:02:57.640> objects

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
the color and stuff of just objects

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.880 
the color and stuff of just objects
without<00:02:58.240> even<00:02:58.600> changing<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.110> texture<00:02:59.440> pack<00:02:59.650> I

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
without even changing the texture pack I

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.040 
without even changing the texture pack I
know<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.370> lot<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.000> stuff<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:01.450> doesn't<00:03:01.570> involve<00:03:01.900> a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
know a lot of stuff it doesn't involve a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.900 
know a lot of stuff it doesn't involve a
jtag<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:03.130> this<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.460> one<00:03:03.640> hundred<00:03:03.730> percent

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
jtag but this is one hundred percent

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.330 
jtag but this is one hundred percent
without<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> jtag<00:03:04.960> although<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.350> do<00:03:05.500> have<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:05.860> jtag

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
without a jtag although I do have a jtag

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.930 
without a jtag although I do have a jtag
system<00:03:06.820> um<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.710> without<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.070> jtag<00:03:09.580> and

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
system um this is without a jtag and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.360 
system um this is without a jtag and
it's<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.810> messing<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.290> code<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.770> do<00:03:12.100> not

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
it's just a messing with code I do not

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.890 
it's just a messing with code I do not
encourage<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.880> guys<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.090> go<00:03:13.360> ahead<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.660> screw

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
encourage you guys to go ahead and screw

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.020 
encourage you guys to go ahead and screw
with<00:03:14.050> around<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.740> code<00:03:14.950> because<00:03:15.340> most<00:03:15.610> likely

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
with around the code because most likely

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.840 
with around the code because most likely
you'll<00:03:16.450> just<00:03:16.740> reckon<00:03:17.740> bring<00:03:18.010> your<00:03:18.160> xbox<00:03:18.430> to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
you'll just reckon bring your xbox to

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.220 
you'll just reckon bring your xbox to
 but<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:21.100> good<00:03:21.280> result<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:22.230> after

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
 but and a good result on after

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.040 
 but and a good result on after
maybe<00:03:24.040> four<00:03:24.400> hours<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.850> screwing<00:03:25.570> around<00:03:25.810> with

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
maybe four hours of screwing around with

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.410 
maybe four hours of screwing around with
code<00:03:26.320> because<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.680> was<00:03:26.800> bored<00:03:27.040> as<00:03:27.220> hell<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.730> I

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
code because I was bored as hell and I

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.460 
code because I was bored as hell and I
didn't<00:03:28.600> even<00:03:28.660> know<00:03:28.870> what<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.170> hell<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.350> was

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
didn't even know what the hell I was

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.970 
didn't even know what the hell I was
doing<00:03:29.620> but<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:31.690> works<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.560> little<00:03:32.710> bit<00:03:32.920> of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
doing but it works and a little bit of

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.830 
doing but it works and a little bit of
tweaking<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:34.120> end<00:03:34.330> now<00:03:34.810> works<00:03:35.700> now<00:03:36.700> yeah<00:03:37.480> the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
tweaking the end now works now yeah the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.420 
tweaking the end now works now yeah the

see if I can like go ahead and get this
working<00:03:57.720> sometimes<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.990> doesn't<00:03:59.320> work<00:03:59.350> and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
working sometimes it doesn't work and

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.380 
working sometimes it doesn't work and
especially<00:04:00.160> because<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:00.550> want<00:04:00.790> survival<00:04:01.270> and

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
especially because I want survival and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.210 
especially because I want survival and
there's<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.600> lot<00:04:01.810> under<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.500> do<00:04:02.560> not<00:04:02.890> want<00:04:03.160> to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
there's a lot under it I do not want to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.770 
there's a lot under it I do not want to

you<00:04:55.029> can<00:04:55.180> expect<00:04:55.569> it<00:04:55.779> within<00:04:56.080> like<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.830> middle

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
you can expect it within like the middle

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.830 
you can expect it within like the middle
or<00:04:57.669> late<00:04:57.939> of<00:04:58.210> March<00:04:58.719> but<00:04:59.379> if<00:04:59.710> not<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.699> then

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840
