dial then we'll hook up the RPM wire and

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.509 
dial then we'll hook up the RPM wire and
then<00:02:43.379> we'll<00:02:43.530> start<00:02:43.709> playing<00:02:44.159> around<00:02:44.310> with

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
then we'll start playing around with

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.949 
then we'll start playing around with
getting<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:44.849> thing<00:02:44.970> launched<00:02:45.209> off<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.540> rpm

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.510 
well now you've seen how we install the
launcher<00:03:20.260> let's<00:03:20.590> go<00:03:20.710> over<00:03:20.950> how<00:03:21.040> we've<00:03:21.190> set<00:03:21.370> it

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
launcher let's go over how we've set it

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.040 
launcher let's go over how we've set it
up<00:03:21.610> for<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.820> first<00:03:22.060> few<00:03:22.210> passes<00:03:22.660> now<00:03:22.810> Jake

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
up for the first few passes now Jake

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.480 
up for the first few passes now Jake
when<00:03:23.260> he<00:03:23.320> hits<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.710> button<00:03:23.890> off<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.310> line

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
when he hits the button off the line

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.360 
when he hits the button off the line
it's<00:03:24.790> gonna<00:03:25.030> kick<00:03:25.330> in<00:03:25.510> at<00:03:25.720> 30%<00:03:26.440> then<00:03:26.800> ramped<00:03:27.190> up

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
it's gonna kick in at 30% then ramped up

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.430 
it's gonna kick in at 30% then ramped up
to<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.550> hundred<00:03:27.910> percent<00:03:27.970> over<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.630> next<00:03:28.690> 1.3

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
to a hundred percent over the next 1.3

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.560 
to a hundred percent over the next 1.3
seconds<00:03:29.860> now<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.520> all<00:03:30.730> activated<00:03:31.210> via

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
seconds now this is all activated via

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.450 
seconds now this is all activated via
the<00:03:31.750> LCD<00:03:32.350> screen<00:03:32.740> so<00:03:32.770> if<00:03:32.950> everything<00:03:33.220> works

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
the LCD screen so if everything works

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.650 
the LCD screen so if everything works
according<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.850> plan<00:03:34.030> you'll<00:03:34.210> see<00:03:34.390> him<00:03:34.480> take

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
according to plan you'll see him take

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.870 
according to plan you'll see him take
off<00:03:34.840> fairly<00:03:35.140> gently<00:03:35.590> at<00:03:35.680> 30%<00:03:36.040> like<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.490> said<00:03:36.700> and

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
off fairly gently at 30% like I said and

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.790 
off fairly gently at 30% like I said and
then<00:03:37.210> picking<00:03:37.480> up<00:03:37.690> rapidly<00:03:38.110> as<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.470> hits<00:03:38.650> its

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
then picking up rapidly as it hits its

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.520 
then picking up rapidly as it hits its
400<00:03:39.370> percent<00:03:39.670> by<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:39.910> 1.3<00:03:40.630> second<00:03:41.020> mark<00:03:41.200> now

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
400 percent by the 1.3 second mark now

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.740 
400 percent by the 1.3 second mark now
this<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.830> all<00:03:42.040> linear<00:03:42.400> but<00:03:42.850> that<00:03:43.000> LSA<00:03:43.480> can<00:03:43.690> be

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
this is all linear but that LSA can be

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.620 
this is all linear but that LSA can be
changed<00:03:44.140> just<00:03:44.320> by<00:03:44.470> using<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.830> LCD<00:03:45.220> screen<00:03:48.630> all

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
changed just by using the LCD screen all

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.760 
changed just by using the LCD screen all

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
tell us how did this run compared to

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.410 
tell us how did this run compared to
last<00:04:20.920> weeks<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:21.640> could<00:04:21.760> tell<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:22.090> was<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.210> lot

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
last weeks you could tell it was a lot

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.120 
last weeks you could tell it was a lot
quicker<00:04:22.600> you<00:04:23.410> know<00:04:23.440> like<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.770> mentioned

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
quicker you know like I mentioned

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.600 
quicker you know like I mentioned
earlier<00:04:24.400> we<00:04:24.640> went<00:04:24.760> 645<00:04:25.720> at<00:04:25.900> 1:10<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:27.430> was

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
earlier we went 645 at 1:10 that was

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.100 
earlier we went 645 at 1:10 that was
with<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.820> direct<00:04:28.060> port<00:04:28.240> nitrous<00:04:28.330> system<00:04:28.900> and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
with the direct port nitrous system and

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.390 
with the direct port nitrous system and
hitting<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.500> bottle<00:04:29.800> right<00:04:29.980> out<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.250> gate

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
hitting the bottle right out of the gate

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.340 
hitting the bottle right out of the gate
with<00:04:30.640> this<00:04:30.820> launcher<00:04:31.330> what<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:31.750> was<00:04:31.930> able<00:04:32.140> to<00:04:32.170> do

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
with this launcher what I was able to do

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.580 
with this launcher what I was able to do
is<00:04:32.860> launch<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.220> 30%<00:04:33.910> nitrous<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.570> ramp<00:04:35.380> it<00:04:35.500> in

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
is launch a 30% nitrous and ramp it in

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.800 
is launch a 30% nitrous and ramp it in
over<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.890> course<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.190> 1.3<00:04:36.700> seconds<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.630> car

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
over the course of 1.3 seconds the car

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.780 
over the course of 1.3 seconds the car
felt<00:04:38.080> great<00:04:38.320> it<00:04:38.530> launched<00:04:38.980> real<00:04:39.250> smooth<00:04:39.610> and

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
felt great it launched real smooth and

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.130 
felt great it launched real smooth and
soft<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.270> then<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.420> can<00:04:40.540> really<00:04:40.750> feel<00:04:40.930> the

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
soft and then you can really feel the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.100 
soft and then you can really feel the
225<00:04:41.710> come<00:04:41.980> on<00:04:42.130> you<00:04:42.640> know<00:04:42.760> about<00:04:43.000> 1.3<00:04:43.750> seconds

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
225 come on you know about 1.3 seconds

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.370 
225 come on you know about 1.3 seconds
into<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.410> run

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
into the run

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.460 
into the run
a<00:04:45.440> tenth<00:04:46.370> quicker<00:04:46.460> in<00:04:46.880> my<00:04:46.970> 60-foot<00:04:47.510> at<00:04:47.690> 1:46

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
a tenth quicker in my 60-foot at 1:46

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.860 
a tenth quicker in my 60-foot at 1:46
60-foot<00:04:49.040> as<00:04:49.220> opposed<00:04:49.670> like<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:49.970> 152<00:04:50.600> is<00:04:50.720> low

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
60-foot as opposed like a 152 is low

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.630 
60-foot as opposed like a 152 is low
we're<00:04:51.050> doing<00:04:51.200> with<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.380> direct<00:04:51.590> port<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.370> with

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
we're doing with the direct port so with

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.710 
we're doing with the direct port so with
a<00:04:52.670> little<00:04:52.790> bit<00:04:52.940> more<00:04:53.120> tuning<00:04:53.540> with<00:04:53.630> the

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
a little bit more tuning with the

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.300 
a little bit more tuning with the
launcher<00:04:54.110> I<00:04:54.170> feel<00:04:54.350> like<00:04:54.500> we<00:04:54.620> can<00:04:54.770> extend<00:04:55.160> that

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
launcher I feel like we can extend that

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.400 
launcher I feel like we can extend that
ramp<00:04:55.670> a<00:04:55.790> little<00:04:56.030> bit<00:04:56.150> further<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:56.780> wrap<00:04:57.260> the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
ramp a little bit further and wrap the

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.350 
ramp a little bit further and wrap the
night<00:04:57.560> just<00:04:57.740> an<00:04:57.830> even<00:04:58.070> smoother<00:04:58.550> maybe<00:04:59.030> get<00:04:59.270> to

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
night just an even smoother maybe get to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.210 
night just an even smoother maybe get to
60-foot<00:04:59.870> down<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.050> little<00:05:00.290> better<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.740> not

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
60-foot down a little better and not

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.950 
60-foot down a little better and not
hurt<00:05:01.430> by<00:05:01.520> mile<00:05:01.700> an<00:05:01.850> hour<00:05:01.940> because<00:05:02.420> we<00:05:02.540> actually

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
hurt by mile an hour because we actually

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.330 
hurt by mile an hour because we actually
went<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.200> same<00:05:03.380> mile<00:05:03.620> an<00:05:03.800> hour<00:05:03.890> away<00:05:04.160> a<00:05:04.190> little

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
went the same mile an hour away a little

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.670 
went the same mile an hour away a little
bit<00:05:04.430> actually<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:04.850> little<00:05:05.000> bit<00:05:05.150> faster<00:05:05.570> so<00:05:06.080> this

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
bit actually a little bit faster so this

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.350 
bit actually a little bit faster so this
is<00:05:06.890> ideal<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.520> mean<00:05:07.790> this<00:05:07.910> is<00:05:08.060> something<00:05:08.210> I'm

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
is ideal I mean this is something I'm
