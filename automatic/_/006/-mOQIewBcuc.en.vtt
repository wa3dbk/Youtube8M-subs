but I might be ready let me check to see

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
but I might be ready let me check to see
well<00:00:22.289> when<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> look<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> arch<00:00:23.310> around<00:00:23.880> here

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
well when I look at the arch around here

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.029 
well when I look at the arch around here
I<00:00:24.740> can<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:26.210> how<00:00:27.210> soaked<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.320> bricks<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
I can see how soaked the bricks are and

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.209 
I can see how soaked the bricks are and
heat<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.179> tell<00:00:30.510> because<00:00:31.080> all<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.800> carbon

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
heat you can tell because all the carbon

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
heat you can tell because all the carbon
has<00:00:32.369> burnt<00:00:32.820> off<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.329> inside<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> oven<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
has burnt off the inside of the oven and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
has burnt off the inside of the oven and
is<00:00:34.500> starting<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.040> burn<00:00:35.250> off<00:00:35.489> around<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
is starting to burn off around the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
is starting to burn off around the
archway<00:00:36.890> when<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> flames<00:00:38.280> die<00:00:38.550> down

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
archway when the flames die down

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
archway when the flames die down
I<00:00:39.030> simply<00:00:39.600> spread<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> coals<00:00:40.260> around<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
I simply spread the coals around the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.220 
I simply spread the coals around the
floor<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> let<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.940> heat<00:00:42.149> transfer<00:00:42.329> into

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
floor and let that heat transfer into

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.529 
floor and let that heat transfer into
the<00:00:43.590> five<00:00:43.890> bricks<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> floor<00:00:47.329> okay<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.390> I

the five bricks on the floor okay so I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.779 
the five bricks on the floor okay so I
spread<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:48.960> coals<00:00:49.230> around<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> floor<00:00:49.860> I'll<00:00:50.520> go

coals are soaked the floor so you want

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
coals are soaked the floor so you want

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.600 

get<00:01:16.590> most<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> big<00:01:17.400> coals<00:01:17.670> away<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.189> just

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
get most of the big coals away and just

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.770 
get most of the big coals away and just
use<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:24.000> pizza<00:01:24.299> peel<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:25.710> lightly<00:01:26.220> bang<00:01:26.780> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
use your pizza peel to lightly bang the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:45.570 
use your pizza peel to lightly bang the
ash<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.890> dust<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> back<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> oven

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.230 

okay<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:46.420> it's<00:01:47.050> not<00:01:47.110> quite<00:01:47.440> ready<00:01:47.620> yet<00:01:48.210> still<00:01:49.210> a

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
okay so it's not quite ready yet still a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.580 
okay so it's not quite ready yet still a
little<00:01:49.420> bit<00:01:49.510> of<00:01:49.600> SRAM<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.230> the<00:01:50.290> best<00:01:50.470> way<00:01:50.560> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
little bit of SRAM so the best way to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.290 
little bit of SRAM so the best way to
clean<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:51.040> is<00:01:51.970> with<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.870> wet<00:01:53.170> mop<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:55.090> don't

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
clean that is with a wet mop and don't

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.450 
clean that is with a wet mop and don't
recommend<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:55.750> use<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.050> mop<00:01:56.230> that<00:01:56.800> you<00:01:57.280> use

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
recommend you use the mop that you use

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.640 
recommend you use the mop that you use
inside<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.000> kitchen<00:01:58.180> give<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.170> sip<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.470> that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
inside the kitchen give a sip of that

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.020 
inside the kitchen give a sip of that
mop<00:01:59.860> before<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.280> best<00:02:00.400> idea

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
mop before the best idea

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.740 
mop before the best idea
keeps<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.870> wife<00:02:02.050> happy<00:02:02.260> too<00:02:03.510> there<00:02:04.510> we<00:02:04.600> go<00:02:04.690> you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
can see look carefully we had a seat at

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.820 
can see look carefully we had a seat at
the<00:02:09.040> back<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.490> your<00:02:09.580> oven<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:11.110> clearly<00:02:11.620> so

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
the back of your oven now clearly so

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.740 
the back of your oven now clearly so
just<00:02:12.040> give<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.310> mop<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.790> here<00:02:13.540> it's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
just give it a mop and here it's

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.130 
just give it a mop and here it's
steaming<00:02:14.020> away<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.240> floor<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.660> nice<00:02:16.870> and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
steaming away so the floor is nice and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.790 
steaming away so the floor is nice and
hot<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:19.720> we<00:02:19.870> are<00:02:19.990> ready<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.380> go<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.770> I

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
hot and there we are ready to go so I

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.380 
hot and there we are ready to go so I
probably<00:02:21.070> leave<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.400> about<00:02:21.580> 20<00:02:21.940> minutes<00:02:22.180> half

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
probably leave it about 20 minutes half

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.030 
probably leave it about 20 minutes half
an<00:02:22.510> hour<00:02:22.660> or<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:22.900> before<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.290> cooked<00:02:23.590> any<00:02:23.740> bread

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
an hour or so before I cooked any bread

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.090 
an hour or so before I cooked any bread
or<00:02:24.760> pita<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.600> it's<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.320> heat<00:02:26.680> sort<00:02:27.010> of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
or pita in it so it's the heat sort of

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.100 
or pita in it so it's the heat sort of
