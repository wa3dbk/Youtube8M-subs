00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.360
 hello on air our special 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.690
 heading and body chemistry with you i'm sergey 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.889
 Ogami scientists have long established that 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.480
 some countries quantity 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.969
 cardiovascular diseases 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.519
 significantly lower than others than that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.640
 only not associated with 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:23.939
 eating fat-rich fish why 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.220
 some fats are harmful and others are beneficial in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.359
 this we will analyze today in our 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.359
 heading chemistry body 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.270
 good afternoon paul simplicity like 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.900
 the mood is super it is good sauce keychain 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.199
 we heard from the studio that during classes 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.070
 Omega-3 fatty foods 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.320
 acids 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.660
 here that is either muscle mass there 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.930
 gain either there at fitness and weight 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.519
 dump wanted to know well is it so on 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.010
 in fact and in more detail that because 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.430
 acid let's understand 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.720
 omega-3 fatty acids what they 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.829
 necessary for normal 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.070
 human activity 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.259
 organism was discovered back in 1930 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.210
 judged that as a result various 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.280
 the latter was found out that those countries 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 where is the consumption of foods that are rich 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.000
 these fatty acids are high in these 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 countries significantly lower risk 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.350
 cardiovascular diseases such 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.800
 countries like japan 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.630
 it is there that fish populations use 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.270
 and seafood are associated with the fact that 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.789
 very long life expectancy and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.679
 while low cardiovascular risk 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:34.229
 diseases and how they affect 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.440
 on life expectancy now 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.729
 I will actually explain 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.590
 polyunsaturated fatty acids and those 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.319
 foods that are rich in them 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.259
 getting into the human body 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:48.209
 absorbed through the intestinal wall and this 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.959
 leads to multiple effects 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:54.869
 firstly omega-3 fatty acids affect 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.300
 on the rheological properties of blood viz 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.869
 blood starts to flow better through the bloodstream 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.489
 vessels 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.700
 decreases the likelihood of education 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:04.530
 blood clots second polyunsaturated 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.110
 fatty acids improve the condition 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.080
 vascular wall obstructed 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.290
 development of atherosclerotic plaques there 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.780
 plus omega-3 fatty acids 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.420
 includes cell membrane composition 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.370
 human brain 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.040
 proven to use foods 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.410
 rich in these substances positively 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.080
 affects a person's ability 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.290
 memorize information and recycle and 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.510
 her 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.280
 in addition, omega-3 fatty acids 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.140
 also has a positive effect on work 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.769
 liver and 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.769
 on the condition of the joints the whole point is that 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.790
 from these fatty acids are formed 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.970
 substances 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.319
 prostaglandins that possess 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.810
 anti-inflammatory action by 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.610
 joint damage is reduced 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.280
 way 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.780
 omega-3 fatty acids also affect 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.190
 cardiovascular and nervous 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.200
 system and on the liver and us fatigue 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.680
 Tell me Sergey, I understand that for 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.980
 it is necessary to eat the fish recipient on 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.950
 in fact some 30-40 years ago 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.230
 I would answer this question positively 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.989
 now you can't the whole thing is that in 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.030
 the last time fish we 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.790
 eat this fish which is grown on 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.530
 special farms where they feed this fish 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.599
 mostly mixed feed 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.209
 and the thing is that omega 3 is fatty 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.250
 acids enter the body of fish from 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.959
 marine plankton for precisely this 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.630
 have a beneficial effect because 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.810
 only fish caught directly 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.739
 in the sea and it is desirable that it be 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.810
 cold northern seas 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.450
 beyond that in order to get 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.920
 enough of these substances 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.500
 you need to consume fish almost every 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:55.430
 the day that is 5 6 times a week is so 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.220
 often and so i cant eat 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.530
 in some other way 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.109
 Ways have long been known as 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.299
 consume enough 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.169
 omega-3 fatty acids with special 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.510
 drugs 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.700
 one of these drugs is fish 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.250
 fat that has long been known to mankind 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.530
 and since ancient times applied for 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.470
 prevention of vitamin d deficiency 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.229
 for example or for the purpose of delivering to 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.660
 the body is enough omega 3 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.130
 fatty acids 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.340
 alternative to fish oil for those people 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.169
 who don't like the smell of fish is 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.849
 Lenin and oil the whole thing is that it 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.430
 one of the few vegetable oils 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.449
 which also contains omega 3 fatty 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.039
 acids 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:42.139
 The disadvantage of these forms is that 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.300
 fish oil and flaxseed oil are enough 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.039
 quick burn cal so store them 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.379
 can only be in the fridge and 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.110
 use after you opened 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.960
 capacity for a month 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.210
 otherwise fat oxidation occurs 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.779
 and as a result instead of you favor 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.180
 you get hurt and how then show in 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:04.669
 Then if we get more 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.169
 harm than good in fact has long been 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.189
 began to produce fish oil here in such 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.129
 here are the capsules 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:15.860
 this capsule is sealed accordingly 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:19.069
 in contact with air oxidation not 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.749
 happens and plus to all of course such 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:23.719
 capsules are very easy to dose 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:27.050
 consuming February 4 capsules per day during this 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:29.599
 about three grams of fish oil you 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.759
 get enough omega 3 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.110
 fatty acids 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.059
 which are necessary for our body 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.270
 plus everything to prevent 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:40.999
 oxidation in such capsules add more 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.509
 vitamin e tocopherol which inhibits 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:46.279
 oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.080
 for this reason they have 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.599
 much longer shelf life can 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.749
 stored at room temperature and not 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:55.240
 about harkat yes and how about growth 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.560
 muscle mass 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.689
 really gives such an effect on the very 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.249
 business here just 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.659
 the effect is very slight though 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.149
 there is a study which 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.709
 shows that the effectiveness of training 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:07.599
 increases slightly if the person 

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:10.580
 takes 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:13.909
 omega-3 fatty acids but statistically 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.680
 this data is unreliable that is, in fact 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.149
 to say it's powerful 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.880
 anabolic drug can not be here 

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:23.480
 Still, the main thing is training 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.700
 but even the effect on the cardiovascular and 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.500
 nervous system is enough for that 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.870
 to this drug and regularly 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.420
 eat and what should still 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.120
 need to take an adult 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.160
 man daily about two or three 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.290
 grams depending on body weight 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.670
 usually 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.800
 dosage of either 500 milligrams or 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:47.540
 1000 milligrams respectively this is from 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:50.690
 two to four capsules per day well 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:53.150
 Well you understand everything on offer you 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.270
 take part quiz well 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:00.710
 agreed it is useful to use 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:03.320
 omega-3 fatty acids with depression yes 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.750
 and it really is not a trace 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.210
 show that people who suffer 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.730
 depression of omega-3 dosing 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.230
 fatty acid helps to reduce 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:15.620
 depressive symptoms people start 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.320
 feel better is it dangerous for 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:22.760
 high temperature omega 3 for example 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.310
 work or hot yes and it really is 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.140
 so actually when exposed 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.150
 high temperature oxidation occurs 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.580
 polyunsaturated fatty acids 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.230
 toxic oxidation products are formed 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.630
 which is dangerous for human 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.540
 so the body is not on the linseed oil is not 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.230
 you shouldn't cook on fish oil 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.360
 whether to use 

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.550
 omega-3 fatty acids to speed up 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.160
 recovery after exercise 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:51.320
 yeah well i hope you all understood 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:55.300
 Omega-3 fatty acids, and you, too, it 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.300
 there was a heading chemistry body see you tomorrow
