00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
gonna affect it but then you could use a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.270 
gonna affect it but then you could use a
fairytale<00:00:49.170> move<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:49.829> know<00:00:49.950> cuenta

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
fairytale move which I don't know cuenta

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610

y<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.629> takes<00:00:51.840> credit<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.379> so

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
y and that actually takes credit out so

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200 
y and that actually takes credit out so
it's<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:52.920> bad<00:00:53.250> luck<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.579> my<00:00:53.730> part<00:00:53.760> i

comes<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> delta<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:12.689> goes<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.670> or

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
comes out and delta then goes for a or

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.260 
comes out and delta then goes for a or
to<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.210> goes<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> lost<00:01:16.200> boy<00:01:16.650> rush<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.820> i

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
toxic which was a bad choice i figured i

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.960 
toxic which was a bad choice i figured i
can't<00:01:37.049> got<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> water-type<00:01:37.710> move<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.950> toxic<00:01:38.430> but

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
can't got a water-type move on toxic but

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.700 
can't got a water-type move on toxic but
i<00:01:39.119> forgot<00:01:39.360> about<00:01:39.540> delphox<00:01:40.110> his<00:01:40.320> psychic

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
typing which don't seem to take toxic

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
typing which don't seem to take toxic
out<00:01:42.840> right<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.560> wasn't<00:01:43.950> too<00:01:44.070> great

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
out right there so that wasn't too great

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.719 
out right there so that wasn't too great
there

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
there

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.179 
there
next<00:01:46.729> up<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:46.969> go<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:47.299> switch<00:01:47.539> in<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:48.049> sylveon<00:01:48.590> um

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
next up I go and switch in to sylveon um

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.899 
next up I go and switch in to sylveon um
don't<00:01:50.119> know<00:01:50.210> quite<00:01:50.539> why<00:01:50.689> did<00:01:50.899> sylveon<00:01:51.909> it's

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
don't know quite why did sylveon it's

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.200 
don't know quite why did sylveon it's
not<00:01:53.210> really<00:01:53.509> his<00:01:53.960> reason<00:01:54.619> behind<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.979> um<00:01:55.280> so

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
not really his reason behind that um so

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.880 
not really his reason behind that um so
that<00:01:56.359> he<00:01:56.719> sends<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.350> was<00:01:58.280> he<00:01:58.399> sent<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.789> his<00:01:58.819> ice

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
that he sends is was he sent in his ice

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.219 
that he sends is was he sent in his ice
skuntank<00:02:00.890> rather<00:02:01.429> than<00:02:01.610> his<00:02:01.819> thingy<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.689> went

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
skuntank rather than his thingy I went

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.779 
skuntank rather than his thingy I went
for<00:02:03.319> Shadow<00:02:03.560> Ball<00:02:03.770> because<00:02:04.159> that<00:02:04.640> would<00:02:04.759> have

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
for Shadow Ball because that would have

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:05.919 
for Shadow Ball because that would have
been<00:02:04.909> super<00:02:05.090> effective<00:02:05.329> against<00:02:05.569> delphox

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
been super effective against delphox

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.520 
been super effective against delphox
obviously<00:02:06.890> looking<00:02:07.009> too<00:02:07.130> much<00:02:07.250> damage<00:02:07.459> now<00:02:07.729> I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
obviously looking too much damage now I

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.400 
obviously looking too much damage now I
figured<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.769> um<00:02:10.239> he<00:02:11.239> or<00:02:11.510> he<00:02:11.660> uses<00:02:11.989> toxic<00:02:12.349> I

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
figured that um he or he uses toxic I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.289 
figured that um he or he uses toxic I
think<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.010> went<00:02:13.220> straight<00:02:13.489> for<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.730> TI<00:02:14.000> she<00:02:14.120> went

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
think I went straight for a TI she went

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.330 
think I went straight for a TI she went
from<00:02:14.360> moonblast<00:02:14.890> because<00:02:15.890> he<00:02:16.040> was<00:02:16.160> going<00:02:16.280> to

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
from moonblast because he was going to

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.100 
from moonblast because he was going to
do<00:02:16.459> new<00:02:16.730> damage<00:02:17.030> because<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.390> poisoned<00:02:17.930> dark

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
do new damage because it's poisoned dark

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.140 
do new damage because it's poisoned dark
typing<00:02:18.560> now<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.610> gonna<00:02:19.730> see<00:02:19.910> how<00:02:19.940> much

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
out I gave her a sigh shock but uh

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.000 
out I gave her a sigh shock but uh
protects<00:03:59.819> himself<00:04:00.200> so<00:04:01.200> then<00:04:01.380> poison<00:04:01.830> affects

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
protects himself so then poison affects

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
for case we boost again huh so obviously

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.570 
for case we boost again huh so obviously
nothing<00:04:07.530> with<00:04:07.650> him<00:04:07.770> is<00:04:07.830> gonna<00:04:07.890> be<00:04:07.980> our<00:04:08.099> output

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
nothing with him is gonna be our output

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.580 
nothing with him is gonna be our output
speed<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:08.940> now<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.239> speed<00:04:09.750> boosts<00:04:10.020> he<00:04:10.410> gets

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
speed and now this speed boosts he gets

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.199 
speed and now this speed boosts he gets
replaced<00:04:10.830> can<00:04:11.099> we<00:04:11.160> actually<00:04:11.310> avoid<00:04:11.610> it<00:04:11.819> so<00:04:12.000> I

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
replaced can we actually avoid it so I

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.780
