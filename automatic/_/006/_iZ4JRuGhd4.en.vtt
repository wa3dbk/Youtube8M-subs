starting<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.369> show<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.539> yourself<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
starting to show and for yourself and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.509 
starting to show and for yourself and
for<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.529> team<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.890> well<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.099> mean<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.429> don't

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
for the team as well I mean I don't

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.550 
for the team as well I mean I don't
think<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:29.970> any<00:00:30.119> coincidence<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.380> this

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
think it's any coincidence that this

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.770 
think it's any coincidence that this
team<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.880> probably<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> way<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
team is probably on the way to it a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.560 
team is probably on the way to it a
playoff<00:00:34.410> berth<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> year<00:00:35.460> when<00:00:35.670> when

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
playoff berth in the year when when

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.119 
playoff berth in the year when when
yourself<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> some<00:00:37.350> other<00:00:37.500> players<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:38.010> this

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
yourself and some other players on this

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.490 
yourself and some other players on this
team<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.790> emerged<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.360> mean<00:00:40.230> yeah

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
team have really emerged I mean yeah

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.799 
team have really emerged I mean yeah
that's<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:41.250> owe<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> city<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.690> our

big lines you've been still putting up

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.709 
big lines you've been still putting up
some<00:02:28.469> very<00:02:28.769> very<00:02:29.040> impressive<00:02:29.370> numbers<00:02:29.790> does

some very very impressive numbers does
one<00:02:31.650> lead<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> other<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.879> lot<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.150> ways

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
one lead to the other in a lot of ways

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.409 
one lead to the other in a lot of ways
absolutely<00:02:34.829> you<00:02:35.400> know<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.579> best<00:02:35.730> offense<00:02:36.269> is

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:36.419 
absolutely you know the best offense is

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.929 
absolutely you know the best offense is
a<00:02:36.450> good<00:02:36.540> defense<00:02:36.659> so<00:02:37.519> you<00:02:38.519> know<00:02:38.639> when<00:02:38.790> you're

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
a good defense so you know when you're

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.940 
a good defense so you know when you're
when<00:02:39.299> you're<00:02:39.389> getting<00:02:39.689> stops<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.859> know

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
when you're getting stops and you know

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.709 
when you're getting stops and you know
breaking<00:02:41.310> pucks<00:02:41.549> out<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.819> your<00:02:41.909> zone<00:02:42.180> easily

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
breaking pucks out of your zone easily

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.170 
breaking pucks out of your zone easily
that<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.950> know<00:02:44.040> makes<00:02:44.250> your<00:02:44.430> transition<00:02:45.000> game

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
that you know makes your transition game

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.390 
that you know makes your transition game
not<00:02:45.450> much<00:02:45.659> more<00:02:45.900> effective<00:02:46.409> so<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.709> think<00:02:46.980> we've

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
not much more effective so I think we've

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.949 
not much more effective so I think we've
been<00:02:47.489> doing<00:02:47.699> a<00:02:47.760> great<00:02:47.879> job<00:02:48.000> at<00:02:48.359> that<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.810> the
