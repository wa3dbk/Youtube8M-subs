00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.000
 swing doors and windows have become increasingly 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.760
 give way to sliding structures 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.940
 their range is very large warm

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 this is an easy sliding option 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.120
 large constructions from

 room partition in a residential building 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 This type of construction may be 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.850
 made very large for 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 account of sufficiently large flaps and her 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.710
 increased rigidity when using 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.710

 high enough tightness is

 need to consider when designing on

 queues obliquely sliding design 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.910
 unlike from xt 179 it is warm and

 hermetic construction 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.680
 it allows you to open the doorway in half 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.820

 sliding design is made 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.630
 only using pvc profiles 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.000
 therefore suitable for both cold and

 this is only part of the advantages 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.250
 types of structures before us 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.990
 perfect meeting all strict

 bichebi has a very high

 sealing the perimeter of the sash sometimes 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.170
 half a ton takes place due to simple

 sliding construction from access 22 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.310
 especially constructive allows 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.230
 do any mobile flap that 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.380
 increases comfort in its use

 leave it when glazing a balcony or 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.450
 loggia saves space usually 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.549
 necessary for swinging the sash behind 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.319
 wind bill you a seal on the balcony 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.079
 with such glazing is missing 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.000
 greenhouse effect the possibility of coloring in 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.790
 any color opens wide possibilities 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.150
 for design, if desired, may

 designs from access 22 has 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.540
 extremely attractive price and 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.440
 much cheaper than ordinary glazing from 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.440
 pvc profiles 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.320
 frameless glazing 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.810
 unique design which 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.510
 provides the fullest overview in the open 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.970
 and in the closed position as it does not have 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.390
 vertical temple she preserves 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.400
 holistic overview of the unique facade

 new design word 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.940
 it is a solid wall without equal 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.770
 partitions despite the visible 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.010
 weightlessness this design is very 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.680
 safe without frame construction possible 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.180
 glazing round balconies and other 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.660
 custom shapes 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.180
 due to its ability to bend around corners when 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.280
 otkryvanii sash roll back get 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.770
 kind of opening edge and compact there 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.260
 folded up people have not yet come up 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.050
 more comfortable to maintain than 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.510
 this is because access to 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.940
 either side of the casement with a view 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.000
 security used thick 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.770
 glass impact resistant glazing 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.770
 applied both on loggias and balconies 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.550
 and to protect the terraces and verandas in 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.650
 bad weather 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.930
 spectacular frameless partitions 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.350
 glazing is installed in shopping 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.200
 centers lounges summer cafes and 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.510
 restaurants in custody can be said 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.610
 limited time 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.730
 the glazing of buildings only windows and 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.620
 the doors have gone wide 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.620
 openings and great prospects
