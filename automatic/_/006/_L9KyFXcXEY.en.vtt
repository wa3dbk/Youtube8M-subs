00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.390
 Hello everyone and welcome to this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.600

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.290
 today we will go to art 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:49.080
 practically open three more packages 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.430
 perfect we leave right away this time 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.250
 let 's try to be more fortunate than 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.129
 so nothing came out 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:02.140
 what the minimum should be called 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:07.030
 one player is actually a bit 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:11.979
 disgust but then we have ss is the emblem 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.789
 of the juventus that I will fly together with kato 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:20.080
 player I really expected 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:23.940
 something better but still we see 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.940
 everything as always 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:43.440
 everton while for physical fitness 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:48.240
 let's eliminate away we open our second 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:53.970
 package also this time we have a 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:02:01.920
 nail not read well yes another 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:04.380
 kaka player who absolutely does not 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.640
 like, however, this coach would like 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.640
 let us earn a little something 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.360
 we are obviously all changing into 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.850
 strange row formula 2 packages 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.450
 I really did n't like it greeted 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.130
 the Roma in no one likes and likes you is 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.430
 liked this puppy we keep 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.430
 why 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.140
 then it remains instead we go how many they have 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:41.750
 throw 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:43.940
 the filas can of a exchanged kg ok 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.220
 people also in this episode 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.540
 we arrived at the end so we open 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:56.500
 the last package we have last 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:02.800
 eye package that I can't read 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:07.070
 however barkero stronger is really 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.530
 there is almost total disappointment 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:14.180
 this milan for new well certainly 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:20.300
 three unlucky packages the bad luck mi 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:22.410
 pursues that we must do it guilt 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.700
 of bad luck 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.340
 I think, however, the athletic shirt 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.400
 Madrid 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.170

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.170

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.660

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:52.360
