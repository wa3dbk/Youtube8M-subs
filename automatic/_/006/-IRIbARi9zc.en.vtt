about the race and what I could have

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.250 
about the race and what I could have
done<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:05.130> know<00:03:05.250> want<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.780> good<00:03:06.780> times<00:03:07.020> it's

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
frustrating like you said but I had a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.380 
frustrating like you said but I had a
few<00:03:10.440> ideas<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.980> should<00:03:11.160> have<00:03:11.280> done<00:03:11.460> last<00:03:12.030> week

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
few ideas I should have done last week

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.240 
few ideas I should have done last week
and<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.720> think<00:03:12.990> I<00:03:13.170> probably<00:03:13.740> could<00:03:13.980> have<00:03:14.100> came

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
and I think I probably could have came

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.920 
and I think I probably could have came
out<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.580> top<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:15.000> would<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.300> done<00:03:15.450> them<00:03:15.690> and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
out on top I would have done them and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.060 
out on top I would have done them and
hopefully<00:03:16.170> if<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.590> get<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:16.830> situation

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
hopefully if I get in that situation

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.160 
hopefully if I get in that situation
tonight<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:18.240> I'll<00:03:18.420> use<00:03:18.630> those<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.020> my
