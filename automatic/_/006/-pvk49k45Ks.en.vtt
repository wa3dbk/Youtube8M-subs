a lot of humor

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.650 
a lot of humor
first<00:02:36.460> of<00:02:36.640> all<00:02:36.760> there's<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.060> lot<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.330> humor<00:02:37.630> in

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
first of all there's a lot of humor in

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.260 
first of all there's a lot of humor in
the<00:02:37.780> actual<00:02:38.350> words<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.830> makes<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.190> tight<00:02:39.460> this

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
the actual words it makes you tight this

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.600 
the actual words it makes you tight this
is<00:02:40.480> not<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> game<00:02:41.050> an<00:02:41.860> elementary<00:02:42.280> schooler

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
is not a game an elementary schooler

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.540 
is not a game an elementary schooler
could<00:02:43.150> play<00:02:43.390> under<00:02:44.170> reasonable<00:02:44.770> parenting

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
could play under reasonable parenting

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.950 
could play under reasonable parenting
because<00:02:46.410> there's<00:02:47.410> bad<00:02:47.710> words<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:49.600> you're

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
because there's bad words but you're

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.780 
because there's bad words but you're
expected<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.500> type<00:02:50.710> them<00:02:50.890> out<00:02:51.040> anyway<00:02:51.310> and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
expected to type them out anyway and

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.610 
expected to type them out anyway and
that<00:02:52.150> makes<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> game<00:02:52.600> pretty<00:02:52.840> fun<00:02:53.050> but

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
that makes the game pretty fun but

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.700 
that makes the game pretty fun but
another<00:02:54.210> funny<00:02:55.210> part<00:02:55.630> about<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.080> game<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
another funny part about the game is the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.890 
another funny part about the game is the
entire<00:02:57.100> story<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.700> did<00:02:58.030> not<00:02:58.180> expect<00:02:58.660> there<00:02:58.870> to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
entire story I did not expect there to

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.800 
entire story I did not expect there to
be<00:02:59.070> voice<00:03:00.070> acting<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.730> really<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> decent

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
be voice acting and really a decent

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.790 
be voice acting and really a decent
emphasis<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.410> story<00:03:02.620> but<00:03:02.890> there<00:03:03.040> was<00:03:03.220> it's

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
emphasis on story but there was it's

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.410 
emphasis on story but there was it's
essentially<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:05.830> parody<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.760> buddy<00:03:07.030> cop

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
essentially a parody of a buddy cop

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.600 
essentially a parody of a buddy cop
movie<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.470> you've<00:03:08.680> got<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:08.980> stereotypical

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
movie so you've got this stereotypical

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.770 
movie so you've got this stereotypical
the<00:03:10.570> two<00:03:11.320> very<00:03:11.710> stereotypical<00:03:12.370> cops<00:03:12.910> just

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
the two very stereotypical cops just

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.810 
the two very stereotypical cops just
going<00:03:14.020> around<00:03:14.260> being<00:03:14.620> badasses<00:03:15.100> killing

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
going around being badasses killing

going around being badasses killing
zombies<00:03:16.270> it's<00:03:16.810> pretty<00:03:17.380> hilarious<00:03:18.300> there<00:03:19.300> are

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
zombies it's pretty hilarious there are

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.650 
zombies it's pretty hilarious there are
times<00:03:20.050> when<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.560> does<00:03:20.770> try<00:03:21.190> too<00:03:21.250> hard<00:03:21.490> as<00:03:22.060> you

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
might expect but there are also times

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.300 
might expect but there are also times
where<00:03:26.320> it's<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.590> hit<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:26.890> nail<00:03:27.010> on<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.220> head

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
is it tries a bit too hard at times with

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.050 
is it tries a bit too hard at times with
the<00:06:20.080> humor<00:06:20.410> and<00:06:20.530> you<00:06:21.400> know<00:06:21.520> that<00:06:21.669> can<00:06:21.789> be<00:06:21.880> let

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
the humor and you know that can be let

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.700 
the humor and you know that can be let
down<00:06:22.090> but<00:06:22.450> every<00:06:22.900> game<00:06:23.110> that<00:06:23.139> tries<00:06:23.500> to<00:06:23.620> be

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
down but every game that tries to be

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.950 
down but every game that tries to be
funny<00:06:23.740> does<00:06:24.160> that<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:24.580> also<00:06:25.419> the<00:06:25.599> graphics

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
funny does that and also the graphics

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.990 
funny does that and also the graphics
are<00:06:26.349> atrocious<00:06:26.650> but<00:06:27.160> I<00:06:27.190> don't<00:06:27.490> know<00:06:27.760> if

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
watching this video I'm pretty sure the

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.320 
watching this video I'm pretty sure the
graphics<00:06:44.110> we're<00:06:44.290> intently<00:06:44.950> low<00:06:45.640> resolutions

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
graphics we're intently low resolutions

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.570 
graphics we're intently low resolutions
and<00:06:46.420> stuff<00:06:46.630> so<00:06:46.810> they<00:06:46.960> could<00:06:47.190> allow<00:06:48.190> it<00:06:48.340> to<00:06:48.460> run

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
and stuff so they could allow it to run

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.070 
and stuff so they could allow it to run
on<00:06:48.760> many<00:06:48.940> different<00:06:49.120> machines<00:06:49.510> I<00:06:49.720> mean<00:06:49.870> it<00:06:49.960> is

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
on many different machines I mean it is

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.580 
on many different machines I mean it is
an<00:06:50.200> ish<00:06:50.440> game<00:06:50.710> anyway<00:06:51.100> so<00:06:51.300> it's<00:06:52.300> not<00:06:52.540> like<00:06:52.840> they

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
an ish game anyway so it's not like they

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.590
