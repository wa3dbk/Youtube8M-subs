though she's 16 inches it doesn't really

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.930 
though she's 16 inches it doesn't really
matter<00:00:56.530> because<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:57.159> basics<00:00:57.550> are<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.909> same

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
matter because the basics are the same

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.840 
matter because the basics are the same
whether<00:00:58.390> it's<00:00:58.600> 12<00:00:58.929> or<00:00:59.140> 16<00:00:59.679> or<00:00:59.829> 22<00:01:00.550> for<00:01:00.729> that

whether it's 12 or 16 or 22 for that

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.670 
whether it's 12 or 16 or 22 for that
matter<00:01:01.059> I<00:01:01.829> began<00:01:02.829> with<00:01:04.229> draping<00:01:05.229> this<00:01:05.350> over

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
matter I began with draping this over

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.320 
matter I began with draping this over
and<00:01:05.890> exceptionally<00:01:06.670> I'm<00:01:06.850> dreaming<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.300> whole

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
and exceptionally I'm dreaming the whole

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.840 
and exceptionally I'm dreaming the whole
thing<00:01:07.900> because<00:01:08.440> this<00:01:08.920> stretch<00:01:09.340> is<00:01:09.549> quite<00:01:09.820> a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
thing because this stretch is quite a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.050 
thing because this stretch is quite a
bit<00:01:10.210> so<00:01:10.600> we<00:01:11.229> can't<00:01:11.560> just<00:01:11.770> do<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.040> one<00:01:12.520> side<00:01:12.909> of

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
bit so we can't just do the one side of

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.520 
bit so we can't just do the one side of
it<00:01:13.180> but<00:01:13.479> what<00:01:13.659> we're<00:01:13.780> going<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:13.960> do<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.320> we're

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
it but what we're going to do is we're

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.219 
it but what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.210> entire<00:01:16.540> side<00:01:16.899> and<00:01:17.140> then

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
going to do the entire side and then

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.929 
going to do the entire side and then
we're<00:01:17.380> going<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.590> fold<00:01:17.890> over<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.250> then<00:01:18.430> we're

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
we're going to fold over and then we're

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.380 
we're going to fold over and then we're
going<00:01:19.119> to<00:01:19.590> make<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.770> more<00:01:21.210> symmetrical<00:01:22.210> a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
going to make it more symmetrical a

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.760

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
need to go to that center line what

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.350 
need to go to that center line what
we'll<00:02:31.720> do<00:02:31.990> is<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:33.010> transfer<00:02:33.940> everything<00:02:34.060> on

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
we'll do is to transfer everything on

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.930 
we'll do is to transfer everything on
the<00:02:34.420> other<00:02:34.540> side<00:02:34.870> after<00:02:35.380> we've<00:02:36.340> only<00:02:36.520> marked

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
the other side after we've only marked

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.120 
the other side after we've only marked
one<00:02:37.090> side<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.480> dolls<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.800> only<00:02:38.950> have

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
one side of the dolls so we only have

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.560 
one side of the dolls so we only have
the<00:02:39.160> references<00:02:39.730> for<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.090> that's<00:02:40.210> okay

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
the references for and that's okay

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.760 
the references for and that's okay
because<00:02:40.720> we'd<00:02:41.050> still<00:02:41.230> have<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.500> do<00:02:41.620> this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
because we'd still have to do this

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.210 
because we'd still have to do this
process<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:43.030> I'm<00:02:43.510> marking<00:02:44.020> all<00:02:44.230> along<00:02:44.590> the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
process so I'm marking all along the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.750 
process so I'm marking all along the
armhole<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:47.200> side<00:02:47.770> then<00:02:48.190> that's<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
armhole and the side then that's the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.670 
armhole and the side then that's the
purpose<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.240> that<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.630> so<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.990> we<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.500> some

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
purpose of that is so that we have some

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.010 
purpose of that is so that we have some
kind<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:50.890> guide<00:02:51.160> when<00:02:51.490> we<00:02:51.610> add<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.940> back<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.420> so

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
kind of guide when we add the back on so

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.600 
kind of guide when we add the back on so
with<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.590> I'm<00:02:53.830> going<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.100> turn<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.430> dial

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
with that I'm going to turn the dial

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.970 
with that I'm going to turn the dial
around<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.330> I'm<00:02:56.110> going<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:59.460> tape<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:01.980> next

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
around and I'm going to tape the next

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.130 
around and I'm going to tape the next
fabric<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.760> her<00:03:06.180> actually<00:03:07.180> instead<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.690> taping

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
fabric to her actually instead of taping

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.490 
fabric to her actually instead of taping
this<00:03:08.470> I've<00:03:09.010> pinned<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.820> I<00:03:09.970> pinned<00:03:10.240> it<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.600> the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
this I've pinned it I pinned it to the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.020 
this I've pinned it I pinned it to the
fabric<00:03:11.740> that's<00:03:12.070> already<00:03:12.280> underneath<00:03:12.790> and

is<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:24.340> way<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.580> should<00:04:24.820> be<00:04:26.700> okay<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:27.729> have

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
is the way it should be okay I have

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.060 
is the way it should be okay I have
pinned<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.780> side<00:04:29.080> of<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.320> I<00:04:29.560> pinned<00:04:29.890> this

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
well now we still have to pin the top so

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.510 
well now we still have to pin the top so
I'm<00:05:01.410> going<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.740> go<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.370> um<00:05:03.020> tape<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.470> now<00:05:05.039> join

I'm going to go and um tape and now join

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.020 
I'm going to go and um tape and now join

the back with the front I've pinned
everything<00:05:12.210> down<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:12.960> clipped<00:05:13.260> away

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
everything down I clipped away

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.950 
everything down I clipped away
excessively<00:05:14.580> being<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:14.940> little<00:05:15.150> bit<00:05:15.330> of<00:05:15.419> margin

excessively being a little bit of margin

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.920 
excessively being a little bit of margin
to<00:05:16.380> play<00:05:16.590> with<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.160> so<00:05:18.030> with<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.539> I<00:05:18.780> will

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
to play with and so with that I will

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.640 
to play with and so with that I will
mark<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.889> remaining<00:05:20.370> areas<00:05:21.240> which<00:05:21.419> is<00:05:21.650> the

mark the remaining areas which is the
shoulders<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.580> make<00:05:23.699> sure<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.330> whole

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
shoulders and make sure that the whole

shoulders and make sure that the whole
shoulder<00:05:24.900> and<00:05:25.289> make<00:05:25.889> sure<00:05:26.100> that<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.370> neck

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
shoulder and make sure that the neck

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.129 
shoulder and make sure that the neck
lines<00:05:26.789> are<00:05:27.060> well<00:05:27.240> marked<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.990> that

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
lines are well marked and that

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.900 
lines are well marked and that
everything<00:05:28.620> is<00:05:28.770> just<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.070> way<00:05:29.190> you<00:05:29.250> want<00:05:29.610> and

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
everything is just the way you want and

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.510 
everything is just the way you want and
with<00:05:30.840> that<00:05:31.020> we're<00:05:31.199> going<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.410> unpin<00:05:32.250> and

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
with that we're going to unpin and

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.110 
with that we're going to unpin and
flatten<00:05:33.000> it<00:05:33.060> out<00:05:34.430> when<00:05:35.430> you<00:05:35.550> flatten<00:05:35.820> it<00:05:36.000> out

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
flatten it out when you flatten it out

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.170 
flatten it out when you flatten it out
of<00:05:36.630> course<00:05:36.990> you've<00:05:37.139> got<00:05:37.169> one<00:05:37.979> side<00:05:38.280> you'll

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
of course you've got one side you'll

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.150 
of course you've got one side you'll
note<00:05:39.389> that<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:40.289> pattern<00:05:40.650> is<00:05:40.770> going<00:05:40.919> to<00:05:41.070> be

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
note that the pattern is going to be

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.089 
note that the pattern is going to be
quite<00:05:41.430> curvy<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.060> that's<00:05:42.770> indicative<00:05:43.770> of

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
quite curvy and that's indicative of

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.129 
quite curvy and that's indicative of
this<00:05:44.430> type<00:05:44.639> of<00:05:44.669> a<00:05:44.880> pattern<00:05:45.300> because<00:05:45.690> we<00:05:45.960> are

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
this type of a pattern because we are

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.930 
this type of a pattern because we are
following<00:05:46.620> her<00:05:46.770> form<00:05:47.039> there<00:05:47.220> are<00:05:47.250> no<00:05:47.550> darts

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
following her form there are no darts

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.990 
following her form there are no darts
the<00:05:48.450> only<00:05:48.780> area<00:05:49.500> that<00:05:49.530> should<00:05:49.830> not<00:05:50.070> be<00:05:50.099> curvy

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
the only area that should not be curvy

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.710 
the only area that should not be curvy
should<00:05:51.300> be<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.780> shoulder<00:05:52.470> line<00:05:52.620> so<00:05:52.889> you'll

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
should be the shoulder line so you'll

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.420 
should be the shoulder line so you'll
straighten<00:05:54.720> that<00:05:54.930> up<00:05:55.139> a<00:05:55.320> bit<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:55.680> everything

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
straighten that up a bit and everything

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.600 
straighten that up a bit and everything
else<00:05:56.669> will<00:05:56.910> just<00:05:56.940> kind<00:05:57.479> of<00:05:58.130> sketch<00:05:59.130> we<00:05:59.400> have

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
else will just kind of sketch we have

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.010 
else will just kind of sketch we have
half<00:05:59.970> but<00:06:00.750> before<00:06:01.229> I<00:06:01.560> take<00:06:02.070> it<00:06:02.099> to<00:06:02.690> graph<00:06:03.690> paper

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
half but before I take it to graph paper

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.040 
half but before I take it to graph paper
is<00:06:04.199> always<00:06:04.560> very<00:06:04.770> nice<00:06:05.039> to<00:06:05.099> keep<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:06.050> weight

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
is always very nice to keep the weight

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.159 
is always very nice to keep the weight
to<00:06:07.889> keep<00:06:08.070> the<00:06:08.250> ratio<00:06:08.460> between<00:06:08.789> left<00:06:09.750> side<00:06:09.960> to

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
to keep the ratio between left side to

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.879 
to keep the ratio between left side to
right<00:06:10.199> side<00:06:10.550> pretty<00:06:11.550> much<00:06:11.789> out<00:06:12.210> there<00:06:12.889> before

I do that I want to pin it and then put
