00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.270
 Hello and welcome to the call 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.120
 on thursday a fresh cod 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.559
 comments like every Thursday with new 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.330
 hot topics and since we the 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.530
 last weeks so hotly when to go 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.090
 I go back a bit further today 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.440
 in the time a topic which I already the 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.969
 wanted to bring the whole time is 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.439
 the devil today is on it 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.550
 answer and above all interested 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.839
 me what you think to the can you 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.400
 I like to write in the comments 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.929
 But before we get to the actual topic 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.019
 come short preface to the gameplay 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.509
 i play here on express with the 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.320
 I have scala towers on it double 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:35.710
 Magazine from the basement was created 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.870
 and extras were blind watchers stuck 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.640
 Wired and what it was after frets 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.740
 or something in the direction and then 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.570
 I still have it anyway 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.600
 back to the topic was what is it about 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.610
 actually , the devil was ea 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.430
 a few weeks ago once again 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.230
 worst companies and america 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.310
 voted for the second time over seat in 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.710
 follow this title 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.540
 picked up and really so I have that 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.150
 with a certain smile did not go 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.350
 just about the whole thing and then me 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.130
 actually has a bit of a breast 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.159
 then again the statement of ceo peter 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.499
 Moore of the ruling open letter 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.270
 wrote and I read and now 

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:16.060
 times in front and not the complete letter 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.920
 but just a few excerpts from it 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.450
 the whole is in English I last 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.549
 then briefly in German 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.530
 we do not transport the whole thing 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.560
 understood 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.240
 we are the best company in America 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.929
 was unanimous halliburton whatever 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.729
 what if exxon was mobile in the city 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:42.459
 games report is far away processing and 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.310
 higher communitys ground waters pilling 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.709
 free for 2011 on teur in the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.469
 Run through the middle recognize that so what us 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.789
 dear peter voh wants to say that is 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.829
 Of course we have a bad game 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.420
 developed in the fall sin city and the 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.450
 is of course much worse meant 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.819
 of course sarcastic as somehow yes 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.499
 the environment with oil disasters too 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.119
 otherwise they will fail to improve 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.889
 dear Peter just what is that please for 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.329
 the homicide argument want us now 

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:09.670
 other undertaking to an even 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.280
 Much worse than it is 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.900
 so that, for example, rome worse 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.340
 market 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.510
 Nobody and I think everyone will 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.950
 a signature under then puts if 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.390
 You would say haye in the area 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.120
 Let's take her to the kag 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.060
 but ea has a much wider range 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.730
 you have millions of customers worldwide and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.510
 also in america and the anti crawls 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.340
 bad lobby for example the anti 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.799
 Oil pollution lobby anyway or 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.909
 activists who are just not as much 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.280
 celik and if that one 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.049
 Internet voting is probably everyone 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.909
 participate of america it's 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.680
 yes, of course, that the people choose that 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.319
 as for her at the table 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.239
 since I do not have so much with me everyday 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.519
 Slaughtered robben babies have to do 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.049
 it is obvious that if you 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.420
 a playful rush brings a shit 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.220
 port and then things diel says 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.299
 It has been the first two weeks 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.849
 the game does not work like that 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.859
 For example, simcity that you are the bad guy 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.810
 is and is incensed and then of course too 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.189
 So this company is right 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.780
 not have dismissed by saying 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.230
 hey thats bad these were 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.209
 worse 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.950
 that is not possible anyway you can not 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.720
 objectively measure what is that really 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.010
 worst worst companies 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.780
 one should instead of the times 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.819
 grab your own nose and think twice 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.680
 Something went wrong there 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.750
 will be the second time in a row for this 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.209
 Price are nominated and the thing then 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.410
 even with ah and crash with far 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.569
 gain a lead 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.260
 but love comes from this thought 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.090
 Of course, not the whole thing behind me 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.209
 letter will be out this year 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.519
 station unterton on and caught up 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.870
 a bit rum direct providers now 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.599
 disgusting when I have to be honest 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.129
 So that's what they say 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.250
 Crown put on this choice 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.909
 interesting there is something else that again 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.680
 consumer portal wants to be consumerist too 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.989
 This statement from Peter only again 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.000
 I say I read that out 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.470
 this to the following just about that 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.720
 to clarify the meaning of this 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.310
 For eight years it has been the competition 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.379
 to enable consumers 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.150
 send message to a company 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.159
 that were him and services 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.079
 the victory offers in this competition 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.180
 means that your customers try 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.590
 to tell them something and that they 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.959
 as a company the trophy in shape 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.729
 one droppings it earn the most 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.709
 and that's directly mine 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.139
 Signature under it like it is 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.090
 ea has again real fuck 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.170
 allowed or needed for example 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.450
 not on sims anymore 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.030
 Let's take a look at space 3 and a half 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.280
 60 euro gets in the game and gets 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.230
 then a ass full of dlcs you have on 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.030
 first day at the psn store or on the 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.860
 marketplace at xbox live watched what 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.560
 is how we have been shut down 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.480
 with download content actually like that 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.890
 I could have listened to the game 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.420
 me now just as exciting that 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.280
 gameplay marches now also to the end 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.780
 Your opinion would be me 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.160
 of course they also bring interest 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.570
 still good games out and publisher 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.660
 but they are playing lately 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.880
 really just bad news 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.010
 and thus have this price perfect 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.290
 in my opinion deserves something 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.300
 said Peter Moore too general and before 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.310
 everything to your opinion to your yes 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.750
 at her price she rightfully deserves 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.820
 I would be interested 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.170
 skin clean and dust on that I still have 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.010
 I almost forgot you have now 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.600
 of course the corner for the 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.800
 Gas payments seen who wants to know how 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.420
 you get it he just looks 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.220
 the found last week 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.420
 so that was really it for now 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.900
 high because I liked the whole thing 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.900
 pure skin
