test on this wood gas stove I already
started<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.690> up<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.990> save<00:00:25.170> us<00:00:25.320> some<00:00:25.439> time<00:00:25.500> here

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
started it up to save us some time here

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.310 
started it up to save us some time here
because<00:00:26.880> I'm<00:00:27.000> trying<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> beat<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.540> rainstorm

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.690 

made<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> fire<00:00:31.650> with<00:00:32.070> wood<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.489> found

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
made the fire with wood that I found

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.090 
made the fire with wood that I found
around<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.120> yard<00:00:33.440> drops<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.650> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> tree

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
around in my yard drops out of the tree

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.549 
around in my yard drops out of the tree
so<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.520> all<00:00:35.640> soft<00:00:35.940> stuff<00:00:36.330> I'm<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.470> have

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
so it's all soft stuff I'm going to have

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.500 
so it's all soft stuff I'm going to have
to<00:00:37.620> keep<00:00:37.830> filling<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.360> other

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510

water that on put on it's about 45

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.830 
water that on put on it's about 45
degrees<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:54.360> water<00:00:54.600> temperature

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
degrees out here the water temperature

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.639 
degrees out here the water temperature
from<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> house<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.890> 56<00:00:56.489> degrees<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> I'll<00:00:58.469> put

10<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.910> 11<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:27.550> 12<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:32.190> little<00:02:33.190> trouble<00:02:33.550> there

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
10 to 11 to 12 a little trouble there

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.510 
10 to 11 to 12 a little trouble there
almost<00:02:34.780> let<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.080> fire<00:02:35.410> go<00:02:35.440> out<00:02:35.710> when<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.220> went

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
almost let the fire go out when I went

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.910 
almost let the fire go out when I went
to<00:02:36.580> look<00:02:36.760> for<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:38.550> guard<00:02:39.550> for<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.920> temperature

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
to look for a guard for the temperature

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.160 
to look for a guard for the temperature
probe

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.200 

this<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.290> all<00:02:48.470> real<00:02:48.740> soft<00:02:49.070> wood<00:02:49.460> plus<00:02:49.910> i<00:02:50.060> was

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
this is all real soft wood plus i was

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.580 
this is all real soft wood plus i was
using<00:02:50.420> pinecones<00:02:52.780> anything<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.960> little

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
using pinecones anything that a little

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.460 
using pinecones anything that a little
stuff<00:02:54.920> might<00:02:55.280> find<00:02:55.580> along<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:55.910> trail

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.010 

definitely<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.500> fire<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:04.070> have<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.370> keep

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
definitely a fire that you have to keep

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.840 
definitely a fire that you have to keep
attending<00:03:06.020> and<00:03:06.380> filling<00:03:09.190> let's<00:03:10.190> let<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.610> go

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
attending and filling let's let this go

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
attending and filling let's let this go
for<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:12.610> didn't<00:03:13.610> notice<00:03:13.730> what<00:03:14.030> time<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:14.480> started

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
for I didn't notice what time it started

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.470 
for I didn't notice what time it started
to<00:03:14.960> boil<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.380> have<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.680> look<00:03:15.830> back<00:03:19.330> let<00:03:20.330> this

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
to boil I have to look back let this

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.420 
to boil I have to look back let this
burn<00:03:20.780> for<00:03:21.080> another<00:03:21.320> minute<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.010> we<00:03:22.250> get

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
burn for another minute so that we get

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:31.320 
burn for another minute so that we get
our<00:03:22.660> safe<00:03:23.660> drinking<00:03:24.140> water

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.410 

and<00:03:31.930> anyway<00:03:32.740> there<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.610> have<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:33.850> relatively

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
and anyway there you have a relatively

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.420 
and anyway there you have a relatively
easy<00:03:34.860> wood<00:03:35.860> gas<00:03:36.130> type<00:03:36.490> stove<00:03:37.980> burning<00:03:38.980> soft

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
easy wood gas type stove burning soft

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.790 
easy wood gas type stove burning soft
wood<00:03:39.990> stuff<00:03:40.990> off<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.350> trail<00:03:45.420> pinecones<00:03:46.800> small

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
wood stuff off the trail pinecones small

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:56.190 
wood stuff off the trail pinecones small
branches<00:03:48.810> all<00:03:49.810> soft<00:03:50.290> stuff<00:03:53.610> so<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:54.990> know<00:03:55.990> if<00:03:56.140> you

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
branches all soft stuff so I know if you

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.780 
branches all soft stuff so I know if you
can<00:03:56.350> find<00:03:56.530> one<00:03:56.740> much<00:03:56.920> easier<00:03:57.280> than<00:03:57.460> this<00:03:57.580> to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
can find one much easier than this to

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.210 
can find one much easier than this to
make

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.160
