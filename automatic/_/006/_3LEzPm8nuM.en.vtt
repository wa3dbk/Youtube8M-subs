00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.000 
remember is when you look into them
you'll<00:01:12.090> notice<00:01:12.510> right<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> centre<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
looks that you've got the little calyx

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.050 
looks that you've got the little calyx
and<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> little<00:01:16.950> white<00:01:17.640> cross

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and it's just like a little white cross

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.990 
and it's just like a little white cross
if<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.100> new<00:01:20.400> bloom<00:01:20.700> and

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
wait a few weeks and see how they can be

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.230 
wait a few weeks and see how they can be
conditioned<00:06:19.979> comes<00:06:20.190> up<00:06:20.400> and<00:06:20.490> as<00:06:20.610> they<00:06:20.759> dry<00:06:21.060> off

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240
