00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.840
 have you ever thought that the presence of 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.330
 a strainer or a bath on the 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.999
 entrance door or on your bed to the 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.320
 sleep can be 70 and health more than 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.740
 what do you imagine 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.580
 the windows the doors the collage the 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.070
 corridors all that is a fundamental part 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.830
 of a house in this philosophy write 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.920
 sexy is not considered the house as a 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.290
 service and the veins that we are going to associate 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.710
 with the corridors the eyes with the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.539
 windows the doors in the mouth is very 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.519
 peculiar I am curious and the most 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.739
 important is your rest area for 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.440
 that today we are going to focus on the subject 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.109
 of health when we talk about 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.359
 an environment of a space the influence 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.190
 that this exercises over us is more 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.159
 great than what we could 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.780
 think your unconscious emits a 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.960
 reaction to everything that is 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.660
 capturing all its surroundings and based on 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.510
 this option is seven results 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.330
 if you modify your environment then the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.820
 results to matÃ­as the magic is in you 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.170
 the important thing is to make us aware of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.570
 everything that is having 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.760
 influence in our life and in what 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.100
 we are attracting useful today 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.619
 precisely to vibrate through the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.060
 health energy we will use and 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.270
 let's go to our 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.570
 most precious flowers and today we play in 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.240
 yellow color natural flowers el 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.610
 today they are yellow because 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.880
 in yellow is the color that vibrates with the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.890
 energy of health within what 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.200
 it's been and the king's philosophy already 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.970
 there are different theories and schools by 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.399
 consequently we will be able to paint and 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.009
 work the exposure health of 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.380
 sizes of certain areas as well 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.780
 from the position based on the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.820
 conception although I mean a place 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.710
 where you are going to locate health energy 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.960
 in your house in your space is going to be the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.539
 center the center of all construction 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.580
 the center of each room and even 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.270
 the ethical center when we talk about 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.580
 drains 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.910
 we talk about a need 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.330
 down that is holding back that steals 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.730
 the energy one of the shepherd principles 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.250
 facebook something which is key 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.370
 facebook analyzes is as it should 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 have a greater amount of energy they 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.170
 they call chip inside your house because it 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.390
 separates total health into abundance in 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.970
 achievements in which your life flows from a 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.250
 obviously appropriate and correct 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.640
 have sewers and drains that energy 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.350
 it escapes and is not retained at home so it's 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.000
 that my first task is very important 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.830
 that I am going to leave you today is that 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.140
 check where you have strainers at home 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.970
 Beware of those who are outside in the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.100
 street because they are also stealing the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.690
 energy before it reaches your home and 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.550
 that's going to reflect on health for 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.680
 swing the pints is a red line 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.030
 all around eye since we did that 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.610
 even those who are being 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.340
 sink or sink or open the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.620
 doors and below you put the tube that 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.440
 red line is very important since 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.840
 we saw that let's check in what position 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.920
 the bathrooms are what I mean bathroom 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.590
 that was just up 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.260
 system or the water tank or the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.319
 laundry any drain that is left 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.760
 on your bed can affect your health 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.040
 mainly to those bodies that are 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.110
 associate with the metal element or with the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.530
 water element that are kidneys bladder or 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.890
 sexual organs lungs and intestine 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.130
 thick ok since we saw this we can 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.230
 us do if for some reason you 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.180
 you have these drains on what is your 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.730
 bed when sleeping the first option would be 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.190
 change your position bed I know no 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.290
 it is always easy to achieve this if not 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.019
 you may or may not have the option or the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.540
 space to change your bed then what 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.180
 What can we do is suggest you 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.850
 that you paint and that bathroom or that 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.480
 area or that water tank because of all that has 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.120
 what to do with him 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.730
 in shades of green because that's going to 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.400
 generate that energy doing and no longer 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.590
 it escapes so easily down the drain 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.690
 since we did that now we're going with the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.290
 next step that can affect your 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.569
 health where is the stove where is the 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.389
 chimney 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.940
 where is your bed where is the box 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.250
 lights throughout the house 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.470
 those are aspects that generate too much 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.690
 stress and obviously are reflected in not 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.550
 sleep and not rest what you are going to have 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.220
 consequently, your defenses go down 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.580
 and your health is fragile if for some 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.610
 Scale ratio is right over the kitchen 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.340
 and to still complicate it a little bit 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.680
 more just above the stove careful 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.410
 because that about warm your organs and 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.620
 it can be reflected in stress conflicts 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.210
 the new and the constant but the most 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.580
 complicated is that you can start 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.160
 affect your organs associated with games 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.960
 that would be the eyes in the heart what 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.940
 we can do if this is our case 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.250
 well there are two options the first is 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.710
 place an exploded with reflective face 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.990
 under your bed looking down 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.599
 towards what is being the stove or the 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.090
 pitcher or a chimney if for some 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.070
 reason for some reason is complicated is 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.500
 because you have a pet except for the tip 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.199
 they are with water and all traction is painted on 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.060
 Chest of your kitchen in a yellow color 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:24.050
 we do not advance in it 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.360
 where is the light box where is it 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.790
 everything that has been the entries of 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.400
 electric light there is some transformer 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.270
 near your window near your bedroom 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.360
 all that lowers its defenses more than it 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.669
 you can finish and obviously it reflects 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.950
 in constant illnesses if for some 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.470
 reason you have the light sockets very 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.660
 near your cameras and their walls with 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.660
 of these plastic caps that 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.400
 sold in the market for security reasons 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.840
 that they sell you for children so they do not 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.810
 put your fingers in the facts then 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.490
 You can place these caps on those 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.190
 plugs that are on the sides of your 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.610
 bed since we do that if for some 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.190
 reason if you stay sleeping on the box 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.229
 deluxe completed at home or live in 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.410
 a building and you have the electric gate 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:15.350
 right down there is your support more 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.660
 clear to this tension that causes the 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.810
 electromagnetic effect places a cork 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.000
 between the base and the mattress of your bed or 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.620
 of the door the mask 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.020
 isolation 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.850
 are you liking we go to our house of 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.310
 fruits to see that we find ourselves 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.310
 it seems good that we are going to accompany you
