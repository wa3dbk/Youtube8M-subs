00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
hi I'm Gary boss the marketing director

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.889 
hi I'm Gary boss the marketing director
for<00:00:05.580> audio<00:00:05.940> technique<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.509> I'm<00:00:06.600> here<00:00:06.810> at

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
for audio technique and I'm here at

Sonic<00:00:07.230> Electronix<00:00:07.350> talking<00:00:08.160> about<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.460> three

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
Sonic Electronix talking about the three

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.209 
Sonic Electronix talking about the three
to<00:00:08.970> one<00:00:09.179> rule<00:00:09.450> now<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> three<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:10.800> rule<00:00:11.040> is

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
to one rule now the three to one rule is

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.220 
to one rule now the three to one rule is
a<00:00:11.250> good<00:00:11.519> way<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> avoid<00:00:12.120> phase<00:00:12.540> issues<00:00:12.780> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
a good way to avoid phase issues and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.440 
a good way to avoid phase issues and
using<00:00:13.530> multiple<00:00:14.040> microphones<00:00:14.250> now<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.269> can

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
using multiple microphones now this can

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.750 
using multiple microphones now this can
be<00:00:15.480> with<00:00:15.960> multiple<00:00:16.560> individual<00:00:17.070> vocalists

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
be with multiple individual vocalists

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.240 
be with multiple individual vocalists
like<00:00:17.880> maybe<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.180> backing<00:00:18.869> vocal<00:00:19.230> scenario<00:00:19.890> or

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
like maybe a backing vocal scenario or

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.269 
like maybe a backing vocal scenario or
when<00:00:20.850> you're<00:00:21.000> making<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.420> choir<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.680> rule<00:00:22.949> says

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
when you're making a choir the rule says

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.910 
when you're making a choir the rule says
to<00:00:24.180> take<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.689> distance<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> nearest

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
to take the distance to the nearest

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.189 
to take the distance to the nearest
sound<00:00:26.369> source<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.119> make<00:00:27.599> certain<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
sound source and make certain that the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
sound source and make certain that the
next<00:00:28.500> mic<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:28.980> least<00:00:29.130> three<00:00:29.490> times<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
next mic is at least three times that

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.049 
next mic is at least three times that
distance<00:00:30.240> away<00:00:31.009> this<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.130> pretty<00:00:32.279> easy<00:00:32.550> math<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
distance away this is pretty easy math I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.069 
distance away this is pretty easy math I
think<00:00:33.239> everyone<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.989> don't

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
think everyone can do this you don't

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.110 
think everyone can do this you don't
need<00:00:34.230> your<00:00:34.410> logarithmic<00:00:35.399> calculate<00:00:36.030> or

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
need your logarithmic calculate or

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.060 
need your logarithmic calculate or
anything<00:00:37.280> essentially<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:39.000> backing<00:00:39.510> group

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
anything essentially in a backing group

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.840 
anything essentially in a backing group

inches off the microphone you want to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
inches off the microphone you want to
make<00:00:46.440> certain<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.190> eighteen<00:00:47.789> inches

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
make certain that your eighteen inches

youth urge to use more microphones that
can<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.180> cause<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.630> kinds<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.860> problems

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
can just cause all kinds of problems

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
can just cause all kinds of problems
now<00:01:08.790> while<00:01:09.000> phase<00:01:09.210> issues<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.750> still<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.170> a

problem at these distances the reason

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.899 
problem at these distances the reason
this<00:01:12.510> works<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.619> second<00:01:14.070> sound<00:01:14.250> source<00:01:14.670> at

this works is the second sound source at

this works is the second sound source at
that<00:01:15.090> distance<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.689> far<00:01:15.930> enough<00:01:16.140> away<00:01:16.350> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that distance is far enough away that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.460

the signal from your main sound source

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.429 
the signal from your main sound source
is<00:01:19.799> much<00:01:20.490> louder<00:01:20.939> than<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.930> second<00:01:22.290> sound

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439

source coming in the reason that this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.289 
source coming in the reason that this
phase<00:01:25.350> problem<00:01:25.890> happens<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:26.909> two

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
phase problem happens is if you have two

they're arriving at different times and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
they're arriving at different times and
you<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.150> phase<00:01:33.450> cancellation<00:01:33.780> we're<00:01:34.259> going

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you get phase cancellation we're going

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.899 
you get phase cancellation we're going
to<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> quick<00:01:34.890> little<00:01:35.070> demo<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.670> after
