00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.109
 yes Kevin Strootman were that match 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.670
 against Japan the equal game in terms of feeling 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.259
 perhaps directions went defeat 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.999
 this draw may feel a little minor 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.039
 bit like a win 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.349
 then go more i way than after the 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.910
 match against japan that is natural 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.790
 again before we win such a competition 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.040
 only play with a whole on the 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.330
 team again some injury 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.660
 injury case a fuse of the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.280
 least players and then you know that 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.320
 difficult to be sure someone could stand 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.329
 we just got it right 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.790
 defend organization organization stood 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.470
 well given no chances and have it myself 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.120
 you created some small options and 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.860
 of course the public hope for one 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.630
 nicer mass of more offensive alone 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.130
 then so 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.960
 I understand that and I hope so 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.120
 that it becomes even more difficult then sand 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.800
 first duel that went from 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.930
 that was bored between falcao and 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.430
 debutant in the center of fieldman or flan 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.380
 also those who have the fuck out 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.550
 surely reasonable had in the bag 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.320
 why not scored and then it goes 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.610
 end up getting hot one 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.040
 friendly match to be that 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.320
 it was hard to find at times 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.269
 yes that is true and of course your home that 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.590
 such a sluggish race is that 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.970
 not good for anyone in the car naturally 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.570
 only play if you have a violation on 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.130
 assignment I might see it now 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.750
 competition matches must miss then 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.680
 then so can the natural heart 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.789
 only something like that should be played 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.079
 not really but you see it 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.909
 happens 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:31.850
 lens gets red on the orange side 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:33.439
 are then smart in that game think now 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.689
 that the woman has the man looks at me 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.490
 I did n't see the images like that 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.289
 but yes if you know more that the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.939
 wrongest than smart in the game 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.380
 then nobody knows the referee can be one 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.700
 red card for the violation of 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.299
 8 and then they are again 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.380
 so stupid temptation 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.640
 Colombia back again in advance 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.509
 announced as an opponent of 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.490
 format 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.459
 how are you through that for that matter 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.810
 encounter these lessons in your eyes 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.090
 considering we are a bit more compact in players 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.009
 I am closer to Japan then we see 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.659
 That we still had a trouble was serious 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.179
 turning red we are going back to the 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.470
 basis that is important to it a lot 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.149
 new guys to everyone knows what 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.200
 must happen at those positions in the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.810
 competition had to go three times 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.040
 and then the guys in it 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.420
 come do it too 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.459
 and that gives a good feeling 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.750
 occasional striker fair 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.310
 yes but that is actually the whole week 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.989
 trained you in that position and 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.880
 in fact , they mainly find out 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.099
 he was bald for their bellies and now was now 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.750
 needed earlier and that you have excellent 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.750
 filled in and I in the air is very strong 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.130
 building fixed late in being able to score 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.690
 takes a while before you as dutch 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.980
 team come together again with which 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.980
 feeling you go to these two 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.390
 matches I have good feeling after 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.769
 This recession can of course be avoided 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.330
 drain off 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.980
 we have a better than we put in 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.410
 minimal of distro of competitions a 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.110
 times window or twice 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.280
 only yes it certainly becomes today then 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.280
 it just awkward awesome it someone 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.630
 we have we have almost none 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.739
 opportunities given away that is greatest 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.910
 compliment 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.830
 important to finish that with a good feeling 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.600
 to close that is also you will see though 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.760
 longer period and then you still have 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.380
 a match and then and then starts off 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.549
 the forms preparation for the world cup 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.440
 so now everyone has had club 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.849
 Finally we aim to plow today 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.170
 seen joining the world cup 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.970
 Portugal for example is there 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.200
 france is about bit 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.319
 itch with you 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.760
 Sure am really looking forward to it and 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.469
 only now is it just important for 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.740
 everyone to be good at the club 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.230
 perform and 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.090
 to go to the World Cup so that is 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.560
 the most important 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.710
 who will draw lots so we will since 6 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.770
 December knows that it is so difficult 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.770
 to become
