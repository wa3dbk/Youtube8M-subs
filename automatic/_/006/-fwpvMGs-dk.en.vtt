fight<00:01:49.650> for<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:49.890> guys<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.640> lot<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
fight for you guys is that just a lot of

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.490 
fight for you guys is that just a lot of
communication<00:01:51.510> or<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.869> practicing<00:01:52.409> with

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
communication or are you practicing with

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.780 
communication or are you practicing with
these<00:01:52.590> particular<00:01:52.799> champions<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.670> these

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
these particular champions and these

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.580 
these particular champions and these
configurations<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.260> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
configurations I think it's the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.890 
configurations I think it's the
composition<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> team<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.750> how

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
composition of the team and the and how

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.630 
composition of the team and the and how
you<00:01:57.960> position<00:01:58.320> yourself<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:59.040> example<00:01:59.549> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you position yourself for example in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.330 
you position yourself for example in
first<00:01:59.850> game<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.659> had<00:02:00.810> Malphite<00:02:01.320> TF<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.189> a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
first game they had Malphite TF and a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.429 
first game they had Malphite TF and a
fair<00:02:02.520> destro<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:03.720> Lulu<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> was

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
fair destro with Lulu and it was

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.050 
fair destro with Lulu and it was
impossible<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.130> destro<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:05.880> four

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
impossible to get destro like if four

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.479 
impossible to get destro like if four
week<00:02:06.210> class<00:02:06.360> ultimate<00:02:06.900> Lulu<00:02:07.200> use<00:02:07.489> polyform

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
week class ultimate Lulu use polyform

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.100 
week class ultimate Lulu use polyform
poly<00:02:08.880> morphine<00:02:09.269> and<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:09.690> couldn't<00:02:09.959> do

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
poly morphine and we couldn't do

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.199 
poly morphine and we couldn't do
anything<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.920> think<00:02:11.519> we<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.790> got<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> bit

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
anything so I think we just got a bit

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.050 
anything so I think we just got a bit
out<00:02:12.299> peak<00:02:12.570> in<00:02:12.810> teamfights<00:02:13.430> composition<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.670> we

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
out peak in teamfights composition so we

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.610 
out peak in teamfights composition so we
just<00:02:15.180> love<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.540> game<00:02:15.690> what<00:02:16.470> are<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
just love that game what are the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.900 
just love that game what are the
champions<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.160> there's<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.820> you're

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.250

even<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.030> second<00:02:34.270> we<00:02:34.510> were<00:02:34.630> all<00:02:34.900> really<00:02:35.140> tanky

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
even the second we were all really tanky

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.830 
even the second we were all really tanky
so<00:02:35.830> we<00:02:36.070> didn't<00:02:36.280> care<00:02:36.490> mostly<00:02:37.210> we<00:02:37.390> care<00:02:37.660> about

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
so we didn't care mostly we care about

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.590 
so we didn't care mostly we care about
the<00:02:38.110> froggen<00:02:38.680> anivia<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.310> lux<00:02:39.520> since<00:02:40.270> he<00:02:40.450> can

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
the froggen anivia and lux since he can

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.300 
the froggen anivia and lux since he can
just<00:02:40.780> poke<00:02:40.990> from<00:02:41.260> afar<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.800> they<00:02:41.980> just<00:02:42.160> play

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
just poke from afar and they just play

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.560 
just poke from afar and they just play
really<00:02:42.340> safe<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.000> wait<00:02:43.120> till<00:02:43.300> they<00:02:43.420> catch

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
really safe and wait till they catch

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.850 
really safe and wait till they catch
someone<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.050> it's<00:02:44.230> really<00:02:44.410> impossible<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
someone and it's really impossible to

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.070 
someone and it's really impossible to
play<00:02:45.070> against<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.460> play<00:02:45.580> style<00:02:46.080> is

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
play against that play style is

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.260 
play against that play style is
everything<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:48.100> think<00:02:48.550> an<00:02:48.790> idiot<00:02:49.090> locks

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
everything that I think an idiot locks

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.000 
everything that I think an idiot locks
are<00:02:49.450> actually<00:02:49.720> teasing<00:02:50.170> more<00:02:50.350> because<00:02:50.890> you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
are actually teasing more because you

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.710 
are actually teasing more because you
cannot<00:02:51.280> put<00:02:51.340> seconds<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:51.850> here<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.330> like<00:02:52.480> you

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
cannot put seconds this here is like you

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.570 
cannot put seconds this here is like you
watch<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.230> game<00:02:53.380> they<00:02:53.560> are<00:02:53.620> losing<00:02:53.980> ultimate

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
watch the game they are losing ultimate

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.100 
watch the game they are losing ultimate
in<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.790> middle<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.240> cannot<00:02:55.450> do<00:02:55.660> anything

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
in the middle and you cannot do anything

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.020 
in the middle and you cannot do anything
were<00:02:56.950> there<00:02:57.100> any<00:02:57.190> other<00:02:57.370> teams<00:02:57.610> coming<00:02:57.850> up

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
were there any other teams coming up

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.700 
were there any other teams coming up
that<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.180> had<00:02:58.300> trouble<00:02:58.600> with<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.870> know<00:02:59.020> cursey

you was really just referring to make a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.010 
you was really just referring to make a
strong<00:03:00.850> showing<00:03:01.060> cripple<00:03:01.450> your<00:03:01.570> stomach<00:03:01.900> is

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
strong showing cripple your stomach is

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.680 
strong showing cripple your stomach is
fabulous<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:03.960> think<00:03:06.030> wolves<00:03:07.030> what's<00:03:07.480> their

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
fabulous I think wolves what's their

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.940 
fabulous I think wolves what's their
heart<00:03:07.960> as<00:03:08.110> much<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.530> group<00:03:08.680> like<00:03:08.830> we

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
heart as much of the group like we

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.620 
heart as much of the group like we
expected<00:03:09.430> curse<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.790> be<00:03:09.910> harder<00:03:10.210> but<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.390> think

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
expected curse to be harder but I think

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.090 
expected curse to be harder but I think
they<00:03:10.720> didn't<00:03:10.930> practice<00:03:11.260> at<00:03:11.350> all<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:11.980> was

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
they didn't practice at all so it was

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.610 
they didn't practice at all so it was
quite<00:03:12.400> easy<00:03:12.640> actually<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:13.380> coping<00:03:14.380> having

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
quite easy actually and coping having

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.020 
quite easy actually and coping having
Wolves<00:03:14.860> played<00:03:15.070> really<00:03:15.250> good<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.670> was<00:03:15.820> really

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
Wolves played really good it was really
