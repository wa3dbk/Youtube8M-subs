 What is there aquarium people? Tank TV, Dustin Wunderlich. I'm enthusiastic ... dustinsfish tanks 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.470
 ! I'm in my zen chair and this is in my office. I was already excited yesterday because 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:21.919
 I show you my pond, but I wanted to show what is going on 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.439
 in that pond. Many people give goldfish a bad rep, and it drives me crazy. She 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.650
 are like the first starter fish you get, they are hardy, they grow easily, they 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.650
 something to eat, they are colorful, they are good when I breed them. I want a shootout 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.040
 give to my goldfish, I call them "The boys" if you want. They are in my 29 liters now. 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.040
 Check this out. This is my 29 liter and I'm with a couple early in the morning because 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.540
 You can see I have some really killer natural sunlight coming in and hitting this tank so well, 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.540
 but we are not talking about that tank today. We are talking about this tank. This is my 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.820
 ryukin. These are my favorite fish here. I love them ! They are from Japan. I think 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.409
 that of an island called Ryuke and they are bred with an extra high ... the high back 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.409
 as you can see on there. And I love that red color! What had happened had 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.420
 I put these guys in my pond, "The Boys". There is one of them, I think maybe he is 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.979
 be a girl. What happened, she is bred and they created these ones. I 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.979
 pulled these suckers out of my pond. These are the babies I had last year. Are those 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.549
 not bad? So I think they mix. I have to get them in the shade. I think 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.319
 that she is a mix of this man, or this girl and this man ... I haven't sexed them yet 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.100
 . But there they are. Look at them! Want to tell me that one is not related 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.050
 to that one? I am absolutely loving these things! Then 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.080
 I pulled it out, I was so pumped. So you can see that they are fat. That one has one 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.890
 nice ryukin shape, slightly longer at the top. I also put a killer pot of jungle trap 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.890
 . This was actually in my pond and I brought it in. Now it says some wild and it grows 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.580
 awesome! This is just like my garbage disposal tank, if you want. I just put everything I like 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.470
 pull out of my tanks. I have it there and these guys eat. It is awesome ! They find 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.600
 it's great, like this moss they always pick up. That keeps them really healthy in the winter 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.480
 and then probably in a month I will put them outside. I think she's just here 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.650
 when i look at them in the morning. So these are "The boys"! This is actually 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.130
 L1. This is originally bred, the first brood or whatever.That one there. Of course 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.780
 looks like a kind of standard goldfish. I'm going to try and breed this one. I have 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.090
 some other Ryukins at home, but this is my original strand. I am very proud 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.980
 on this . That is it!
