harder<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.300> want

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
harder you want

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.039 
harder you want
your<00:02:13.590> kneecap<00:02:14.099> whoo<00:02:14.340> falling<00:02:14.700> off<00:02:14.879> so<00:02:15.840> when

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
your kneecap whoo falling off so when

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.420 
your kneecap whoo falling off so when
you're<00:02:16.170> training<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:17.159> need<00:02:17.370> to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you're training you need to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.580 
you're training you need to
understanding<00:02:18.060> while<00:02:18.360> each<00:02:18.689> thing<00:02:19.260> need<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
understanding while each thing need to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.220 
understanding while each thing need to
be<00:02:19.680> done<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.189> each<00:02:20.459> wife<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.569> this<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.959> why<00:02:22.170> you

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
be done in each wife so this is why you

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.170 
be done in each wife so this is why you
pay<00:02:22.560> attention<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.220> me<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.760> when<00:02:23.909> you<00:02:23.939> kick
