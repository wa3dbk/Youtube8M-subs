00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:03.450
 van der wart 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.020
 pass by einse 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.149
 Now put the ball back to the back line 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.339
 the reds bet 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.769
 from haarlem 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.039
 and they make and pop 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.039
 the pace benefits psv 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 investors will be the first to land on the ground in the center 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.019
 and there he is 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.369
 the little bostelaar Hans Gillhaus 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.169
 who seemed to be going to feyenoord that last week 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.169
 but the top ones remained beautiful 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.660
 lerby 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 poster that now plays on the left 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.280
 and govaerts is sacrificed by hiddink and does not wish as was thought 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 after both sides at 3fm 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.940
 five minutes in the second half 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.730
 vanenburg will go 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.650
 the cover was gone for a moment 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.460
 weird the avro in it 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.040
 just before the break 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 hup now a 3 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.490
 Again it speaks about itself 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.480
 have been free here for two weeks 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.550
 Cairo the evening left the wheel of a customization 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.440
 Scotland to help 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 stages it once on the shoe 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.220
 he started at that is fast free kick 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.710
 and from the base 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.729
 the hopman is playing, they just send a solution 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 krefeld jan nederburgh the balls around the ears 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.130
 a four twelfth minute second half 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.130
 I can never pick up PSV again 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 I believe there is a second place 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.790
 smits was all hagen takes no risk 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.820
 that city is good at the situation 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.820
 oil was in favor of kiev 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.189
 whirling wind 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.949
 it must have been half the battle 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.949
 could of her career 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:30.009
 unbelievable although the roda can happen twice the cover left 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.199
 back in stock 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.779
 neglecting and taking salt psv went to martin said 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.269
 but when the favorites lists whimper 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.389
 and he is successful for the second time making the evening macintyre 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:48.279
 zwanenburg 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.829
 god again the bie second pole where the attacks 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.829
 you can head well 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.749
 pace 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.749
 the reds uses wages is averted 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.379
 already at the goal line ball 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.219
 vanenburg lerby those people 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.949
 we are on the right track now 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.949
 lethal with the watercourse man 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.749
 groenendijk 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.519
 after this is one of them 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.479
 the man ride over 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.069
 from which they get reached 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.069
 but everything stays within limits 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.139
 a good place of 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.749
 also several recorded 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.319
 volvo parties 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.319
 for twenty minutes 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.129
 out injured 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.659
 and as a handicap only a sloppy leader village 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.659
 maybe it was in the doors or 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.039
 at least 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.039
 zwanenburg down against diliberto 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.090
 which is in the direction of venlo and did again in kaprun 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.280
 actually that third choice is in the rush hour when romario is back 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.610
 Paris tone can be life threatening 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.610
 what feyenoord let this hans gillhaus both lead 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.099
 you beat china like you do yourself 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.249
 he is having an injury to her leg 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.020
 vanenburg again with this type of car 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.639
 waardenburg 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.460
 combined with falcons that is now covered by excellent investment 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.809
 to catch 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:36.089
 every pole next 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.089
 at least just in the match 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.569
 or mobile court on that odds chances no offside 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.229
 van der waa artist position 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.849
 van de leur do it himself some play time but he should have been on it 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.849
 laying on of course makes 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:58.939
 vaals anp 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.169
 the sensation is undressed like roda button psv 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.639
 because the opportunities it got better use with 4 3
