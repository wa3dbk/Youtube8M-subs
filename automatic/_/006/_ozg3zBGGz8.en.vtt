00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
case open into the case all right now

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.569 
case open into the case all right now
I'm<00:02:22.489> ready<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.139> work<00:02:24.139> on<00:02:24.380> connecting<00:02:24.829> up<00:02:25.010> more

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
I'm ready to work on connecting up more

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.850 
I'm ready to work on connecting up more
of<00:02:25.609> this<00:02:26.500> board

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
of this board

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.390 
of this board
so<00:02:29.010> I'll<00:02:29.130> make<00:02:29.160> sure<00:02:30.710> this<00:02:31.710> water<00:02:32.070> here<00:02:32.370> is

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
so I'll make sure this water here is

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.850 
so I'll make sure this water here is
going<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.270> sound<00:02:33.510> card<00:02:33.860> but

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
going to be going to the sound card but

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.890 
going to be going to the sound card but
I<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.100> another<00:02:35.400> wire<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.120> need<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.630> see

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
hard drive power button so what I have

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.910 
hard drive power button so what I have
is<00:03:41.210> the<00:03:41.630> reset<00:03:41.990> switch<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.280> parse<00:03:43.550> which

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
is the reset switch in the parse which

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.880 
is the reset switch in the parse which
currently<00:03:46.870> but<00:03:47.870> I'm<00:03:47.990> only<00:03:48.110> connecting<00:03:48.650> what

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
currently but I'm only connecting what

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:58.980 
currently but I'm only connecting what
hostel<00:03:49.580> is<00:03:49.730> connected<00:03:50.240> when<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:51.400> hooked<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.550> up

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.140 

we're<00:03:59.890> going<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.160> put<00:04:00.310> power<00:04:00.580> in<00:04:00.760> its<00:04:00.910> place

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
we're going to put power in its place

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.420 
we're going to put power in its place
and<00:04:01.870> like<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.800> really<00:04:03.460> where<00:04:04.020> having

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
and like so this is really where having

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.700 
and like so this is really where having
your<00:04:06.430> motherboard<00:04:07.000> manual<00:04:07.390> comes<00:04:07.720> in<00:04:07.960> indy

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
your motherboard manual comes in indy

card so I'm going to go for and set that
one<00:06:22.520> up<00:06:22.580> to<00:06:22.729> I<00:06:23.090> have<00:06:23.720> this<00:06:23.840> wire<00:06:24.080> here<00:06:24.110> that

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
one up to I have this wire here that

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.790 
one up to I have this wire here that
went<00:06:24.740> to<00:06:25.569> connect<00:06:26.569> with<00:06:26.780> the<00:06:27.110> sound<00:06:27.380> card<00:06:27.560> so

and I believe that be as it may and

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:38.059 
and I believe that be as it may and

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:38.069 
slide this down into place it's the same

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.719 
slide this down into place it's the same
