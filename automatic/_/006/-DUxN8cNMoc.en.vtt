00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.370
 panda the official car to do what you want 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.330
 for me it means a nightmare you have in mind is the story of the gazelle of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.180
 lion every morning they wake up insane having to run peyote mornings me 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.850
 awake 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.840
 and I hope I sold to panda more than the day before he had sold mail 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.009
 for fiat bravo lpg is a piece of its history 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.829
 but perhaps also a lot more crazy his story because he panda the karma 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.739
 a few that are the characteristics of fiat recognized simple fiat 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.420
 in intelligent multifunctional sympathetic use 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.569
 in solutions 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:41.780
 photo what people expect from fire 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.989
 the preparations available for pandas are many because at the bottom of the panda 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.039
 is a platform on which we played a lot of stuff sites 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.380
 nice from all stages but 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.500
 in fact already as a range of bees we offer 4 for two or four for four then 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.269
 on the same platform there are 2 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.670
 different traction 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.840
 conversions 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.290
 we find on 4 pro 2 4 versions 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.500
 your email activates the real screw 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.549
 even worse out of four for four 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.770
 let's try 3 who is the next clejani let's start adding up every night 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.660
 Special 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.490
 product interventions he did 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.420
 it is high the family is enriched so it is own considerable 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.040
 proving how much chameleons are huts made of 4 for 2 we have 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.259
 from 100 hp 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.170
 and therefore 100 horses. 3004 for those who want the scariest dynamic car a 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.590
 little 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.549
 performance excitement 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.219
 but we also have cream but they have been done lately 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.760
 directing us to mothers and children anyway 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.619
 bright colors a little 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.939
 what we see in the fashion world status of fashion 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:47.999
 addressed 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:52.709
 to young moms and yet I also love you then made the panda lessing ate of 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.929
 design with the homonymous the homonymous house even you are special 'monster' made 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.000
 with the ducati on the 4per4 panda not to remember 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.109
 the panda cross 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:09.030
 which basically is the + sub and apnea and baby stove with these with these bands 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.899
 lateral 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.709
 panda round eyes comparison 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.650
 normal that it has a rectangular shape and then the words are a real thing 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.810
 cut bike that is a bit like aispo dai suuuu big trouble bulky sub 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.879
 in the city that they take so seriously 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.959
 and the panda's engines are here too the ranges were quite wide 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.429
 because we offer gasoline in 1100 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.840
 it's a 1002 &amp; dev tv on which one among other things 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.959
 and we also made my transformations 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.269
 i of more ecological food therefore with methane and with 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.779
 the gta &amp; lt today 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:52.669
 it's a bit the driver of both purchase and agent behavior begins 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.990
 to understand that to have a better world we will have to start polluting less 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.740
 and then contact in the case of motorists 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.379
 alternative fuels 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.219
 and then we also have diesel 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.140
 and we also have 1003 diesel 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.789
 that here is the version is 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:16.209
 sedan we call a4 for two yes to version 4 for 4 without forgetting then 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.779
 the 1400 horsepower because as I said p is the most powerful engine for peppery 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.109
 100hp 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.240
 Fresh, just fresh news is coming 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.709
 the panda cross natural park from the name as you see 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.400
 when it comes to mid-year it's like we have two pandas because they are there 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.119
 two tanks so also the name we wanted to reflect 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.449
 eeee the panda cross hours 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.679
 the first is the market postulates because it is the first 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.630
 power supply being a natural gas resignation practically zero 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.049
 however dressed like the great super then 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.889
 with all those great characterization 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.059
 and the modernity of great personality that made panda cross and already 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:00.060
 on the version 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.069
 eheh don't not make a success 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.639
 loved by all we are to the young public that 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.219
 female male who wants a car pop praises be a little more 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.149
 trendy to be a little in step with the times 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:16.109
 the woman of the Sunday hours of the natural pauer band 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.420
 obviously the fact that 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.160
 eo were a zero-emission power supply so what machine was in line e 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.379
 in the direction 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:30.059
 of the new trend is to purchase but above all behavioral 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:35.359
 the distribution of methane and begins to reach a certain capillarity also 

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:36.160
 in Italy 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.120
 and therefore on the one hand we pay attention to the environment and to the other 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.569
 why now also 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.690
 a tension towards saving considering that 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.060
 methane costs less than other fuels such as gasoline 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.970
 we have also introduced to be gpl which is another 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.220
 another low power supply beyond resignation 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.120
 and certainly today 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.340
 she lgpl something of added value well above all that even 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.449
 even more widespread distribution of methane 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.360
 with methane 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.529
 and also encouraged with new government incentives this is not bad here 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.499
 word of geophysics therefore to save even very careful
