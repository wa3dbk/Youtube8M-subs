that it's my a Chinese battery if it is

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.629 
that it's my a Chinese battery if it is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
here I got from eBay eBay so should be

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.630 
here I got from eBay eBay so should be
this<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:28.439> here<00:00:32.690> get<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.840> focus<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
this one here get that focus so it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.020 
this one here get that focus so it
should<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.059> one<00:00:37.520> this<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:38.850> here

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
should be this one this one right here

00:00:39.030 --> 00:01:00.950 
should be this one this one right here
so<00:00:50.480> that's<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.780> black<00:00:59.750> that's<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
so that's the one black that's the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.870 
so that's the one black that's the
battery

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
battery

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.120 
battery
7600<00:01:03.880> milliamp<00:01:04.270> battery<00:01:04.740> that's<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.950> cheap

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
7600 milliamp battery that's the cheap

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.650 
7600 milliamp battery that's the cheap
Chinese<00:01:06.340> ones<00:01:07.410> so<00:01:08.940> I'm<00:01:09.940> assuming<00:01:10.180> this<00:01:10.390> is<00:01:10.630> the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
Chinese ones so I'm assuming this is the

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.270 
Chinese ones so I'm assuming this is the
one<00:01:10.870> because<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.590> zerolemon

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
one because the zerolemon

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.370 
one because the zerolemon
is<00:01:12.610> not<00:01:13.360> supposed<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.690> be<00:01:13.750> coming<00:01:13.930> in<00:01:14.140> for<00:01:14.350> a

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
is not supposed to be coming in for a

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.060 
is not supposed to be coming in for a
little<00:01:14.560> bit<00:01:14.770> still<00:01:15.070> so<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:17.710> should<00:01:17.890> be<00:01:17.980> the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
little bit still so there should be the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.210 
little bit still so there should be the
one<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.330> got<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.660> for<00:01:22.680> 20<00:01:23.680> bucks<00:01:23.800> I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
one and I got that for 20 bucks I

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.530 
one and I got that for 20 bucks I
thought<00:01:24.640> it's<00:01:24.850> cheaper<00:01:25.120> than<00:01:25.150> that<00:01:25.360> but<00:01:25.510> I

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
thought it's cheaper than that but I

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.130 
thought it's cheaper than that but I
guess<00:01:25.720> not

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
guess not

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.500 
guess not
this<00:01:27.040> one<00:01:27.220> right<00:01:27.310> here<00:01:28.620> 23<00:01:29.620> bucks<00:01:30.510> Canadian

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.660 

let's<00:03:55.860> see<00:03:56.040> if<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.220> actually<00:03:56.490> fits<00:03:58.670> taste

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
let's see if this actually fits taste

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:09.320 
let's see if this actually fits taste
the<00:03:59.880> phone's<00:04:00.150> off<00:04:05.150> take<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.180> off<00:04:06.390> take<00:04:08.330> that

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
the phone's off take it off take that

the phone's off take it off take that
off<00:04:18.110> okay<00:04:19.110> so<00:04:19.170> so<00:04:19.590> far<00:04:21.590> this<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:22.860> now<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.130> third

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
off okay so so far this is now the third

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.900 
off okay so so far this is now the third
battery<00:04:23.850> from<00:04:24.030> China<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.660> don't<00:04:24.840> know

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
battery from China that I don't know

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.090 
battery from China that I don't know
what<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.030> problem<00:04:27.420> is<00:04:27.540> but<00:04:27.870> as<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.740> can<00:04:28.920> see

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
what the problem is but as you can see

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.710 
what the problem is but as you can see
from<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:29.550> show<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:29.970> on<00:04:30.180> my<00:04:30.240> last<00:04:30.450> video

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
from here I show this on my last video

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.530 
from here I show this on my last video
here's<00:04:31.110> my<00:04:31.320> stock<00:04:31.620> battery<00:04:32.130> right<00:04:33.120> and

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
here's my stock battery right and

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.480 
here's my stock battery right and
there's<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.320> Chinese<00:04:34.590> battery<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.340> they're

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
there's a Chinese battery and they're

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.150 
there's a Chinese battery and they're
not<00:04:35.640> quite<00:04:36.030> as<00:04:36.060> wide<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.810> length<00:04:37.170> is<00:04:37.350> proper

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
not quite as wide the length is proper

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.810 
not quite as wide the length is proper
but<00:04:39.200> apparently<00:04:40.200> either<00:04:41.190> they<00:04:41.580> don't<00:04:41.700> know

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
but apparently either they don't know

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.880 
but apparently either they don't know
how<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.060> measure<00:04:42.470> because<00:04:43.470> for<00:04:43.800> my

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
how to measure because for my

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.230 
how to measure because for my
understanding<00:04:44.490> all<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.700> phones<00:04:44.940> are<00:04:45.120> the

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
understanding all the phones are the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.900 
understanding all the phones are the
same<00:04:46.670> there<00:04:47.670> you<00:04:47.730> go<00:04:48.350> see<00:04:49.520> that's<00:04:50.520> not<00:04:50.670> a<00:04:50.700> flat

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
same there you go see that's not a flat

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.120 
same there you go see that's not a flat
surface<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:52.760> same<00:04:53.760> same<00:04:54.300> thing<00:04:54.600> here<00:04:54.810> but

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
surface so same same thing here but

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.000 
surface so same same thing here but
whatever<00:04:58.460> see<00:04:59.460> what<00:04:59.610> happens<00:05:00.410> let's<00:05:01.410> stick

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
whatever see what happens let's stick

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.280 
whatever see what happens let's stick
this<00:05:02.130> in<00:05:02.370> there<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:03.480> what<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.630> want<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:03.990> put<00:05:04.200> it

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
this in there so what I want to put it

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.340 
this in there so what I want to put it
in<00:05:04.470> I'm<00:05:04.680> pushing<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.220> towards<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.700> side

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
in I'm pushing it to towards the side

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.600 
in I'm pushing it to towards the side
but<00:05:07.350> honestly<00:05:07.680> when<00:05:07.890> I<00:05:07.950> have<00:05:08.160> when<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.370> use

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
but honestly when I have when I use

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.270 
but honestly when I have when I use
these<00:05:08.910> these<00:05:09.180> are<00:05:09.600> -<00:05:09.840> but<00:05:10.350> you<00:05:10.950> know<00:05:11.070> for

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
these these are - but you know for

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.740 
these these are - but you know for
now<00:05:11.370> some<00:05:11.669> is<00:05:11.880> better<00:05:12.120> than<00:05:12.390> none

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
now some is better than none

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.730 
now some is better than none
um<00:05:14.120> these<00:05:15.120> are<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.330> same<00:05:15.510> size<00:05:15.750> same<00:05:16.080> with<00:05:16.350> not

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
um these are the same size same with not

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.450 
um these are the same size same with not
wide<00:05:17.100> enough<00:05:17.600> but<00:05:18.600> I<00:05:19.230> never<00:05:19.740> lose<00:05:19.890> connection

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
wide enough but I never lose connection

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.920 
wide enough but I never lose connection
or<00:05:20.700> anything<00:05:20.880> like<00:05:21.060> that<00:05:21.120> because<00:05:21.360> it<00:05:21.630> doesn't

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
or anything like that because it doesn't

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.340 
or anything like that because it doesn't
slide<00:05:22.110> over<00:05:22.760> because<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.810> length<00:05:25.110> is

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
slide over because the the length is

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.370 
slide over because the the length is
proper<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:26.640> it<00:05:26.790> there's<00:05:27.600> no<00:05:27.720> room<00:05:27.990> for<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.200> to

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
proper so it there's no room for it to

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.030 
proper so it there's no room for it to
wiggle<00:05:28.680> or<00:05:28.800> slide<00:05:29.130> so<00:05:30.140> regardless<00:05:31.140> it's<00:05:31.650> I

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
wiggle or slide so regardless it's I

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.420 
wiggle or slide so regardless it's I
don't<00:05:32.190> know<00:05:33.500> alright<00:05:34.500> so<00:05:34.860> let's<00:05:35.100> stick<00:05:35.280> the

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
don't know alright so let's stick the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:47.119 
don't know alright so let's stick the
son

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.589 

all<00:05:48.129> right<00:05:48.279> so<00:05:50.969> it<00:05:51.969> used<00:05:52.180> to<00:05:52.270> be<00:05:52.389> a<00:05:52.419> pretty

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
all right so it used to be a pretty

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.369 
all right so it used to be a pretty
tight<00:05:52.870> fit<00:05:53.110> all<00:05:53.259> the<00:05:53.349> way<00:05:53.439> around<00:05:55.259> was<00:05:56.259> I

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.379 
tight fit all the way around was I

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:07.860 
tight fit all the way around was I
focused<00:06:01.229> see<00:06:04.770> not<00:06:05.770> bad<00:06:06.479> it<00:06:07.479> does<00:06:07.629> make<00:06:07.840> it

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
focused see not bad it does make it

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.480 
focused see not bad it does make it
thicker<00:06:08.199> but<00:06:08.650> you<00:06:09.310> know<00:06:11.159> you<00:06:12.159> have<00:06:12.279> to<00:06:12.400> be

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
thicker but you know you have to be

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.769 
thicker but you know you have to be
willing<00:06:12.639> to<00:06:12.789> sacrifice<00:06:12.969> that<00:06:13.509> when<00:06:13.659> you're

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
willing to sacrifice that when you're

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.080 
willing to sacrifice that when you're
putting<00:06:13.960> a<00:06:14.050> fat<00:06:14.199> battery<00:06:14.529> in<00:06:14.849> I'm<00:06:15.849> actually

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
putting a fat battery in I'm actually

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.700 
putting a fat battery in I'm actually
curious<00:06:16.569> to<00:06:16.900> see<00:06:16.930> what<00:06:17.229> the<00:06:19.469> zerolemon<00:06:20.469> will

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
curious to see what the zerolemon will

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.089 
curious to see what the zerolemon will
be<00:06:20.830> at<00:06:20.949> 10,000<00:06:21.550> milliamps<00:06:21.969> but<00:06:22.889> let's<00:06:23.889> fire

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
be at 10,000 milliamps but let's fire

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.459 
be at 10,000 milliamps but let's fire
the<00:06:24.250> sucker<00:06:24.490> up<00:06:24.840> see<00:06:25.840> what<00:06:25.960> kind<00:06:26.110> of<00:06:26.139> juice<00:06:26.319> we

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
the sucker up see what kind of juice we

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:41.459 
the sucker up see what kind of juice we
have<00:06:33.150> stick<00:06:34.150> that<00:06:34.300> there<00:06:34.569> for<00:06:34.750> now

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:59.439 

I'll<00:06:42.469> charge<00:06:42.800> it<00:06:42.889> up<00:06:57.879> okay<00:06:58.879> so<00:06:58.939> right<00:06:59.209> now<00:06:59.330> I've

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
I'll charge it up okay so right now I've

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:05.169 
I'll charge it up okay so right now I've
got<00:06:59.679> 57%<00:07:01.239> so<00:07:02.239> 50%<00:07:03.069> 57%<00:07:04.069> should<00:07:04.249> be<00:07:04.429> just<00:07:05.089> a

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:05.179 
got 57% so 50% 57% should be just a

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:06.790 
got 57% so 50% 57% should be just a
little<00:07:05.360> bit<00:07:05.449> more<00:07:05.599> than<00:07:05.779> a<00:07:05.809> stock<00:07:06.110> battery<00:07:06.319> at

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
little bit more than a stock battery at

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.339 
little bit more than a stock battery at
full<00:07:07.099> charge<00:07:10.209> all<00:07:11.209> right<00:07:11.330> so<00:07:11.629> let's<00:07:11.989> see<00:07:12.199> if

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:12.349 
full charge all right so let's see if

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.809 
full charge all right so let's see if
this<00:07:13.209> bus<00:07:14.209> charging<00:07:14.719> works<00:07:15.519> now<00:07:16.519> I'm<00:07:16.669> not
