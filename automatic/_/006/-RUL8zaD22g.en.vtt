 good it's not easy 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.869
 before embarking on all tyrants must still take 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:32.570
 proportions 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.630
 I think we are wondering, however, the subsidies we will make of me 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 for 30 months an army you never know 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.410

 gold for minimum 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.800
 we will redo the story before embarking on the breach 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.760
 we are in a movement of 6000 workers could be the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.150
 undocumented workers on strike 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.090
 since the month of October every week we see little pressure going 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.430
 drink the tickets for Tuesday morning of November 6th

 borough 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.420
 we tried to make the bargaining power is also today 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.950
 to refuse 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.430

 castiel why take a ride on the aggressor 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.560
 this support committee for those of us 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.850
 with distrust - pierre laurent 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.850
 and we're dealing with a boss of the interim who put on gloves 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.860
 he made a lot of mistakes 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.579
 for our beautiful painting drawing the moment 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.230
 in France in Lorraine and not too much who 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.740
 no humanity 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.480
 in finishing u6-u7 members 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.950
 - person - remote monitoring 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.760
 these deaths lead to these abuses 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.010
 but not enough to fall into the hole 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.890
 fallout of a sudden arises no fallout of a sudden 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.900
 the original idea was to work without papers the boss of the 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.910
 famous city of the two lawsuits 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.440
 the heads of all the fcz possesses 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.479
 how long has it been to have moved type of year but year 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:14.479
 even about him is not a small to paris a quality frankly 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:18.379
 I never saw the doors to the public until the beginning of the title 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.989
 but we did not count the non 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.289
 no he made a lot of fouls of undocumented man's shoes 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.429
 because they knew they had my senses we do not know well for the pale 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:28.069
 copy 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.949
 we can not blame them 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.170
 we see which one we go where 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.629
 because if we had proclaimed he was going to fire us 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.919
 this is ladies she is not too big remember the promises of a beautiful 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:38.289
 comes to an end 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:39.319
 the Netherlands 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.279
 since the inauguration of all 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.179
 it's the guy who is not from Cairo 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.069
 to have the ball 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.069
 step by step we will go beyond 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.969
 at 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.179

 woerth 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:09.359
 good 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.729
 good 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.729
 good 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.569
 nothing 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.239
 haha 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.989
 it's clever 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.989
 he expressed the study 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.099
 he 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.939
 then in 2008 and 2009 when the premium was very big work four 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:37.730
 hours per night 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.919
 likewise tp 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.529
 the first of interim 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.209
 a fight that lasted nine months 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.049
 and it was held for 4 to 8 hours 74 'regularization 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.079
 the contribution of the lilas we managed to get that this tramway exit 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.069
 first year with the arrival of a violent crime ie an increase 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.499
 pretty quickly and here we are asking tomas verner zafar ago 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:02.120
 the psychiatrist at his spoiler we will spend more than 6 months in time 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:03.639
 the other undocumented friends 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.689
 they also do not have the pasta packets ambiguous voice of a heart that 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:08.399
 beats 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:09.379
 and for all blogs 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.009
 all judged this postponement 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:15.509
 dokeos and the species five people but since his protected the union with 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:19.329
 she was with them on the ground they started negotiating with the 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.329
 bosses 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.030
 dokou the words they are and it depends on the sectors this time 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.699
 he was playing without his reinforcements last week where he would go away for 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:30.650
 show 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.120
 for the pastor to translate into your presence we worked there 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.379
 years and years a tea practice 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:37.379
 t &amp; d 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:38.640
 dt 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.290
 dtp dollars let's go 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.500
 so yes it's very good we do not have pater he takes advantage of us 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.689
 over country-continent 5 we want it to not stop 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.789
 in the Dutch camp was really exemplary 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.270
 after detentions things like that but I think we're going 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.349
 he will have very few people who would be able to stand like that at 32 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.990
 for five months in such a cramped space 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.180
 and with the hardness also the struggle of frying power 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.530
 believe me solidarity and communitarianism that so-called so 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.320
 decried it's also thanks to the company he was actually in 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.789
 homes 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.770
 as soon as it is possible today 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.589
 but his difficult beginnings 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:15.099
 the chosen method 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.319
 pastore did not attend the scene 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.389
 we do not miss this year his ten years in the morning in paris bordeaux is not 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.150
 at this stage the wounds of deaths due to the strike which is important on the 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.009
 20th it is the Ford of the support committee 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.009
 we do not know is not in a relationship neocolonial paternalism istat that I 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.339
 think it's very, very strong, it's going to stay 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.669
 this side we make the cover we enjoy it 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.770
 we did not open the palace of the elysea to work 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.009
 we need to work 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.699
 in total these questions in the strike started France 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.169
 sign of recovery 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.939
 redesigned outgoing 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:49.710
 we have the strength 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.960
 according to inserm the nintendo ds in power 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.960
 moscow - telepathy 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.300
 we have to continue, though to the end, with the unions 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.689
 in solidarity with you to prove that I am proud 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:05.909
 we will continue this contest
