bit and point out that Roman reigns and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.300 
bit and point out that Roman reigns and
Seth<00:01:14.310> Rollins<00:01:15.090> were<00:01:15.869> not<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> tag<00:01:16.470> team<00:01:16.770> when

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
Seth Rollins were not a tag team when

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.800 
Seth Rollins were not a tag team when
this<00:01:17.549> belt<00:01:18.320> at<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.710> new<00:01:20.040> logo<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> also<00:01:21.509> I'd

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
this belt at the new logo and also I'd

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.260 
this belt at the new logo and also I'd
like<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> point<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.520> attire<00:01:23.970> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
like to point out that the attire that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.960 
like to point out that the attire that
Seth<00:01:24.780> Rollins<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.470> presented<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.220> he<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.939> not

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
Seth Rollins is presented in he was not

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.899 
Seth Rollins is presented in he was not
wearing<00:01:27.630> when<00:01:28.380> he<00:01:28.560> had<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.070> belt<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.549> think<00:01:29.759> he

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
wearing when he had the belt I think he

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.679 
wearing when he had the belt I think he
had<00:01:30.119> sleeves<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.430> sleeveless<00:01:32.430> edition<00:01:33.390> was

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
had sleeves this sleeveless edition was

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.319 
had sleeves this sleeveless edition was
basically<00:01:34.290> right<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.310> he<00:01:35.490> betrayed<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
basically right when he betrayed the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
basically right when he betrayed the
shield<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.530> unfortunate<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.430> it's

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
shield and it's unfortunate because it's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.240 
shield and it's unfortunate because it's
so<00:01:39.210> close<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> being<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.560> new<00:01:40.710> Seth<00:01:41.009> Rollins

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so close to being the new Seth Rollins

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.749 
so close to being the new Seth Rollins
look<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.509> not<00:01:43.040> because<00:01:44.040> he's<00:01:44.369> wearing

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
look but it's not because he's wearing

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.830 
look but it's not because he's wearing
his<00:01:44.869> military<00:01:45.869> esque<00:01:46.590> Hance

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
his military esque Hance

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
his military esque Hance
let's<00:01:48.840> zoom<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> face<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.610> is

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
let's zoom in on a face because this is

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.999 
let's zoom in on a face because this is
another<00:01:51.210> critique<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:52.740> really

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
another critique I have I don't really

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.010 
another critique I have I don't really
think<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.520> face<00:01:53.729> looks<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.420> him<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:55.680> much

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
think the face looks like him that much

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.090 
think the face looks like him that much
can<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:59.119> that<00:02:00.119> his<00:02:00.509> nose<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:02.040> too

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
can see there that his nose is way too

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.810 
can see there that his nose is way too
thin<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.119> too<00:02:04.079> long<00:02:04.740> also<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.670> think

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
thin and a bit too long also I think

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.690 
thin and a bit too long also I think
overall<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.600> head<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> bit<00:02:07.530> too<00:02:07.829> small<00:02:08.310> for

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
overall the head is a bit too small for

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
overall the head is a bit too small for
the<00:02:08.789> body<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:10.220> here<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.430> his<00:02:11.819> vest<00:02:12.180> once<00:02:12.480> just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the body and here is his vest once just

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.140 
the body and here is his vest once just
throw<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.200> on

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
throw it on

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.450 
throw it on
and<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.210> think<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.930> Roman<00:02:16.440> reigns<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:17.190> belt

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
and I think like Roman reigns this belt

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.970 
and I think like Roman reigns this belt
is<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.180> bit<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.720> challenge<00:02:19.710> to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
is going to be a bit of a challenge to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.500 
is going to be a bit of a challenge to
get<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:23.040> Roman<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.670> think<00:02:24.330> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
get on the the like Roman I think that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.080 
get on the the like Roman I think that
this<00:02:24.690> vest<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.410> going<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.800> be<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.130> bit<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.880> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
this vest is going to be a bit of a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.380 
this vest is going to be a bit of a
challenge<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:29.060> put<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:32.390> correct

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
challenge to put on and that is correct

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.830

if<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.360> already<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> previous<00:02:55.290> Seth

if you already have the previous Seth

Rollins elite and the basic that comes

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.950 
Rollins elite and the basic that comes
with<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.800> new<00:02:58.950> updated<00:02:59.370> head<00:02:59.670> scan<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.180> might

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
with the new updated head scan I might

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.710 
with the new updated head scan I might
swap<00:03:01.890> them<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.340> might<00:03:02.760> recommend<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.300> one<00:03:03.690> I

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
swap them I might recommend that one I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.180 
swap them I might recommend that one I
might<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.140> recommend<00:03:04.500> waiting<00:03:04.740> for<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
might just recommend waiting for the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.920 
might just recommend waiting for the
next<00:03:05.310> Seth<00:03:05.550> Rollins<00:03:05.730> because<00:03:06.180> overall<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.780> do

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
next Seth Rollins because overall I do

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.990 
next Seth Rollins because overall I do
not<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.400> necessary

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
not think that this is a necessary

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.500 
not think that this is a necessary
upgrade<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.220> an<00:03:11.370> attire<00:03:11.730> that's<00:03:12.030> so

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
upgrade this is an attire that's so

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.840 
upgrade this is an attire that's so
close<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.960> his<00:03:13.080> previous<00:03:13.620> one<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.790> don't

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
close to his previous one and I don't

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.990 
close to his previous one and I don't
really<00:03:15.360> think<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.930> head<00:03:16.200> scan<00:03:17.000> warrants

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
really think that the head scan warrants

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.210 
really think that the head scan warrants
an<00:03:18.830> update<00:03:20.630> now<00:03:21.630> there<00:03:21.780> are<00:03:21.900> much<00:03:22.500> paint<00:03:22.980> flaws

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
an update now there are much paint flaws

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.680 
an update now there are much paint flaws
or<00:03:23.430> anything<00:03:23.640> like<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.420> need<00:03:24.540> to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
or anything like that that you need to

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.020 
or anything like that that you need to
take<00:03:25.140> note<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.500> it's<00:03:26.070> just<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.670> vest<00:03:26.850> is
