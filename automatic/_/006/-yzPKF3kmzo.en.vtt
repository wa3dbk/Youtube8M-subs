00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.000
 if there is a game which nintendos 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.400
 wii u console back to the track again 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.920
 could lead to good sales 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.820
 then it is without ifs and but mario 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.439
 kart 8 with many different ones 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.899
 characters from the mario universe 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.149
 A total of 32 strict around the pole 

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:24.729
 drive position and join in the process 

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:27.640
 diverse teams make life difficult 

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:29.949
 so is mario kart and love as it is 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.559
 By the way, there are a few of the items 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.780
 new for example the boomerang with those 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.120
 we can throw off enemies or even those 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.219
 great horn thanks to this we can 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.510
 finally the unloved blue sting 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.179
 stave off armor 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.129
 even if mario kart wii mario kart 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.079
 plays fans quickly 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.390
 nintendo has some balloons in it 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.489
 screwed to the last round on the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.350
 then the last place will be one 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.699
 get super item and go straight to the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.489
 front seats race 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:01.659
 yes this plan does not work anymore 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.579
 as well as new intel eight you can now 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.490
 driving on the walls and on the ceiling 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.829
 that she brings cool off in 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.740
 the stretch optics purely plays but 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.869
 not very different 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.180
 It makes more sense to assemble the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.729
 own kart that is not new but 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.700
 There are now next to motorcycles and the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.950
 normal cards also quads depending on how 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.079
 her your car together cobbler is 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.259
 faster agile or faster 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.299
 fixer which is still very neglected 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.399
 is more than just the nintendo 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.509
 normal kromm pries you can not in the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.969
 driving single player 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.159
 a great deal is not that 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.670
 mario kart you should anyway with friends 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.560
 gamble 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.899
 that works four at one 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.979
 console or of course with up to twelve 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.079
 people online 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.900
 Although the online mode is not 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.410
 especially extensive but always 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.970
 in very stable graphic mario kart 8 1 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.100
 really pretty game 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.180
 especially to see the many lights 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.820
 just great 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.310
 Although the ju screwed the graphic at two 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.470
 or four players clearly down fun 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.750
 But it always makes it from the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.729
 former selling point of the ju team 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.660
 gamepad controller is noticeable in the game 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.730
 brings nothing 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.880
 special features of the offers 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.100
 controller not mario kart 8 is again 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.540
 a really entertaining fun racer 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.670
 this is more on the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.010
 actual game principle as to the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.320
 innovations and the scope just in 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.890
 online mode leaves much potential internally 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.290
 lie 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.390
 but especially with multiple players 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.680
 and remains mario kart with part 8 of the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.680
 perfect fun racer
