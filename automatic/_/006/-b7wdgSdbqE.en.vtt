00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
dance and a moonwalk maybe so let's go

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.800 
dance and a moonwalk maybe so let's go
into<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.160> shop<00:01:36.220> by<00:01:36.730> tapping<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.180> top<00:01:37.570> left

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
into the shop by tapping the top left

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.850 
into the shop by tapping the top left
hand<00:01:37.930> corner<00:01:38.200> button<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:41.290> are<00:01:41.500> our

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
hand corner button and here are our

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.000 
hand corner button and here are our
upgrades<00:01:42.610> your<00:01:42.820> arrows<00:01:43.090> will<00:01:43.270> fly<00:01:43.480> longer

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
upgrades your arrows will fly longer

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.320 
upgrades your arrows will fly longer
arch<00:01:45.010> so<00:01:45.280> just<00:01:45.460> adds<00:01:45.580> an<00:01:45.700> archer<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.210> your

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
arch so just adds an archer to your

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.850 
arch so just adds an archer to your
garrison<00:01:46.600> means<00:01:46.930> that<00:01:47.080> we<00:01:47.170> can<00:01:47.320> find<00:01:47.620> more

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
garrison means that we can find more

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.400 
garrison means that we can find more
often<00:01:48.220> so<00:01:48.400> let's<00:01:48.580> do<00:01:48.760> that<00:01:48.910> at<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:49.900> slingshot

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
often so let's do that at a slingshot

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.320 
often so let's do that at a slingshot
operator<00:01:51.040> to<00:01:51.250> your<00:01:51.400> garrison<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.090> guess

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
operator to your garrison so I guess

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.820 
operator to your garrison so I guess
that<00:01:52.360> that<00:01:52.540> means<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:53.050> can<00:01:53.200> probably<00:01:53.350> have<00:01:53.590> more

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
that that means I can probably have more

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.460 
that that means I can probably have more
and<00:01:54.100> add<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.310> runner<00:01:55.300> so<00:01:55.420> let's<00:01:56.260> add<00:01:56.440> another

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
and add a runner so let's add another

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.880 
and add a runner so let's add another
slingshot<00:01:57.280> person<00:01:58.140> slingshot<00:01:59.140> range<00:01:59.410> range

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
slingshot person slingshot range range

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.950 
slingshot person slingshot range range
will<00:02:00.070> go<00:02:00.430> further<00:02:00.730> that<00:02:01.240> sounds<00:02:01.540> good<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:01.840> me

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
will go further that sounds good to me

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.620 
will go further that sounds good to me
as<00:02:02.080> well<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.410> that's<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.680> good<00:02:02.800> set<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.070> upgrades

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
as well so that's a good set of upgrades

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.650 
as well so that's a good set of upgrades
so<00:02:04.630> let's<00:02:04.780> move<00:02:05.020> on<00:02:05.170> let's<00:02:05.440> do<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.650> next<00:02:05.680> level

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
so let's move on let's do the next level

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.930 
so let's move on let's do the next level
get<00:02:07.660> lots<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.990> different<00:02:08.229> enemy<00:02:08.470> types<00:02:08.940> coming

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
get lots of different enemy types coming

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.280 
get lots of different enemy types coming
at<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.330> each<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.600> them<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.869> brilliantly

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
at you and each of them is brilliantly

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.460 
at you and each of them is brilliantly
animated<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.920> entire<00:02:12.370> game<00:02:12.550> just<00:02:12.760> looks

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
animated the entire game just looks

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.230 
animated the entire game just looks
fantastic<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.650> mean<00:02:14.800> look<00:02:14.890> at<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.160> thing<00:02:15.370> like

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
fantastic I mean look at this thing like

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.729 
fantastic I mean look at this thing like
I<00:02:16.300> was<00:02:16.450> think<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.750> absolutely<00:02:16.959> beautiful<00:02:19.739> so

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
I was think it's absolutely beautiful so

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.170 
I was think it's absolutely beautiful so
they're<00:02:21.099> going<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.310> show<00:02:21.430> me<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.700> technique

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
they're going to show me this technique

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.580 
they're going to show me this technique
now<00:02:22.300> I've<00:02:22.480> played<00:02:22.870> pass<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.170> level<00:02:23.319> they're

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
now I've played pass this level they're

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.510 
now I've played pass this level they're
going<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.770> shame<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.010> technique<00:02:24.340> whereby

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
going to shame this technique whereby

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.030 
going to shame this technique whereby
basically<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.300> can<00:02:25.480> squish<00:02:25.840> enemies<00:02:26.739> instead

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
basically you can squish enemies instead

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.870 
basically you can squish enemies instead
of<00:02:27.250> firing<00:02:27.520> rocks<00:02:28.030> at<00:02:28.330> them<00:02:28.540> directly<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:30.040> if

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
of firing rocks at them directly so if

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.460 
of firing rocks at them directly so if
they<00:02:31.090> go<00:02:31.209> up<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.390> then<00:02:31.630> come<00:02:31.780> down<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.260> then

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
they go up and then come down and then

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.370 
they go up and then come down and then
it<00:02:32.590> squishes<00:02:32.890> bad<00:02:33.850> guys<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.300> these<00:02:34.510> ones<00:02:34.780> that

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
it squishes bad guys so these ones that

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.750 
it squishes bad guys so these ones that
just<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:35.709> squished<00:02:36.069> just<00:02:36.340> there<00:02:36.520> you<00:02:36.640> get

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
just got squished just there you get

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.370 
just got squished just there you get
extra<00:02:36.970> points<00:02:37.150> for<00:02:37.300> doing<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.600> but<00:02:38.050> if<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.290> was

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
extra points for doing that but if I was

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.930 
extra points for doing that but if I was
to<00:02:38.500> hit<00:02:38.620> them<00:02:38.709> with<00:02:38.800> arrows<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.489> might<00:02:39.730> take<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
to hit them with arrows it might take a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.670 
to hit them with arrows it might take a
couple<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.330> shots<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.750> actually<00:02:41.019> do<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.350> see

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
couple of shots to actually do that see

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.949 
couple of shots to actually do that see
there<00:02:42.670> are<00:02:42.760> boosters<00:02:43.180> as<00:02:43.390> well<00:02:43.690> um<00:02:45.959> our

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
there are boosters as well um our

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.250 
there are boosters as well um our
boosters<00:02:47.440> let's<00:02:47.800> let's<00:02:48.700> see<00:02:48.970> if<00:02:49.030> we<00:02:49.150> can<00:02:49.300> see

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
boosters let's let's see if we can see

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.199 
boosters let's let's see if we can see
how<00:02:50.380> much<00:02:50.650> further<00:02:50.890> working<00:02:51.190> Farkle<00:02:51.580> really

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
how much further working Farkle really

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.320 
how much further working Farkle really
far<00:02:52.420> that's<00:02:52.930> awesome<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.910> rocks<00:02:55.120> or

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
far that's awesome and the rocks or

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.670 
far that's awesome and the rocks or
we'll<00:02:55.450> see<00:02:55.600> super<00:02:55.900> useful<00:02:56.049> because<00:02:56.350> they<00:02:56.500> take

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
we'll see super useful because they take

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.770 
we'll see super useful because they take
out<00:02:56.890> multiple<00:02:57.040> people<00:02:57.580> at<00:02:57.670> once<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:58.150> love<00:02:58.630> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
out multiple people at once I love the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.840 
out multiple people at once I love the
fact<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:59.049> when<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.040> stagger<00:03:00.340> somebody

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
fact that when you stagger somebody

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.850 
fact that when you stagger somebody
sometimes<00:03:01.299> they'll<00:03:01.510> they'll<00:03:01.840> they'll<00:03:02.680> get

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
sometimes they'll they'll they'll get

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.199 
sometimes they'll they'll they'll get
hit<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.190> they'll<00:03:03.310> get<00:03:03.489> knocked<00:03:03.700> backwards

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
hit and they'll get knocked backwards

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.559 
hit and they'll get knocked backwards
and<00:03:04.330> they'll<00:03:04.420> be<00:03:04.480> like<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:06.420> think<00:03:07.420> that's

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
and they'll be like I think that's

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.780 
and they'll be like I think that's
fantastic<00:03:08.140> there<00:03:09.040> we<00:03:09.100> are<00:03:09.130> got<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.400> little<00:03:09.640> bit

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
fantastic there we are got a little bit

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.110 
fantastic there we are got a little bit
of<00:03:09.819> combat<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.269> see<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.630> little<00:03:10.980> Viking

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
of combat you see that little Viking

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.920 
of combat you see that little Viking
swine<00:03:13.470> managed<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.680> jump<00:03:14.980> out<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.400> way<00:03:15.580> of

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
swine managed to jump out of the way of

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.319 
swine managed to jump out of the way of
the<00:03:16.930> rock<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.489> quite<00:03:18.700> useful<00:03:18.850> as<00:03:19.150> if

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
the rock and that is quite useful as if

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.420 
the rock and that is quite useful as if
we<00:03:19.420> can<00:03:19.540> use<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.750> technique<00:03:20.200> I'll<00:03:21.100> grab<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
we can use that technique I'll grab the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.580 
we can use that technique I'll grab the
faint<00:03:21.640> grab<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.030> thing<00:03:22.239> oh<00:03:22.390> now<00:03:23.109> obviously

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
faint grab the thing oh now obviously

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.039 
faint grab the thing oh now obviously
what<00:03:24.519> what<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:25.030> what<00:03:25.180> will<00:03:25.299> happen<00:03:25.329> if<00:03:25.690> they

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
what what so what will happen if they

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.780 
what what so what will happen if they
get<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.530> ads<00:03:26.709> or<00:03:26.890> well<00:03:27.160> that's<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.670> good

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
get to ads or well that's a good

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.210 
get to ads or well that's a good
question<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:29.290> they're<00:03:29.410> bashing<00:03:29.650> down<00:03:30.070> the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
question so they're bashing down the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.110 
question so they're bashing down the
door<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.900> adore<00:03:31.900> doors<00:03:32.829> strength<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:33.850> shown

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
door and adore doors strength is shown

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.180 
door and adore doors strength is shown
in<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.329> bottom<00:03:34.450> right<00:03:34.750> hand<00:03:34.780> corner<00:03:35.079> so<00:03:35.590> you

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
in the bottom right hand corner so you

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.860 
in the bottom right hand corner so you
can't<00:03:36.370> let<00:03:36.519> them<00:03:36.640> bash<00:03:37.090> down<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.510> door<00:03:37.660> for

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
can't let them bash down the door for

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.539 
can't let them bash down the door for
too<00:03:38.049> long<00:03:40.410> come<00:03:41.410> on<00:03:41.500> go<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.859> get<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.010> thing<00:03:42.190> so

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
too long come on go and get the thing so

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.860 
too long come on go and get the thing so
I'm<00:03:42.790> sending<00:03:43.090> my<00:03:43.120> run<00:03:43.359> around<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:43.660> going<00:03:43.810> to

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
I'm sending my run around is going to

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.110 
I'm sending my run around is going to
get<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.049> present<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:45.310> obviously<00:03:45.820> he<00:03:46.000> can

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
get the present but obviously he can

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.509 
get the present but obviously he can
really<00:03:46.810> go<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.320> grab<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.709> if<00:03:47.920> there's<00:03:48.340> no

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
really go and grab that if there's no
