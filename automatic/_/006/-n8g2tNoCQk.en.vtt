00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
know what you could get good with it

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.940 
know what you could get good with it
after<00:06:56.460> you<00:06:56.550> practice<00:06:56.790> for<00:06:57.210> a<00:06:57.270> while<00:06:57.420> but<00:06:57.840> as<00:06:58.230> of

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
after you practice for a while but as of

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.360 
after you practice for a while but as of
right<00:06:59.010> now<00:06:59.930> it's<00:07:00.930> not<00:07:01.110> a<00:07:01.290> very<00:07:01.590> efficient

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
right now it's not a very efficient

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.190 
right now it's not a very efficient
weapon<00:07:03.030> at<00:07:03.330> killing<00:07:05.390> this<00:07:06.390> is<00:07:06.600> my<00:07:06.870> first<00:07:07.080> time

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
you can completely rely on to get a lot

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:30.590 
you can completely rely on to get a lot
