ninja Halfbrick did something good here
they<00:00:26.010> did<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.760> agree<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:28.230> enjoying<00:00:28.439> my

time<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.189> it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
time with it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.209 
time with it
admittedly<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.539> think<00:00:30.929> though<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.219> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
admittedly I do think though that the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.420 
admittedly I do think though that the
cooperative<00:00:32.790> mode<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.079> fun<00:00:34.350> as

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
cooperative mode is not as fun as

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.479 
cooperative mode is not as fun as
competitive<00:00:35.870> yeah<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.620> still<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.100> fun<00:00:38.340> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
think playing it with you but right if

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.020 
think playing it with you but right if
given<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.160> choice<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.640> want<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.879> play

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
given the choice I want to play

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.869

about<00:01:03.660> work<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:04.979> me<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> vision

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
about work this for me is the vision

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.000 
about work this for me is the vision
best<00:01:06.150> showcase<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.990> any<00:01:07.350> sort<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.740> precision

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
best showcase of any sort of precision

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.340 
best showcase of any sort of precision
with<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.640> Kinect<00:01:08.939> obviously<00:01:09.420> right<00:01:09.810> except

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
with the Kinect obviously right except

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
in any game except for menu movement I'm

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.520 
in any game except for menu movement I'm
not<00:01:14.700> solving<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> menu<00:01:15.420> movement<00:01:15.659> are<00:01:16.080> you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
not solving the menu movement are you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.510 
not solving the menu movement are you
talk<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> referring

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
talk what do you what are you referring

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.340 
talk what do you what are you referring
to<00:01:17.700> well<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.270> mean<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.200> going

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to well I mean you're when you're going

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.170 
to well I mean you're when you're going
through<00:01:19.560> leaderboards<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.580> you're<00:01:20.790> choosing

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
through leaderboards or you're choosing

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.600 
through leaderboards or you're choosing
skin<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.140> when<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.350> yeah<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.369> like

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
skin so when you yeah but it's not like

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.170 
skin so when you yeah but it's not like
I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> scrolling<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.939> big

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
I think that the scrolling is not as big

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.690 
I think that the scrolling is not as big
of<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.330> problem<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.409> skins<00:01:28.799> selecting

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
of a problem with the skins selecting

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.190 
of a problem with the skins selecting
just<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> list<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.960> big

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
just because of the list is not as big

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.039 
just because of the list is not as big
oh<00:01:31.500> yeah<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.460> did<00:01:32.700> still<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.240> its<00:01:33.689> problem

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
oh yeah I did still like its problem

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.499 
oh yeah I did still like its problem
with<00:01:34.170> precision<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:36.240> really

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
with precision right going that's really

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.020 
with precision right going that's really
my<00:01:36.689> only<00:01:36.869> complaint<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.740> don't<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.430> care

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
my only complaint I don't really care

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.660 
my only complaint I don't really care
for<00:01:39.090> challenge<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.780> don't<00:01:40.049> either

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
for challenge I don't either

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
for challenge I don't either
it's<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.720> challenges<00:01:43.140> start<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.439> easy

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
it's like the challenges start out easy

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.170 
it's like the challenges start out easy
of<00:01:43.860> course<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> mean<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.610> I'd

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
of course but I mean it's just I'd

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.179 
of course but I mean it's just I'd
rather<00:01:45.360> play<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.810> other<00:01:46.740> people<00:01:47.040> or<00:01:47.159> just

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
rather play with other people or just

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.999 
rather play with other people or just
play<00:01:47.549> arcade<00:01:48.210> mode<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.840> has<00:01:49.079> kind<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.439> been

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
play arcade mode this has kind of been

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.530 
play arcade mode this has kind of been
the<00:01:50.189> problem<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.850> lot<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.060> these<00:01:51.270> games

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the problem with a lot of these games

was so surprised by the controls with it

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.409 
was so surprised by the controls with it
feeling<00:04:28.960> absolutely<00:04:29.949> precise<00:04:30.759> and<00:04:31.060> there's<00:04:31.360> a

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
feeling absolutely precise and there's a

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.180 
feeling absolutely precise and there's a
few<00:04:31.690> moments<00:04:32.110> in<00:04:32.199> there<00:04:32.410> where<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.710> doesn't<00:04:33.039> do

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
few moments in there where it doesn't do

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.100 
few moments in there where it doesn't do
exactly<00:04:33.729> what<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.090> want<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.389> do<00:04:34.509> but<00:04:34.990> it

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
exactly what you want to do but it

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.930 
exactly what you want to do but it
doesn't<00:04:35.380> take<00:04:35.620> away<00:04:35.830> really<00:04:36.490> from<00:04:36.669> it<00:04:36.789> because

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
doesn't take away really from it because

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.760 
doesn't take away really from it because
this<00:04:37.060> is<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:37.330> easy<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.660> go<00:04:37.750> back<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.080> hit<00:04:38.289> any
