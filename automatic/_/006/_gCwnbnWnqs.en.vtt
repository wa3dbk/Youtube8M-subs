00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.870
 sent from China and ordered online 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.699
 aliexpress judging by the track number here 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.210
 there must be another package on the subject 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.590
 fishing 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.760

 very small swayed such in 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.530
 Basically, here is how you see the parcel was 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.649
 simple package and inside here's such 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.239
 boll even substantial unexpectedly 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.550
 such a box I thought they would come 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.120
 in bulk 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:52.070

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.140
 These are the bait namely from spinners 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.109

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.210
 I'll show you as I said 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.820
 order on the site aliexpress they came 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.400
 Basically fast for a little more than 2 weeks 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.320
 and 16 days from the date of shipment to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.729
 of the moment 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.729
 getting in the mail and have such here 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.659
 Georgians are small, very small 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.640
 swayed and last time a lot of things 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 ordered if someone follow the channel then 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 there are all kinds of wobblers 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.860
 It was not well, so I decided to shake from 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.950
 order a little science don't try 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.190
 In principle, in form, what I expected weight 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.320
 and two and a half 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.040
 we are absolutely sprues, that is, such for 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.040
 ultralight 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.390
 hooks are sharp well honestly not even 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.690
 I expected that they will come to such 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.900
 okay box if anyone interested 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.500
 link to the seller for a pancake under I became 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.450
 spinners I will leave under the video here here is 5 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.670
 different colors and 6 6 different it 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.280
 I am mistaken why 6 in theory like 5 should 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.350
 be but i will check five or six all 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.900
 left unimportant roof counted on 5 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.400
 it seems like here is a golden copper 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:15.010
 the color is such a dark interesting 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.660
 so bright green and and silvery 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.100
 will come on silvery that is like to 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.130
 pieces but it doesn't matter okay they check 6 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.170
 all written on the package 6 pieces means 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.030
 they must be slightly different 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.570
 such a silver I do not know on camera will 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.790
 visible or not and the second silver but how 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.070
 Whatever is matte mirror slegontsa 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.050

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.980
