00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 as a child I often dreamed of flying 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.470
 I think it could be called a dream 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.450
 recurrent but remember that in dreams 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.610
 stood out long jumps freeing me 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.769
 in the area circling a few times in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.269
 green meadows moved by the wind other i 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.609
 deserts like that of tunisia that 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.170
 visit at an early age and that I still today 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.830
 remains in the heart with its expanses 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.720
 desert architecture arabesque this 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.789
 recurring dream has become more and more 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.010
 seldom but the has never vanished 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.230
 hidden desire to become light 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.420
 how the air is as fast as the wind of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.579
 get rid of something to glide over 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.410
 gently in dreamlike landscapes 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.480
 from today all this is not only confined 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.270
 in the night time fantasies from 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.090

 little gem released by the dells 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.030
 that in company that as far as I am 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.590
 regards has forever revolutionized the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.570
 way of understanding the video game as 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.199
 artistic object as experience 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.910
 training 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.039
 I'm talking about two days talking about 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.510
 what is days is difficult to see 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.180
 as much as this little diamond in the rough 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 from the paltry three-hour loggia 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.450
 is as far from the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.850
 concept of the challenge itself 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 videogame to some in search

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.979
 vestiges of ancient civilizations sprouting 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.659
 timidly from a naturalness here 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.549
 we find ourselves emerging as ancient 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.240
 testimonials from thankful people sent by 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.860
 sands of a desert a thousand 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.480
 others may remember that little one

 sublime video loop experiences is a 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.070
