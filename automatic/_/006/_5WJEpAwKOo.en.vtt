in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:03.389> make<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.659> tree<00:00:04.049> out<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.589> paper<00:00:05.810> all<00:00:06.810> you're

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
to make a tree out of paper all you're

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.820 
to make a tree out of paper all you're
going<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.500> need<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:08.099> paper<00:00:08.780> scissors<00:00:09.780> tape<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
going to need is paper scissors tape and

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.730 
going to need is paper scissors tape and
a<00:00:11.070> water<00:00:11.309> bottle<00:00:12.019> start<00:00:13.019> by<00:00:13.230> laying<00:00:13.500> your

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
a water bottle start by laying your

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.950 
a water bottle start by laying your
paper<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.880> end<00:00:15.120> like<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:20.960> now

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
paper out and to end like this now

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.580 
paper out and to end like this now
slightly<00:00:22.410> overlap<00:00:23.189> each<00:00:23.580> piece<00:00:24.560> just<00:00:25.640> barely

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
slightly overlap each piece just barely

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.880 
slightly overlap each piece just barely
like<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:29.330> I'm<00:00:30.330> using<00:00:30.660> eight<00:00:31.050> pieces<00:00:31.529> of

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
like that I'm using eight pieces of

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.459 
like that I'm using eight pieces of
paper<00:00:32.210> because<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.660> pieces<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.260> paper

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
paper because the more pieces of paper

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.530 
paper because the more pieces of paper
you<00:00:34.620> use<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.309> taller<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.790> tree<00:00:36.059> will<00:00:36.210> end<00:00:36.360> up

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you use the taller your tree will end up

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.380 
you use the taller your tree will end up
being<00:00:37.160> next<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> tape<00:00:39.149> along

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
being next you are going to tape along

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.530 
being next you are going to tape along
the<00:00:39.450> seams<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.110> each<00:00:40.410> piece<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.739> paper<00:00:41.540> next

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the seams of each piece of paper next

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.020 
the seams of each piece of paper next
start<00:00:43.200> rolling<00:00:43.500> up<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.860> paper<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.460> this

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.580 

you<00:00:48.030> want<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> roll<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.930> two<00:00:49.200> or<00:00:49.350> three

over<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> papers<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:56.010> might<00:00:56.039> get<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
over all of the papers you might get it

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.430 
over all of the papers you might get it
a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.940> off-center<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.989> might<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.199> I

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
of the tube you're gonna get a pattern

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.130 
of the tube you're gonna get a pattern
like<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.149> cuz<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.750> didn't<00:01:57.960> rotate

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
like this down here cuz it didn't rotate

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.639 
like this down here cuz it didn't rotate
as<00:01:58.469> much<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.130> gently<00:02:00.060> grab<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.869> you

as much so just gently grab it and you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.109 
as much so just gently grab it and you
might<00:02:01.829> want<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> twist<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.520> around<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.939> few

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
might want to twist it around a few

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.459 
might want to twist it around a few
times<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.750> pull<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.619> end<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> little<00:02:05.369> more

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
times and pull the end out a little more

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.809 
times and pull the end out a little more

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
give it a little variety by just

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.600 
give it a little variety by just
twisting<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.660> places<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.709> match

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
twisting it in places that have match

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.850 
twisting it in places that have match
