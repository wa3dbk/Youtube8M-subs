00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.820
 hello hello everyone and welcome to me 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.799
 new tutorial where I will be giving you 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.799
 basic defense tips 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.550
 I'll talk about the three most important techniques 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.259
 important to defend and the first 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.560
 of them is how to use the button 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.599
 Normal input and push 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.849
 to perform them you must press the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.610
 button b in xbox and circle in playstation 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.140
 4 in the default controls with it 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.360
 You will remove the ball when you are near the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.579
 rival or failing that will push him 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.290
 steal it I must say that to perform 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.940
 the entry you will have to calculate the 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.760
 moment before doing it or what 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.379
 otherwise you will fail this is the time 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.790
 that you have to press the buttons before 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.269
 mentioned to make an entry with 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.400
 success and in this is how you should not do it 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.960
 or otherwise you consider a fault or 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.579
 you will miss the entrance and you will lose 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.500
 attacker also as I explained 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.570
 previously if you press these buttons 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.610
 respectively pushed already laracha 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.960
 your opponents away the ball to the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.240
 correct way to press the buttons 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.920
 it's like it's shown right now or 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.170
 otherwise if you press them 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.299
 too much and if it will cause a lack 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.280
 even silly criminals like this one that 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.110
 could end up defining a match 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.600
 against you the second point to try 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.700
 is the anticipation logically we are not 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.140
 fortune tellers but nevertheless in many 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.090
 Sometimes we can intuit the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.500
 movements of our rival the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.000
 anticipation involves moving to 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 our players to the position where 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.960
 is the possible recipient of the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.790
 pass in the first example 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.950
 try to throw a desperate pass towards 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.690
 ahead but I managed to intuit the play and 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.670
 I ended up cutting the same pass with 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.640
 benatia likewise happens in this 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.250
 example here managed to do it with sell 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.140
 but having less reaction time and 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.220
 in this example I pull back alan for 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.990
 prevent bale from receiving the pass 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.030
 this last example is like a ball 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.860
 long flight in these situations you should 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.780
 select your centrals and go back 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.180
 the up to the possible position where 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.490
 will drop the ball and clear it once 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.380
 to avoid possible entries or rebounds 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.270
 that the strikers have the third 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.550
 and last point for today are the sweeps 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.530
 when you use them correctly they are 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.480
 very effective weapons to steal the ball to 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.670
 the rivals is done by pressing the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.830
 x and square buttons in xbox and 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.630
 playstation 4 respectively 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.640
 They can view these clips performing 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.290
 they are respective sweeps that end 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.000
 cutting cleanly a chance to 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.830
 attack of the opponent at this time is that 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.230
 must perform the sweep to remove the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.080
 ball to the opponent effectively neither before nor 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.180
 afterwards but at the exact moment and this 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.040
 It is the moment when you should not perform 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.320
 the sweep or otherwise give to the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 defense and will be in trouble let's review 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.190
 the first point are the tickets 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.750
 normal and push are those that you will use to 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.520
 often for duels in the middle 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.230
 court and plays with low grade 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.610
 danger the second point is the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.040
 anticipation that you should use 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.020
 often if you like to play to have 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.790
 the position of the ball preventing your 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.920
 rival have it for a long time and the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.940
 third point are the sweeps which 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.440
 you must use 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.120
 often in plays that really 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.130
 need them to cut the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.050
 attacks because they are a double-edged sword 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.640
 and I want to take advantage to announce my 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.410
