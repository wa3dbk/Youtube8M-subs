00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.700
 Good day to all dear 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.990
 Friends have not been shooting video 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.730
 large load on the main work for 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.269
 it's time to quietly 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.310
 continued work on the king's knife here 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.619
 so far soaked with danish butter 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:29.420
 the bottom of the need to decided nevertheless to do 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 its wood because you can not find 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:37.140
 less good part of the circle for 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.129
 This because there are cracks and other 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.570
 all sorts of trouble here 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.360
 touches the knife itself 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.050
 the knife is in principle already ready it left 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.100
 just sharpen it all now like this 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.379
 here it looks let's look closer then 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.329
 what's wrong with the impregnation of the stain itself 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.609
 lesson 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.070
 the winding that I did to protect it 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.960
 she gave a leak so hands a little 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.330
 tint smiling think that stain 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.450
 soaked did not try very deep 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:21.320
 so grind the handle a little bit 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.840
 I will lose pores 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.590
 which after all there is kind 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.600
 they are deep enough so that's all 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.860
 remove completely failed 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 but no less ears bugs will be taken into account 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:45.060
 in the future that's why rock either need 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.829
 somehow stabilize or don't know 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.100
 in some other way to protect when 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.130
 impregnation 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.470
 wooden part means let's 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:03.530
 let's see what all the same happened 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:08.039
 as a result, here is such a pattern cut out 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.310
 now show the cutters that Iâ€™m all 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:22.720
 did 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:23.770
 1 second here made two such rice for 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.069
 these goals 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:37.870
 there were a few d90 steel here 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:52.660
 1 pieces of previously made knives such 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:57.970
 here is a straight line more precisely oblique cutter focus here 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:02.920
 such an oblique cutter and another such 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.730
 Here, as it were, but this cutter is also growing 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.330
 used for some small parts 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.970
 this one 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:15.790
 used for bigger for 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:19.870
 triangles will say that the bone is not 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.350
 the tree is hard enough would not say 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.380
 very hard therefore requires large 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:32.190
 effort for pressing and cutting and and 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.190
 here at the end 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.030
 so I'll fix the camera for a second 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.049
 so here does not look our butt son of cruz 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:59.829
 tation and wood here made another 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:59.829
 small and such vodka from around the edge 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:11.659
 such a pattern of triangles such 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:16.549
 for the stars as well, and on the main knife here 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:22.030
 such triangles whole knife turned out 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:26.449
 I really like this style 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:30.259
 northern on this we will continue 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:32.810
 the work is left to finish on this 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.470
 the knife will be over all thanks for 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.660
 Attention 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.750
 I'll share it soon 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.830
 the final results of the work to all 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.830
 thanks, bye
