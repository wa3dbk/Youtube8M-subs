00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.880
 personal speech including one more time 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.020
 we prove that it is not about control of 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.580
 temperature 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.420
 Because we are important because 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.030
 hiring right on the grounds is 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.040
 The first time you step fish is the 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.530
 fish they can not control the 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.510
 temperature of the body at the 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.010
 their body is the same as the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.040
 when we have a very large control 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.719
 of this parameter in temperature and 5 world 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.660
 would feel sickness 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.219
 very low temperature for sure 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.829
 Are you going to have a note having a problem? 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.359
 with some time between a lot of 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.420
 opportunistic 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:46.039
 the very high taquari temperature of the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.079
 directly the amount of 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.309
 dissolved oxygen also did a lot 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.800
 some countries along the way and corals 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.670
 Non-woven floral video lessons are 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.769
 called ocean screen is a future algae 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.780
 what does the simple does not 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.210
 and is responsible for a choral trio 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.079
 feed the coral the result of 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.689
 photosynthesis is a sugar and ends up 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.189
 feeding this coral how much is a 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.710
 very long at the temperature that the 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.009
 people see the going on the news is the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.110
 bleaching of coral and due to 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.210
 when there is an increase around 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.030
 a great album which expulsion 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.549
 santana in an attempt to survive only 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.430
 He does not have food 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.490
 feeds and ends up dying a problem 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.340
 global world everybody reads that right 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.810
 It's official and one hour too. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.640
 happens right? 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.170
 virus is important to score the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.049
 temperature is temperature 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.869
 low how high did we tell the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.890
 temperature for two 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.330
 equipment of the first time no comments 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.390
 which uses a refrigerator converter 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:02.130
 a snake servant wrapped in a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.860
 just before titanium and water goes through 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.619
 inside this titanium tube and the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.640
 serpentine only released gas and 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.950
 there are pests and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.330
 equipment is used for at least ten 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.790
 90's, right? 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.970
 are also identified in those who have 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.630
 around music great things 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.280
 advantages of the shot is that it consumes 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.350
 relatively quite ita energy 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.420
 uses a refrigerator compressor and 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.049
 depending on the daily volume only for one 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.950
 power of the day has to be greater 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.470
 really love to great advantage 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.370
 however it is a natural gift as well 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.799
 efficient 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.769
 the other second equipment that people 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.840
 can put several are the made days 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.630
 in this case in the case of the wind 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.840
 refrigerator teachers do you think? 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.030
 many forum advertisements 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.850
 It really is her size up to a 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.579
 power of a very good reason as well. 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.660
 I only use them that will not pay 717 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.519
 space to work to pull there we have 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.670
 here is a smaller model with the wind 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.890
 plot 12 by 12 also took this 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.989
 obviously we were not a little lower 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.780
 but also used 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.630
 previous display that works 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.920
 I use 3 micron microwave factors 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.989
 relatively little less than the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.989
 refrigerator is having a good reason 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:34.260
 My case here at home. 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.200
 the summer these three symptoms more than 15 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.730
 20 hours the theme equals that natan it 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.049
 did not hold the heat cause 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.609
 so I just ended up going out to the solution 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.750
 Gambia gun is a bottle of water 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:50.370
 frozen 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.739
 op - always helped the temperature and 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.540
 everything is now with the tone here in são 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.169
 paulo also temperature dropped a little 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.709
 I was able to keep the device 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.239
 it's too much room temperature 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.250
 right as the fans are 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.359
 selected through a controller 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.709
 temperature 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:14.280
 we have marks there like what is the rocket 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.139
 who have this function is what works them 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.199
 are microcontrolled in they have a 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.630
 cast from a temperature 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:25.169
 that you program it 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.200
 will turn on or off something one 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.570
 bit of a complete 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.710
 has two heating outputs 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.590
 cooling 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.510
 you can be for him that the exit of 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.330
 heating apart a temperature 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.800
 very low and switch on the heater 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.220
 when it reaches the highest temperature 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.080
 high also determining you turn off 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.080
 Also same thing with 11 cases 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.530
 including in my case here a passage 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.100
 quoted so that when the temperature 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:58.270
 batan guzzi 16.9 and salaries and wedges in 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:02.050
 hour down to 26.4 né it turns off 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.000
 everything is half a degree difference 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.950
 it is important to remember that regardless of 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.110
 temperature you want to leave your 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.630
 Work is important that there is no 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.590
 temperature greater than one degree during the 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.230
 whole day 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.470
 this variation is actually very large 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.150
 the fish of which they feel quite 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.840
 leaves a variation of 20 lower 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:26.200
 I feel in more connected spaces and with that 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.150
 I can control the temperature is a 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.360
 tip I have I want doing well 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.510
 here the following summer as if these 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.230
 lines do not hold an aquarium that one day 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.150
 of heat I program for less than 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.930
 left ministries in which not even one 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.980
 lower value or even accepted 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:50.300
 practically spend an entire day 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:52.759
 working and yet there is how to meet 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.870
 At the end of the day it will not be so 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.669
 high 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.370
 The argument that I need to turn off the 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.259
 I can not reduce the amount of 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.539
 The ambient temperature was very 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.819
 day-to- day pressure on people leaving the 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:08.210
 difference for one more does contract of 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.190
 oscar - the other tip to control the 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.280
 summer temperature is changing the period 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.669
 of registrations, either connect the 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.379
 lights later, right? 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.319
 but in the afternoon left the lawns having a 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:24.949
 night temperature slightly lower 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:26.210
 also ends up giving right so that only 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.259
 remembering that we have to think 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.259
 like this 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:33.440
 this concern culture temperature by 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.569
 cause of animals nec 20 feel very 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.710
 Intense people do not think 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.240
 can control the temperature 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.729
 corporal 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.099
 It's good to give this same newspaper tip . 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:45.280
 moderator chokes you talk about 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:45.280
 things
