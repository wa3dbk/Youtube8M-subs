let's<00:00:10.200> go<00:00:10.320> find<00:00:10.559> out<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:10.980> check<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.309> tech

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.109 

what<00:00:21.300> does<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.539> reverse<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.560> an<00:00:23.039> LTZ<00:00:23.430> it's

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
what does this reverse is an LTZ it's

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.609 
what does this reverse is an LTZ it's
loaded<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.660> gills<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.230> there's<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.560> a

loaded to the gills and there's not a
lot<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.130> option<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.820> let's<00:00:26.849> check<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
lot to option so let's check out the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
lot to option so let's check out the
rather<00:00:27.869> lavish<00:00:28.320> standard<00:00:28.680> equipment<00:00:28.920> here's

I<00:00:32.790> find<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> display<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.320> relatively

smooth<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:36.149> its<00:00:36.329> resolution<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:37.170> not

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
smooth in its resolution but not

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500 
smooth in its resolution but not
terribly<00:00:37.739> sharp<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> looks

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
terribly sharp so it looks

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.780 
terribly sharp so it looks
I'd<00:00:39.899> say<00:00:40.140> mid<00:00:40.469> pack<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.040> terms<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.370> how<00:00:41.520> quickly

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
I'd say mid pack in terms of how quickly

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.100 
I'd say mid pack in terms of how quickly

can actually click one of those to find
out<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> problem<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.570> directly<00:00:58.350> from

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
out what the problem is directly from

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.319 
out what the problem is directly from
that<00:00:58.590> icon<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.309> traffic<00:00:59.699> by<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.030> comes

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that icon now traffic by the way comes

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.299 
that icon now traffic by the way comes
via<00:01:00.600> XM<00:01:01.140> Nav<00:01:01.410> traffic<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.070> there's<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
via XM Nav traffic so there's a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.860 
via XM Nav traffic so there's a
subscription<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.059> an<00:01:03.149> account<00:01:03.510> you've<00:01:03.719> got

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
subscription and an account you've got

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
subscription and an account you've got
to<00:01:04.019> maintain<00:01:04.170> after<00:01:05.010> year<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.430> it's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to maintain after year I think it's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.670 
to maintain after year I think it's
three<00:01:05.790> months<00:01:05.970> free<00:01:06.420> expire<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
three months free expire and then of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.469 
three months free expire and then of
course<00:01:07.710> also<00:01:08.130> tells<00:01:08.520> us<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.820> XM
