00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
going to lean forward so that way most

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.580 
going to lean forward so that way most
of<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.510> weight<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.840> distributed<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.469> the

easier<00:01:00.059> you're<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> bottle<00:01:01.620> cap

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
easier you're going to do a bottle cap

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.299 
easier you're going to do a bottle cap
motion<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.930> that's<00:01:04.890> how<00:01:05.010> you're<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
motion and that's how you're going to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.880 
motion and that's how you're going to
get<00:01:05.400> around<00:01:07.610> again<00:01:09.290> right<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> most

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
get around again right here is the most

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.350

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
learn how to set up if you're doing it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.789 
learn how to set up if you're doing it
from<00:01:16.200> your<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> again<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:19.650> we
