00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
about the last four years but really

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.160 
about the last four years but really
Illumina<00:00:38.070> color<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:39.150> creating<00:00:39.630> a<00:00:39.930> color

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
Illumina color is about creating a color

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.350 
Illumina color is about creating a color
that<00:00:40.410> looks<00:00:40.530> good<00:00:40.860> anywhere<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> world

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
that looks good anywhere in the world

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.830 
that looks good anywhere in the world
it's<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.990> youthful<00:00:43.650> sheer<00:00:44.160> premium<00:00:45.150> result<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
it's a youthful sheer premium result I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.560 
it's a youthful sheer premium result I
think<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.900> two-term<00:00:49.410> load<00:00:49.740> is<00:00:50.060> really<00:00:51.060> easy<00:00:51.300> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
think a two-term load is really easy to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.810 
think a two-term load is really easy to
achieve<00:00:51.810> and<00:00:52.380> I<00:00:53.040> think<00:00:53.340> there's<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> big

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
achieve and I think there's a big

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.840 
achieve and I think there's a big
difference<00:00:53.850> between<00:00:54.500> ombre<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.770> dip<00:00:56.400> dyeing

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
difference between ombre and dip dyeing

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.480 
difference between ombre and dip dyeing
ombre<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.660> much<00:00:57.870> more<00:00:58.050> natural<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.800> dip<00:00:59.250> dye

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
ombre is much more natural and dip dye

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.430 
ombre is much more natural and dip dye
is<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.700> for<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.060> faint-hearted<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.260> think

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
is not for the faint-hearted and I think

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.710 
is not for the faint-hearted and I think
the<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.680> create<00:01:02.130> them<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.670> very<00:01:03.240> much

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
the way you create them is very much

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.479 
the way you create them is very much
about<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.530> amount<00:01:04.800> of<00:01:04.890> hair<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.370> you're

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
about the amount of hair that you're

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.970 
about the amount of hair that you're
coloring<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.690> for<00:01:06.840> an<00:01:06.930> ombre<00:01:07.350> you're<00:01:07.740> really

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
coloring so for an ombre you're really

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.850 
coloring so for an ombre you're really
trying<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> blend<00:01:08.640> from<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.200> piece<00:01:10.440> of<00:01:10.620> color

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
trying to blend from the piece of color

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.680 
trying to blend from the piece of color
all<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> way<00:01:11.580> through<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.060> natural<00:01:12.450> roots

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
all the way through to the natural roots

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.649 
all the way through to the natural roots
I'm<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.710> making<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.159> look<00:01:14.340> seamless<00:01:14.659> where

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
I'm really making it look seamless where

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.469 
I'm really making it look seamless where
dip<00:01:15.900> dyeing<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.620> really<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.940> more<00:01:18.210> bold

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
dip dyeing can really be much more bold

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.540 
dip dyeing can really be much more bold
you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.380> almost<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:20.159> where<00:01:20.310> you've<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
you can almost go where you've got a

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.390 
you can almost go where you've got a
complete<00:01:21.450> definite<00:01:22.050> line<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.800> color<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
complete definite line of color in the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.300 
complete definite line of color in the
hair

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.410 

when<00:01:28.310> you're<00:01:28.430> in<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.610> salon<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.060> think<00:01:29.300> it's

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
when you're in the salon I think it's

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.120 
when you're in the salon I think it's
really<00:01:29.720> important<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.440> communicate<00:01:30.830> with

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
really important to communicate with

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.310 
really important to communicate with
your<00:01:31.250> hairstylist<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.240> really<00:01:32.660> let<00:01:32.870> them<00:01:33.050> know

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
your hairstylist I really let them know

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.800 
your hairstylist I really let them know
how<00:01:34.130> much<00:01:34.460> hair<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:34.970> want<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.210> have<00:01:35.390> colored

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
how much hair you want to have colored

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.560 
how much hair you want to have colored
don't<00:01:36.470> go<00:01:36.680> in<00:01:36.890> for<00:01:37.130> an<00:01:37.190> ombre<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.940> get<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.300> dip

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
don't go in for an ombre and get a dip

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.820 
don't go in for an ombre and get a dip
dye

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.190 

I<00:01:42.330> think<00:01:43.330> we're<00:01:43.420> seeing<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.720> lot<00:01:43.900> of<00:01:43.930> people

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
I think we're seeing a lot of people

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.740 
I think we're seeing a lot of people
still<00:01:44.710> coming<00:01:45.100> into<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.490> Atelier<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.150> asking

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
still coming into the Atelier and asking

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.530 
still coming into the Atelier and asking
for<00:01:46.900> some<00:01:47.110> kind<00:01:47.410> of<00:01:47.620> ombre<00:01:48.130> or<00:01:48.550> dip<00:01:48.910> dyeing<00:01:49.210> I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
for some kind of ombre or dip dyeing I

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.940 
for some kind of ombre or dip dyeing I
think<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.840> reason<00:01:50.260> that<00:01:50.290> it's<00:01:50.500> got<00:01:50.680> so

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
think the reason that it's got so

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.470 
think the reason that it's got so
commercial<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.730> that<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:51.940> really<00:01:52.120> kind<00:01:52.360> of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
commercial is that it really kind of

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.240 
commercial is that it really kind of
suits<00:01:52.750> everybody<00:01:53.170> there's<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.800> level<00:01:54.040> of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
suits everybody there's a level of

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.040 
suits everybody there's a level of
lightness<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.120> the<00:01:55.180> level<00:01:55.480> of<00:01:55.540> blond<00:01:55.840> in

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
lightness and the level of blond in

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.910 
lightness and the level of blond in
there<00:01:56.260> for<00:01:56.410> everybody

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
there for everybody

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.950 
there for everybody
but<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.340> think<00:01:57.430> for<00:01:57.790> fall<00:01:58.060> we're<00:01:58.660> gonna<00:01:58.750> be<00:01:58.930> a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
but I think for fall we're gonna be a

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.740 
but I think for fall we're gonna be a
lot<00:01:59.110> bolder<00:01:59.500> with<00:02:00.070> colors<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:01.330> it's<00:02:01.480> gonna<00:02:01.570> be

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
lot bolder with colors so it's gonna be

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.930 
lot bolder with colors so it's gonna be
a<00:02:01.780> lot<00:02:02.020> less<00:02:02.290> about<00:02:02.470> looking<00:02:02.950> sunkissed<00:02:03.610> and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940
