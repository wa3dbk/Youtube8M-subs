00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.330 
the Google keyboard is what I recommend
for<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:22.050> because<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:24.220> Google<00:02:24.400> keyboard<00:02:24.790> is

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
for this because the Google keyboard is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.400 
for this because the Google keyboard is
meant<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.610> kind<00:02:27.849> of<00:02:27.940> work<00:02:28.209> with<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.840> emoji

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
meant to kind of work with this emoji

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.170 
meant to kind of work with this emoji
keyboard<00:02:29.590> because<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.640> emoji<00:02:31.030> keyboard

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
keyboard because this emoji keyboard

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.440 
keyboard because this emoji keyboard
comes<00:02:31.630> already<00:02:32.620> included<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:34.120> Nexus

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
devices to pure Google devices so the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.170 
devices to pure Google devices so the
Google<00:02:37.840> keyboard<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.500> definitely<00:02:39.180> much

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
Google keyboard is definitely much

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.020 
Google keyboard is definitely much
better<00:02:40.709> experience<00:02:41.709> with<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.190> keyboard<00:02:42.670> so

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
and then you would switch to emoji so

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.690 
and then you would switch to emoji so
that's<00:04:08.530> why<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.769> recommend<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.430> Google

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
that's why I recommend the Google

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.620 
that's why I recommend the Google
keyboard<00:04:10.060> because<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.329> could<00:04:10.449> just

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
keyboard because you could just

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.840 
keyboard because you could just
literally<00:04:10.930> hold<00:04:11.290> down<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.829> spacebar<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.639> it

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
literally hold down the spacebar and it

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.210 
literally hold down the spacebar and it
does<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.329> you

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
does it for you

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.940 
does it for you
right<00:04:14.760> there<00:04:14.970> we<00:04:15.090> have<00:04:15.210> emojis<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:15.950> it's
