obviously<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:08.370> look<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.760> am<00:01:08.970> creating<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.690> not

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
obviously the look I am creating is not

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.770 
obviously the look I am creating is not
a<00:01:09.960> wearable<00:01:10.650> everyday<00:01:11.100> look<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> why<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
a wearable everyday look that is why I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
a wearable everyday look that is why I
allow<00:01:13.080> myself<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.680> add<00:01:13.920> red<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.520> orange

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
allow myself to add red and orange
eyeshadows<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.840> love<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.410> lower<00:01:16.650> than<00:01:16.950> usual

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
eyeshadows I love bit lower than usual

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.550

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
together and creating a smooth

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:59.300 
together and creating a smooth
transition<00:01:51.310> from<00:01:51.729> one<00:01:51.999> color<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.420> another
