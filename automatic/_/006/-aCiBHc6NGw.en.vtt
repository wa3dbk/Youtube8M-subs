well<00:01:20.539> and<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.799> was<00:01:22.009> first<00:01:22.310> supercharged<00:01:23.060> at

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
well and it was first supercharged at

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.429 
well and it was first supercharged at

it's now showing 146 within a few weeks
it'll<00:01:27.770> be<00:01:27.920> 150<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.270> it's<00:01:29.389> done<00:01:29.509> quite<00:01:29.719> a<00:01:29.749> few

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
it'll be 150 so it's done quite a few

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.800 
it'll be 150 so it's done quite a few
