00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.580
 cloud is the kid where is 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.050
 going up 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.940
 the fingers 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.240
 all areas in kid up to the ear 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.430
 OK 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.540
 here with you guys and now for 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.540
 where others for back 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.799
 and something so you can see who is 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:32.820
 you deserve it I liked your money 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.340
 to the point as you know already it seems that 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.200
 in here inside 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.200
 How fun is there a lump here 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:12.600
 really what he is doing is following 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.370
 the theater brand was 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.909
 Let's see 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.049
 to the question of palante for back I 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.049
 I think so 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.740
 slow down but where is I fall mother of mine 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:52.090
 hard to the point the virgin 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.090
 you have to do the whole mountain 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.830
 follow 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.209
 yes 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.209
 and second 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:31.409
 I do not know what to do 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.339
 but how it works 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.339
 to the talk 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.440
 you have to do it 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.160
 of their life 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.789
 for me 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.180
 but where are you 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.300
 and still the roller coaster we are going to 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.990
 take advantage here to do me a moment 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.990
 miniature 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.020
 be it for the ferris wheel it's time and it says 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.830
 it's time to stay here standing 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.920
 so I do 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:23.090
 I fall but what do you say 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.420
 this that my balls go through or not what 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.420
 he 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:33.690
 but the point I do not have it 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.690
 now it is true 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:40.590
 also but it will not be carried by the wheel 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.040
 point 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.370
 if you have to ride the Ferris wheel and 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.370
 let him take it 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.210
 but the point though I 'm going to take it for 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.169
 ass 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.270
 let's see 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.870
 do not fuck god 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.120
 fall from others 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.270
 today with the piquitos these uncles the 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.700
 Oh, God 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.210
 let's see if I slow down the 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:30.169
 barrels of these also out 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:36.620
 come on let's go let's go against the water 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:39.460
 ok I understand the extra pressure everything is 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.460
 here 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.600
 go Go 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.600
 up to the liver 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.730
 we are all together at the end and if 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.720
 I want this time further 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.720
 if we had a stone's throw 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.660
