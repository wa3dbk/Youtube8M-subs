00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
what I mean what I mean by that is we

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.570 
what I mean what I mean by that is we
want<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.110> individual<00:01:04.890> sounds<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.430> each

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
want to have individual sounds in each
room<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.689> build<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.290> storyline

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
room so we really build that storyline

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
room so we really build that storyline
as<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.700> through<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.600> try<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> avoid

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
as they go through and we try to avoid

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.289 
as they go through and we try to avoid
that<00:01:10.200> overall<00:01:10.680> sound<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> top<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.000> mean<00:01:12.180> we

that overall sound on the top I mean we

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.840 
that overall sound on the top I mean we
do<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> quick<00:01:14.100> way<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> just

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
do have it and it is a quick way to just

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.580 
do have it and it is a quick way to just
throw<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> sound<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.600> last<00:01:15.840> minute<00:01:16.080> but

back<00:01:46.829> here<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> treble<00:01:48.180> let's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
back here that's for the treble let's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.819 
back here that's for the treble let's
take<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> look<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.500> sounds<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:51.829> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
take a look at what that sounds like you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.950 
take a look at what that sounds like you
mean<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> amplifier<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.030> amplifier<00:01:54.060> yeah

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.320 

not<00:01:59.960> a<00:01:59.990> week<00:02:00.170> right<00:02:00.410> so<00:02:01.370> I'm<00:02:01.790> not<00:02:01.970> going<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.150> use

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
not a week right so I'm not going to use

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.520 
not a week right so I'm not going to use
that<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:02.810> I'm<00:02:02.900> not<00:02:02.960> going<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.170> use<00:02:03.260> that<00:02:03.290> one

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
that so I'm not going to use that one

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.530 
that so I'm not going to use that one
but<00:02:03.800> these<00:02:04.190> are<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.520> two<00:02:04.670> cables<00:02:05.060> right<00:02:05.210> here

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
but these are the two cables right here

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.750 
but these are the two cables right here
and<00:02:05.690> this<00:02:06.440> is<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.680> speaker<00:02:06.950> look<00:02:07.280> how<00:02:07.370> small

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
and this is the speaker look how small

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.359 
and this is the speaker look how small
that<00:02:07.820> is<00:02:08.030> it's<00:02:08.450> got<00:02:08.600> little<00:02:09.590> holes<00:02:09.920> right<00:02:10.310> here

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
that is it's got little holes right here

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.100 
that is it's got little holes right here
which<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.330> awesome<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:11.750> i'm<00:02:11.810> going<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.990> make

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
which is awesome so i'm going to make

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.110 
which is awesome so i'm going to make
like<00:02:12.320> a<00:02:12.350> unit<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.130> mount<00:02:13.460> this<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.910> wall

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
like a unit to mount this to the wall

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.950 
like a unit to mount this to the wall
and<00:02:14.330> it's<00:02:15.050> got<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.470> connectors<00:02:15.950> right<00:02:16.220> here

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
and it's got the connectors right here

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:34.000 
and it's got the connectors right here
so<00:02:17.960> if<00:02:18.590> i<00:02:18.680> take<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:30.700> look<00:02:31.700> again<00:02:32.740> so<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:33.860> works

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
so if i take this look again so it works

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.120 
so if i take this look again so it works
really<00:02:34.070> well<00:02:34.250> right<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.410> let's<00:02:36.410> say<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.860> want<00:02:37.070> to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
really well right so let's say I want to

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.620 
really well right so let's say I want to
have<00:02:37.250> two<00:02:37.459> speakers<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.090> room<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.600> that

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
have two speakers in the room so that

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.510 
have two speakers in the room so that
the<00:02:38.870> sounds<00:02:39.260> coming<00:02:39.470> from<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.040> even<00:02:40.280> just

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
the sounds coming from and even just

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280 
the sounds coming from and even just
like<00:02:40.730> surround<00:02:41.120> sound<00:02:41.390> Connor<00:02:41.690> right<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:42.200> it

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
like surround sound Connor right so it

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.690 
like surround sound Connor right so it
just<00:02:42.440> sounds<00:02:42.620> really<00:02:42.709> cool<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:45.830> take<00:02:46.130> one

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
just sounds really cool you take one

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.130 
just sounds really cool you take one
wire<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.860> put<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.430> into<00:02:49.640> here<00:02:50.240> just<00:02:50.959> bring

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
wire and you put it into here just bring

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.500 
wire and you put it into here just bring
clothes<00:02:51.440> for<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.740> time<00:02:51.920> yes<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.120> put<00:02:53.360> one

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
clothes for the time yes so I put one

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.810 
clothes for the time yes so I put one
wire<00:02:53.720> into<00:02:53.990> there<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.380> then<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.370> came<00:02:55.640> with

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
wire into there and then it came with

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.100 
wire into there and then it came with
this<00:02:55.910> other<00:02:56.060> wire<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.690> was<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:56.990> there<00:02:57.400> and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
this other wire that was in there and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.160 
this other wire that was in there and
hooked<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.260> one<00:03:00.320> into<00:03:00.590> there<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:02.140> then<00:03:03.140> I

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
hooked that one into there and then I

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.500 
hooked that one into there and then I
hook<00:03:03.880> these<00:03:04.880> babies<00:03:05.800> into<00:03:06.880> here<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.390> it's

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
hook these babies into here so it's

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.090 
hook these babies into here so it's
basically<00:03:08.690> like<00:03:09.019> daisy<00:03:09.440> chaining<00:03:09.890> these

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
basically like daisy chaining these

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.759 
basically like daisy chaining these
speakers<00:03:10.340> together<00:03:10.810> all<00:03:11.810> of<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:12.050> sudden<00:03:12.410> have

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
speakers together all of a sudden have

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:20.160 
speakers together all of a sudden have
speakers<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.430> I've<00:03:13.610> sound<00:03:13.910> two<00:03:14.420> speakers

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.990 

so<00:03:21.170> it's<00:03:21.920> pretty<00:03:22.130> cool<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:22.520> now<00:03:22.640> what<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.820> would

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
so it's pretty cool so now what I would

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.310 
so it's pretty cool so now what I would
do<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:24.100> probably<00:03:26.050> probably<00:03:27.050> going<00:03:27.260> to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
do is I probably probably going to

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.800 
do is I probably probably going to
extend<00:03:27.710> these<00:03:27.950> wires<00:03:28.310> right<00:03:28.760> here<00:03:28.820> like<00:03:29.630> they

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
extend these wires right here like they

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.750 
extend these wires right here like they
make<00:03:29.840> these<00:03:30.140> long<00:03:30.410> these<00:03:30.800> wires<00:03:31.070> longer<00:03:31.610> maybe

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
make these long these wires longer maybe

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.940 
make these long these wires longer maybe
like<00:03:32.030> 12<00:03:32.750> feet<00:03:32.990> or<00:03:33.140> something<00:03:33.440> like<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:33.920> I

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
like 12 feet or something like that so I

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.760 
like 12 feet or something like that so I
have<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.340> range<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:35.000> be<00:03:35.120> able<00:03:35.210> to<00:03:35.740> run<00:03:36.740> the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
have the range to be able to run the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.770 
have the range to be able to run the
white<00:03:37.010> run<00:03:37.250> these<00:03:37.370> speakers<00:03:37.730> like<00:03:38.060> 10<00:03:38.600> feet

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
white run these speakers like 10 feet

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.590 
white run these speakers like 10 feet
apart<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:39.950> different<00:03:40.010> spots<00:03:40.400> in<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.700> room<00:03:40.850> and

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
apart in different spots in the room and

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.390 
apart in different spots in the room and
I'm<00:03:42.110> probably<00:03:42.320> going<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.620> make<00:03:42.740> a<00:03:42.770> box<00:03:43.100> for

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
I'm probably going to make a box for

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.560 
I'm probably going to make a box for
this<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:44.180> this<00:03:44.360> gets<00:03:44.540> mounted<00:03:45.140> in<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.350> room<00:03:45.680> and

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
this so this gets mounted in a room and

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.490 
this so this gets mounted in a room and
basically<00:03:47.570> this<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:47.990> unit<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.410> controls

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
basically this is the unit that controls

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.930 
basically this is the unit that controls
the<00:03:49.460> power<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.440> this<00:03:51.440> goes<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:52.670> one<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:52.880> the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
the power and this goes to one of the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.940 
the power and this goes to one of the
speakers<00:03:53.270> and<00:03:53.570> it<00:03:53.900> runs<00:03:54.200> around<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.860> other

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
speakers and it runs around the other

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.140 
speakers and it runs around the other
side<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.280> room<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:55.610> other<00:03:55.730> speaker

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
side of the room to the other speaker

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150 
side of the room to the other speaker
and<00:03:56.330> boom<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.810> think<00:03:57.110> we'll<00:03:57.470> have<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.650> awesome

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
and boom I think we'll have a awesome

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.880 
and boom I think we'll have a awesome
sound<00:03:58.730> system<00:03:58.820> for<00:03:59.510> pretty<00:04:00.200> inexpensive

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
sound system for pretty inexpensive

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.650 
sound system for pretty inexpensive
because<00:04:01.010> this<00:04:01.250> cost<00:04:01.490> me<00:04:01.670> three<00:04:02.060> bucks<00:04:02.090> at<00:04:02.510> an

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
because this cost me three bucks at an

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.720 
because this cost me three bucks at an
