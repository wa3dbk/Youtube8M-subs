00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
a surveyor people never built surveyors

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.760 
a surveyor people never built surveyors
on<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.710> map<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.450> yes<00:02:03.450> hence<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> fact<00:02:04.649> that

this game is called iron guy with crazy
strat<00:02:09.349> so<00:02:10.349> yeah

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.530 

my<00:02:14.710> severe<00:02:15.100> headed<00:02:15.580> out<00:02:15.730> there<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.150> I've<00:02:16.390> got

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
my severe headed out there and I've got

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.530 
my severe headed out there and I've got
an<00:02:16.630> OP<00:02:16.780> Center<00:02:17.020> up<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.030> can<00:02:19.210> only<00:02:19.240> mean

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
an OP Center up so that can only mean

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.110 
an OP Center up so that can only mean
one<00:02:19.600> thing<00:02:19.840> I'm<00:02:20.530> going<00:02:20.770> for<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.120> stealth

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
one thing I'm going for the stealth

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.660 
one thing I'm going for the stealth
surveyor<00:02:22.770> I'm<00:02:23.770> going<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.040> cloak<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.520> with<00:02:24.640> a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
surveyor I'm going to cloak it with a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.790 
surveyor I'm going to cloak it with a
cloaking<00:02:24.940> field<00:02:27.630> don't<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.840> instant<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.590> I've

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
cloaking field don't it instant and I've

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.280 
cloaking field don't it instant and I've
also<00:02:29.950> got<00:02:30.190> my<00:02:30.370> secret<00:02:31.000> Rhine<00:02:31.240> up<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:35.050> is

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
also got my secret Rhine up and that is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.610 
also got my secret Rhine up and that is
for<00:02:35.680> well<00:02:36.670> you'll<00:02:37.510> see<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:38.020> bit<00:02:38.320> later<00:02:38.590> actually

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
for well you'll see a bit later actually

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.600 
for well you'll see a bit later actually
so<00:02:41.620> basically<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.460> these

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
so basically this is one of these

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.470 
so basically this is one of these
strategies<00:02:43.090> where<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.780> know<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.830> fails

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
strategies where you know if it fails

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.840 
strategies where you know if it fails
you're<00:02:46.480> screwed<00:02:46.870> you're<00:02:47.200> out<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.770> game<00:02:47.950> if

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
you're screwed you're out of the game if

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.170 
you're screwed you're out of the game if
it's<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.570> succeeds<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:51.070> you've<00:02:51.880> won<00:02:52.030> the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
it's that succeeds then you've won the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.040 
it's that succeeds then you've won the
game<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:53.770> sort<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.040> an<00:02:54.420> all-in<00:02:55.420> strategy

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
game so it's sort of an all-in strategy

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.190 
game so it's sort of an all-in strategy

totally he has no no fucking idea what
the<00:05:40.550> hull<00:05:40.669> is<00:05:40.699> capturing<00:05:41.210> all<00:05:41.360> those

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
the hull is capturing all those

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.089 
the hull is capturing all those
buildings<00:05:41.690> because<00:05:42.169> my<00:05:42.379> engineers<00:05:42.889> also

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
buildings because my engineers also

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.999 
buildings because my engineers also
stealth<00:05:44.229> because<00:05:45.229> they're<00:05:45.379> in<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.560> radius<00:05:45.889> of

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
stealth because they're in the radius of

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.749 
stealth because they're in the radius of
my<00:05:46.099> disruption<00:05:46.699> tale<00:05:47.440> but<00:05:48.440> of<00:05:49.220> course<00:05:49.520> he

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
my disruption tale but of course he

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.820 
my disruption tale but of course he
builds<00:05:50.060> a<00:05:50.120> guardian<00:05:50.479> cannon<00:05:50.810> which<00:05:51.560> can

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
builds a guardian cannon which can

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.370 
builds a guardian cannon which can
detect<00:05:52.009> stealth<00:05:56.080> but<00:05:57.080> that's<00:05:57.199> alright

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
detect stealth but that's alright

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.960 
detect stealth but that's alright
because<00:05:57.530> it's<00:05:57.979> a<00:05:58.069> little<00:05:58.370> bit<00:05:58.460> far<00:05:58.669> away<00:05:58.699> so

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
because it's a little bit far away so

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.610 
because it's a little bit far away so
you<00:05:59.240> can't<00:05:59.539> see<00:05:59.720> my<00:05:59.840> barracks<00:06:00.169> which<00:06:00.349> is<00:06:00.470> good

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
you can't see my barracks which is good

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.439 
you can't see my barracks which is good
and<00:06:00.650> you<00:06:00.770> just<00:06:00.919> you<00:06:01.580> know<00:06:01.729> rolling<00:06:02.360> around

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
and you just you know rolling around

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.420 
and you just you know rolling around
with<00:06:02.599> its<00:06:02.810> predators<00:06:03.259> and<00:06:03.409> stuff<00:06:03.650> doesn't

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
with its predators and stuff doesn't

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.399 
with its predators and stuff doesn't
have<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.580> clue<00:06:04.759> what's<00:06:04.909> going<00:06:05.150> on<00:06:05.270> and<00:06:06.199> I'm

building<00:06:06.710> my<00:06:06.770> second<00:06:07.190> barracks<00:06:07.630> because<00:06:08.630> I

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
building my second barracks because I

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.029 
building my second barracks because I
figure<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.229> engineers<00:06:09.620> aren't<00:06:09.740> going<00:06:09.889> to<00:06:09.949> be

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
figure the engineers aren't going to be

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.830 
figure the engineers aren't going to be
enough<00:06:10.099> I'm<00:06:10.969> going<00:06:11.120> to<00:06:11.210> need<00:06:11.330> something<00:06:11.690> else

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
enough I'm going to need something else

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.140 
enough I'm going to need something else
to<00:06:11.960> finish<00:06:12.289> this<00:06:12.500> off<00:06:15.340> place<00:06:16.340> my<00:06:16.610> second

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
to finish this off place my second

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.920 
to finish this off place my second
barracks<00:06:17.509> in<00:06:17.719> a<00:06:17.750> minutes<00:06:20.259> there<00:06:21.259> you<00:06:21.319> good<00:06:21.440> and

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
barracks in a minutes there you good and

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.379 
barracks in a minutes there you good and
I'm<00:06:23.930> sort<00:06:24.229> of<00:06:24.289> building<00:06:24.919> rockets<00:06:25.789> quads<00:06:26.060> and<00:06:26.330> I

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
I'm sort of building rockets quads and I

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.059 
I'm sort of building rockets quads and I
quickly<00:06:26.569> get<00:06:26.870> rid<00:06:27.020> of<00:06:27.050> them<00:06:27.229> and<00:06:27.409> stop
