she's<00:00:12.030> picks<00:00:12.240> up<00:00:12.360> our<00:00:12.480> wave<00:00:12.809> or<00:00:13.910> our<00:00:14.910> minds<00:00:15.660> you

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
she's picks up our wave or our minds you

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.470 
she's picks up our wave or our minds you
know<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.670> wavelength<00:00:17.670> or<00:00:17.910> whatever<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.359> want

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480

know a wavelength or whatever you want
to<00:00:18.570> call<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.840> they<00:00:18.960> pick<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.920> they'll

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
to call it they pick it up and they'll

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.950 
to call it they pick it up and they'll
actually<00:00:20.400> perform<00:00:20.939> what<00:00:21.090> we're<00:00:21.210> thinking<00:00:21.359> so

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
ahead and make an action so that's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.250

lot of y'all think well you're just
teaching<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.520> horse<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> move<00:00:41.969> away<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.210> me

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
teaching that horse to move away from me

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.700 
teaching that horse to move away from me
before<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.320> backed<00:00:43.530> off

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
before you get on because you backed off

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.950 
before you get on because you backed off
well<00:00:44.430> if<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.820> would<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.149> ahead<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> wait<00:00:45.719> for

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
well if I would go ahead and wait for

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
well if I would go ahead and wait for
her<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.260> move<00:00:46.500> completely<00:00:46.890> away<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.789> then

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
her to move completely away and then

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.029 
her to move completely away and then
stop<00:00:48.270> well<00:00:49.200> yeah<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.710> stopped<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
stop well yeah because I stopped the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.500 
stop well yeah because I stopped the
stimulation<00:00:50.430> which<00:00:50.700> she<00:00:50.820> put<00:00:50.969> energy<00:00:51.210> into

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
stimulation which she put energy into

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
stimulation which she put energy into
moving<00:00:51.750> away<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.949> tune<00:00:53.219> with

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
moving away but if I get in tune with

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.590 
moving away but if I get in tune with
her<00:00:53.579> emotions<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:55.530> stop<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.640> split

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
her emotions and I stop right split

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.790 
her emotions and I stop right split
second<00:00:58.109> before<00:00:59.039> she<00:00:59.399> actually<00:00:59.850> moves<00:01:00.800> then

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
second before she actually moves then

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
second before she actually moves then
she<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.190> put<00:01:02.340> energy<00:01:02.489> into<00:01:02.820> doing<00:01:03.359> nothing

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
she just put energy into doing nothing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.560 
she just put energy into doing nothing
she<00:01:03.870> can't<00:01:04.110> fight<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> air<00:01:04.979> she<00:01:05.820> can't<00:01:06.030> she

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
she can't fight in the air she can't she

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.330 
she can't fight in the air she can't she
can't<00:01:06.689> resist<00:01:06.900> air<00:01:07.350> she<00:01:07.530> can't<00:01:07.770> pull<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.100> air

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
can't resist air she can't pull on air

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.969 
can't resist air she can't pull on air
so<00:01:09.030> instead<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.770> stopped

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979

there and well she didn't do it but she
pushed<00:07:09.690> into<00:07:09.930> it<00:07:10.110> and<00:07:10.260> she's<00:07:10.410> that<00:07:10.980> she's

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
pushed into it and she's that she's

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.650 
pushed into it and she's that she's
learning<00:07:11.610> that's<00:07:11.730> where<00:07:12.060> the<00:07:12.210> release<00:07:12.450> of<00:07:12.570> the

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
learning that's where the release of the

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.480 
learning that's where the release of the
pressure<00:07:12.870> is<00:07:13.110> so<00:07:13.650> I<00:07:13.710> got<00:07:13.860> a<00:07:13.890> reward<00:07:14.220> every

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
pressure is so I got a reward every

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.580 
pressure is so I got a reward every
little<00:07:14.700> thing<00:07:15.080> holding<00:07:16.080> that<00:07:16.230> pressure<00:07:16.470> a

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
little thing holding that pressure a

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.090 
little thing holding that pressure a
little<00:07:16.710> bit<00:07:17.630> hold<00:07:18.710> she's<00:07:19.710> shifting<00:07:19.890> her

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100 
little bit hold she's shifting her

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.920 
little bit hold she's shifting her
weight<00:07:20.130> back<00:07:20.340> I'm<00:07:20.970> squeezing<00:07:21.330> a<00:07:21.510> little<00:07:21.630> bit

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
weight back I'm squeezing a little bit

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.750 
weight back I'm squeezing a little bit
and<00:07:22.140> she's<00:07:22.470> dropped<00:07:22.740> her<00:07:22.860> head<00:07:23.040> as<00:07:23.280> she<00:07:23.490> moved

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.760 
and she's dropped her head as she moved

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.130 
and she's dropped her head as she moved
back<00:07:23.820> a<00:07:23.970> little<00:07:24.180> bit<00:07:24.300> it's<00:07:24.450> not<00:07:24.570> quite<00:07:24.930> what<00:07:25.080> I

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.140 
back a little bit it's not quite what I

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.570 
back a little bit it's not quite what I
want<00:07:25.410> but<00:07:25.890> it's<00:07:26.010> a<00:07:26.070> start

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.130 
back squeeze bump a little bit make it

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.120 
back squeeze bump a little bit make it
uncomfortable<00:07:41.490> for<00:07:41.850> her<00:07:41.940> to<00:07:42.060> go<00:07:42.210> backwards

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.130 
uncomfortable for her to go backwards

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.500 
uncomfortable for her to go backwards
just<00:07:44.130> wanted<00:07:44.370> to<00:07:44.460> dip<00:07:44.669> there<00:07:44.970> she<00:07:45.270> pushed

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 
there see how far she dropped down by

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.080 
there see how far she dropped down by
putting<00:08:04.350> the<00:08:04.530> pressure<00:08:04.680> on<00:08:04.860> both<00:08:05.130> reins<00:08:05.400> so

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.090 
putting the pressure on both reins so

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.240 
putting the pressure on both reins so
now
