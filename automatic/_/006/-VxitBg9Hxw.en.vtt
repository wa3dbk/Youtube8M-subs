the new battery in what I've got to do

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.420 
the new battery in what I've got to do
now<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.280> reassemble<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> unit<00:01:46.100> I'm<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
now is reassemble the unit I'm going to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.030 
now is reassemble the unit I'm going to
first<00:01:47.729> glue<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.689> new<00:01:48.960> battery<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.530> place<00:01:49.560> with

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
first glue the new battery in place with

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.120 
first glue the new battery in place with
a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.340> bit<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.579> clear<00:01:51.649> contact<00:01:52.649> adhesive

a little bit of clear contact adhesive

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.490 
a little bit of clear contact adhesive
so<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.729> doesn't<00:01:53.970> fall<00:01:54.329> out<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.780> very

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so that it doesn't fall out it's very

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.120 
so that it doesn't fall out it's very
difficult<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.040> reassemble<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.700> otherwise<00:01:57.360> and

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
difficult to reassemble it otherwise and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.060 
difficult to reassemble it otherwise and
