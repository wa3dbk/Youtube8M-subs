00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello friends we have a question 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.769
 quite interesting 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:19.860
 do immigrants change names in connected 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:24.000
 States, and I must say that sometimes they change 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.060
 and sometimes do not change it depends here that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.440
 cultures from which these immigrants 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.730
 come here for example from india people they 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:39.140
 very holding on to their names i think that 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.929
 in the name there is a lot that is important with 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.300
 religious point of view and they they 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.309
 it does not change 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 I know absolutely nothing about it 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.629
 buddhism i can say that in judaism 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 the name plays a fundamental role therefore 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.999
 not always people want to change names but in 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.679
 the other side is 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:04.050
 counter tendency you come to 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.899
 another country you want to you 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.719
 it is more convenient for people who are with 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.810
 you have a deal that they were more comfortable 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:15.750
 so there is one trend there is another 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.979
 then there are people from china 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.039
 come from vietnam 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.259
 they are happy to change their names and have 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.590
 a lot of funny stories on this topic 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.049
 I remember 13 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.679
 we have earned a lot of settings 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.960
 years among the mexicans and it happened 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:37.009
 that when he obtained citizenship through 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.780
 20 years decided to get citizenship and him 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.850
 they said it was a good time to 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.280
 to change because it is not necessary to court 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.500
 walk there and the court decision then grandfather 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.109
 began to implement but just here right in 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.729
 the process is really the most 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.859
 the best time to change games 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.990
 that's when you get civil 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.729
 but he liked the idea could this be 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.579
 how everyone liked him and he is there 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.939
 turned out to be sante hanza forests or there type 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.920
 That neither was the Spanish Palatin script 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.810
 because he was in this environment therefore 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.790
 people change names easily 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:16.030
 in addition there is another name you can 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.230
 if you bathe Alice, that is, well, like 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.260
 substitute such when you can have 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.110
 a dozen Ilyas that is also known 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.260
 how are we going to say misha tailors 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.980
 known as michael there tailors 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.350
 known as mikel portnova fillet the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.180
 still something else there 10 all sorts of names and i 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.010
 I can in one place so another place so 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.769
 and that's fine that is when you 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.069
 fill out all forms of application there and 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.560
 so on they say and come on come on as 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.049
 you are there so well according to the documents you 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.299
 like this and give all your own or 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.760
 under which you could go there 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.349
 know there somewhere there and there and this 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.419
 ok guy caressed the apartment 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.450
 filmed her business card was written RPC 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.280
 mind and wish offset so name that I

 namaz attempts called no no simple 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.349
 cool and here I am writing on the wings 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.540
 I'm so in this sense, the relationship 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.069
 very light and free ie you 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.700
 can cut write down your name 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.760
 John Smith 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.840
 and when they give you a job offer 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.560
 and you will fill 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.269
 really form where you check 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.489
 will be driven there write all that is 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:27.620
 then write there also 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.720
 but he's with john smith please here but people 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.469
 many people like me just to 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.930
 It is convenient to do this. There are times when 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.909
 people had been times when 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.430
 people had to change star even 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.560
 creeds so that it is more convenient 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.000
 It was now let's say there the Germans in Russia there 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.610
 took Orthodoxy 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.969
 and were before this Lutherans there and someone 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.489
 they were still there or let's say dad Carl 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:55.579
 Marx when Carl Marx was three years old 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.739
 and from the birth of Karl Marx his name was 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.680
 mordechai but when dad 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.510
 when mars was three years old dad being 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.730
 as a lawyer, he fought for German 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.950
 clientele and he so wanted to somehow 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.969
 sound like that more well not only sound 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.340
 but also to communicate and 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.019
 and here he is he he accepted 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.630
 Christianity and here it is accordingly there 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.470
 mordechai became carl and for life 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.410
 remained anti-Semite delirium 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.030
 had time to get so close now 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.890
 easier now do not need to change for 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.020
 Confession can be and do not have a 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.510
 just change them if you 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.940
 but do not want to not that it somehow 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.300
 fundamentally influenced something ie 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.310
 by documents you can be anyone a 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.440
 there somewhere here on the surface you can 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.370
 to have there several different names i would 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.370
 It is a measure for the Spaniards give Michel 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.110
 not for anyone 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.110
 for the Germans and so on clean
