00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
philosophy and so I was trying to think

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380 
philosophy and so I was trying to think
of<00:00:25.619> ways<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.369> explaining<00:00:26.880> different

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
of ways of explaining different

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.759 
of ways of explaining different
philosophical<00:00:27.599> issues<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> much<00:00:28.740> easier

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
philosophical issues in a much easier

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.730 
philosophical issues in a much easier
way<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.490> understand<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> other<00:00:31.439> day<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
way to understand and the other day I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.010 
way to understand and the other day I
was<00:00:31.859> thinking<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.430> could<00:00:32.550> use<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
was thinking that I could use the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.020 
was thinking that I could use the
mechanics<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.350> objects<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> Minecraft

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
mechanics and objects in the Minecraft

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.530 
mechanics and objects in the Minecraft
world<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:37.969> simplify<00:00:38.969> certain<00:00:39.360> philosophical

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
world to simplify certain philosophical

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.750 
world to simplify certain philosophical
issues<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.290> at<00:00:40.379> least<00:00:40.559> give<00:00:41.930> analogies<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
issues or at least give analogies to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.250 
issues or at least give analogies to
different<00:00:44.760> philosophical<00:00:45.030> theories<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
different philosophical theories and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.970 
different philosophical theories and
positions<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.059> I'm<00:00:49.020> hoping<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.530> create

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
positions and so I'm hoping to create

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.740 
positions and so I'm hoping to create
you<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.280> make<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.730> into<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> series<00:00:51.449> with

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you know make this into a series with

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
you know make this into a series with

see anything but the wall in front of me
and<00:03:15.709> even<00:03:16.709> though<00:03:16.830> there<00:03:16.950> aren't<00:03:17.040> any<00:03:17.160> shadows

that<00:03:19.709> netherrack<00:03:20.130> around<00:03:20.519> oh<00:03:21.650> man<00:03:22.700> should

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
that netherrack around oh man should

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.650 
that netherrack around oh man should
probably<00:03:23.970> get<00:03:24.030> myself<00:03:24.209> out<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> situation

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
probably get myself out of the situation

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.039 
probably get myself out of the situation
before<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.560> continue<00:03:25.739> telling<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.459> story

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:37.660 

this<00:03:31.049> might<00:03:31.260> take<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.470> while

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.830 

whew<00:03:38.270> I'm<00:03:38.990> glad<00:03:39.050> I<00:03:39.260> got<00:03:39.500> out<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.830> that<00:03:39.980> obsidian

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
whew I'm glad I got out of that obsidian

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.240 
whew I'm glad I got out of that obsidian
well<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.050> guess<00:03:42.319> we<00:03:42.440> can<00:03:42.560> continue<00:03:42.890> our<00:03:42.920> story

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
well I guess we can continue our story

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.850 
well I guess we can continue our story
now<00:03:43.810> consider<00:03:44.810> what<00:03:44.989> would<00:03:45.020> happen<00:03:45.140> if<00:03:45.590> one<00:03:45.709> of

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
now consider what would happen if one of

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.440 
now consider what would happen if one of
the<00:03:45.950> prisoners<00:03:46.130> escaped<00:03:46.700> from<00:03:46.849> his<00:03:47.000> chains<00:03:47.300> in

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
the prisoners escaped from his chains in

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.270 
the prisoners escaped from his chains in
the<00:03:47.480> cave<00:03:47.750> just<00:03:48.500> like<00:03:48.620> I<00:03:48.770> did<00:03:48.830> from<00:03:49.160> the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
the cave just like I did from the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.330 
the cave just like I did from the
obsidian<00:03:49.730> chair<00:03:50.110> all<00:03:51.110> he<00:03:51.170> would<00:03:51.590> know<00:03:51.800> is<00:03:52.190> what

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
obsidian chair all he would know is what

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.130 
obsidian chair all he would know is what
he<00:03:52.400> experienced<00:03:53.239> in<00:03:53.330> his<00:03:53.480> position<00:03:53.959> in<00:03:54.050> the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
he experienced in his position in the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.220 
he experienced in his position in the
cave<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.790> would<00:03:55.910> be<00:03:56.030> extremely<00:03:56.239> jarring<00:03:57.110> to

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
cave so it would be extremely jarring to

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.800 
cave so it would be extremely jarring to
turn<00:03:57.500> around<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:58.310> see<00:03:58.790> other<00:03:58.910> people<00:04:01.720> even<00:04:02.720> if

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
turn around and see other people even if

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.420 
turn around and see other people even if
those<00:04:02.959> people<00:04:03.319> had<00:04:03.470> made<00:04:03.650> sounds<00:04:04.130> while<00:04:04.310> the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
those people had made sounds while the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.670 
those people had made sounds while the
man<00:04:04.580> was<00:04:04.790> chained<00:04:05.060> up<00:04:05.239> he<00:04:05.930> wouldn't<00:04:06.200> know<00:04:06.380> the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
man was chained up he wouldn't know the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.430 
man was chained up he wouldn't know the
sounds<00:04:07.010> came<00:04:07.190> from<00:04:07.250> his<00:04:07.700> neighbors<00:04:08.260> he<00:04:09.260> might

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
sounds came from his neighbors he might

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.410 
sounds came from his neighbors he might
even<00:04:09.560> think<00:04:09.830> that<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.160> sounds<00:04:10.700> were<00:04:11.360> coming

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
even think that the sounds were coming

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.259 
even think that the sounds were coming
from<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.989> shadows<00:04:12.350> on<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.530> wall<00:04:12.800> or<00:04:13.310> in<00:04:14.150> my

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
from the shadows on the wall or in my

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.969 
from the shadows on the wall or in my
case<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.900> nether<00:04:15.319> rack<00:04:15.530> in<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.950> wall<00:04:17.979> now

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
case the nether rack in the wall now

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.039 
case the nether rack in the wall now
imagine<00:04:19.190> how<00:04:19.549> painful<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:20.299> would<00:04:20.389> be<00:04:20.600> for<00:04:20.930> him

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
imagine how painful it would be for him

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.830 
imagine how painful it would be for him
to<00:04:21.200> leave<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.620> cave<00:04:22.180> his<00:04:23.180> body<00:04:23.479> has<00:04:23.690> been

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
to leave the cave his body has been

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.840 
to leave the cave his body has been
chained<00:04:24.139> up<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.590> he<00:04:24.710> has<00:04:24.830> had<00:04:24.979> practically<00:04:25.760> no

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
chained up and he has had practically no

chained up and he has had practically no
movement<00:04:26.630> his<00:04:26.750> entire<00:04:27.080> life<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:28.340> if<00:04:28.669> he<00:04:28.910> could

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
movement his entire life so if he could

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.450 
movement his entire life so if he could
actually<00:04:29.419> walk<00:04:29.810> out<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.380> cave<00:04:30.620> it<00:04:30.979> must

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
actually walk out of the cave it must

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.659 
actually walk out of the cave it must
have<00:04:31.520> been<00:04:31.669> extremely<00:04:32.060> painful<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:33.669> turning

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
have been extremely painful and turning

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.060 
have been extremely painful and turning
around<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:35.600> seeing<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.110> fire<00:04:36.380> would<00:04:37.010> be

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
around and seeing the fire would be

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.330 
around and seeing the fire would be
blinding<00:04:37.760> after<00:04:38.750> all<00:04:38.900> his<00:04:39.139> eyes<00:04:39.440> are<00:04:39.740> adjusted

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
blinding after all his eyes are adjusted

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.029 
blinding after all his eyes are adjusted
to<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.330> lights<00:04:41.600> that<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.229> fire<00:04:42.410> casts<00:04:42.800> on<00:04:42.890> the

wall to the very dim light so take a

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.810 
wall to the very dim light so take a
long<00:04:47.630> time<00:04:47.900> for<00:04:47.960> him<00:04:48.200> to<00:04:48.289> adjust<00:04:48.740> as<00:04:49.070> he<00:04:49.580> walks

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820
