00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.430
 yes 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.600
 or not 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.830
 hello guys and girls to remove but indar 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:24.180
 in a new video of a review of a 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:27.150
 box we do not say good the case is that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:34.730
 we are as I have seen it at first 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.730
 call no club no and good as such says 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.860
 disappears in the surface cubes 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.130
 as you are seeing but you are going to like 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.150
 a camera that you notice 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.750
 here for example as you are seeing no 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.820
 exists or does not exist are not the typical 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.020
 small squares as you can see behind there is a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.630
 mound 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.490
 there are no typical squares of 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.260
 minecraft but there is this kind 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.260
 of mound of the surface 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.259
 the truth is that it is quite 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 interesting me when I saw it I do not know she 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.100
 It caught my attention and I hope 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.850
 that also because it is that it is 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.090
 quite curious so long we are 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.820
 playing minecraft I imagined it then 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.909
 without Cuban and once the truth songs 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.730
 It is that the look is quite rare 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.250
 male to face 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:36.410
 It's weird but at the same time it's cool 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.320
 although it loses a little the essence of what 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.290
 what's in my kraft but the reality that 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.920
 it's pretty good it's pretty good 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.700
 This only occurs on the surface since 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.120
 if we finish we do not grow up like this 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.890
 tunnels form or anything like that for 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.320
 example that only happens on the surface 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.960
 this square has been deformed but one 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.300
 Once we go deeper into the earth 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.300
 as you see the typical and normal minecraft 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.229
 and what I liked was that they stayed 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.090
 so look for example I remove this and it 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.629
 shape 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.629
 here 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.200
 see what is creating me 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.160
 well, it can work in plan or plan 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.980
 if you dig down 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.080
 It is like the mounds so 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.880
 they have changed without form is quite 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.110
 cool good this is beautiful does not have 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.630
 more effect simply and I put it because 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.700
 it caught my attention and I 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.010
 It seems pretty funny 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.660
 we go funny curious not being 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.990
 always accustomed to the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.350
 typical cubes of maika although I feel 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.540
 say it but I would not put this love on 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.430
 a series I like the essence of 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.930
 Marica for that 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.090
 a greeting likes I liked and nothing 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.240
 subscribe if you want more mods up 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.240
 then 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.500
 why
