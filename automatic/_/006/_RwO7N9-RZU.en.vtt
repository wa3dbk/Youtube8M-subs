changing<00:03:40.400> lives<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:41.060> know<00:03:41.209> I<00:03:41.239> mean<00:03:41.690> it's<00:03:42.049> just

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
changing lives you know I mean it's just

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.020 
changing lives you know I mean it's just
pretty<00:03:42.650> amazing<00:03:43.250> what<00:03:43.430> happens<00:03:43.579> when<00:03:43.910> you

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
pretty amazing what happens when you

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.170 
pretty amazing what happens when you
start<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.510> cleanse<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.620> body<00:03:45.920> eat<00:03:46.850> these

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
start to cleanse the body eat these

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.569 
start to cleanse the body eat these
light<00:03:47.540> fresh<00:03:48.079> easily<00:03:48.620> digestible<00:03:49.220> foods

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
light fresh easily digestible foods

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.360 
light fresh easily digestible foods
which<00:03:49.850> don't<00:03:50.120> bog<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.810> down<00:03:51.130> food<00:03:52.130> without

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
which don't bog you down food without

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.390 
which don't bog you down food without
enzymes<00:03:52.730> in

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
enzymes in

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.520 
enzymes in
it's<00:03:54.000> very<00:03:54.209> taxing<00:03:54.629> on<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> human<00:03:55.319> organism

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
it's very taxing on the human organism

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.460 
it's very taxing on the human organism
because<00:03:56.040> if<00:03:56.189> your<00:03:56.310> food<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.760> got<00:03:56.879> enzymes

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
because if your food and got enzymes

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.190 
because if your food and got enzymes
then<00:03:58.549> your<00:03:59.549> body<00:03:59.760> has<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.000> take<00:04:00.269> all<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.540> its

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
then your body has to take all of its

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.170 
then your body has to take all of its
metabolic<00:04:01.680> enzymes<00:04:02.189> which<00:04:02.670> would<00:04:02.849> be<00:04:02.970> used

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
metabolic enzymes which would be used

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.610 
metabolic enzymes which would be used
for<00:04:03.390> brain<00:04:03.629> function<00:04:03.829> heart<00:04:04.829> function

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
for brain function heart function

all<00:04:14.879> those<00:04:15.150> metabolic<00:04:15.840> enzymes<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.799> would

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
all those metabolic enzymes that would

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.349 
all those metabolic enzymes that would
be<00:04:17.100> used<00:04:17.310> for<00:04:17.489> all<00:04:17.639> those<00:04:17.789> metabolic

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359

be used for all those metabolic
processes<00:04:18.930> are<00:04:19.560> used<00:04:19.829> up<00:04:20.039> to<00:04:20.220> digest<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.150> food

processes are used up to digest the food

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.409 
processes are used up to digest the food
that's<00:04:22.560> cooked<00:04:22.949> because<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.729> cooked<00:04:24.030> all<00:04:24.240> the

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
that's cooked because you cooked all the

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.750 
that's cooked because you cooked all the
enzymes<00:04:24.810> out<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.259> the<00:04:25.350> food<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.889> that<00:04:26.430> food

enzymes out of the food that that food

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.810 
enzymes out of the food that that food
would<00:04:27.330> utilize<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.440> break<00:04:28.680> itself<00:04:29.160> down<00:04:29.490> and

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
would utilize to break itself down and

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.870 
would utilize to break itself down and
be<00:04:30.330> a<00:04:30.360> self<00:04:30.840> break<00:04:31.229> down<00:04:31.470> mechanism<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:32.639> cook

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
be a self break down mechanism you cook

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.570 
be a self break down mechanism you cook

all the water out with high heat fry it
up<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.030> get<00:04:36.150> those<00:04:36.330> oils<00:04:36.780> I'm<00:04:37.199> telling<00:04:37.470> you

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
up and get those oils I'm telling you

up and get those oils I'm telling you
raw<00:04:37.889> foods<00:04:38.220> is<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.550> way<00:04:38.699> to<00:04:38.760> go<00:04:39.000> I've<00:04:39.449> been

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
raw foods is the way to go I've been

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.050
