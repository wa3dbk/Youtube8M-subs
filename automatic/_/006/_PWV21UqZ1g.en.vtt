just<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> phone<00:01:40.640> seems<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.850> made<00:01:42.060> our

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
just like the phone seems we made our

just like the phone seems we made our
faux<00:01:42.509> leather<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.009> strangely<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.189> would

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
faux leather and strangely you would

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280 
faux leather and strangely you would
have<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.579> stick<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.090> onto<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.689> back<00:01:46.020> cover

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
which is not something idea we would

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.660 
which is not something idea we would
have<00:01:48.899> liked<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.470> separate<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.460> cover
