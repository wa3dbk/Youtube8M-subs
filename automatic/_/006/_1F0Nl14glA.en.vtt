 premiere of our new website you know 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.969
 that a week ago we started the draw 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.400
 to launch our new website 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.380
 of sandboxing dotcom and as you know the 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.850
 prizes were a smartphone and a smart 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.869
 works the truth that the prize is not 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.029
 not bad at all, the draw is 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.619
 international is to say of course that 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.029
 to participate in the raffle will have to 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.929
 send a tweet you have to follow me on 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.119
 twitter 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.950
 be subscribed to our channel and 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.050
 write a tweet that he had to have 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.489
 this hashtag and I also had to have 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.500
 Also a mention to my account 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.210
 twitter and the url is what we will have in 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.580
 account now when we check who is 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.500
 the winner is to say that here this page 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.600
 web what it does is collect all the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.070
 tweets that by the way compiles a tweet 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.350
 per user I know that even if you have 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.550
 put 20 times you will tell one what 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.080
 I say because there are many users that 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.580
 trying to get more more 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.100
 chances of winning have put 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.660
 several times and it's useless now 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.010
 I marked it here that only a tweet 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.020
 per user and therefore will not serve 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.160
 not in fact the people who have 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.950
 been very heavy and they have put 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.420
 for several days 15 to 20 tweets the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.770
 I have blocked so they are 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.750
 disqualified 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.640
 saying this we are going to do this and as 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.700
 I say this is a compilation of all 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.979
 the valid tweets and will get one at 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.390
 chance so we give nothing here and you will see 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.579
 that here is loading all the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.009
 tweets takes a little bit because they are a 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.100
 pile and once you finish you will take one to 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.100
 random 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.439
 and the winner of the draw is Ã¡lvaro saw if 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.990

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.399
 has left dimension that is the link 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.320

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.640
 as I see it also follows me on twitter and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.950
 we only need to check that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.570
