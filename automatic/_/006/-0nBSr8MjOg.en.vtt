see I'm not good with cameras um yeah as
far<00:03:56.379> as<00:03:56.410> tangling<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.579> don't<00:03:57.790> get<00:03:57.940> any<00:03:58.090> tangling

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
far as tangling I don't get any tangling

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.740 
far as tangling I don't get any tangling
except<00:03:59.410> for<00:03:59.680> right<00:04:00.040> back<00:04:00.250> here<00:04:00.579> where<00:04:00.819> but<00:04:01.690> I

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
except for right back here where but I

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.619 
except for right back here where but I
think<00:04:01.930> that's<00:04:02.019> because<00:04:02.139> I<00:04:02.940> doubled<00:04:03.940> my<00:04:04.000> 24

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
think that's because I doubled my 24

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.509 
think that's because I doubled my 24
inch<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.019> I'm<00:04:05.139> guessing<00:04:05.349> this<00:04:05.620> word<00:04:05.919> it's

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
inch so I'm guessing this word it's

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.430 
inch so I'm guessing this word it's
coming<00:04:06.819> from<00:04:06.940> but<00:04:07.239> it's<00:04:07.480> nothing<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:08.169> mean

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
coming from but it's nothing I mean

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.339 
coming from but it's nothing I mean
there's<00:04:09.190> nothing<00:04:09.400> big<00:04:09.819> or<00:04:10.090> it's<00:04:10.989> nowhere<00:04:11.319> near

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
there's nothing big or it's nowhere near

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.020 
there's nothing big or it's nowhere near
like<00:04:11.709> Manning<00:04:12.310> or<00:04:12.430> nothing

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030

top is I just take the color line and I

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.840 
top is I just take the color line and I
I<00:04:45.910> started<00:04:46.630> right<00:04:46.810> here<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.490> rolled<00:04:48.730> it

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
I started right here and I rolled it

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.760 
I started right here and I rolled it
around<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.450> leave<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:50.020> on<00:04:50.080> there<00:04:50.230> for<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.530> five

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
around I leave it on there for like five

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.380 
around I leave it on there for like five
seconds<00:04:51.190> just<00:04:51.310> like<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.730> could<00:04:51.940> create<00:04:52.240> the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
seconds just like it could create the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.900 
seconds just like it could create the
same<00:04:52.570> kind<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:52.930> way<00:04:53.050> that's<00:04:53.260> in<00:04:53.380> my<00:04:53.470> hair<00:04:53.680> just

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
same kind of way that's in my hair just

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.400 
same kind of way that's in my hair just
brush<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:54.940> down<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.570> that's<00:04:55.810> how<00:04:55.960> i<00:04:55.990> blended

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
brush it down and that's how i blended

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.450 
brush it down and that's how i blended
um<00:04:56.590> for<00:04:57.460> my<00:04:57.610> leave<00:04:57.850> out<00:04:58.890> instead<00:04:59.890> of<00:04:59.950> making<00:05:00.340> it

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
um for my leave out instead of making it

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.150 
um for my leave out instead of making it
a<00:05:00.610> u-shape<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.419> time<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.780> made<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:01.990> v-shape<00:05:02.470> so

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
a u-shape this time I made a v-shape so

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.450 
a u-shape this time I made a v-shape so
it<00:05:03.310> comes<00:05:03.580> so<00:05:04.210> my<00:05:04.300> leave<00:05:04.479> out<00:05:04.630> is<00:05:04.810> like<00:05:04.840> this

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
it comes so my leave out is like this

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.610 
it comes so my leave out is like this
because<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:07.120> find<00:05:07.720> that<00:05:07.930> when<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.320> have<00:05:08.590> a

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
because I find that when you have a

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.659 
because I find that when you have a
v-shape<00:05:09.460> it's<00:05:10.090> better<00:05:10.450> um<00:05:10.860> when<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.100> comes

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
v-shape it's better um when it comes

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.330 
v-shape it's better um when it comes
attracts<00:05:13.090> better<00:05:13.389> back<00:05:13.630> here<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.500> me<00:05:14.680> so

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
attracts better back here to me so

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.990 
attracts better back here to me so
that's<00:05:15.550> why<00:05:15.729> I<00:05:15.790> do<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.330> v-shape<00:05:16.690> and<00:05:17.640> yes<00:05:18.640> so

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
that's why I do the v-shape and yes so

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.880 
that's why I do the v-shape and yes so
this<00:05:19.210> is<00:05:19.240> all<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:20.110> hair<00:05:20.290> pull<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.830> front

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
this is all the hair pull to the front

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.280 
this is all the hair pull to the front
at<00:05:21.669> first<00:05:22.030> I<00:05:22.210> was<00:05:22.330> like<00:05:22.360> dang<00:05:22.720> four<00:05:23.020> bundles

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
at first I was like dang four bundles

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.840 
at first I was like dang four bundles
I'm<00:05:23.560> not<00:05:23.710> even<00:05:23.919> gonna<00:05:24.070> do<00:05:24.280> it<00:05:24.400> but<00:05:24.490> since<00:05:24.700> this

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
I'm not even gonna do it but since this

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.200
