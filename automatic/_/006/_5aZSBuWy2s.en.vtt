00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
and then going around the cuticle line

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.050 
and then going around the cuticle line
it<00:01:42.079> may<00:01:42.409> take<00:01:42.590> some<00:01:42.740> time<00:01:42.979> but<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.609> can<00:01:43.819> get<00:01:43.969> it

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
it may take some time but you can get it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.839 
it may take some time but you can get it
perfect<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.630> next<00:01:45.459> it<00:01:46.459> went<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.729> little

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:46.849 
perfect and next it went a little

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:52.990 
perfect and next it went a little
something<00:01:47.060> like<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:50.590> but<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:52.250> didn't<00:01:52.729> like<00:01:52.819> it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
something like this but I didn't like it

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.389 
something like this but I didn't like it
so<00:01:55.899> so<00:01:56.899> basically<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.319> just<00:01:57.590> went<00:01:58.219> back<00:01:58.369> to
