the kit comes with two perfectly sized
rings<00:00:17.990> just<00:00:18.380> for<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:18.680> holes<00:00:18.860> and<00:00:19.040> they<00:00:19.130> are

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
rings just for the holes and they are

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.850 
rings just for the holes and they are
very<00:00:19.490> easy<00:00:19.790> to<00:00:20.029> operate<00:00:20.410> you<00:00:21.410> just<00:00:21.590> kinda<00:00:21.770> have

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
very easy to operate you just kinda have

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.500 
very easy to operate you just kinda have
to<00:00:21.920> rotate<00:00:22.340> them<00:00:22.700> to<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.910> side

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
to rotate them to the side

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.300 
to rotate them to the side
rotate<00:00:24.260> them<00:00:24.380> a<00:00:24.440> little<00:00:24.680> bit<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:24.950> off<00:00:25.040> of<00:00:25.070> them

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
rotate them a little bit and off of them

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.859 
rotate them a little bit and off of them
and<00:00:25.610> you<00:00:25.730> want<00:00:25.850> to<00:00:25.970> open<00:00:26.119> it<00:00:26.330> all<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.750> way

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
and you want to open it all the way

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.090 
and you want to open it all the way
that's<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.680> way<00:00:27.800> it<00:00:27.920> makes<00:00:28.100> a<00:00:28.340> lazy<00:00:28.580> W<00:00:29.330> shape

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
that's the way it makes a lazy W shape

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.920 
that's the way it makes a lazy W shape
and<00:00:31.100> we're<00:00:31.850> going<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.059> insert<00:00:32.330> them<00:00:32.540> from<00:00:32.780> the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
and we're going to insert them from the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.210 
and we're going to insert them from the
back<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.350> front<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:33.800> there<00:00:33.890> is<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.040> little

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
back to the front and there is a little

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.479 
back to the front and there is a little
trick<00:00:34.489> in<00:00:34.640> doing<00:00:34.940> this<00:00:35.830> place<00:00:36.830> one<00:00:37.100> side<00:00:37.370> of

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
trick in doing this place one side of

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.820 
trick in doing this place one side of
the<00:00:37.610> ring<00:00:37.820> through<00:00:38.120> either<00:00:38.300> hole<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.440> rotate

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
the ring through either hole and rotate

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.280 
the ring through either hole and rotate
it<00:00:39.980> all<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.699> way<00:00:40.850> until<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.570> hinge<00:00:41.989> is

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
it all the way until the hinge is

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.590 
it all the way until the hinge is
touching<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.770> board<00:00:42.980> then<00:00:43.970> from<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:44.390> back

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
touching the board then from the back

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.170 
touching the board then from the back
and<00:00:44.900> from<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.170> front<00:00:45.559> close<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.309> ring<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.059> as

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
and from the front close the ring and as

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.149 
and from the front close the ring and as
you're<00:00:47.510> closing<00:00:47.839> it<00:00:48.140> you'll<00:00:48.650> see<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.040> other

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
you're closing it you'll see the other

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.360 
you're closing it you'll see the other
side<00:00:49.489> come<00:00:49.820> right<00:00:50.089> through<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.510> hole<00:00:51.370> and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
side come right through the hole and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.130 
side come right through the hole and
under<00:00:52.909> the<00:00:53.000> front<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:53.600> can<00:00:53.720> see<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.960> rings

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
under the front you can see the rings

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.990 
under the front you can see the rings
are<00:00:54.350> through<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.979> then<00:00:55.400> just<00:00:55.610> go<00:00:55.699> ahead<00:00:55.879> and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
are through and then just go ahead and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.880 
are through and then just go ahead and
close<00:00:56.120> them<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.629> again<00:00:57.170> it<00:00:57.260> might<00:00:57.379> be<00:00:57.530> easier

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
close them and again it might be easier

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.619 
close them and again it might be easier
with<00:00:58.070> one<00:00:58.280> hand<00:00:58.550> in<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.790> back<00:00:58.970> and<00:00:59.269> one<00:00:59.390> hand

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.960 
with one hand in the back and one hand
in<00:00:59.780> the<00:00:59.839> front<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.290> close<00:01:00.500> them<00:01:00.769> tight<00:01:01.010> okay

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
in the front to close them tight okay

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.369 
in the front to close them tight okay

showing<00:01:47.810> here<00:01:48.140> if<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.350> look<00:01:48.530> closely<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.429> I

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
showing here if you look closely and I

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.919 
showing here if you look closely and I
don't<00:01:49.549> know<00:01:49.759> if<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:49.939> can<00:01:50.090> see<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.390> really<00:01:50.479> well

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
don't know if you can see it really well

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.109 
don't know if you can see it really well
but<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.289> should<00:01:51.469> have<00:01:51.679> a<00:01:51.920> square<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.549> perfect

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
but you should have a square a perfect

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.819 
but you should have a square a perfect
square<00:01:53.359> down<00:01:53.719> in<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:53.960> corner<00:01:54.259> if<00:01:54.439> you<00:01:54.469> don't

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
square down in the corner if you don't

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.349 
square down in the corner if you don't
have<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> perfect<00:01:55.369> square<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:55.939> means<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.240> one

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
have a perfect square it means that one

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.330 
have a perfect square it means that one
of<00:01:56.390> your<00:01:56.539> two<00:01:56.719> measurements<00:01:57.259> are<00:01:57.350> off<00:01:57.469> unless

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
of your two measurements are off unless

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.620 
of your two measurements are off unless
both<00:01:58.609> your<00:01:58.820> measurements<00:01:59.240> are<00:01:59.299> off<00:01:59.420> by<00:01:59.570> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
both your measurements are off by the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.480 
both your measurements are off by the
same<00:01:59.899> amount

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
same amount

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.649 
same amount
and<00:02:01.490> then<00:02:01.609> I<00:02:01.640> can't<00:02:01.939> really<00:02:02.149> help<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.479> there

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
and then I can't really help you there

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.929 
and then I can't really help you there
well<00:02:03.590> we'll<00:02:03.710> just<00:02:03.740> continue<00:02:04.070> on<00:02:04.340> knowing<00:02:04.789> that

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
well we'll just continue on knowing that

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.510 
well we'll just continue on knowing that
you've<00:02:05.060> made<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> perfect<00:02:05.749> measurement<00:02:06.520> now

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
you've made a perfect measurement now

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.800 
you've made a perfect measurement now
we're<00:02:07.640> going<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.789> pull<00:02:07.969> out<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.300> last<00:02:08.450> two

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
we're going to pull out the last two

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.200 
we're going to pull out the last two
pieces<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.740> our<00:02:09.860> bookbinding<00:02:10.429> board<00:02:10.729> you'll

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
pieces of our bookbinding board you'll

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.350 
pieces of our bookbinding board you'll
notice<00:02:11.510> one<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:12.080> medium<00:02:12.470> one<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:13.010> small<00:02:13.360> or

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
notice one is medium one is small or

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.750 
notice one is medium one is small or
large<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.260> small<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:16.160> we're<00:02:16.280> going<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.520> place

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
large and small and we're going to place

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.260 
large and small and we're going to place
them<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.930> book<00:02:18.440> or<00:02:18.710> on<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.130> cover<00:02:19.940> stack

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
them on the book or on the cover stack

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.140 
them on the book or on the cover stack
so<00:02:21.110> that's<00:02:21.350> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
so that's the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.539 
so that's the
left-hand<00:02:22.599> corner<00:02:23.049> of<00:02:23.260> your<00:02:24.010> book<00:02:24.250> board

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
left-hand corner of your book board

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.179 
left-hand corner of your book board
nests<00:02:25.239> right<00:02:25.510> into<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.019> corner<00:02:26.349> of<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> lines

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
nests right into the corner of the lines

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.770 
nests right into the corner of the lines
that<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:27.519> just<00:02:27.730> drew<00:02:27.939> right<00:02:28.360> into<00:02:28.659> the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
that we just drew right into the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.050 
that we just drew right into the
intersection<00:02:29.409> there<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.489> we'll<00:02:30.640> glue<00:02:30.879> that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
intersection there and we'll glue that

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.119 
intersection there and we'll glue that
in<00:02:31.239> place<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.780> then<00:02:32.319> this<00:02:32.560> measurement<00:02:33.069> is

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
in place and then this measurement is

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.100 
in place and then this measurement is
the<00:02:33.280> most<00:02:33.489> important<00:02:34.030> one<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.390> went<00:02:34.930> through

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
the most important one you went through

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.770 
the most important one you went through
a<00:02:35.170> smaller<00:02:35.590> piece<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.189> be<00:02:36.310> mounted<00:02:36.700> one<00:02:37.420> half

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
a smaller piece to be mounted one half

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.640 
a smaller piece to be mounted one half
of<00:02:37.930> an<00:02:38.079> inch<00:02:38.319> above<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.780> larger<00:02:40.780> section<00:02:41.019> so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
of an inch above the larger section so

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.839 
of an inch above the larger section so
we're<00:02:41.799> gonna<00:02:41.890> go<00:02:42.069> ahead<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.430> measure<00:02:42.579> that

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
we're gonna go ahead and measure that

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.399 
we're gonna go ahead and measure that
and<00:02:43.000> easiest<00:02:43.239> way<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.450> do<00:02:43.659> that<00:02:43.689> again<00:02:44.200> with

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
and easiest way to do that again with

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.089 
and easiest way to do that again with
your<00:02:44.500> club<00:02:44.739> scrap<00:02:45.099> clear<00:02:45.730> gridded<00:02:46.090> ruler

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
your club scrap clear gridded ruler

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.009 
your club scrap clear gridded ruler
place<00:02:48.099> it<00:02:48.280> right<00:02:48.579> at<00:02:48.909> a<00:02:49.120> half<00:02:49.390> an<00:02:49.569> inch<00:02:49.810> above

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
place it right at a half an inch above

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.000 
place it right at a half an inch above
and<00:02:50.560> then<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.489> nest<00:02:52.230> your<00:02:53.230> top<00:02:53.470> board<00:02:53.769> right

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
and then just nest your top board right

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.170 
and then just nest your top board right
up<00:02:54.159> to<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.459> okay<00:02:56.639> you<00:02:57.639> should<00:02:57.819> have<00:02:57.970> something

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
up to it okay you should have something

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.729 
up to it okay you should have something
looks<00:02:58.420> just<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.079> let's<00:02:59.319> go<00:02:59.440> ahead<00:02:59.560> and

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
looks just like this let's go ahead and

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:00.569 
looks just like this let's go ahead and
glue<00:02:59.859> it<00:02:59.980> into<00:03:00.099> place

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
glue it into place

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.059 
glue it into place
okay<00:03:01.389> might<00:03:01.569> only<00:03:01.780> have<00:03:02.049> had<00:03:02.230> glued<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.920> book

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
okay might only have had glued the book

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.190 
okay might only have had glued the book
for<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.370> into<00:03:03.489> place<00:03:03.760> on<00:03:03.970> our<00:03:04.150> cover<00:03:04.389> stack<00:03:04.690> but

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
for it into place on our cover stack but

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.530 
for it into place on our cover stack but
I've<00:03:05.290> also<00:03:05.500> scored<00:03:06.159> it<00:03:06.340> turn<00:03:06.909> to<00:03:06.939> the<00:03:07.150> edges

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
I've also scored it turn to the edges

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.569 
I've also scored it turn to the edges
nip<00:03:07.930> them<00:03:08.139> and<00:03:08.349> glue<00:03:08.530> them<00:03:08.709> into<00:03:08.859> place<00:03:08.950> as<00:03:09.310> we

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
nip them and glue them into place as we

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.399 
nip them and glue them into place as we
had<00:03:09.760> done<00:03:09.939> on<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.420> front<00:03:10.629> of<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.870> podium<00:03:11.049> book

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
had done on the front of the podium book

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.229 
had done on the front of the podium book
standing<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:12.489> this<00:03:12.639> is<00:03:12.790> what<00:03:12.909> we<00:03:13.030> should<00:03:13.090> have

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
standing so this is what we should have

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.089 
standing so this is what we should have
at<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:13.989> point<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.379> don't<00:03:14.560> need<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.889> worry

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
at this point you don't need to worry

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.860 
at this point you don't need to worry
about<00:03:15.189> scoring<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:16.209> gutter<00:03:16.480> or<00:03:16.659> anything

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
about scoring in this gutter or anything

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.349 
about scoring in this gutter or anything
just<00:03:17.560> leave<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.829> just<00:03:17.859> as<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:19.090> we're<00:03:19.209> going

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
just leave it just as is and we're going

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.960 
just leave it just as is and we're going
to<00:03:19.480> put<00:03:19.689> the<00:03:19.780> front<00:03:20.019> cover<00:03:20.230> on<00:03:20.609> again<00:03:21.609> with<00:03:21.819> my

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
to put the front cover on again with my

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.789 
to put the front cover on again with my
man<00:03:22.180> hands<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.629> can<00:03:22.840> hold<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:23.139> while<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.319> spread

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
man hands I can hold it while I spread

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.920 
man hands I can hold it while I spread
the<00:03:23.920> glue<00:03:24.099> but<00:03:25.090> if<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.329> need<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.599> put<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.810> down

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.890 
sure that it's tacked down nice and
tight<00:05:01.949> we<00:05:02.220> can<00:05:02.370> start<00:05:02.639> exercising<00:05:03.449> that<00:05:03.570> hinge

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
tight we can start exercising that hinge

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.260 
tight we can start exercising that hinge
piece<00:05:04.199> and<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:05.070> do<00:05:05.220> that<00:05:05.460> we're<00:05:05.970> just<00:05:06.150> gonna

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
piece and to do that we're just gonna

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.960 
piece and to do that we're just gonna
take<00:05:06.539> it<00:05:06.599> and<00:05:06.840> bend<00:05:07.349> it<00:05:07.530> like<00:05:07.740> this<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:08.460> then

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
take it and bend it like this and then

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.640 
take it and bend it like this and then
go<00:05:09.120> back<00:05:09.330> with<00:05:09.510> our<00:05:09.630> hands<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.260> make<00:05:10.470> sure

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
go back with our hands and make sure

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.439 
go back with our hands and make sure
that<00:05:10.800> this<00:05:10.949> is<00:05:11.160> pressed<00:05:11.460> firmly<00:05:11.849> along<00:05:12.300> the

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
that this is pressed firmly along the

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.260 
that this is pressed firmly along the
seam<00:05:12.690> again<00:05:13.320> this<00:05:14.310> is<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.520> good<00:05:14.789> way<00:05:14.940> to<00:05:15.000> do<00:05:15.240> it

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
seam again this is a good way to do it

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.240 
seam again this is a good way to do it
and<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.539> reason<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.110> do<00:05:16.169> this<00:05:16.590> is<00:05:17.099> because

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
and the reason that I do this is because

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.580 
and the reason that I do this is because
you<00:05:17.460> really<00:05:17.910> have<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:18.330> manhandle<00:05:18.960> this<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.440> get

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
you really have to manhandle this to get

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.649 
you really have to manhandle this to get
it<00:05:19.710> to<00:05:19.740> lay<00:05:19.949> completely<00:05:20.220> flat<00:05:20.639> and<00:05:21.150> if<00:05:21.510> you're

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
it to lay completely flat and if you're
