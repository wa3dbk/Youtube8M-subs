okay<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.580> do<00:02:47.730> I'm<00:02:48.000> assuming<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:48.930> is

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
okay so what you do I'm assuming this is

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.600 
okay so what you do I'm assuming this is
what<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.440> instruction<00:02:49.980> said<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.370> we're<00:02:50.520> going

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
what the instruction said so we're going

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.690 
what the instruction said so we're going
to<00:02:50.670> leave<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.910> stuff<00:02:51.390> there<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:53.040> think<00:02:53.430> we

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
to leave that stuff there and I think we

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.230 
to leave that stuff there and I think we
go<00:02:53.940> over<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.590> little<00:02:55.830> restaurant<00:02:56.550> over
