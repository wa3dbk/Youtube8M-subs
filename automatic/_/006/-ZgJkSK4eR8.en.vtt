you<00:02:41.090> can<00:02:41.269> see<00:02:41.829> onboard<00:02:42.829> audio<00:02:43.099> that's<00:02:43.730> all

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
you can see onboard audio that's all

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:51.759 
you can see onboard audio that's all
there<00:02:47.200> other<00:02:48.200> than<00:02:48.439> that<00:02:50.379> there<00:02:51.379> isn't<00:02:51.709> a

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
there other than that there isn't a

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.979 
there other than that there isn't a
whole<00:02:51.799> lot<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:53.889> we<00:02:54.889> can<00:02:54.919> change<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:56.450> can<00:02:56.629> take

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
whole lot that we can change we can take

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:05.159 
whole lot that we can change we can take
a<00:02:57.019> look<00:02:57.319> at<00:02:57.819> so<00:02:58.819> that's<00:02:59.629> it<00:02:59.989> basically<00:03:00.669> so<00:03:03.700> but

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
a look at so that's it basically so but

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.330 
a look at so that's it basically so but
anyway<00:03:08.200> thanks<00:03:09.200> for<00:03:09.230> watching<00:03:09.739> once<00:03:09.980> again
