of the Year hazard know the reason why

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.560 
of the Year hazard know the reason why
he<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.470> expensive<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.250> because<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.270> bought

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
he was so expensive is because I bought

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.670 
he was so expensive is because I bought
him<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> couple<00:01:18.930> days<00:01:19.140> before<00:01:19.350> he<00:01:19.650> was

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
him a couple days before he was

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.950 
him a couple days before he was
rereleased<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.060> current<00:01:21.420> team<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.600 
rereleased in the current team of the
year<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:22.710> why<00:01:22.860> he<00:01:22.979> was<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
year so that's why he was going for that

Vincent<00:02:54.730> Kompany<00:02:54.880> now<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.180> wasn't<00:02:55.600> overly

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
Vincent Kompany now I wasn't overly

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.910 
Vincent Kompany now I wasn't overly
impressed<00:02:55.990> with<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> team<00:02:56.710> of<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.890> year

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
impressed with the team of the year

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.650 
impressed with the team of the year
Vincent<00:02:57.340> Kompany<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:58.000> be<00:02:58.240> honest<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.600> don't

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
Vincent Kompany I to be honest I don't

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.180 
Vincent Kompany I to be honest I don't
think<00:02:58.930> there's<00:02:59.080> much<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.380> difference<00:02:59.560> between

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
think there's much of difference between

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.160 
think there's much of difference between
his<00:03:00.370> non<00:03:00.580> informed<00:03:01.120> care<00:03:01.300> definitely<00:03:02.020> not

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
his non informed care definitely not

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.080 
his non informed care definitely not
worth<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.890> 200k<00:03:03.460> I<00:03:03.580> suppose<00:03:03.910> it<00:03:04.060> would

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
worth that the 200k I suppose it would

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.610 
worth that the 200k I suppose it would
cost<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.750> go<00:03:04.840> out<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.050> get<00:03:05.140> him<00:03:05.290> now<00:03:05.320> I

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
cost you to go out and get him now I

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.830 
cost you to go out and get him now I
would<00:03:06.370> definitely<00:03:06.490> recommend<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:07.240> gold<00:03:07.630> for

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
but other than that he's actually got

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.340 
but other than that he's actually got
good<00:03:18.760> dribbling<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.330> he's<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.630> great<00:03:19.930> defender

think he would have been more suited to

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.940 
think he would have been more suited to
be<00:03:25.420> in<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.570> left<00:03:25.780> winger<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.260> found<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.770> left

better options if you're looking for a

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.550 
better options if you're looking for a
bro<00:04:00.370> silver<00:04:00.760> at<00:04:00.970> right-sided<00:04:01.720> midfielder<00:04:01.870> and

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
bro silver at right-sided midfielder and

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.290 
bro silver at right-sided midfielder and
that<00:04:03.010> would<00:04:03.190> be<00:04:03.220> down<00:04:03.520> lineal<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.060> he<00:04:04.150> does

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
that would be down lineal and he does

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.300 
that would be down lineal and he does
have<00:04:04.450> five<00:04:04.690> star<00:04:04.960> skills<00:04:05.260> as<00:04:05.440> well<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.190> don't

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
have five star skills as well so I don't

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.830 
have five star skills as well so I don't
think<00:04:06.670> Michael<00:04:06.970> Netta<00:04:07.210> is<00:04:07.300> all<00:04:07.660> that

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
think Michael Netta is all that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.480 
think Michael Netta is all that
impressive<00:04:08.140> for<00:04:08.440> over<00:04:08.740> a<00:04:08.770> hundred<00:04:08.920> care<00:04:09.220> think

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
impressive for over a hundred care think

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.250 
impressive for over a hundred care think
he<00:04:09.580> is<00:04:09.670> definitely<00:04:09.910> at<00:04:10.210> not<00:04:10.780> worth<00:04:10.960> the<00:04:11.110> price

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
he is definitely at not worth the price

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.050 
he is definitely at not worth the price
but<00:04:11.500> diamonte<00:04:11.980> he<00:04:12.400> was<00:04:12.520> distinctively

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
but diamonte he was distinctively

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.730 
but diamonte he was distinctively
average<00:04:13.570> although<00:04:13.900> he<00:04:14.020> did<00:04:14.200> have<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.410> great

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.320 
average although he did have a great
free<00:04:15.010> kick<00:04:15.220> on<00:04:15.370> I'm<00:04:15.520> probably<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.970> best<00:04:16.150> free

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
free kick on I'm probably the best free

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
goals in 20 games and he urgently does

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.640

come<00:06:19.460> as<00:06:19.640> a<00:06:19.940> center<00:06:20.360> attack<00:06:20.630> amid<00:06:20.990> but<00:06:21.410> I<00:06:21.440> would

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
come as a center attack amid but I would

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.170 
come as a center attack amid but I would
convert<00:06:21.980> him<00:06:22.100> to<00:06:22.130> a<00:06:22.250> center<00:06:22.550> for<00:06:22.700> two<00:06:22.880> striker

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
convert him to a center for two striker

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.210 
convert him to a center for two striker
because<00:06:23.480> he<00:06:23.540> does<00:06:23.780> play<00:06:24.050> a<00:06:24.290> lot<00:06:24.830> better<00:06:24.980> there

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
because he does play a lot better there

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.310 
because he does play a lot better there
I<00:06:25.250> had<00:06:25.580> him<00:06:25.730> in<00:06:25.880> Assyria<00:06:26.360> silver<00:06:27.020> team<00:06:27.200> before

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
I had him in Assyria silver team before

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.110 
I had him in Assyria silver team before
and<00:06:27.710> he<00:06:27.770> didn't<00:06:28.070> play<00:06:28.160> all<00:06:28.340> that<00:06:28.520> well<00:06:28.580> at<00:06:29.060> a

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
and he didn't play all that well at a

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.300 
and he didn't play all that well at a
center<00:06:29.840> attack<00:06:30.020> amid<00:06:30.350> but<00:06:30.740> if<00:06:30.830> you<00:06:30.950> did<00:06:31.100> pass

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
center attack amid but if you did pass

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.770 
center attack amid but if you did pass
through<00:06:31.700> him<00:06:31.820> on<00:06:31.970> the<00:06:32.090> marketplace<00:06:32.480> and

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
through him on the marketplace and

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.270 
through him on the marketplace and
seeing<00:06:33.020> his<00:06:33.140> stats<00:06:33.380> you<00:06:33.530> wouldn't<00:06:33.860> rid<00:06:34.010> of<00:06:34.160> all

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280
