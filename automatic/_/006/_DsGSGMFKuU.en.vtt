Superman 64 has been the butt of
everyone's<00:05:33.030> joke<00:05:33.450> for<00:05:33.720> over<00:05:33.930> 15<00:05:34.440> years<00:05:34.470> now

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
everyone's joke for over 15 years now

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.370 
everyone's joke for over 15 years now
and<00:05:35.220> I<00:05:35.640> think<00:05:35.700> it's<00:05:36.210> do<00:05:36.420> a<00:05:36.450> little<00:05:36.720> credit<00:05:37.200> for

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
and I think it's do a little credit for

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.350 
and I think it's do a little credit for
all<00:05:37.890> the<00:05:38.070> laugh<00:05:38.310> that's<00:05:38.610> given<00:05:38.910> us<00:05:39.030> over<00:05:39.210> the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
all the laugh that's given us over the

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.240 
all the laugh that's given us over the
years<00:05:39.450> I<00:05:39.960> think<00:05:40.230> it's<00:05:40.620> time<00:05:40.800> we<00:05:40.860> can<00:05:41.130> all

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
years I think it's time we can all

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.520 
years I think it's time we can all
acknowledge<00:05:41.430> Superman<00:05:42.210> 64<00:05:42.420> is<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.080> important

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
acknowledge Superman 64 is the important

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.290 
acknowledge Superman 64 is the important
part<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.860> gaming<00:05:44.250> culture<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:44.760> history<00:05:45.060> that

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
part of gaming culture and history that

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.280 
part of gaming culture and history that
it<00:05:45.420> truly<00:05:45.840> is

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
it truly is

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.290 
it truly is
I'd<00:05:47.010> say<00:05:47.430> it's<00:05:47.670> earned<00:05:48.090> our<00:05:48.270> respect<00:05:50.300> it's

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
I'd say it's earned our respect it's

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.410 
I'd say it's earned our respect it's
still<00:05:51.630> pretty<00:05:51.810> bad<00:05:52.110> though
