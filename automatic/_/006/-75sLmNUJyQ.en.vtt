00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
boxy so right off the bat I just thought

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.540 
boxy so right off the bat I just thought
there's<00:03:30.990> no<00:03:31.050> way<00:03:31.200> I'm<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.650> like<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:31.860> but

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
there's no way I'm going to like it but

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.220

for<00:03:45.360> myself<00:03:45.750> in<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.959> store<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.260> would<00:03:46.650> just<00:03:46.830> walk

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
for myself in a store I would just walk

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.310 
for myself in a store I would just walk
right<00:03:47.040> by<00:03:47.459> this<00:03:47.520> jacket<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.900> jacket<00:03:49.230> is

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320

seventy-eight<00:03:49.920> dollars<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.670> again<00:03:51.660> all<00:03:51.900> of

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
seventy-eight dollars and again all of

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.490 
these pieces I think are a little bit on
the<00:03:53.730> expensive<00:03:53.940> side<00:03:54.270> but<00:03:54.510> if<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.320> buy

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
the expensive side but if you buy

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.840 
the expensive side but if you buy

everything in your box to get

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.699 
everything in your box to get

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
twenty-five percent offs and then last

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.860 
twenty-five percent offs and then last
and<00:03:59.040> certainly<00:03:59.190> not<00:03:59.400> least<00:03:59.760> is<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.510> blast

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.690 
when I actually budget for it so for me
that<00:04:42.260> actually<00:04:42.860> sounds<00:04:43.280> pretty<00:04:43.310> reasonable

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
that actually sounds pretty reasonable

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.280 
that actually sounds pretty reasonable
I've<00:04:44.360> gotten<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.810> point<00:04:45.020> where<00:04:45.140> I'm
