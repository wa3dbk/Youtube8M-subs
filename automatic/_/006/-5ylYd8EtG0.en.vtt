00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
was a little scuffle logo which to me

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.820 
was a little scuffle logo which to me
doesn't<00:01:02.489> provide<00:01:02.850> much<00:01:02.879> grip<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:04.500> saying

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
doesn't provide much grip but saying

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.990 
doesn't provide much grip but saying
that<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.250> actually<00:01:05.510> haven't<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.750> lost<00:01:06.869> grip

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
it's contradicting is that is the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
it's contradicting is that is the
paddles<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> back<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.150> awesome<00:01:12.450> just

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the scruff grip is the first time I've

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.810 
the scruff grip is the first time I've
actually<00:01:18.450> purchased<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.549> although<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> never

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
actually purchased it although I never

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
actually purchased it although I never
really<00:01:21.030> had<00:01:21.210> problems<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> past<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.290> my

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
really had problems in the past with my

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.539 
really had problems in the past with my
hands<00:01:22.710> sweating<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> controller

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
hands sweating and the controller

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.910 
hands sweating and the controller
slipping<00:01:23.939> out<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.390> whatever<00:01:25.380> they<00:01:25.619> proclaim

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
slipping out or whatever they proclaim

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590 
slipping out or whatever they proclaim
that<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.159> need<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:27.150> time<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.450> what<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that you need it for this time is what I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.880 
that you need it for this time is what I
hadn't<00:01:27.810> gone<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.170> I've<00:01:28.619> had<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.860> many

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
hadn't gone because I've had so many

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.219 
hadn't gone because I've had so many
scuf<00:01:29.250> controllers<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.729> thought<00:01:29.909> why<00:01:30.150> not<00:01:30.229> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
scuf controllers I thought why not and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.780 
scuf controllers I thought why not and
I've<00:01:31.320> actually<00:01:31.530> found<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.579> little

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I've actually found it to be a little

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.390 
I've actually found it to be a little
bit<00:01:32.970> more<00:01:33.270> perspiring<00:01:33.960> with<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> grip<00:01:35.100> than

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
bit more perspiring with the grip than

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.609 
bit more perspiring with the grip than
without<00:01:35.600> but<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> don't<00:01:36.810> lose<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> grip<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
without but you don't lose the grip I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.020 
without but you don't lose the grip I
don't<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:37.979> contradicted<00:01:38.340> myself<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.939> this

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
don't really contradicted myself in this

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
don't really contradicted myself in this
video<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.680> my<00:01:41.430> hands<00:01:41.610> are

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
video but it is what it is my hands are

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.920 
video but it is what it is my hands are
getting<00:01:41.759> sweaty<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.360> I'm<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:42.540> losing<00:01:42.630> grip

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
getting sweaty but I'm not losing grip

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.950 
getting sweaty but I'm not losing grip
so<00:01:43.610> take<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.000> worth<00:01:45.030> batteries

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
