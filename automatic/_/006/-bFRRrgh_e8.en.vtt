00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
wine into the other damage on your levee

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.499 
wine into the other damage on your levee
you<00:01:17.410> like<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.590> siphon<00:01:18.160> to<00:01:18.580> blink<00:01:19.060> round<00:01:19.360> the

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
you like a siphon to blink round the

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.589 
you like a siphon to blink round the
bottom<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.050> it's<00:01:20.170> not<00:01:21.240> running<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.420> and

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:22.599 
bottom so it's not running in and

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
bottom so it's not running in and
dragging<00:01:22.990> air<00:01:23.289> into<00:01:23.590> it<00:01:23.740> you'll<00:01:23.979> be<00:01:24.130> fine<00:01:25.619> so

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
dragging air into it you'll be fine so

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.080 
dragging air into it you'll be fine so
that's<00:01:26.860> on<00:01:27.069> at<00:01:27.190> times<00:01:27.399> I'm<00:01:27.670> gonna<00:01:27.759> empty<00:01:28.000> it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
that's on at times I'm gonna empty it

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.859 
that's on at times I'm gonna empty it
out<00:01:28.300> now<00:01:28.569> and<00:01:29.500> then<00:01:30.220> we're<00:01:30.459> gonna<00:01:30.610> add<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
out now and then we're gonna add the

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.749 
out now and then we're gonna add the
potassium<00:01:32.319> sorbate<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.950> grounded<00:01:33.340> tablet

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
potassium sorbate the grounded tablet

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.430 
potassium sorbate the grounded tablet
now<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.300> captive<00:01:34.750> tablet<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.950> for<00:01:36.369> clearing

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
now the captive tablet is for clearing

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.570 
now the captive tablet is for clearing
and<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.530> potassium<00:01:38.770> sorbate

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
and the potassium sorbate

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.389 
and the potassium sorbate
is<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.360> stabilizer<00:01:41.050> it's<00:01:42.009> actually<00:01:42.340> II<00:01:42.550> -<00:01:43.030> OH<00:01:43.060> -

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
is a stabilizer it's actually II - OH -

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.910 
is a stabilizer it's actually II - OH -
what<00:01:45.399> this<00:01:45.610> does<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.810> prevents<00:01:47.170> any<00:01:47.410> wild

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
what this does is it prevents any wild

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.800 
what this does is it prevents any wild
yeasts<00:01:48.399> from<00:01:48.910> growing<00:01:49.300> in<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.709> wine<00:01:51.810> some

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
yeasts from growing in the wine some

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.449 
yeasts from growing in the wine some
people<00:01:53.170> use<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.970> meta<00:01:55.750> box<00:01:55.929> or<00:01:56.229> fate<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:57.130> kill

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
people use the meta box or fate to kill

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.370 
people use the meta box or fate to kill
the<00:01:57.789> yeast<00:01:58.000> which<00:01:58.390> is<00:01:58.539> in<00:01:58.690> your<00:01:58.840> wine<00:01:59.080> already

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380

I've never had a problem with it I just
got<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.810> potassium<00:02:05.289> sorbate

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
got the potassium sorbate

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.540 
got the potassium sorbate
and<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.090> hell<00:02:07.270> with<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.539> and<00:02:08.099> never<00:02:09.099> had<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> bad

and to hell with it and never had a bad
batch<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.270> wine<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.950> let's<00:02:12.190> crack<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.610> with<00:02:12.640> it

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
batch of wine so let's crack on with it

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.740 
batch of wine so let's crack on with it
right<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.800> when<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:14.920> did<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.160> banana<00:02:15.280> wine<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
right so when we did the banana wine and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.280 
right so when we did the banana wine and
we<00:02:16.870> added<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.230> dozen<00:02:17.650> sauteing<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.160> cabin

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
we added a dozen sauteing the cabin

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.530 
we added a dozen sauteing the cabin
you'll<00:02:20.069> notice<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.700> crushed<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.150> captain

check<00:02:38.790> which<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.299> way<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.480> do<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.840> now<00:02:40.940> and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
check which is the way I do it now and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.860 
check which is the way I do it now and
that<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.599> take<00:02:43.019> it<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.410> captain<00:02:44.129> tablet

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
that is I take it to a captain tablet

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.960 
that is I take it to a captain tablet
just<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.120> drop<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.660> straight<00:02:48.780> in

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
just one and I just drop it straight in

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.199 
just one and I just drop it straight in
and<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.180> same<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.630> potassium<00:02:52.140> sorbate

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.930 

this<00:02:57.209> potassium<00:02:57.720> sorbate<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:59.370> gram<00:02:59.640> for

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
this potassium sorbate is one gram for

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.880 
this potassium sorbate is one gram for
every<00:03:00.120> 5<00:03:00.390> litres<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.900> works<00:03:04.200> out<00:03:04.560> to

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
every 5 litres so and it works out to

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:14.020 
every 5 litres so and it works out to
about<00:03:05.849> half<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.750> teaspoon<00:03:09.950> half<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.069> teaspoon<00:03:11.579> so

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.569 

that's<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.239> now<00:03:16.010> now<00:03:17.010> we're<00:03:17.160> going<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.370> wrap

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
that's it now now we're going to wrap

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.900 
that's it now now we're going to wrap
the<00:03:18.569> pineapple<00:03:19.049> wine<00:03:19.200> into<00:03:19.530> this<00:03:19.700> pour<00:03:20.700> an<00:03:20.790> air

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
the pineapple wine into this pour an air

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.559 
the pineapple wine into this pour an air
lock<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.440> and<00:03:22.440> leave<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.859> clear<00:03:23.569> right

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
lock on it and leave it to clear right

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.360 
lock on it and leave it to clear right
so<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:24.959> really<00:03:25.109> just<00:03:25.200> stirred<00:03:25.590> apologies

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
so it's really just stirred apologies

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.680 
so it's really just stirred apologies

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
for the mess but this new computer bill

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.960 
for the mess but this new computer bill
has<00:03:31.170> had<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.560> room<00:03:31.920> sort<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.519> upside<00:03:32.940> down

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.289 
has had this room sort of upside down
with<00:03:33.480> bits<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.109> cardboard<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.739> whatnot<00:03:35.299> all

with bits of cardboard and whatnot all

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.449 
with bits of cardboard and whatnot all
I'm<00:03:36.450> doing<00:03:36.510> now<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.139> can't<00:03:37.380> see<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.799> but

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
I'm doing now is you can't see it but

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.220 
I'm doing now is you can't see it but
I've<00:03:38.579> taken<00:03:38.819> out<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.180> airlock<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:40.109> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
I've taken out the airlock to the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:50.330 
I've taken out the airlock to the
pineapple<00:03:40.739> wine

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.199 

and<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.549> smells<00:03:51.940> gorgeous<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.970> leaving<00:03:54.970> it

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
and that smells gorgeous so leaving it

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.320 
and that smells gorgeous so leaving it
in<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.390> demijohn<00:03:55.959> seal<00:03:56.349> has<00:03:57.340> not<00:03:57.670> hindered<00:03:58.030> it

in the demijohn seal has not hindered it

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.140 
in the demijohn seal has not hindered it
in<00:03:58.900> any<00:03:59.110> way<00:03:59.610> because<00:04:00.610> everything's<00:04:01.060> been

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
in any way because everything's been

sealed up so there's no harm and coming

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.720 
sealed up so there's no harm and coming
to<00:04:04.269> a<00:04:04.299> siphon<00:04:04.750> hose<00:04:04.870> comes<00:04:05.200> in<00:04:08.129> Cube<00:04:09.129> goes<00:04:09.400> all

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
to a siphon hose comes in Cube goes all

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.140 
to a siphon hose comes in Cube goes all
the<00:04:09.760> way<00:04:10.150> down<00:04:10.599> and<00:04:11.610> loop<00:04:12.610> it<00:04:12.790> around<00:04:12.819> the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
the way down and loop it around the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.680 
the way down and loop it around the
bottom<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.829> that<00:04:15.010> way<00:04:15.220> as<00:04:15.879> it<00:04:15.940> comes<00:04:16.299> out<00:04:16.510> the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
bottom and that way as it comes out the

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.569 
bottom and that way as it comes out the
tube<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.229> will<00:04:17.320> just<00:04:17.470> run<00:04:17.829> on<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:18.190> bottom<00:04:18.310> and

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
tube it will just run on the bottom and

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.759 
tube it will just run on the bottom and
the<00:04:18.639> damage<00:04:18.940> on<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.049> won't<00:04:20.139> swatch<00:04:20.560> any

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
the damage on and it won't swatch any

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.890 
the damage on and it won't swatch any
air<00:04:20.979> into<00:04:21.340> it

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
air into it

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.550 
air into it
few<00:04:22.900> pumps<00:04:23.169> on<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:23.680> side<00:04:24.490> four<00:04:24.729> toes<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:29.320> the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
few pumps on this side four toes and the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.290 
few pumps on this side four toes and the
weight<00:04:29.740> goes<00:04:32.039> now<00:04:33.039> if<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.250> use<00:04:33.430> instar<00:04:33.970> sound

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
weight goes now if you use instar sound

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.320 
weight goes now if you use instar sound
for<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.539> first<00:04:34.570> time<00:04:35.340> don't<00:04:36.340> worry<00:04:36.580> about<00:04:36.910> the

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
for the first time don't worry about the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.689 
for the first time don't worry about the
bubbles<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.750> are<00:04:37.900> left<00:04:38.110> in<00:04:38.229> it<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:39.340> now<00:04:39.490> when

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
bubbles that are left in it and now when

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:45.719 
bubbles that are left in it and now when
I<00:04:39.729> first<00:04:40.060> started<00:04:40.479> I<00:04:40.630> was<00:04:43.710> but<00:04:44.710> some<00:04:45.430> people

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
I first started I was but some people

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.290 
I first started I was but some people
believe<00:04:45.940> that<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:48.100> does<00:04:48.340> aid<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.820> yeast<00:04:49.060> if

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
believe that it does aid the yeast if

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.980 
believe that it does aid the yeast if
you<00:04:49.419> do<00:04:49.570> in<00:04:49.720> beer<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:51.180> don't<00:04:52.180> know<00:04:52.479> but<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:52.870> know

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
you do in beer I don't know but I know

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.520 
you do in beer I don't know but I know
it's<00:04:53.289> in<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.800> in<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.360> foam<00:04:55.360> that's<00:04:55.599> left<00:04:55.870> it's

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
it's in the in the foam that's left it's

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.180 
it's in the in the foam that's left it's
safe<00:04:56.860> because<00:04:58.169> when<00:04:59.169> you<00:04:59.289> dilute<00:04:59.680> it<00:04:59.860> again

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
safe because when you dilute it again

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.700 
safe because when you dilute it again
with<00:05:00.760> your<00:05:00.880> wine<00:05:01.120> will<00:05:01.360> you<00:05:01.389> beer<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:02.380> pH

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
with your wine will you beer the pH

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.100 
with your wine will you beer the pH
level<00:05:03.099> drops<00:05:03.419> so<00:05:04.419> so<00:05:05.080> don't<00:05:05.200> worry<00:05:05.410> about<00:05:05.710> that

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.659 

it's<00:05:11.110> gonna<00:05:11.289> angle<00:05:11.500> this<00:05:11.860> now<00:05:12.130> just<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.520> get

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
it's gonna angle this now just to get

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.330 
it's gonna angle this now just to get
the<00:05:12.789> last<00:05:12.940> bits<00:05:13.240> out<00:05:15.449> so<00:05:16.449> that's<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:16.870> guys<00:05:17.340> that
