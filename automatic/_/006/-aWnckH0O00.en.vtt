00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.309
 for all welcome one more day to me 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.629
 channel not because today I bring you another video 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.540
 in which I wanted to show you some 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.730
 you buy that I have made in mercadona 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.529
 some are news, not some 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.390
 girls have already taken them on instagram in 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.039
 photos but good I wanted them 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.650
 teach 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.839
 and well let's start with them in 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.060
 First place buy the most famous 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.859
 honey candles 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 well you have to talk about the 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.850
 fabulous are super cheap I think 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.200
 they left by July and a half 175 more or 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.140
 less 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.570
 and they really smell great smell even 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.430
 without lighting, put them on diets 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.040
 here they smell lots of good rooms 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.440
 heap so good you're together with the 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.630
 yannick yankee candle changers that are 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.310
 what I have now are my candles 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.500
 favorites 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.010
 Then I bought some that are new 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.430
 which are the mint and chocolate in 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.400
 these smell more loose than the others and 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.920
 especially what is most noticeable is the smell 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.920
 mint is worth so good they have the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.659
 same price that I tell you that they are new 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.240
 relatively new 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.999
 then I bought this facial cream that is 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.800
 cream with honey and royal jelly that is the 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:25.980
 I'm using for the nights 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.630
 to hydrate and well it was not because the 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.610
 you need you are going to buy a bit like that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.230
 on a whim then I'm not 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 using that for at night 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.340
 because it is quite unctuous arrives factor 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.050
 of sun protection 10 so also 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.880
 could be used for the day without any 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.670
 kind of problem even if not 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.980
 you have creams with solar factor for 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.200
 Now it is highly recommended that 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.280
 use these very good tips for 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.800
 titans and angels were 56 euros 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.660
 then I bought these two masks 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.370
 has a plastic of one euro and so 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.350
 that I have heard are worth one or two 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.240
 dose are worth of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.400
 from the same line of butter 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.340
 cut that came out I think the year 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.470
 past are like these but this is the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.869
 new that they have taken out we also take out a 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.000
 perfume of this smell is worth 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.160
 We have been here is passion fruit and tiare 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.570
 and the truth is that it smells great 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.700
 the truth is that you're butters I 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.670
 they like a lot and 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.830
 and they are also super trinkets so they 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.470
 I recommend you to take a look 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.019
 I say you speak because it sounds great and good 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.989
 then I'm going to put in this video because 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.060
 the same day at home my boy and the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.400
 parents who gave me a gift and I 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.310
 I want to teach it worth the blogs 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.580
 from a few past seasons that 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.709
 I had l'orÃ©al and well there are different 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.340
 types I leave this that these plants with 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.430
 glitter is like glitter 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.580
 then I have the glam scifres 3 range 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.530
 I have this 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.940
 He looks at you teaching because they are from ranges 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.410
 different even if they have the same 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.630
 all the format that I will show you 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.850
 Now they are from different ranges but they are 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.940
 super nice you see them saying 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.380
 good and this is the 116 I do not know if what 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.000
 we will continue finding now but good 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.000
 it's 116 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.920
 this is the 106 this is a little girl with 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.920
 silver shimmer this is very nice 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.400
 this one that is brown gets also 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.400
 silver is 501 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.890
 this is a more need lighter 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.670
 also recorded the silver but it is more 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.709
 subtle than the previous 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.709
 and this is the 301 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.930
 another brownie but that this is with 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.930
 golden sparkles 305 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.220

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.830
 which is 208 is a red with 6 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.070
 silver and red is very beautiful is 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.070
 colour 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.860
 this that is like a kind of garnet 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:15.470

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.470

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.150
 It's 6 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.510
 and brown with silver sparkles that is 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.800

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.670
 this s 300 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.730
 the other you had in 300 hours 3 in 308 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.710
 the difference is the tone is worth this one is 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.710
 more brown and the other pulls more pink 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:56.700
 and then another rose with golden sparkles 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.700
 and oranges from 111 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.190
 then this moradito this has no 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.000
 type of flash that is 118 this 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.000
 It is also beautiful 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.100
 and another rose with pink sparkles and 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.100
 silver which is the 205 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.030
 other stereo a lot of flashes 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.509
 golden and study the volume range there 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.509
 to be is 110 is precious 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.890
 another one that is 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.890
 golden brown with golden sparkles 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.219
 that this is 307 and another that is sent 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.989
 pick it up that they take it to the course and this 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.509
 that is super nice that is a yellow 

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:49.659
 to notice is precious but there are still 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.930
 lips as very subtle and also looks and 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.240
 I take advantage of you to teach 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.449
 then the applicator that has the form of 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.960
 heart 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.960
 and it's not sticky at all 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.660
 and it does not stay very nice it's very 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.690
 nice this gives a little bit of brightness with 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.220
 a little tone as doradito and very 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.140
 alright I'm got an hour of gloss is 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.010
 that I'm practically nothing of 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.570
 gloss is because this way I avoid myself I have to 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.310
 everything is broken and treating them the villa 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.290
 Dora that both skin and dry 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.120
 so much I am throwing a lot of gloss 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.580
 it's good then this one took you in the 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.670
 bag because it's like that with more 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:35.000
 neutral along with this one at lunchtime 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.980
 what to apply and then it's good 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.410

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:46.510
