00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 dress greet you school want to know 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.919
 I will give Ostrenko a teacher of biology 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.370
 today we will analyze the selection 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.440
 task c2 and the second question and so what 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.010
 type of cell division is depicted in the figure 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.650
 all 9 some kind of phase seals how many 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.710
 such cells are formed as a result 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.960
 this type of division so let's start 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.439
 beginnings and we know that we have two 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 type of division is mitosis and meiosis 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.110
 we have to establish what the division is 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:39.210
 let's look carefully at the drawing 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.149
 we see that in chromosomes and therefore us and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.010
 michi chromosomes i.e. they will have 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.399
 four chromatids in each 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.460
 that is, not two sticks a4 means it is us 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:55.340
 chromosomes chromosomes diverge by pluses 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.350
 and this is typical only for meiosis a 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.640
 for the first and the selection because 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.430
 that for mitosis and 2 divisions of meiosis 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.409
 characterized by discrepancy chromatids about 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.390
 poles of the cell, that is, there will be two 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.060
 sticks they are 4 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.470
 the fact that our chromosomes differ by 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.900
 to pluses it indicates that it is with us 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.229
 mejos namely meiosis 1 i.e. first 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.270
 meiosis division 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.710
 some sort of division phase it will be anaphase 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.250
 anaphase that is it when we have 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 chromosomes they already have you gone too far and approach 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.060
 and diverge towards the poles of the cell that is 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.400
 this is such a phase of movement and beyond us 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.080
 ask how many and what cells 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.090
 formed as a result of this 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.430
 I will remind you about the separation as a result 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.360
 meiosis will be here from one cell which 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.340
 set of chromosomes 2 m 4 with result 1 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.780
 division 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.900
 two cells are formed in them a set of n 2 c 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.260
 n20 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.320
 further each of these cells will divide 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:12.140
 still in half as a result of us 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.270
 4 cells are formed each of which is nc 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.080
 nc is a haploid set of chromosomes 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.880
 We answered all questions with you 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.980
 I want to know the school and I will give ostrenko 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.870
 subscribe to our YouTube channel out 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.610
 that know rum come to us for courses in 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.610
 Moscow and get ready for the exam, along with
