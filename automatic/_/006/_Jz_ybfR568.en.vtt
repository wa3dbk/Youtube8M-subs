00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
pretty legit is this is first time I

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.580 
pretty legit is this is first time I
played<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.170> right<00:00:25.289> here<00:00:25.380> this

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
played it and this one right here this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.300 
played it and this one right here this
is<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.920> third<00:00:26.220> wave<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:27.990> much

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
is the third wave and it's pretty much

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.510 
is the third wave and it's pretty much
like<00:00:29.750> modern<00:00:30.750> warfare<00:00:30.990> 3<00:00:31.140> had<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.949> think

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
like modern warfare 3 had that I think

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.799 
like modern warfare 3 had that I think
it's<00:00:32.610> called<00:00:32.759> survival<00:00:32.910> mode<00:00:33.390> whatever<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it's called survival mode whatever you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.450 
it's called survival mode whatever you
know<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.140> waves<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.130> harder<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
know they have waves and it's harder and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.790 
know they have waves and it's harder and
harder<00:00:35.670> kind<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.630> zombies<00:00:37.050> too<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> guess

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
harder kind of like zombies too I guess

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
harder kind of like zombies too I guess
