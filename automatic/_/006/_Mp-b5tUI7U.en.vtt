right<00:00:46.950> away<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.820> should<00:00:48.030> work<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.210> fine

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
right away and it should work just fine

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.290 
right away and it should work just fine
then<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> r9<00:00:49.739> 370<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> also

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
then you have the r9 370 this is also

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.850 
then you have the r9 370 this is also
kind<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> being<00:00:51.899> classified<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.680> league

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
kind of being classified as that league

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
kind of being classified as that league
of<00:00:52.980> legends<00:00:53.309> dota<00:00:53.579> player<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.149> more<00:00:54.360> beefier

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
of legends dota player but more beefier

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.229 
of legends dota player but more beefier
of<00:00:54.989> course<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.410> 149<00:00:56.129> dollars<00:00:56.550> expect<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
of course it's 149 dollars expect to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
of course it's 149 dollars expect to
play<00:00:57.329> games<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.690> witcha<00:00:57.989> tree<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.440> well<00:00:58.710> at

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
play games like witcha tree as well at

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.439 
play games like witcha tree as well at
around<00:00:59.070> high<00:00:59.309> settings<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.850> would<00:01:00.000> imagine<00:01:00.180> at

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
around high settings I would imagine at

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
around high settings I would imagine at
1080p<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.140> still<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.800> 40<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> 45<00:01:02.520> frames

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
1080p and still get like 40 to 45 frames

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.369 
1080p and still get like 40 to 45 frames
per<00:01:02.910> second<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.359> four<00:01:03.780> hundred<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.140> forty

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
per second so four hundred and forty

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.960 
per second so four hundred and forty
nine<00:01:04.500> dollars<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.949> might<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> really

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
nine dollars this might be a really

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.700 
nine dollars this might be a really
great<00:01:06.090> budget<00:01:06.390> GPU<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> lot<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.560> guys

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
great budget GPU for a lot of you guys

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.670 
great budget GPU for a lot of you guys
then<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> r9<00:01:08.970> 380<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.049> has<00:01:10.290> enough

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
then we have the r9 380 this has enough

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
then we have the r9 380 this has enough
performance<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.400> 1440p<00:01:12.330> gaming<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.020> comes

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
performance for 1440p gaming and comes

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
performance for 1440p gaming and comes
in<00:01:13.439> at<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> hundred<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.100> ninety<00:01:14.369> nine<00:01:14.520> dollars

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
in at a hundred and ninety nine dollars

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.640 
in at a hundred and ninety nine dollars
and<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.060> has<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.840> four<00:01:16.049> gigabytes<00:01:16.530> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and it has up to four gigabytes of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.469 
and it has up to four gigabytes of
memory<00:01:16.860> now<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.549> want<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> four<00:01:18.060> gigabyte

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
memory now if you want the four gigabyte

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.060 
memory now if you want the four gigabyte
configuration<00:01:19.229> chances<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.860> probably

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
configuration chances are it's probably
