00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello girls i hope you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.910
 okay so today I'm coming back 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.050
 with a new makeup so 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.360
 as I promised you a 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.820
 makeup with the screw pallet of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.610
 cherves indicated so to makeup who 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.079
 is not very discreet we will say 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.650
 since I do not use colors 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.960
 neutral 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.640
 I really wanted to use this 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.680
 blue electric pallet 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.720
 so here I hope you'll see 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.270
 as you see change of scenery 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.149
 I am in my son's room 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.010
 because today really does not 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.469
 beautiful outside but given that his 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 window is well placed there is a good 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.090
 brightness so I thought why 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.039
 not film here today 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.219
 so do not hesitate to tell me what you 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.410
 also think if you prefer here or 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.420
 in the room finally you tell me in 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.989
 comment here so if this tutorial 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.309
 interested in staying there then for 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.530
 to begin I denied a base 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.809
 so I'm going to use the rest take 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.809
 shon of charb indicated in colors eden 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.100
 then I take a hot bath is have 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.590
 scared and I 'm going to come take the color 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.280
 anonymous tunnels applied in touch 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.750
 light and I the road goes down to little 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.490
 close to the middle of the eyelid 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:35.870
 so we stay on the fixed eyelid so 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 it will facilitate the stamping work 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.760
 Then I will come and define the hollow 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.220
 of my eyelid so for that I take a 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.110
 boat is so we can there I take the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.520
 brush that had in the palette and I 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.190
 want to come take the color the eye 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.150
 side 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.150
 she placed in the hollow 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.450
 so it's really coming from 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.250
 limits and my hollow and that will allow 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.440
 also to facilitate the fading since 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.160
 will come add a little more color 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:18.230
 dark and I come to take the color 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.230
 chaos which is so an electric blue 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.460
 so I'm not starting to come tap the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.460
 lighthouse on my mobile eyelid 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.030
 i'm going to actually pale intensified a 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.790
 little more because it's a lighthouse that 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.090
 is already lights and flashy 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.819
 I'm just going to moisten it 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.459
 to come good to fix because he's 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.110
 still quite powdery and when we go 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.209
 dimmed we will not be a little bit 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.430
 intensity so to avoid too much in 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.920
 put back I 'll come spray my 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.890
 brush of makeup fixer to 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.239
 place the one from home decay 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.680
 also and then I'll see again 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.459
 applied from above so you see that 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.920
 Intensive, not more than that color 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.920
 but it really comes there fixed 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.519
 so she is fine up to the lashes 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.110
 to prevent them from having white 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:39.640
 since I'm not going to put a line 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:41.170
 to eyeliner so be careful here and 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.870
 Then I will come 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.860
 blur so I take the brush and 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.860
 are scared of just now 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.060
 I want to come intensify a little bit 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.220
 my outer corner for to give a 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.080
 little more definition at 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.930
 makeup so I'm going to come use 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:09.269
 the lighthouse muse which is therefore a chestnut 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.849
 with small glitter I come 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.140
 well pat the excess on the back of my 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.109
 hand because it's a lighthouse that's 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.709
 very very powdery and I apply them 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.169
 so in the hollow so I'm going 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.100
 really little by little will avoid the 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.100
 maximum of fall 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.450
 so I came to apply it 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.690
 directly with a brush is afraid 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:40.080
 like that that's it and it's already falling a little 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.400
 little when you apply it well take 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.780
 then my brush is scared I 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.910
 take a little bit of the lighthouse the aecid 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.370
 that we actually put in the hollow all 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.370
 by the hour and I come dimmed 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:05:00.419
 I do not hesitate to come and put a little 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.300
 few colors until you 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:08.669
 actually get the intensity you 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.379
 I want to take a brush 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:15.090
 is we lose a little wider so there 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:17.340
 it's my wish 35 of sigma so link 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.900
 blurred with the light button for good 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.900
 founds the colors and then I go 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:27.090
 come and shoot a little bit of the headlights 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.159
 at the outer corner of the eye and 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.229
 at the inner corner game come 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.229
 apply a little bit of eco beach 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.340
 it brings a touch of light but 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:49.440
 a little golden touches that goes very 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.940
 very well with the blue I find I 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.800
 then come off absil so I take 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.479
 with a beveled brush and I just redo 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.250
 the same thing is to say that I'm going 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.919
 put the lighthouse chaos 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.319
 will he have it pretty much to the middle and 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.979
 on the rest I will hand over the lighthouse 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:08.090
 put so it's the same I 'm a 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.090
 first time pat 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.870
 here 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.979
 and I'm going to blur audois went 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.550
 applied a pencil in mucous membranes so me 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:33.319
 this is the pen 24 7 0 of Charles 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.139
 dickens next I mean apply 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:39.680
 my mascara which I use mascara 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.729
 volum deploy from yves rock so 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.169
 makeup at eye level is 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.169
 finished that's what it gives 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.780
 I will then go to the application 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.460
 blush so I'm going to use a blush 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.819
 pink so it's my home blush 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.330
 lancÃ´me which is a flashy pink glitter 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:10.770
 that I often put this moment in fact 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:15.000
 I really put in a little touch 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.000
 because he is really very pigmented 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:20.940
 but that's the thing that gives a little 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.940
 good-looking side 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:28.030
 then I would put a little bit of 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:31.479
 so here I use a powder from home 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:35.409
 grow in attaining luminance is a 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:43.030
 little bit that at the level of the bridge of the nose 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:45.659
 So I go down too I place under 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.659
 the top of the cheekbones 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.150
 and to finish this makeup and well 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:59.090
 applied a little bit of gloss so there 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:59.090
 I use my gloss from gasoline 

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.130
 walfisz makeup is over I hope 

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.060
