finished using them a couple of things
that<00:00:23.009> I'd<00:00:23.099> like<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.310> show<00:00:23.610> you<00:00:23.669> of<00:00:23.939> it

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
squeezing it from the tube you can see

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.689 
squeezing it from the tube you can see
that<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.020> artisan<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.310> any

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that the artisan is like any

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.519 
that the artisan is like any
conventional<00:00:30.449> oil<00:00:30.599> color<00:00:30.930> that<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> may<00:00:31.410> have

conventional oil color that you may have

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.939 
conventional oil color that you may have
used<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.780> to<00:00:33.780> show<00:00:34.019> you<00:00:34.080> this<00:00:34.290> against<00:00:34.769> our

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
used just to show you this against our

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.790 
used just to show you this against our
artists<00:00:35.550> oil<00:00:35.910> color<00:00:36.150> which<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:37.470> is<00:00:37.650> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
artists oil color which this is the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
artists oil color which this is the
fallow<00:00:38.070> green<00:00:38.489> blue<00:00:38.790> shade<00:00:39.089> in<00:00:39.239> artists<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
fallow green blue shade in artists and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.920 
fallow green blue shade in artists and
this<00:00:40.470> is<00:00:40.620> how<00:00:40.800> our<00:00:41.040> Windsor<00:00:41.910> green<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.780> our

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this is how our Windsor green in our

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.600 
this is how our Windsor green in our
artists<00:00:43.290> oil<00:00:43.470> color<00:00:43.800> which<00:00:43.980> actually<00:00:44.309> uses

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
artists oil color which actually uses

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.119 
artists oil color which actually uses
the<00:00:44.699> same<00:00:44.910> pigment<00:00:45.479> you<00:00:46.199> can't<00:00:46.470> really<00:00:46.710> notice

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the same pigment you can't really notice

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.200 
the same pigment you can't really notice
the<00:00:47.280> difference

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.810 

that's<00:00:51.900> because<00:00:52.320> artisan<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.340> made<00:00:53.580> out<00:00:53.790> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
that's because artisan is made out of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
that's because artisan is made out of
pigment<00:00:56.120> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.180> an<00:00:57.270> example<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.900> cadmium

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
pigment this is an example of cadmium

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.450 
pigment this is an example of cadmium
yellow<00:00:59.010> pigment<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.990> linseed<00:01:01.650> oil<00:01:01.830> which

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
yellow pigment and a linseed oil which

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.180 
yellow pigment and a linseed oil which
has<00:01:02.610> actually<00:01:02.790> been<00:01:02.970> modified<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
has actually been modified so that it

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:13.100 
has actually been modified so that it
mixes<00:01:05.550> with<00:01:05.700> water<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.850> essentially<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.930> base

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
mixes with water so essentially the base

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
mixes with water so essentially the base
of<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> mix<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.040> pigment<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.120> linseed<00:01:15.780> oil

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
of the mix is pigment and linseed oil

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
of the mix is pigment and linseed oil
which<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.560> why<00:01:16.830> artists<00:01:17.220> ant<00:01:17.370> can<00:01:17.520> be

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
which is why artists ant can be

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.690 
which is why artists ant can be
considered<00:01:18.120> as<00:01:18.270> an<00:01:18.510> oil<00:01:18.660> color

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.539 

so<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.420> see<00:01:23.689> how<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.200> affected<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.340> oil

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
so to see how this is affected the oil

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.530 
so to see how this is affected the oil
paint<00:01:26.740> if<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:27.860> now<00:01:28.100> try<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:28.549> thin<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.150> artists

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
paint if I now try and thin the artists

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.740 
paint if I now try and thin the artists
oil<00:01:29.840> color<00:01:30.049> with<00:01:30.229> water

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
oil color with water

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.929 
oil color with water
you<00:01:32.750> can<00:01:32.930> see<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:33.380> difficult<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.369> it

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
you can see it's difficult and it

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.700 
you can see it's difficult and it
doesn't<00:01:35.270> mix<00:01:35.420> at<00:01:35.630> all<00:01:37.930> whereas<00:01:38.930> as<00:01:39.049> I<00:01:39.229> use<00:01:39.470> some

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
doesn't mix at all whereas as I use some

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.700 
doesn't mix at all whereas as I use some
water<00:01:40.340> with<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.820> artisan<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:42.289> can<00:01:42.440> see

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
water with the artisan you can see

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.690 
water with the artisan you can see
straight<00:01:43.580> away<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:45.530> can<00:01:45.799> thin<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.369> and

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
straight away that I can thin this and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.249 
straight away that I can thin this and
move<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.360> about<00:01:47.479> with<00:01:47.840> water<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.869> biggest

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
move it about with water so the biggest

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.200 
move it about with water so the biggest
advantage<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.890> this<00:01:52.070> is<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.340> can<00:01:52.789> do<00:01:52.939> an<00:01:53.060> oil

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
advantage of this is you can do an oil

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.419 
advantage of this is you can do an oil
painting<00:01:53.869> following<00:01:54.470> all<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.740> conventional

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
painting following all the conventional

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.730 
painting following all the conventional
oil<00:01:55.700> painting<00:01:56.300> rules<00:01:56.600> without<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.560> use<00:01:57.710> of

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
oil painting rules without the use of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.520 
oil painting rules without the use of
solvents<00:01:58.720> furthermore<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.929> this<00:02:00.080> we've

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
solvents furthermore to this we've

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.480 
solvents furthermore to this we've
produced<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:01.159> range<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.670> thinners<00:02:02.479> oils

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
produced a range of thinners oils

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.669 
produced a range of thinners oils
mediums<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.789> varnishes<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.110> can<00:02:06.319> use

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
mediums and varnishes that you can use

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.880 
mediums and varnishes that you can use
to<00:02:07.280> complete<00:02:07.789> your<00:02:08.000> oil<00:02:08.360> painting<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.170> then

to complete your oil painting and then

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.650 
to complete your oil painting and then
you<00:02:10.069> don't<00:02:10.280> have<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.519> use<00:02:10.789> any<00:02:11.030> solvents<00:02:11.569> at

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
you don't have to use any solvents at

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.059 
you don't have to use any solvents at
all<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.959> clean<00:02:12.170> your<00:02:12.290> brushes<00:02:12.560> or<00:02:12.890> your
