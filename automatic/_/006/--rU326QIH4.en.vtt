00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
somewhere near the bomb that's the

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.569 
somewhere near the bomb that's the
easiest<00:02:02.409> way<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.649> know<00:02:02.829> when<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.130> guys<00:02:03.280> going

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
easiest way to know when the guys going

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.130 
easiest way to know when the guys going
for<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.819> diffuse<00:02:04.179> and<00:02:04.630> that's<00:02:04.810> gonna<00:02:04.929> make<00:02:05.020> it

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
for the diffuse and that's gonna make it

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.600
