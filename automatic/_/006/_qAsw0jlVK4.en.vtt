to<00:01:23.060> make<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.330> this<00:01:23.540> image<00:01:23.930> but<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:25.090> think<00:01:26.090> that

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
to make of this image but I think that

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.120 
to make of this image but I think that
you<00:01:26.360> know<00:01:26.480> he<00:01:26.690> knows<00:01:26.900> what<00:01:27.080> he's<00:01:27.170> doing<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.100> I

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
you know he knows what he's doing so I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.160 
you know he knows what he's doing so I
can't<00:01:28.670> just<00:01:28.910> judge<00:01:29.180> from<00:01:29.450> an<00:01:29.570> image<00:01:29.840> maybe

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
can't just judge from an image maybe

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.230 
can't just judge from an image maybe
this<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.470> not<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.650> final<00:01:30.860> costume<00:01:31.520> maybe<00:01:32.060> she

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
this is not the final costume maybe she
