00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
an ABS will not warp now I'm looking

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
an ABS will not warp now I'm looking
over<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> monitor<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.630> make

I've<00:01:24.060> been<00:01:24.299> working<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.780> ABS<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> long

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I've been working with ABS for a long

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.060 
I've been working with ABS for a long
time<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.689> ABS<00:01:28.020> has<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> tendency

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
time and I know that ABS has a tendency

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.730 
time and I know that ABS has a tendency
to<00:01:29.159> warp<00:01:29.509> well<00:01:30.509> you'll<00:01:30.869> notice<00:01:31.110> let<00:01:31.530> me<00:01:31.619> get

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
to warp well you'll notice let me get

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.160 
to warp well you'll notice let me get
this<00:01:31.890> nice<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.250> flat<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this nice and flat for you so that you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.700 
this nice and flat for you so that you
can<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.430> there's<00:01:35.939> no<00:01:36.090> warping<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:37.470> not

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
can see that there's no warping it's not

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.490 
can see that there's no warping it's not
pulling<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.299> now<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.509> might<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> tendency

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
pulling up now it might have a tendency

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.410 
pulling up now it might have a tendency
to<00:01:40.530> pull<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:40.950> when<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> release<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.119> there

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
to pull up when I release this there

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.230 
to pull up when I release this there
might<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.680> right<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.939> bed

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
might be some but right now on this bed

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.350 
might be some but right now on this bed
this<00:01:45.810> piece<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:46.470> warped<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.880> credit

my<00:02:06.600> belief<00:02:07.020> before<00:02:07.849> with<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> cube<00:02:09.179> 2<00:02:09.450> was

my belief before with the cube 2 was
that<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.800> should<00:02:11.129> put<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> glue<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
that I should put the glue on and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.940 
that I should put the glue on and
immediately<00:02:12.180> start<00:02:12.810> printing<00:02:13.170> before

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
immediately start printing before

the least quality of all of the motes

the least quality of all of the motes
that<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.650> can<00:03:25.829> use<00:03:26.160> for<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.549> printer<00:03:26.970> and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
that you can use for this printer and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.599 
that you can use for this printer and
yet<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.690> perfectly<00:03:28.319> smooth<00:03:28.739> perfectly<00:03:29.370> fine

yet it's perfectly smooth perfectly fine
probably<00:03:30.239> better<00:03:30.720> than<00:03:30.959> I've<00:03:31.109> ever<00:03:31.290> printed

printer<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.569> we'll<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.870> talking<00:03:37.079> about<00:03:37.380> other

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
printer and we'll be talking about other

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
aspects of it as we go along but for now

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.300 
aspects of it as we go along but for now
remember<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.030> get<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.209> cube<00:03:42.510> 3<00:03:42.660> let<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.829> let

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
remember if you get a cube 3 let the let

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.690 
remember if you get a cube 3 let the let
the<00:03:44.340> glue<00:03:44.880> dry<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.540> you'll<00:03:46.049> get<00:03:46.260> results<00:03:46.889> at

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
the glue dry and you'll get results at

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.390 
the glue dry and you'll get results at
least<00:03:47.910> close<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:48.859> again<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:50.069> can't

fashion but I tell you sometimes you're

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.770 
fashion but I tell you sometimes you're
going<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.790> get<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.090> where<00:03:57.239> it's<00:03:57.359> not<00:03:57.510> going<00:03:57.720> to

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
going to get it where it's not going to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.949 
going to get it where it's not going to
warp<00:03:57.959> at<00:03:58.139> all<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:59.130> marvelous<00:03:59.959> hope

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
warp at all and that is marvelous hope
