there it is let's start leghul this one
this<00:02:22.720> when<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.960> perform<00:02:23.140> badly<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:24.070> try<00:02:24.280> that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
this when I perform badly just try that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.130 
this when I perform badly just try that
one<00:02:24.760> here<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.730> can<00:02:27.940> see<00:02:28.090> if<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.360> slide<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.720> to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
one here you can see if I slide it to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.110 
one here you can see if I slide it to
the<00:02:29.170> right<00:02:30.100> screen<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.790> not<00:02:30.850> moving<00:02:31.240> as<00:02:31.510> fast

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
the right screen is not moving as fast

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:42.990 
the right screen is not moving as fast
that<00:02:34.120> their<00:02:34.780> moves<00:02:35.910> try<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.510> again<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:42.850> can

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
that their moves try it again you can

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.480 
that their moves try it again you can
see<00:02:43.180> there's<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.960> lot<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.290> lag<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:47.650> totally

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
see there's a lot of lag it's totally

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.390 
see there's a lot of lag it's totally
jerky<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.960> can<00:02:50.110> see<00:02:50.320> there<00:02:52.620> stuttering<00:02:53.620> very

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
jerky you can see there stuttering very

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:03.510 
jerky you can see there stuttering very
badly

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.090 

now<00:03:04.120> let's<00:03:04.330> go<00:03:04.510> back

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.870 

so<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.760> first<00:03:11.000> thing<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:12.050> need<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.260> do<00:03:12.880> to

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
so the first thing you need to do to

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.020 
so the first thing you need to do to
make<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.240> gameplay<00:03:14.750> smooth<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:16.610> turn<00:03:16.820> off

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
make the gameplay smooth is to turn off

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.570 
make the gameplay smooth is to turn off
all<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.360> connections<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:18.800> is<00:03:18.950> basically

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
all the connections this is basically

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.760 
all the connections this is basically
done<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:20.060> get<00:03:20.210> rid<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.630> ads<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:21.200> come

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
done to get rid of the ads that come

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.270 
done to get rid of the ads that come
between<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.370> game<00:03:22.550> those<00:03:23.360> ads<00:03:23.890> use<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.130> your

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
between the game those ads use of your

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.270 
between the game those ads use of your
network<00:03:25.700> traffic<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.770> your<00:03:27.770> processing

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
network traffic and your processing

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.400 
network traffic and your processing
power<00:03:28.490> and<00:03:28.790> therefore<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.840> at<00:03:29.990> all<00:03:30.140> on<00:03:30.320> the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
power and therefore have at all on the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.230 
power and therefore have at all on the
game<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.800> it<00:03:31.280> slows<00:03:31.760> down<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.660> let's<00:03:33.820> turn<00:03:34.820> all

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
game and it slows down so let's turn all

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.420 
game and it slows down so let's turn all
connections<00:03:35.720> off<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.770> press<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.190> power

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
connections off you press the power

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.720 
connections off you press the power
button<00:03:37.490> for<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.420> few<00:03:38.510> seconds<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:39.830> you<00:03:40.550> get

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
button for a few seconds and you get

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.720 
button for a few seconds and you get
this<00:03:40.910> option<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:42.250> switch<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.670> airplane<00:03:44.390> mode

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.880 

there<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.790> go<00:03:49.940> now<00:03:50.810> all<00:03:51.020> connections<00:03:51.500> are<00:03:51.620> off

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.550
