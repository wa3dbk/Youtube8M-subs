00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 don't teach us to live 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.060
 I liked the criticism of Polish deputies 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.620
 according to the head of the Muslim Union 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.480
 Murada Tele Bekovo official Astana 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.160
 sent amida poland note about 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.349
 the inadmissibility of interference with 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.910
 internal affairs of our state you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.949
 know today poland is pretty 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.039
 I still think of an influential position 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.490
 Western Europe in general in the European Union in a b 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.670
 with e and therefore such an assessment to us all the same 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.880
 may have some impact here 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.460
 international institutions like this 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 bsm eu and general then it can be 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.140
 even affect certain 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 economic contacts with Kazakhstan 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.590
 partners from europe with polish deputies 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.450
 among which is Tomash Makovsky acute 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.890
 criticism did not allow themselves only drew 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.510
 the attention of their colleagues to the problem 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.789
 spread of religious extremism 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.550
 and respect human rights they know and 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.860
 political prisoners of our country 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.530
 say capital with with our 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.050
 delegation one member of the ruling party and 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.180
 2 opposition members we want to 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.100
 show that our country has the Urals 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.540
 dm we openly discuss the reason 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.700
 terrorism in the way of building 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.010
 political democracy we follow 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.140
 these processes and we want to make sure that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.080
 Kazakhstan is moving towards political 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.200
 democracy arte i him well slow 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.490
 languages 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.350
 by the way get a visa to Kazakhstan is not so 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.729
 just murat telibek sure this one 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.729
 of the reasons for which Polish deputies 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.340
 kept in utterances you know in 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.909
 principle 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.280
 during our conversation he noted that 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.280
 In principle, the passage is not really said 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.310
 listens to the opinion here and at one o'clock 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.799
 of the same bright example was given in 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.619
 respect let zhovtis and despite 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.090
 such a seemingly massive 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.429
 informational support 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.759
 connecting a powerful political lobby 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.060
 in the usa in western europe nevertheless it 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.579
 had no effect on 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.560
 Kazakhstan government apple of discord 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.780
 in the search for Kazakhstan relations could 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.979
 to become figures of omurbek tekebaev 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.689
 extradition of which Poland refused 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.729
 silence your own people 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.229
 chord succeeds almost after all 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.000
 high-profile cases because interference 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.930
 outside observers perceived 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.930
 so painful
