hey<00:00:00.989> all<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:01.560> so<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.770> talked<00:00:02.040> about<00:00:02.129> the

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hey all right so I talked about the

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.430 
hey all right so I talked about the
Denman<00:00:02.730> brush<00:00:02.760> last<00:00:03.689> summer<00:00:03.959> but<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.170> guess<00:00:04.319> I

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
Denman brush last summer but I guess I

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.559 
Denman brush last summer but I guess I
really<00:00:04.470> never<00:00:04.830> showed<00:00:05.160> how<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.879> use<00:00:06.150> it<00:00:06.390> and

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
really never showed how to use it and

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.960 
really never showed how to use it and
some<00:00:07.230> people<00:00:07.470> were<00:00:07.529> asking<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.670> know<00:00:08.820> it

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
some people were asking and I know it

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.629 
some people were asking and I know it
sounds<00:00:09.179> like<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.300> silly<00:00:09.510> question<00:00:09.719> but<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.920> guess

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
sounds like a silly question but I guess

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.310 
sounds like a silly question but I guess
the<00:00:11.759> kind<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> technique<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.840> using<00:00:13.200> it

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the kind of is a technique to using it

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.780 
the kind of is a technique to using it
actually<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> go<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.429> buy<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> whole<00:00:14.759> new

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
actually have to go and buy a whole new

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.400 
actually have to go and buy a whole new
one<00:00:15.089> do<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.240> have<00:00:15.420> no<00:00:15.690> idea<00:00:15.900> whether<00:00:16.020> my<00:00:16.230> old

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
one do that have no idea whether my old

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.750 
one do that have no idea whether my old
one<00:00:16.590> because<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.220> know<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.369> really<00:00:17.609> don't

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
one because that you know I really don't

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.460 
one because that you know I really don't
care<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.150> these<00:00:18.420> things<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.289> actually

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
care for these things but it actually

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.840 
care for these things but it actually
found<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.340> good<00:00:20.820> use<00:00:20.880> for<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:22.430> so<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
found a good use for it so this is the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:47.560 
found a good use for it so this is the
packaging<00:00:24.320> for<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.470> seven<00:00:26.460> or<00:00:26.550> eight<00:00:26.609> bucks

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.940 

my<00:00:48.570> hair<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> only<00:00:49.230> part<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.649> care<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
my hair and the only part that I care to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.619 
my hair and the only part that I care to
use<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.250> brush<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> front<00:00:51.329> I'll

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
use this brush for is the front I'll

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.020 
use this brush for is the front I'll
show<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:55.370> I've<00:00:56.370> said<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.670> many<00:00:56.789> other

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
show you what I've said in many other

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:10.670 
show you what I've said in many other
videos<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> doesn't<00:00:59.309> match<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:09.680> you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
videos so doesn't match but you know you

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.250 
videos so doesn't match but you know you
see<00:01:10.830> already<00:01:11.090> how<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.869> should<00:01:13.049> start

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
see already how it should start

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.950 
see already how it should start
shrinking<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> go<00:01:15.869> all

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
shrinking up and I don't like to go all

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.539 
shrinking up and I don't like to go all
the<00:01:16.020> way<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.380> root<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the way to the root because then it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.429 
the way to the root because then it
shrinks<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> way<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.080> I'm<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.290> going

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
shrinks all the way up so I'm just going

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.310 
shrinks all the way up so I'm just going
halfway<00:01:19.890> down<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.580> brush<00:01:21.270> through

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
halfway down and brush through

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.430 
halfway down and brush through
and<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:24.010> starts<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.900> curl<00:01:25.900> up<00:01:25.930> and<00:01:26.320> it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
and it starts to curl up and it

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.470 
and it starts to curl up and it
continues<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.250> do<00:01:27.400> so<00:01:27.430> as<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.880> dries<00:01:28.090> it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
continues to do so as it dries it

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.270 
continues to do so as it dries it
shrinks<00:01:28.510> up<00:01:28.930> more<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.770> get<00:01:29.950> these<00:01:30.070> really

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
shrinks up more and you get these really

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.570 
shrinks up more and you get these really
nice<00:01:30.550> little<00:01:31.380> spiral<00:01:32.380> things<00:01:32.620> here<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.100> it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
nice little spiral things here and it

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.090 
nice little spiral things here and it
matches<00:01:34.180> more<00:01:34.720> with<00:01:35.290> you<00:01:35.440> don't<00:01:35.590> my<00:01:35.680> spirals

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
matches more with you don't my spirals

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.250 
matches more with you don't my spirals
on<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.340> side<00:01:36.520> so<00:01:37.300> that's<00:01:37.510> what<00:01:37.660> I<00:01:37.690> use<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:38.050> for

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
on the side so that's what I use it for

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.070 
on the side so that's what I use it for
and<00:01:38.650> I<00:01:39.130> use<00:01:39.400> it<00:01:39.550> all<00:01:39.760> in<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.300> upper<00:01:40.390> part<00:01:40.960> of<00:01:41.020> my

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
and I use it all in the upper part of my

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.100 
and I use it all in the upper part of my
hair<00:01:41.560> because<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:42.400> is<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.420> problem<00:01:43.780> area

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
hair because that is the problem area

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.930 
hair because that is the problem area
with<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.410> curls<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.890> like<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.550> said<00:01:45.610> in

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
with the curls and like I said in

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.570 
with the curls and like I said in
another<00:01:46.150> video<00:01:46.390> it's<00:01:47.140> like<00:01:47.470> taking<00:01:48.100> scissors

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
another video it's like taking scissors

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.930 
another video it's like taking scissors
too<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.990> know<00:01:50.140> balloon<00:01:50.470> rhythm<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.580> glided

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
too you know balloon rhythm you glided

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.180 
too you know balloon rhythm you glided
along<00:01:52.150> and<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.810> shrivels<00:01:53.380> up<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.980> is<00:01:54.040> why<00:01:54.160> I

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
along and it shrivels up this is why I

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.620 
along and it shrivels up this is why I
don't<00:01:54.310> like<00:01:54.520> using<00:01:54.760> this<00:01:55.000> on<00:01:55.150> my<00:01:55.270> whole<00:01:55.450> head

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
don't like using this on my whole head

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.060 
don't like using this on my whole head
cuz<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.220> look<00:01:57.220> like<00:01:57.490> I<00:02:01.410> make<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:02.620> shrinkage

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
cuz I look like I make the shrinkage

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.490 
cuz I look like I make the shrinkage
that<00:02:03.310> much<00:02:03.880> worse<00:02:04.120> so<00:02:04.900> um<00:02:05.110> but<00:02:05.260> if<00:02:05.380> you're

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
that much worse so um but if you're

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.050 
that much worse so um but if you're
having<00:02:05.650> problems<00:02:05.890> with<00:02:06.190> defining<00:02:07.000> your
