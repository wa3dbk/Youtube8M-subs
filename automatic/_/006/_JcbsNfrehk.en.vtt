00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 in the projects in the clergy funds of 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.370
 back from this daily level I'm going to 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.429
 teach how to get money two 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.750
 ways I have that money faster is 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.269
 the way this ship bought me 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.090
 but I know it's shorter but 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.520
 good months but 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.670
 there are two ways until I'm from the 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.279
 way that I get good money the 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.550
 first would be with this with the seeds 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.070
 the ether these seeds are obtained from 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.160
 a strange way mostly when killing 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.550
 the last one to the giant servant of the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.670
 mission of the devils I think that it 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.230
 call 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.809
 it's here 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.559
 is when he kills the eye or when they kill 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.480
 the beetle is giant the tank is 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.000
 they will skip this seed the one that 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.640
 it can be the I can jump spectrum 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.650
 to get more lumen dominate by the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.839
 name those who say friends lasts 10 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.860
 good minutes once they get those 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.860
 seeds are going to return 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.300
 to the same mission is a little bit slow 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.060
 the process but cream that works 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.560
 in allegories the demons then 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.380
 when the 2 starts to deactivate the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.210
 orange door the lasers exist 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.550
 nothing else and they activate it and they put it for the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.990
 enemies for 10 minutes then it's 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.369
 enough time and the evaluation is 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.280
 a good number of hours of minus 1 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.770
 document time at least 17 thousand per 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.900
 try we can a way to get 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.520
 money pretty fast and good second 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.680
 way to get money is practically 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.210
 going to explore what they are going to do 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.160
 that war your map and it will be measured is a 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.110
 exploration which is the green icon not 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.540
 show here but it 's also screen 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.090
 and what all those posts do 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.649
 normally nothing on the wall is in the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.479
 walls on the right side where just 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.399
 pass and arrive then we will be 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.820
 stuck does not mess it up and in certain 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.410
 structures there boxes and good is 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.810
 boxes are quite more because if you do not 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.700
 they give money they also have weapons 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.619
 Standard armor or anything 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.150
 Have luck and if you have a lot of 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.350
 luck will give you until he 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:11.770
 the letter seeds that were called 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:13.970
 in these these cans in those boxes 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.280
 ivÃ¡ncsik walk for one in all that area 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.750
 and once that whole area is over 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.180
 or plainly want to explore others nothing 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.850
 more you follow this way from here 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.230
 they go down the hill that leads the area of 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.050
 planes 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.670
 aircraft the aircraft wreckage and it 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.170
 are stuck back to the wall of the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.510
 right this one attacks where there is one 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.010
 out there good I'm desperate for that 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.140
 see the places more or less where they are 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.360
 two little rooms that are repetitive in 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.370
 reality and they are just arriving one 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.950
 for a disaster there is also this but 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.600
 there the tubes and good once 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.920
 finish that duel they also come back from 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.860
 this side and they go downsizing play by 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.860
 cave because the checkpoint restarts and 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.720
 they will see again the boxes that if not 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.420
 they grab nasa grabbing three of them 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.769
 others appear flat and good would be 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.430
 basically the way to get 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.320
 money in a good way about 10-15 mind 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.300
 will be a good amount money and in 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.180
 this box for example I always tell them to 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.379
 times of armors 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.319
 and those wells coded something like that and it's 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.180
 basically in this way the two evils 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.670
 that you already see the enjoyment of selling 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.319
 cinema that is last day Saturday and we 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.069
 we go in the full version sting and 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.069
 until then
