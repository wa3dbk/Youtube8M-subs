00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:01:03.700 

I<00:00:46.600> just<00:00:47.410> slide<00:00:47.680> down<00:00:47.710> it<00:00:48.130> off<00:00:50.070> okay

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:25.190

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.899 

so<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.860> size<00:01:26.280> difference<00:01:28.219> really<00:01:29.219> small<00:01:29.640> view

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so the size difference really small view

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.130 
so the size difference really small view
into<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.119> tops<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.570> almost<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> same

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
into the tops are almost at the same

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.800 
into the tops are almost at the same
spot<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> bottom<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.450> looks<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:36.780> of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
spot so is the bottom so looks kind of

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:53.469 
spot so is the bottom so looks kind of
like<00:01:36.869> that

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:05.990 

singleplayer<00:02:04.429> you<00:02:05.429> should<00:02:05.609> definitely<00:02:05.759> I'm

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
singleplayer you should definitely I'm

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.920 
singleplayer you should definitely I'm
never<00:02:06.210> gonna<00:02:06.360> give<00:02:06.569> you<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:07.049> your

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:35.720 

expertise

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.950 

and<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.970> closed<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.360> part<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.690> screen

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
and it closed that part of the screen

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.530 
and it closed that part of the screen
and<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.770> couldn't<00:02:39.010> make<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.190> bigger<00:02:39.540> like

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
and I couldn't make it bigger like

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.930 
and I couldn't make it bigger like
setting<00:02:40.900> some<00:02:41.050> more<00:02:41.170> tape<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.650> bottom<00:02:41.940> see

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
setting some more tape on the bottom see

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.780 
setting some more tape on the bottom see
when<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.120> take<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.330> off<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.660> notebook<00:02:43.990> slower

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
when I take it off the notebook slower

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.310 
when I take it off the notebook slower
so<00:02:45.790> looks<00:02:46.210> like<00:02:46.270> hi<00:02:46.480> Christine<00:02:49.320> cover

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
so looks like hi Christine cover

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.280 
so looks like hi Christine cover
