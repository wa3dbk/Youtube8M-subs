00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
some of these those an axe some kind of

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.889 
some of these those an axe some kind of
speeder<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:59.420> like<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> said<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> haven't

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
speeder and like I said I haven't

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.840 
speeder and like I said I haven't
learned<00:02:01.259> how<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> play<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.920> yet<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> don't

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
learned how to play this yet so I don't

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.639 
learned how to play this yet so I don't
really<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:03.210> what<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:03.600> about<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.889 

guess<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> premise<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.369> they're<00:02:09.179> powered<00:02:09.690> by

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
guess the premise is they're powered by

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.979 
guess the premise is they're powered by
Chi<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.610> these<00:02:11.610> crystals<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.390> something<00:02:12.840> to

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
Chi and these crystals have something to

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
Chi and these crystals have something to
do<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.410> game

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
do with the game

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.940 
do with the game
-<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:15.120> these<00:02:15.810> are<00:02:16.080> their<00:02:16.200> main<00:02:16.410> swords<00:02:16.890> I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
- and these are their main swords I

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.200 
- and these are their main swords I
didn't<00:02:17.160> put<00:02:17.310> them<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.550> just<00:02:17.850> want<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.090> show

didn't put them on I just want to show
you<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.420> difference<00:02:18.750> these<00:02:19.350> are<00:02:19.530> their<00:02:19.650> chief

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
little mechanism bikes which are really

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.600 
little mechanism bikes which are really
cool<00:02:39.450> they're<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:39.900> battle<00:02:40.340> equipment<00:02:41.340> on

the pull cord right in here like this

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.680 
the pull cord right in here like this
right<00:03:28.080> there<00:03:28.110> by<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.500> wheel<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.420> simply

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
right there by the wheel and you simply

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.790 
right there by the wheel and you simply
just<00:03:31.880> wheel<00:03:32.880> go<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.870> don't<00:03:34.260> want<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.620> run

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
just wheel go and I don't want it to run

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.920 
just wheel go and I don't want it to run
off<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.070> run<00:03:35.250> into<00:03:35.489> everything<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:35.930> pretty

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
off and run into everything but pretty

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.860 
off and run into everything but pretty
much<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.290> momentum<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.580> speed<00:03:38.870> I'll

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
much it just momentum and speed I'll

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.590 
much it just momentum and speed I'll
show<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.430> some<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.580> how<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.150> works<00:03:42.390> in<00:03:42.510> a

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
show you some of how this works in a

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.590 
show you some of how this works in a
second<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.920> uh<00:03:43.950> let's<00:03:44.820> say<00:03:45.030> you're<00:03:45.269> heading

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
second you uh let's say you're heading

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.720 
second you uh let's say you're heading
for<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.870> target<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.739> center<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.519> red

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
for that target in the center the red

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.870 
for that target in the center the red
God<00:03:48.650> put<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.800> in<00:03:49.920> there<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.489> with<00:03:50.790> the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
God put that in there like this with the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.020 
God put that in there like this with the
ripcord<00:03:51.330> put<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.290> there<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.590> bam<00:03:52.980> well<00:03:53.489> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
ripcord put it in there and bam well it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.670 
ripcord put it in there and bam well it
didn't<00:03:54.269> really<00:03:54.300> work<00:03:54.480> what<00:03:57.230> if<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.440> had<00:03:58.530> more

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
didn't really work what if I had more

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.340 
didn't really work what if I had more
room<00:03:58.739> I'd<00:03:59.070> show<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.880> get<00:04:00.030> some

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
room I'd show you and you get some

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.960 
room I'd show you and you get some
things<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.560> play<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.800> game<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.310> powerup<00:04:02.730> I

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
things to play the game like a powerup I

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.580 
things to play the game like a powerup I
think<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.300> is<00:04:03.420> what<00:04:03.570> this<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.870> coal<00:04:04.110> with

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
think this is what this is coal with

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.680 
think this is what this is coal with
another<00:04:04.890> one<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.130> orbs<00:04:05.519> if<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.269> hit<00:04:06.450> this

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
another one that orbs if you hit this

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.930 
another one that orbs if you hit this
hard<00:04:06.930> enough<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.650> flips<00:04:07.950> an<00:04:08.160> orb<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.820> it's

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
hard enough that flips an orb and it's

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.430 
hard enough that flips an orb and it's
supposed<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.209> come<00:04:09.360> over<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.690> top<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.959> and

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
supposed to come over the top and and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.759 
supposed to come over the top and and
there<00:04:11.130> but<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:12.049> said<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.080> have<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.410> beat<00:04:13.560> I'm

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
there but I said I have to beat I'm

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.440 
there but I said I have to beat I'm
really<00:04:14.100> good<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:14.430> that's<00:04:14.549> overall<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.150> set

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
really good but that's overall this set

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.020 
really good but that's overall this set
you<00:04:16.200> do<00:04:16.350> get<00:04:16.500> another<00:04:16.739> ramp<00:04:17.070> with<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.549> to

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you do get another ramp with this to

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.759 
you do get another ramp with this to
speed<00:04:18.390> or<00:04:18.510> it's<00:04:18.630> really<00:04:18.840> cool<00:04:19.019> nice<00:04:19.470> little

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769
