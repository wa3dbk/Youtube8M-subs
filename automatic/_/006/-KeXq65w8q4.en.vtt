00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.050
 planned 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.980
 then this method is used generically then 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.210
 even very good 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.550

 west first column know keeper 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.380
 directly will always 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.660
 I reach the loop 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.230
 on the hook formed two 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.120
 loops 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.430
 their and checked

 my popcorn filling method 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.690
 general non-traditional 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.310
 but it is not convenient because it does not have to 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.460
 first off and off the hook 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920
 secondly it turns out 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.820
 pretty plump so 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.330

 four 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.299
 it is important to open an account then 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.149
 first bar 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.119
 and pull the thread 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.119
 on a hook and two loops them and nice 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.719
 Yes very 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.719
