00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
after calm with the Lumia 900 review

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.310 
after calm with the Lumia 900 review
here<00:00:15.419> I'm<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.809> quickly<00:00:15.929> compare

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
here I'm just going to quickly compare

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.710 
here I'm just going to quickly compare
it<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> Lumia<00:00:16.920> 800<00:00:17.609> now<00:00:18.150> we're<00:00:18.300> running<00:00:18.420> it

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
it to the Lumia 800 now we're running it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.019 
it to the Lumia 800 now we're running it
on<00:00:18.900> device<00:00:19.289> diagnostic<00:00:20.100> tool<00:00:20.369> let's<00:00:20.910> not

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
on device diagnostic tool let's not

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.880 
on device diagnostic tool let's not
quickly<00:00:21.660> prepare<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> battery<00:00:22.470> output<00:00:22.800> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
quickly prepare the battery output you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310 
quickly prepare the battery output you
can<00:00:23.010> actually<00:00:23.099> see<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:24.090> Lumia<00:00:24.390> 800<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:25.140> on

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
can actually see the Lumia 800 here on

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.359 
can actually see the Lumia 800 here on
the<00:00:25.680> left<00:00:25.949> has<00:00:26.250> about<00:00:26.810> 180<00:00:27.810> milling<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the left has about 180 milling and the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.490 
the left has about 180 milling and the
900<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.210> doing<00:00:30.390> about<00:00:30.480> 140<00:00:31.320> million

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
900 is actually doing about 140 million

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
900 is actually doing about 140 million
amps<00:00:31.830> spiking<00:00:32.310> a<00:00:32.370> little<00:00:32.610> bit<00:00:32.760> here<00:00:32.970> probably

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
amps spiking a little bit here probably

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.570 
amps spiking a little bit here probably
with<00:00:33.480> live<00:00:33.660> tile<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.170> email<00:00:34.470> checking<00:00:34.920> but

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
with live tile and email checking but

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.810 
with live tile and email checking but
overall<00:00:36.300> pretty<00:00:36.920> similar<00:00:37.920> usage<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
overall pretty similar usage here for a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.100 
overall pretty similar usage here for a
battery<00:00:39.240> output<00:00:39.660> which<00:00:39.810> is<00:00:39.840> pretty

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
battery output which is pretty

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
battery output which is pretty
impressive<00:00:40.260> considering<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.130> a<00:00:41.220> 4.3

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
impressive considering this is a 4.3

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.730 
impressive considering this is a 4.3
inch<00:00:41.940> screen<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.600> course<00:00:42.750> that's<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> 3.7

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
inch screen and of course that's the 3.7

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.410 
inch screen and of course that's the 3.7
you<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.310> the<00:00:44.400> brightness<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.300> bit

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
you see the brightness is a little bit

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.090 
you see the brightness is a little bit
different<00:00:45.750> between<00:00:45.810> the<00:00:46.140> two<00:00:46.170> devices<00:00:46.620> here

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
different between the two devices here

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.190 
different between the two devices here
but<00:00:47.610> basically<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.330> battery<00:00:48.630> life<00:00:48.810> seems<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
but basically the battery life seems to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.870 
but basically the battery life seems to
be<00:00:49.410> really<00:00:49.590> attenuated<00:00:50.220> pretty<00:00:50.460> well<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.850> that

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
be really attenuated pretty well on that

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.000 
be really attenuated pretty well on that
900<00:00:51.630> which<00:00:51.780> results<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> seven<00:00:52.890> hour

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
900 which results in that seven hour

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
900 which results in that seven hour
battery<00:00:53.130> life<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.480> think<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
battery life and what we think is a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.360 
battery life and what we think is a
pretty<00:00:54.960> outstanding<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.920> high<00:00:56.040> number<00:00:56.340> for

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
pretty outstanding and high number for

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.920 
pretty outstanding and high number for
our<00:00:56.520> Windows<00:00:56.880> Phone<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.360> should<00:00:57.690> give<00:00:57.840> you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
our Windows Phone it should give you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
our Windows Phone it should give you
about<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.110> good<00:00:58.380> day<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.740> half<00:00:58.950> of<00:00:59.220> regular

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
about a good day and a half of regular

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.880 
about a good day and a half of regular
to<00:00:59.820> moderate<00:01:00.120> usage<00:01:00.330> now<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.500> back<00:01:01.680> out

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to moderate usage now if we back out

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
to moderate usage now if we back out
here<00:01:02.310> we'll<00:01:02.550> check<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.880> a<00:01:02.910> couple<00:01:03.240> things<00:01:03.420> if

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
here we'll check out a couple things if

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.050 
here we'll check out a couple things if
you<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> gyroscope<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.160> course<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> 800

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
you go to gyroscope of course the 800

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.640 
you go to gyroscope of course the 800
does<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.330> even<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.840> gyroscope<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
does not even have a gyroscope so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.100 
does not even have a gyroscope so
nothing<00:01:07.980> turns<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.030> 900<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.780> premier

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
nothing turns out the 900 a premier

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
nothing turns out the 900 a premier
device<00:01:10.410> of<00:01:10.620> course<00:01:10.650> does<00:01:11.190> you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.940> kind<00:01:12.120> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
device of course does you can kind of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.550 
device of course does you can kind of
rotate<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.660> around<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.110> bit<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> can

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
rotate this around a little bit you can

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.370 
rotate this around a little bit you can
see<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> dice<00:01:14.040> moving<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.090> nice<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.870> see<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
see the dice moving so nice to see the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.640 
see the dice moving so nice to see the
gyroscope<00:01:16.980> on<00:01:17.460> board<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.660> a<00:01:18.690> 900<00:01:19.320> it's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
gyroscope on board here with a 900 it's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950 
gyroscope on board here with a 900 it's
a<00:01:19.770> premium<00:01:20.190> feature<00:01:20.460> kind<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> wish<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.510> 800

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
a premium feature kind of wish the 800

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.220 
a premium feature kind of wish the 800
had<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
had it but so be it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.080 
had it but so be it
under<00:01:25.230> hardware<00:01:25.590> buttons<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.670> actually

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
under hardware buttons you can actually

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.590 
under hardware buttons you can actually
see<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.600> distinction<00:01:28.260> here<00:01:28.760> on<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.970> 800

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
see a little distinction here on the 800

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.820 
see a little distinction here on the 800
it's<00:01:30.750> kind<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:30.990> hard<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.440> you<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
it's kind of hard to see you with the

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.550 
it's kind of hard to see you with the
light<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.340> these<00:01:32.850> keys<00:01:33.210> are<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:33.600> lit<00:01:34.380> up

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
light but these keys are actually lit up

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.490 
light but these keys are actually lit up
right<00:01:34.890> now<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.510> 900<00:01:37.080> they<00:01:37.230> don't

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
right now and on the 900 they don't

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.560 
right now and on the 900 they don't
light<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.760> to<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.210> touch

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
light the I'm going to do when you touch

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.290 
light the I'm going to do when you touch
them<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.400> back<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.120> of

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
them but so if I back out there of

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.810 
them but so if I back out there of
course<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.990> briefly<00:01:43.500> light<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.580> I<00:01:44.670> go

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
course they briefly light up but if I go

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.820 
course they briefly light up but if I go
back<00:01:44.970> into<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.420> app<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.900> hit<00:01:46.440> accept<00:01:46.680> you

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
back into the app and hit accept you

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.260 
back into the app and hit accept you
could<00:01:46.979> see<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.340> turned<00:01:47.729> off<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.940> little

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
could see they just turned off a little

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.950 
could see they just turned off a little
bit<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:49.550> that<00:01:50.550> is<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.760> an<00:01:51.540> important

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
bit so that is a an important

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.649 
bit so that is a an important
distinction<00:01:52.380> between<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.800> 900<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.550> 800<00:01:54.060> 800

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
distinction between a 900 and 800 800

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
distinction between a 900 and 800 800
they<00:01:54.750> basically<00:01:55.020> stay<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> whole<00:01:55.860> time

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
they basically stay on the whole time

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.460 
they basically stay on the whole time
it's<00:01:56.430> kind<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.729> nice<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.510> 900<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.080> don't<00:01:58.290> do

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
it's kind of nice the 900 they don't do

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.469 
it's kind of nice the 900 they don't do
that<00:01:58.680> presumably<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.909> way<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.060> save

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
that presumably it's a way to save

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.969 
that presumably it's a way to save
battery<00:02:00.840> power<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.440> it<00:02:01.530> may<00:02:01.620> be<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.920> reason

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
battery power and it may be one reason

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
battery power and it may be one reason
why<00:02:02.370> we<00:02:02.400> see<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.760> difference<00:02:03.090> between<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
why we see the difference between the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.750 
why we see the difference between the
two<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.799> what<00:02:04.950> make<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.190> actually<00:02:05.370> change

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
two that's what make it actually change

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.900 
two that's what make it actually change
later<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.090> maybe<00:02:06.630> they<00:02:06.840> will<00:02:07.340> it's<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.550> bad

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
later on maybe they will it's not a bad

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.240 
later on maybe they will it's not a bad
thing<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.600> sometimes<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.470> when<00:02:10.709> stark<00:02:11.039> is

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
thing but sometimes in when stark is

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.920 
thing but sometimes in when stark is
nice<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.700> those<00:02:11.850> keys<00:02:12.090> illuminated

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
nice to have those keys illuminated

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.990 
nice to have those keys illuminated
well<00:02:13.019> you<00:02:13.110> know<00:02:13.170> permanently<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.879> an

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
well you know permanently so that is an

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.369 
well you know permanently so that is an
important<00:02:15.329> distinction<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:15.930> can<00:02:16.049> see<00:02:16.230> it's

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
important distinction you can see it's

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.600 
important distinction you can see it's
actually<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.739> hair<00:02:16.920> lights<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.430> could

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
actually in the hair lights we could

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.440 
actually in the hair lights we could
test<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:18.000> under<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.260> magnetar<00:02:20.040> here<00:02:20.450> I'm

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
test that under the magnetar here I'm

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.850 
test that under the magnetar here I'm
pronouncing<00:02:21.689> out<00:02:21.989> life<00:02:22.170> probably<00:02:22.590> not

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
pronouncing out life probably not

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.679 
pronouncing out life probably not
there's<00:02:23.640> actually<00:02:23.760> important<00:02:24.420> distinction

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
there's actually important distinction

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.259 
there's actually important distinction
here<00:02:24.959> with<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.200> compass<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.709> don't<00:02:25.920> know<00:02:26.010> why

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
here with the compass I don't know why

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.929 
here with the compass I don't know why
this<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.629> but<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:29.040> actually<00:02:29.189> see<00:02:29.370> how

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
this is but you can actually see how

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.440 
this is but you can actually see how
they<00:02:30.209> kind<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.540> behave<00:02:30.840> differently<00:02:31.379> I<00:02:32.450> don't

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
they kind of behave differently I don't

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.030 
they kind of behave differently I don't
know<00:02:33.540> why<00:02:33.659> that<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.959> with<00:02:34.170> Windows<00:02:34.470> Phone<00:02:34.680> and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
know why that is with Windows Phone and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.030 
know why that is with Windows Phone and
there<00:02:35.579> is<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> process<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.599> diagnostic<00:02:37.349> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
there is a process of diagnostic you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.080 
there is a process of diagnostic you
know<00:02:38.129> thing<00:02:38.430> there<00:02:38.579> that<00:02:38.700> needs<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:39.030> be

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
know thing there that needs to be

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.520 
know thing there that needs to be
addressed<00:02:39.359> or<00:02:39.629> fixed<00:02:40.049> but<00:02:40.170> there<00:02:40.349> is<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
addressed or fixed but there is a

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.990 
addressed or fixed but there is a
difference<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.159> test<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.459> on<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:41.640> couple<00:02:41.790> of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
difference that test this on a couple of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.199 
difference that test this on a couple of
these<00:02:42.090> phones<00:02:42.390> already<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:45.120> know

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
these phones already and so you know

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.789 
these phones already and so you know
that<00:02:45.629> reading<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.109> very<00:02:46.139> off<00:02:48.409> when<00:02:49.409> we<00:02:49.470> go<00:02:49.590> back

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
that reading is very off when we go back

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.699 
that reading is very off when we go back
here<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.609> test<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.090> speaker<00:02:51.690> now<00:02:52.530> there's

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
here we can test the speaker now there's

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.280 
here we can test the speaker now there's
going<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:52.920> be<00:02:52.980> hard<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.329> listen<00:02:54.329> to<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.750> video

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
going to be hard to listen to on video

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.710 
going to be hard to listen to on video
but<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:56.010> say<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.879> difference<00:02:57.510> is

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
but I can say this the difference is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.530 
but I can say this the difference is
pretty<00:02:58.560> intense<00:02:59.459> at<00:02:59.819> least<00:03:00.000> between<00:03:00.420> these

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
pretty intense at least between these

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.839 
pretty intense at least between these
two<00:03:00.689> devices<00:03:00.930> both<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.159> same<00:03:02.189> speaker

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
two devices both have the same speaker

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:13.100 
two devices both have the same speaker
they're<00:03:03.329> both<00:03:03.510> at<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.750> bottom<00:03:03.870> here

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.850 

now<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.170> volume<00:03:14.320> is<00:03:14.560> set<00:03:14.740> a<00:03:14.770> little

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
now the volume is set a little

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.020 
now the volume is set a little
differently<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.340> that's<00:03:15.700> not<00:03:15.850> what<00:03:15.970> I'm

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
differently so that's not what I'm

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.450 
differently so that's not what I'm
talking<00:03:16.240> about<00:03:16.480> well<00:03:17.080> interest<00:03:17.980> me<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.220> on<00:03:18.400> the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
talking about well interest me is on the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.190 
talking about well interest me is on the
900<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.120> sound<00:03:19.360> actually<00:03:19.540> sounds<00:03:19.960> like<00:03:20.050> it's

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
900 the sound actually sounds like it's

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.170 
900 the sound actually sounds like it's
coming<00:03:20.260> from<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.130> device<00:03:21.370> itself<00:03:21.790> coming<00:03:22.030> up

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
coming from the device itself coming up

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.000 
coming from the device itself coming up
from<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.690> screen<00:03:22.900> where<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.500> 800<00:03:23.920> it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
from the screen where it's on the 800 it

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.290 
from the screen where it's on the 800 it
feels<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:24.340> it's<00:03:24.490> projecting<00:03:25.000> from<00:03:25.210> the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
feels like it's projecting from the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.150 
feels like it's projecting from the
bottom<00:03:25.660> in<00:03:26.020> that<00:03:26.140> sense<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.500> 900<00:03:26.920> actually

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
bottom in that sense the 900 actually

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.820 
bottom in that sense the 900 actually
has<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.310> better<00:03:27.580> sound<00:03:27.970> quality<00:03:28.120> in<00:03:28.570> my<00:03:28.720> opinion

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
has a better sound quality in my opinion

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.230 
has a better sound quality in my opinion
because<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.010> sound<00:03:30.220> actually<00:03:30.550> said<00:03:30.820> does

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
because the sound actually said does

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.640 
because the sound actually said does
some<00:03:31.420> sort<00:03:31.630> of<00:03:31.660> simulation<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.290> seems<00:03:32.500> like

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
some sort of simulation it seems like

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.410 
some sort of simulation it seems like
where<00:03:32.860> it's<00:03:33.430> actually<00:03:33.790> coming<00:03:34.090> from<00:03:34.270> the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
where it's actually coming from the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.790 
where it's actually coming from the
device<00:03:34.750> it's<00:03:35.020> more<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.380> surround

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
device it's more of a surround

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.310 
device it's more of a surround
experience<00:03:36.550> versus<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.270> 800<00:03:37.810> which<00:03:37.990> I<00:03:38.110> said

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
experience versus the 800 which I said

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.230 
experience versus the 800 which I said
like<00:03:38.500> comes<00:03:39.130> more<00:03:39.430> from<00:03:39.460> the<00:03:39.640> bottom<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.180> you

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
like comes more from the bottom and you

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.760 
like comes more from the bottom and you
kind<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.540> feel<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.780> projection<00:03:41.320> difference

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
kind of feel that projection difference

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.320 
kind of feel that projection difference
finally<00:03:44.770> uh<00:03:44.800> well<00:03:45.520> actually<00:03:45.730> two<00:03:46.000> more<00:03:46.120> things

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
finally uh well actually two more things

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.920 
finally uh well actually two more things
under<00:03:46.930> touch<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:49.209> is<00:03:49.390> kind<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.660> interesting

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
under touch this is kind of interesting

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.430 
under touch this is kind of interesting
now<00:03:50.320> on<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:51.040> 800<00:03:51.610> when<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:51.880> draw<00:03:52.810> something

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
now on the 800 when you draw something

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.290 
now on the 800 when you draw something
with<00:03:53.650> your<00:03:54.100> finger<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.520> can<00:03:54.550> you<00:03:54.730> sort<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.030> see

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
with your finger you can you sort of see

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.870 
with your finger you can you sort of see
the<00:03:55.450> line<00:03:55.660> follows<00:03:56.230> my<00:03:56.380> finger<00:03:56.680> directly<00:03:57.160> but

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
the line follows my finger directly but

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.840 
the line follows my finger directly but
on<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.090> 900<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.370> it's<00:04:00.370> going<00:04:00.490> to<00:04:00.580> be<00:04:00.640> hard<00:04:00.820> for

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
on the 900 and it's going to be hard for

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.550 
on the 900 and it's going to be hard for
you<00:04:01.060> guys<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.209> see<00:04:01.660> but<00:04:01.900> there's<00:04:02.050> actually<00:04:02.260> a

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
you guys to see but there's actually a

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.740 
you guys to see but there's actually a
space<00:04:03.070> between<00:04:03.340> my<00:04:03.700> finger<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:07.510> line

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
space between my finger and the the line

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.020 
space between my finger and the the line
that's<00:04:07.959> being<00:04:08.170> drawn<00:04:08.610> so<00:04:09.610> there's<00:04:09.760> actually<00:04:09.850> a

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
that's being drawn so there's actually a

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.940 
that's being drawn so there's actually a
slight<00:04:10.510> delay<00:04:10.720> between<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.590> when<00:04:11.860> the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
slight delay between that and when the

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.270 
slight delay between that and when the
screen<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.310> catching<00:04:12.970> up<00:04:13.320> versus<00:04:14.320> on<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.769> 800

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
screen is catching up versus on the 800

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.460 
screen is catching up versus on the 800
which<00:04:18.400> seems<00:04:18.669> more<00:04:18.880> instinct<00:04:19.480> now<00:04:20.049> I'm<00:04:20.290> not

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
which seems more instinct now I'm not

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.190 
which seems more instinct now I'm not
sure<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.620> actually<00:04:21.070> translates<00:04:21.519> into

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
sure that actually translates into

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.530 
sure that actually translates into
real-world<00:04:23.580> differences<00:04:24.580> between<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:25.000> devices

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
real-world differences between a devices

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.870 
real-world differences between a devices
but<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.260> looks<00:04:26.530> like<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.740> 800<00:04:27.190> touch

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
but it looks like the 800 touch

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.940 
but it looks like the 800 touch
capability<00:04:28.570> is<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.720> little<00:04:29.200> more<00:04:29.350> sensitive

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
capability is a little more sensitive

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.500 
capability is a little more sensitive
I'm<00:04:30.850> curious<00:04:31.240> as<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:31.450> why<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:32.050> is<00:04:32.080> but<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:33.130> is

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
I'm curious as to why that is but it is

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.090 
I'm curious as to why that is but it is
one<00:04:34.510> file<00:04:34.720> distinction<00:04:35.200> is<00:04:35.290> between<00:04:35.410> vibra

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
one file distinction is between vibra

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.100 
one file distinction is between vibra
that<00:04:36.940> is<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.210> vibrate<00:04:37.540> function<00:04:37.750> on<00:04:38.080> both

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
that is the vibrate function on both

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.140 
that is the vibrate function on both
devices<00:04:38.470> now<00:04:39.370> on<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:40.080> 800<00:04:42.540> it's<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.660> nice<00:04:43.930> quiet

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
devices now on the 800 it's a nice quiet

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.310 
devices now on the 800 it's a nice quiet
vibration<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.390> it<00:04:46.479> works<00:04:46.630> really<00:04:46.870> well<00:04:46.990> I

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
vibration and it works really well I

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.140 
vibration and it works really well I
really<00:04:47.650> like<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.830> 800<00:04:48.190> vibrate<00:04:48.580> feature<00:04:48.790> on

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
really like the 800 vibrate feature on

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.980 
really like the 800 vibrate feature on
the<00:04:49.570> 900<00:04:50.260> though<00:04:50.760> it's<00:04:51.760> a<00:04:51.910> loud<00:04:52.180> vibrate<00:04:52.870> I

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
the 900 though it's a loud vibrate I

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.900 
the 900 though it's a loud vibrate I
mean<00:04:53.169> yet<00:04:53.380> it's<00:04:53.979> effective<00:04:54.460> you'll<00:04:54.640> fill<00:04:54.880> in

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
mean yet it's effective you'll fill in

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.150 
mean yet it's effective you'll fill in
your<00:04:55.150> pocket<00:04:55.600> but<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:56.020> has<00:04:56.229> this<00:04:56.380> weird<00:04:56.620> rattle

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
your pocket but it has this weird rattle

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.850 
your pocket but it has this weird rattle
to<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:59.740> hear<00:04:59.919> that

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.469 

it's<00:05:03.860> almost<00:05:04.039> like<00:05:04.249> an<00:05:04.430> electric<00:05:04.849> razor<00:05:05.120> and

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
it's almost like an electric razor and

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.529 
it's almost like an electric razor and
it's<00:05:06.110> kind<00:05:06.469> of<00:05:06.939> borderline<00:05:07.939> annoying

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
it's kind of borderline annoying

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:09.730 
it's kind of borderline annoying
actually<00:05:08.960> thought<00:05:09.349> there<00:05:09.469> was<00:05:09.620> something

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
actually thought there was something

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.019 
actually thought there was something
wrong<00:05:10.009> with<00:05:10.219> a<00:05:10.249> vibrate<00:05:10.639> feature<00:05:10.849> I'm<00:05:10.999> going

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:11.029 
wrong with a vibrate feature I'm going

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.999 
wrong with a vibrate feature I'm going
to<00:05:11.150> 900<00:05:11.599> but<00:05:11.689> turns<00:05:11.900> out<00:05:12.110> I've<00:05:12.499> test<00:05:12.740> this<00:05:12.860> on

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
to 900 but turns out I've test this on

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.579 
to 900 but turns out I've test this on
another<00:05:13.219> version<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:14.199> that's<00:05:15.199> just<00:05:15.379> the<00:05:15.469> way

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:15.589 
another version and that's just the way

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:22.420 
another version and that's just the way
it<00:05:15.680> is<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.219> you<00:05:16.309> can<00:05:16.460> hear<00:05:16.610> once<00:05:16.789> again<00:05:21.189> so<00:05:22.189> the

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
it is so you can hear once again so the

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.579 
it is so you can hear once again so the
900<00:05:22.849> definitely<00:05:23.270> has<00:05:23.419> a<00:05:23.449> more<00:05:23.629> metallic

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:24.589 
900 definitely has a more metallic

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:27.610 
900 definitely has a more metallic
rattle<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.759> it<00:05:25.909> when<00:05:26.059> it<00:05:26.180> vibrates<00:05:26.659> it's<00:05:27.409> not<00:05:27.589> a

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
rattle to it when it vibrates it's not a

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.619 
rattle to it when it vibrates it's not a
deal-killer<00:05:27.860> too<00:05:28.339> little<00:05:28.580> annoyance<00:05:29.210> like<00:05:29.539> he

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
deal-killer too little annoyance like he

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.939 
deal-killer too little annoyance like he
said<00:05:29.779> it's<00:05:29.870> still<00:05:29.930> a<00:05:30.080> strong<00:05:30.379> vibrate<00:05:30.860> so

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
said it's still a strong vibrate so

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.799 
said it's still a strong vibrate so
you'll<00:05:31.099> feel<00:05:31.370> in<00:05:31.550> your<00:05:31.669> pocket<00:05:32.120> but<00:05:32.569> that's<00:05:32.689> an

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:32.809 
you'll feel in your pocket but that's an

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:33.999 
you'll feel in your pocket but that's an
important<00:05:33.169> distinction<00:05:33.439> I<00:05:33.589> kind<00:05:33.800> of<00:05:33.830> wish

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
important distinction I kind of wish

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.769 
important distinction I kind of wish
shows<00:05:34.129> a<00:05:34.159> little<00:05:34.370> better<00:05:34.610> under<00:05:34.819> 900<00:05:35.330> but<00:05:35.509> it

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779 
shows a little better under 900 but it

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.809 
shows a little better under 900 but it
is<00:05:35.930> what<00:05:36.169> it<00:05:36.289> is<00:05:36.439> so<00:05:36.949> there<00:05:37.249> you<00:05:37.370> go<00:05:37.490> those<00:05:37.759> are

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
is what it is so there you go those are
