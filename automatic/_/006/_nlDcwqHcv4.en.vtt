can be a very stressful difficult time
as<00:00:48.380> it<00:00:48.530> is<00:00:48.739> you're<00:00:49.309> having<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.700> make<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.940> right

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
as it is you're having to make the right

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
choices about what care is needed and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.799 
choices about what care is needed and
who's<00:00:52.129> going<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:52.430> provide<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.270> then<00:00:53.690> of

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
who's going to provide that and then of

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.210 
who's going to provide that and then of
course<00:00:54.020> comes<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.440> worry<00:00:54.620> in<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.890> issue<00:00:55.010> of

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
course comes the worry in the issue of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.000 
course comes the worry in the issue of
how<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.760> pay<00:00:55.940> for<00:00:55.970> it<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:56.629> it<00:00:57.590> really<00:00:57.890> is

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
how to pay for it so it really is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.740 
how to pay for it so it really is
important<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.550> get<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.970> right<00:00:59.000> advice<00:00:59.390> from

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
important to get the right advice from

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.290 
important to get the right advice from
the<00:00:59.900> right<00:01:00.050> place<00:01:00.309> one<00:01:01.309> of<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.489> questions<00:01:01.879> we

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
the right place one of the questions we

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.689 
the right place one of the questions we
most<00:01:02.660> commonly<00:01:03.050> are<00:01:03.170> asked<00:01:03.620> is<00:01:03.800> how<00:01:04.250> does<00:01:04.519> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
most commonly are asked is how does the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.710 
most commonly are asked is how does the
system<00:01:04.879> work<00:01:05.089> so<00:01:05.660> we<00:01:05.810> have<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.170> just<00:01:06.860> clear<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
system work so we have to just clear the

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.060 
system work so we have to just clear the
rules<00:01:08.720> really<00:01:08.990> around<00:01:09.410> that<00:01:09.530> making<00:01:10.040> sure

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
rules really around that making sure

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.190 
rules really around that making sure
people<00:01:10.550> know<00:01:10.790> what<00:01:11.300> benefits<00:01:11.509> they<00:01:11.869> might<00:01:12.050> be

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
people know what benefits they might be

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.660 
people know what benefits they might be
able<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.409> claim<00:01:12.710> some<00:01:13.100> people<00:01:13.369> are<00:01:13.460> unaware

be worried about what would happen if

it's<00:01:36.170> quite<00:01:36.500> again<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.100> distressing<00:01:37.550> scenario

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
it's quite again a distressing scenario

it's quite again a distressing scenario
to<00:01:38.690> envisage<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.470> it's<00:01:39.740> really<00:01:39.979> important<00:01:40.520> to

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
to envisage so it's really important to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.440 
to envisage so it's really important to
get<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:40.940> advice<00:01:41.210> at<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:42.110> time<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:43.310> other

assumption<00:01:44.450> many<00:01:44.600> people<00:01:44.929> make<00:01:45.110> is<00:01:45.289> that<00:01:45.410> they

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
assumption many people make is that they

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.680 
assumption many people make is that they
may<00:01:45.710> have<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.920> sell<00:01:46.250> their<00:01:46.490> house<00:01:46.700> but<00:01:47.539> there

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
may have to sell their house but there

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.150 
may have to sell their house but there
are<00:01:47.810> options<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.530> doesn't<00:01:48.770> always<00:01:48.890> have

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
are options and this doesn't always have

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.490 
are options and this doesn't always have
to<00:01:49.190> be<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.520> case<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.090> again<00:01:50.509> it's<00:01:50.990> important

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
to be the case so again it's important

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.930 
to be the case so again it's important
that<00:01:51.530> they're<00:01:51.770> made<00:01:51.920> aware<00:01:52.160> of<00:01:52.220> all<00:01:52.520> options

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
that they're made aware of all options

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.370 
that they're made aware of all options
at<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.209> time

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380

that<00:02:27.220> runs<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.640> risk<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.910> running<00:02:28.209> out<00:02:28.390> so

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
that runs the risk of running out so

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.360 
that runs the risk of running out so
what<00:02:29.290> we<00:02:29.380> talk<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.709> them<00:02:29.830> about<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.340> a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
you 'ti and that's something that could

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.000 
you 'ti and that's something that could
provide<00:02:35.140> much<00:02:35.769> greater<00:02:36.010> peace<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.640> mind

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.520 

well<00:02:40.670> firstly<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.300> would<00:02:41.540> say<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:41.989> it<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.260> not

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
well firstly I would say that it is not

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.680 
well firstly I would say that it is not
the<00:02:42.860> same<00:02:43.069> it's<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.430> pension<00:02:43.849> annuity<00:02:44.090> which<00:02:44.450> is

retirement<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.090> two<00:02:47.269> should<00:02:47.330> not<00:02:47.569> be

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
retirement the two should not be

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.229 
retirement the two should not be
confused<00:02:48.260> however<00:02:49.220> probably<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:50.030> best

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
confused however probably the best

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.750 
confused however probably the best
person<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.599> explain<00:02:51.019> what<00:02:51.349> an<00:02:51.470> annuity<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:51.980> how

because<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.109> had<00:03:39.379> been<00:03:39.590> used<00:03:39.799> by<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.069> friend<00:03:40.430> of

because it had been used by a friend of
mine<00:03:40.730> for<00:03:40.940> his<00:03:41.269> mother

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
mine for his mother

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.539 
mine for his mother
we<00:03:43.370> knew<00:03:43.519> lots<00:03:43.760> about<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:45.220> benefits<00:03:46.220> and

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
we knew lots about the benefits and

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.990 
we knew lots about the benefits and
allowances<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:48.500> forth<00:03:48.859> that<00:03:49.190> she'd<00:03:49.849> be

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
allowances and so forth that she'd be

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.330 
allowances and so forth that she'd be
entitled<00:03:50.299> to<00:03:50.690> when<00:03:51.079> she<00:03:51.230> was<00:03:51.349> in<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.560> home<00:03:51.739> and

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
entitled to when she was in the home and

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.400 
entitled to when she was in the home and
we<00:03:52.519> just<00:03:52.819> assumed<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.630> what<00:03:53.810> we<00:03:53.930> had<00:03:54.109> to<00:03:54.260> do

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
we just assumed that what we had to do

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.509 
we just assumed that what we had to do
is<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.680> sell<00:03:54.889> the<00:03:54.919> house

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
is to sell the house

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.809 
is to sell the house
and<00:03:55.609> use<00:03:56.419> the<00:03:56.630> capital<00:03:57.079> to<00:03:57.169> pay<00:03:57.319> her<00:03:57.470> fees<00:03:57.819> the

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
and use the capital to pay her fees the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.569 
and use the capital to pay her fees the
money<00:03:59.030> she<00:03:59.329> had<00:03:59.510> from<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.840> sale<00:04:00.049> of<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.230> house

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
money she had from the sale of a house

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.909 
money she had from the sale of a house
would<00:04:01.579> have<00:04:01.609> lasted<00:04:01.880> perhaps<00:04:02.650> three<00:04:03.650> four

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
would have lasted perhaps three four

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.460 
would have lasted perhaps three four
years<00:04:04.480> but<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.599> seemed<00:04:05.840> quite<00:04:06.049> a<00:04:06.079> long<00:04:06.290> time

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
years but that seemed quite a long time

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.770 
years but that seemed quite a long time
because<00:04:07.160> she<00:04:07.669> wasn't<00:04:07.849> in<00:04:08.120> particularly<00:04:08.540> good

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
because she wasn't in particularly good

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.610 
because she wasn't in particularly good
health<00:04:09.790> fortunately<00:04:10.790> she<00:04:11.299> she<00:04:12.169> left<00:04:12.349> it<00:04:12.530> in

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
health fortunately she she left it in

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.770 
health fortunately she she left it in
the<00:04:12.739> home<00:04:12.919> once<00:04:13.669> she<00:04:13.819> got<00:04:13.940> used<00:04:14.180> to<00:04:14.329> it<00:04:14.389> she

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
the home once she got used to it she

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.930 
the home once she got used to it she
liked<00:04:14.989> being<00:04:15.200> there<00:04:15.500> health<00:04:15.950> improved<00:04:16.489> and

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
liked being there health improved and

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.319 
liked being there health improved and
then<00:04:17.470> then<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:19.039> know<00:04:19.370> we<00:04:19.519> started<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:20.000> think<00:04:20.239> a

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
then then you know we started to think a

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.050 
then then you know we started to think a
little<00:04:20.450> bit<00:04:20.660> about<00:04:21.520> not<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.669> long-term

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
little bit about not the long-term

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.690 
little bit about not the long-term
financing<00:04:24.039> and<00:04:25.039> we<00:04:25.190> couldn't<00:04:25.370> see<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.639> way

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
financing and we couldn't see a way

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.320 
financing and we couldn't see a way
around<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:26.270> but<00:04:26.450> about<00:04:27.440> five<00:04:28.010> weeks<00:04:28.280> after<00:04:28.849> she

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
around it but about five weeks after she

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.060 
around it but about five weeks after she
went<00:04:29.750> into<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.110> home<00:04:30.320> we<00:04:30.590> read<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.830> newspaper

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
went into the home we read a newspaper

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.250 
went into the home we read a newspaper
article<00:04:31.430> that<00:04:31.849> talked<00:04:32.180> about<00:04:32.300> immediate<00:04:33.050> care

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
article that talked about immediate care

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.339 
article that talked about immediate care
annuities<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.880> seemed<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.360> us<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:36.139> best

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
annuities and that seemed to us the best

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.969 
annuities and that seemed to us the best
possible<00:04:36.830> thing<00:04:37.070> for<00:04:37.789> us<00:04:37.910> so<00:04:38.750> we<00:04:39.020> made<00:04:39.949> our

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
possible thing for us so we made our

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.909 
possible thing for us so we made our
