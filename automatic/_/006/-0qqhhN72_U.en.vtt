00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
day and really struggling to get the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.399 
day and really struggling to get the
knife<00:01:02.100> through<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.899> made<00:01:04.229> me

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
knife through it and I it made me

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.640 
knife through it and I it made me
remember<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.489> young<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.689> know<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
remember when I was young and I know it

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.399 
remember when I was young and I know it
sounds<00:01:07.830> silly<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.659> honest<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.869> truly<00:01:10.080> there

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
sounds silly but honest and truly there

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.310 
sounds silly but honest and truly there
is<00:01:10.439> an<00:01:10.710> easier<00:01:11.010> way<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:12.240> other<00:01:12.390> tip<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.290> have

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
is an easier way the other tip I have

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.179 
is an easier way the other tip I have
for<00:01:13.770> peppers<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.729> cut<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:15.960> flesh<00:01:16.439> side<00:01:16.740> up

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
for peppers is cut them flesh side up

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.469 
for peppers is cut them flesh side up
you'll<00:01:17.939> get<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> much<00:01:18.299> easier<00:01:19.460> cut<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.240> cut

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you'll get a much easier cut if you cut

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
you'll get a much easier cut if you cut
them<00:01:21.659> flush<00:01:21.930> right<00:01:22.140> down<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.680> pop

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
them flush right down you have to pop

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.580 
them flush right down you have to pop
through<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.490> flesh<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.210> yes<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.409> be

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
through that flesh and yes it can be

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.830 
through that flesh and yes it can be
done<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.220> slices<00:01:26.880> may<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.630> as
