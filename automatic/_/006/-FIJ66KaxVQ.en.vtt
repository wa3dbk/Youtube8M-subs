00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.900
 in this lesson I will show you how to 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.330
 process large quantities quickly 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.450
 photos and talk about this function 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.180
 photoshop as batch processing up 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.590
 start i need to write a set of operations 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:38.059
 for this, I threw photos photoshop 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.430
 and write for her 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.140
 action is open to me operations 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.270
 or action I will create a new folder let 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:56.780
 it will be set of 3 and 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:59.810
 and create a new operation file operation 2 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.460
 she started to burn red 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:07.189
 red circle and first thing i'm 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.070
 let's fit all the photos under one 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.939
 same size let it be 400 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.070
 pixels wide well the rest is all so 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:26.150
 and it remains and let's say I want on each 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:29.650
 photos add caption caption this 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.650
 will be the site signature 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.340
 will create a certain effect to the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:10.090
 so that this inscription will not get lost 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:13.290
 white frozen so it was 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.300
 well readable here it is a photograph 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.640
 have a signature let's say i need to do 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.220
 such an editor with a lot of 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.280
 photos 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:28.770
 I did then I add all the layers in one 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:34.000
 and save in the same format dzhipeg 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:37.180
 just click save and close file 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.750
 it's all written to action and save 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.640
 shut down 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:47.400
 I click stop recording action 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:50.860
 created now and now i open 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:56.440
 tab file automation batch 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.450
 processing here is already set 3 then 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.450
 there is here I show the folder in which 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.570
 there is an action and here itself 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.750
 operation 2 itself is worth 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.390
 all right source folder 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.970
 You can take from other places such as those 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.890
 Photos that are uploaded to Photoshop 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.489
 will be edited but in this case 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.720
 I take a folder and show her the way she 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:29.980
 I have a daddy on my desktop 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:33.489
 airplanes like this I will ban the message in 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 color management 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.970
 everything is clear everything is written batch 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.140
 processing can save itself here 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.750
 set save settings 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.780
 but basically I have a save team 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.610
 written in action so i will assign 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.610
 do not save the button 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.900
 errors reported immediately everything is ready i 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:07.490
 click yes and from that moment went 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.490
 processing of all photos that is each 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.040
 photos alternately it opens 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.790
 action is applied and it closes and 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:22.640
 saved here and so over 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.560
 some time for twitches and you can 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.990
 will check 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.680
 see how everything turned out batch 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.810
 treatment 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.400
 I repeat once again conveniently for large 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.010
 number of photos because not 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.570
 need to press 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.120
 click apply action not 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.860
 need to open 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.380
 it doesn't automatically open 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.520
 loaded automatically applying also 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:53.320
 and closes photographs that is 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.320
 just show the folder and 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.810
 all the photos are in the folder 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.810
 being processed 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:08.759
 all processing is finished I go to the folder 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:16.080
 where do all these pictures lie to me 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:19.169
 85 and all 85 were treated with the same 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.319
 way in width they are the same here 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.569
 put oversigned 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.529
 in width all photos are the same and 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:34.500
 everywhere signed 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:37.919
 that way everywhere they made 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.189
 edited and pretty fast 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:45.590
 if I did it manually then this sanya 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.590
 would be much more time
