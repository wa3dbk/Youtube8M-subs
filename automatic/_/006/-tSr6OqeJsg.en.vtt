00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.610
 and so guys hello everyone 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.519
 literally today I had a man with 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.880
 pretty unusual problem but to 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.039
 Sorry I could not shoot 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.430
 it is this problem and the process itself 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.890
 problem solving and therefore as a person 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.760
 let's say so late for work arrived 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.980
 he is far away but secondly for a very long time I 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.019
 got busy with this problem 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.999
 exhausting problem let's say it was well 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.429
 Well, perhaps I'll start at the very beginning 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:39.379
 human alpha zs 50f 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.600
 Well, that is the usual alpha and he 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.920
 This part broke, that is 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.129
 rotor with magnets 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.889
 I do n't know if his magnets are broken or 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.909
 they just soared out of here 

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:56.030
 go let's say so with such sections 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.949
 the man went to the market took his 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.129
 magnet went to the market to buy a new 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.339
 for a long time he could not find him and one of 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.339
 sellers 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:14.119
 let's say so vtyuhal here is such a magnet 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:17.090
 magnet and seemingly identical let's not say 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.250
 so it fits 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.130
 here is such a generator 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:27.039
 getting up here truth as seen on risks 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.770
 little by little it hurts 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:35.450
 generator but the motor as it is not wedges all 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.749
 ok comes man sets 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.499
 magnet in place well and conducts start 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:45.859
 moped and moped will not start 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:49.429
 although gasoline is compression there is a spark 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:52.100
 there are short and everything is well that there is nothing 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:56.060
 there is a moped does not start me there 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.579
 Ignition coil wire switches 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.460
 overall nothing helped but what did he 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:05.359
 reported that I had a spark before 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.759
 so let's say reddish and powerful houses 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.369
 and after installing such a magnet 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.610
 she became some so small 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.370
 and blue but okay but what 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.400
 she is very weak this principle is bad 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.470
 in general, began to deal with this 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.260
 I called a problem with a multimeter 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.299
 high voltage coil all right 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.939
 somewhere was 375 he hike also 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.780
 rang the hall sensor to Chekhov too 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:38.239
 okay mass we have it all right 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.269
 further I also replaced the switches set 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.239
 different 2 and 3 different switch left 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.549
 left the ignition coil another even 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.069
 already from the generator its wires directly 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:53.120
 Switch to give all of that does not 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.980
 it helped well, stupidly 0 even set 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.170
 your generator might suddenly think that there 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.280
 also did not help and even on my 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.430
 the generator is still the same Istra was and 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.069
 in short 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.060
 I stood in a dead end could not move even 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.920
 from the spot what is it then I thought that 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.370
 may act as a hall sensor somehow 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.489
 wrong is relative to the key well 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.000
 i.e. shifted google ignition like 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:28.099
 it turned out no protrusion stand right under 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.739
 key here and here already visited 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:34.099
 such places that this moped I do not 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:38.750
 I can and people will again hire beads 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:41.420
 and again pay for shipping by our 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.579
 saved roads but then took it up 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.019
 such an idea occurred to me 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:53.599
 what could such a thing happen because of 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.829
 of the fact that this here let's say the ledge 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.219
 under the hall sensor 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.810
 no matter how much it hits the hall sensor 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.469
 Well, that is, maybe the hall sensor is higher 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.060
 they just wonâ€™t get the signal 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:07.400
 It was decided to slightly bend the sensor 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.859
 Hall to here it's lip Well 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.540
 the spark improved but only slightly 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.150
 Well, sort of 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.750
 it seems that it has improved and then 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.660
 it became clear that something was wrong with that 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.260
 in this case or with a protrusion or by yourself 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.389
 hall sensor and pay attention 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.419
 on which 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.909
 height let's say the tabs under the sensor 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.610
 the hall is right here 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.210
 above and it turned u over so the sensor 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.310
 the hall 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.830
 this is its metal part 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.979
 passed as if by and after installation 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.590
 of normal 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.460
 stator moped immediately half a turn 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.499
 wound up and worked as a watch 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.979
 Well, guys, that's all you wanted 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.469
 to tell 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.569
 be careful when buying this 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:59.279
 sort of parts 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.279
 take care of your technique for now
