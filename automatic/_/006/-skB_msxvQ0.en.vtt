00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.000 

this<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.750> particularly<00:02:43.750> easy<00:02:44.110> don't

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
this one is a particularly easy don't

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.860 
this one is a particularly easy don't
you<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.400> cross<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.820> road<00:02:46.000> up<00:02:46.270> here<00:02:46.540> onto<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
you just cross the road up here onto the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.480 
you just cross the road up here onto the
railroad<00:02:47.110> tracks<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.860> there's<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.250> railroad

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
railroad tracks and there's a railroad

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.340 
railroad tracks and there's a railroad
tunnel<00:02:49.380> down<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.590> way<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.770> little<00:02:51.040> bit<00:02:51.190> and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
tunnel down the way a little bit and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.870 
tunnel down the way a little bit and
never<00:02:53.350> really<00:02:53.620> had<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.920> police<00:02:54.160> follow<00:02:54.520> me<00:02:54.730> up

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
here before so I just usually cruise

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.670 
here before so I just usually cruise
down<00:02:58.090> here<00:02:58.360> until<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.660> hit<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.990> tunnel<00:02:59.470> and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
down here until I hit that tunnel and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.740 
down here until I hit that tunnel and
then<00:02:59.950> lose<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.880> water<00:03:01.060> level<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.600> that's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
then lose the water level and that's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.350 
then lose the water level and that's
