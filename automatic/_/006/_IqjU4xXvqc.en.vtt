here so you can see how this will be the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.580 
here so you can see how this will be the
setup<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.850> our<00:02:24.030> faiths<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:25.440> you're

setup of our faiths and if you're
curious<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:26.250> how<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.820> relates<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.840> front

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
curious on how it relates to the front

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.700 
curious on how it relates to the front
view<00:02:28.320> face<00:02:28.760> it's<00:02:29.760> right<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.780> where<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.530> can

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
view face it's right here where you can

view face it's right here where you can
see<00:02:31.950> how<00:02:32.100> everything<00:02:32.550> matches<00:02:32.580> up<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.210> this

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
see how everything matches up and this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.630 
see how everything matches up and this
is<00:02:33.390> basically<00:02:33.680> side<00:02:34.680> view<00:02:34.890> front<00:02:35.040> view<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
is basically side view front view of the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.920 
is basically side view front view of the
same<00:02:35.910> base<00:02:36.120> step<00:02:36.930> 3<00:02:37.230> try<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:37.800> all<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.930> don't

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
same base step 3 try it all in I don't

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.390 
same base step 3 try it all in I don't
actually<00:02:40.110> put<00:02:40.440> all<00:02:40.470> these<00:02:40.800> guide<00:02:41.070> lines<00:02:41.100> so

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
actually put all these guide lines so

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.830 
actually put all these guide lines so
when<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.580> draw<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.630> someone

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
when I draw but this is for someone

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.900 
when I draw but this is for someone
who's<00:02:43.050> really<00:02:43.260> having<00:02:43.650> problems<00:02:44.040> with<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.310> so

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
who's really having problems with it so

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.950 
who's really having problems with it so
if<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.750> don't<00:02:45.930> use<00:02:46.050> these<00:02:46.200> it's<00:02:46.620> fine<00:02:47.720> okay<00:02:48.720> so

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
if you don't use these it's fine okay so

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.450 
if you don't use these it's fine okay so
this<00:02:49.260> island<00:02:49.710> we're<00:02:49.830> going<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.010> draw<00:02:50.130> my<00:02:50.280> eye

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
this island we're going to draw my eye

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.370 
this island we're going to draw my eye
I'm<00:02:51.000> gonna<00:02:51.150> let's<00:02:51.300> start<00:02:51.600> with<00:02:51.720> first<00:02:51.990> and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
I'm gonna let's start with first and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.520 
I'm gonna let's start with first and
draw<00:02:53.340> within<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.450> perimeter<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.020> these<00:02:55.080> two

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
draw within the perimeter of these two

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.620 
draw within the perimeter of these two
lines<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:56.070> try<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> draw<00:02:57.240> somewhere<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.570> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
lines I try to draw somewhere in the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.650 
lines I try to draw somewhere in the
middle<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.560> side<00:02:58.800> view<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.400> face

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
middle and for the side view of the face

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.870 
middle and for the side view of the face
this<00:03:00.660> line<00:03:01.140> kind<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.650> goes<00:03:02.100> angled<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.730> this

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
this line kind of goes angled and this

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.130 
this line kind of goes angled and this
line<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.090> small<00:03:03.450> you're<00:03:03.750> not<00:03:03.870> getting<00:03:04.050> an

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
line is small you're not getting an

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.570 
line is small you're not getting an
angle<00:03:04.440> like<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.710> but<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.040> can<00:03:05.070> make<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.310> round

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
angle like this but you can make a round

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.820 
angle like this but you can make a round
one<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:06.420> know<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:06.930> will<00:03:07.080> be<00:03:07.170> flat<00:03:07.530> and

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
one but know that this will be flat and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.500 
one but know that this will be flat and
kind<00:03:08.070> of<00:03:08.250> angled<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.760> way<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.210> very

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
kind of angled this way and this is very

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.490 
kind of angled this way and this is very
short<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.260> angle<00:03:10.620> down<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:13.020> then<00:03:13.230> draw<00:03:13.350> my

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
short to angle down and then draw my

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.720 
short to angle down and then draw my
eyelid<00:03:15.050> bottom<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.170> my<00:03:16.320> eye<00:03:16.470> this<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.220> angled

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
eyelid bottom of my eye this is angled

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.520 
eyelid bottom of my eye this is angled
like<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.420> makes<00:03:19.050> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.500> a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
like this so makes kind of like a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.940 
like this so makes kind of like a
triangle<00:03:20.040> shape<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:21.080> this<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.200> will<00:03:22.590> be<00:03:22.709> kind

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
triangle shape and this I will be kind

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.490 
triangle shape and this I will be kind
of<00:03:23.570> curving<00:03:24.570> out<00:03:24.780> for<00:03:24.990> it

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.710 

eyebrow<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.860> same<00:03:29.120> curve<00:03:30.120> tiny<00:03:30.480> bit

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
eyebrow is the same curve tiny bit

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.410 
eyebrow is the same curve tiny bit
inwards<00:03:31.050> here<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:32.300> curves<00:03:33.300> down<00:03:35.150> okay<00:03:36.150> now

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
inwards here and curves down okay now

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.030 
inwards here and curves down okay now
for<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.780> rest<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.380> face<00:03:37.530> we're<00:03:37.860> just

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
for the rest of the face we're just

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.790 
for the rest of the face we're just
going<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.220> need<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.490> hardest<00:03:38.850> part<00:03:39.030> suppose

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
going to need the hardest part suppose

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.380 
going to need the hardest part suppose
this<00:03:40.800> right<00:03:41.790> where<00:03:42.080> your<00:03:43.080> eyes<00:03:43.260> are<00:03:43.290> marks<00:03:44.390> the

this right where your eyes are marks the
flat<00:03:45.810> part<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.590> kind<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:46.890> from<00:03:47.400> this

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
flat part and the kind of from this

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.550 
flat part and the kind of from this
intersection<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:49.380> starts<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.739> go<00:03:49.860> out<00:03:51.560> and

draw the ear where the intersection is

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.629 
draw the ear where the intersection is
though<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.590> intersection<00:04:31.100> will<00:04:31.190> be<00:04:31.310> towards

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
though the intersection will be towards

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:44.190 
though the intersection will be towards
the<00:04:31.700> top<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.180> ear<00:04:36.160> okay<00:04:38.770> now<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:41.210> neck

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
okay now as you can see this is kind of

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.860 
okay now as you can see this is kind of
really<00:04:46.750> unattractive<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:49.310> I'm<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.580> little

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
really unattractive so I'm a little

you're<00:04:56.690> actually<00:04:57.020> drawing<00:04:57.290> our<00:04:57.560> future<00:04:57.860> so

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
you're actually drawing our future so

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.070 
you're actually drawing our future so
will<00:04:58.160> be<00:04:58.250> based<00:04:58.580> on<00:04:58.790> that<00:04:58.970> kind<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.300> fuzzy<00:04:59.780> line

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
will be based on that kind of fuzzy line

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.159 
will be based on that kind of fuzzy line
here<00:05:00.320> you<00:05:00.950> go<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:01.880> can<00:05:02.090> go<00:05:02.210> back<00:05:02.240> for<00:05:03.080> the

here you go and you can go back for the

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.670 
here you go and you can go back for the
lips<00:05:03.380> oh<00:05:03.970> it's<00:05:04.970> pretty<00:05:05.120> much<00:05:05.300> immediate<00:05:05.900> so

lips oh it's pretty much immediate so

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.200 
lips oh it's pretty much immediate so
don't<00:05:06.950> wait<00:05:07.130> too<00:05:07.340> long<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.550> draw<00:05:07.820> that<00:05:08.000> lip

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.000
