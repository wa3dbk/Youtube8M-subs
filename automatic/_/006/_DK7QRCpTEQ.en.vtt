hey<00:00:08.849> guys<00:00:09.090> nice<00:00:09.360> little<00:00:09.809> demonstration<00:00:09.960> to

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
hey guys nice little demonstration to

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.110 
hey guys nice little demonstration to
show<00:00:10.620> that<00:00:10.920> he<00:00:11.010> drop<00:00:11.340> lanes<00:00:11.639> or<00:00:11.969> how<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
show that he drop lanes or how the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.600 
show that he drop lanes or how the
mechanisms<00:00:12.780> work<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.320> was<00:00:13.980> actually<00:00:14.190> able<00:00:14.459> to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
mechanisms work I was actually able to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.700 
mechanisms work I was actually able to
get<00:00:14.789> it<00:00:14.910> set<00:00:15.180> up<00:00:15.209> to<00:00:15.360> work<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:16.230> servos

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
get it set up to work with two servos

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.150 
get it set up to work with two servos
I'll<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.640> able<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.850> drop<00:00:18.119> three<00:00:18.510> items

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.650 

it's<00:00:21.400> kind<00:00:21.670> of<00:00:21.700> what<00:00:21.850> it<00:00:21.940> looks<00:00:21.970> like<00:00:22.300> Emily

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
it's kind of what it looks like Emily

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.840 
it's kind of what it looks like Emily
the<00:00:22.750> platform

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
the platform

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.770 
the platform
a<00:00:24.910> couple<00:00:25.540> of<00:00:25.630> screws<00:00:26.080> just<00:00:26.260> in<00:00:26.560> case<00:00:26.710> on<00:00:26.950> it

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
a couple of screws just in case on it

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.620 
a couple of screws just in case on it
add<00:00:28.110> some<00:00:28.380> various<00:00:28.740> platforms<00:00:29.370> down<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.700> road

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
add some various platforms down the road

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810 
add some various platforms down the road
see<00:00:31.110> I've<00:00:31.200> got<00:00:31.230> two<00:00:31.530> mechanisms<00:00:31.770> on<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.580> side

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
see I've got two mechanisms on this side

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.380 
see I've got two mechanisms on this side
both<00:00:33.450> controlled<00:00:33.930> by<00:00:34.080> the<00:00:34.140> same<00:00:34.380> servo<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:36.000> I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
both controlled by the same servo and I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.970 
both controlled by the same servo and I
just<00:00:36.570> ended<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.989> using<00:00:38.030> carpenters<00:00:39.030> thread

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
just ended up using carpenters thread

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.370 
just ended up using carpenters thread
pretty<00:00:40.980> durable<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.850> flexible<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
pretty durable it's flexible in the

00:00:43.380 --> 00:01:01.569 
pretty durable it's flexible in the
movement

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.950 

let's<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> got<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> three<00:01:03.390> Farah<00:01:03.690> shoot

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
let's see I got the three Farah shoot

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500 
let's see I got the three Farah shoot
guys<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.530> tucked<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.040> under<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.519> who's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
guys all tucked up under there who's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.130 
guys all tucked up under there who's
there<00:01:09.920> I'll<00:01:10.920> show<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.190> how<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.460> works

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
there I'll show you how this works

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.420 
there I'll show you how this works
all<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.500> way<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.860> haven't<00:01:14.009> set<00:01:14.280> up

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
all right the way that I haven't set up

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.280 
all right the way that I haven't set up
right<00:01:14.670> now<00:01:15.049> essentially<00:01:16.100> when<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.190> throw<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
right now essentially when I throw the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.320 
right now essentially when I throw the
idol<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.440> switch<00:01:19.770> either<00:01:20.130> direction<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.119> can

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
idol up switch either direction you can

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.480 
idol up switch either direction you can
get<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.750> drop<00:01:22.020> two<00:01:22.619> drops<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.159> then<00:01:23.280> push<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
get one drop two drops and then push it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.999 
get one drop two drops and then push it
forward<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.899> one<00:01:25.200> drop<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.800> D

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
forward and then one drop on that D

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.520 
forward and then one drop on that D
switch<00:01:26.310> as<00:01:26.520> well<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
switch as well so see if we can get this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:40.080 
switch as well so see if we can get this
to<00:01:28.710> actually<00:01:28.800> work<00:01:29.070> here

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.690 

it<00:01:40.630> worked<00:01:40.810> pretty<00:01:40.960> well<00:01:41.470> could<00:01:41.979> be<00:01:42.070> fun<00:01:42.310> kids

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
it worked pretty well could be fun kids

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.359 
it worked pretty well could be fun kids
like<00:01:42.909> Jason's<00:01:43.360> parachutes<00:01:43.900> or<00:01:44.049> anything<00:01:44.369> went

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
like Jason's parachutes or anything went

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.749 
like Jason's parachutes or anything went
off<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.549> land<00:01:45.760> after<00:01:46.030> every<00:01:46.450> drop<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:48.430> see

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
off the land after every drop you see

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.030 
off the land after every drop you see
the<00:01:48.880> movement<00:01:49.119> on<00:01:49.360> here<00:01:49.720> it's<00:01:50.020> kind<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.470> cool

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
the movement on here it's kind of a cool

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.039 
the movement on here it's kind of a cool
pole<00:01:51.369> so<00:01:51.670> what<00:01:51.820> happens<00:01:52.210> when<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.600> servo

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
pole so what happens when the servo

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.090 
pole so what happens when the servo
moves<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:55.509> see<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.840> pulls<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.290> far<00:01:56.560> one<00:01:56.800> but

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
moves you see it pulls the far one but

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.010 
moves you see it pulls the far one but
because<00:01:57.190> it's<00:01:57.610> just<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.940> string<00:01:58.300> or<00:01:58.960> thread

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
because it's just a string or thread

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.840 
because it's just a string or thread
doesn't<00:02:00.240> affect<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.390> others<00:02:01.770> mechanism<00:02:02.850> at

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
doesn't affect the others mechanism at

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.889 
doesn't affect the others mechanism at
the<00:02:03.909> center<00:02:04.830> just<00:02:05.830> puts<00:02:06.159> black<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.909> string

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
the center just puts black in the string

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.780 
the center just puts black in the string
on<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.200> opposite<00:02:08.590> side

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.910 

so<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.849> spender<00:02:13.269> position<00:02:13.780> position<00:02:14.049> for<00:02:14.799> the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
so the spender position position for the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.490 
so the spender position position for the
idol<00:02:15.220> ups<00:02:15.370> which<00:02:15.670> controls

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.870 

the<00:02:20.500> opposite<00:02:20.890> side<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.090> single<00:02:22.570> switch
