00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.069
Today I want to teach you a very traditional recipe here in England

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.730
which is known as "coleslaw" this
recipe is so traditional that

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.849
Most restaurants and pubs that we go generally they offer the coleslaw as

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:12.709
a side dish

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.839
it is a kind of a Salad that can be served with cold and hot dishes

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.869
and it's so easy to make that you may already have all the ingredients in your

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.629
home, so let's start our recipe
and I hope you like it

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:28.629

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.200
to prepare our recipe
we will start with our sauce

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.110
in a bowl we put three tablespoons of light mayonnaise

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.690
a teaspoon of mustard

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.650
three tablespoons of apple cider vinegar

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.320
the juice of half lemon

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.290
salt and pepper to taste

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.100
we will mix well and wait

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.200
in another bowl we will put one
cup of cabbage chopped into strips thin  lines

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.750

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.240
we need grated carrot also in thin strips

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.080
put 2 cloves of crushed garlic, it is optional

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.330
and adds chopped chives or you can simply use

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.220
parsley if you prefer

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.260
so let's add the sauce that It is ready and stir well until

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.280
it is all combined

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500
if you want an even lighter version
you can substitute light mayonnaise

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.820
for Greek yogurt, but the one which is 100% natural, ie tasteless and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.880
also sugarless

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.180
the benefit of this recipe is that it is rich in

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.250
fibers, and also has a low glycemic index

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.300
if you find that the sauce is a bit to acid due the lemon and vinegar together

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.400
you can put a little bit of grated apple

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.349
or a teaspoon of sugar in the sauce

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.409
it helps to cut the acidity

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.760
here's our ready coleslaw, you can eat two

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.329
tablespoons per meal. If you liked the recipe, be sure to
