 hello that such kids I bring you a 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.850
 tutorial on how to download and install a 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.320
 Minecraft textures pack and this time 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.269
 It is the short craft space 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.520
 and nothing the only thing you have to do is 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.070
 come to google or to the explorer that you have 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.460

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.700
 you enter and you appear in this 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.260
 page is dark from kraft in a 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.060
 page is called minecraft eo valley that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.740
 there are many things that is the best page 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.440
 for me it's worth 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.790
 and the only thing you have to go down and give 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 here it's worth always will be and you 'll have 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.990
 well you have to give here to spend 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.130
 it's worth when those five seconds pass 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.830
 from that elusive and you already start 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.900
 download automatically voucher here 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.700
 I stop it because I already have it downloaded 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.830
 you will leave it close this 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.140
 tab and you leave this ok and until 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.260
 download do not close the browser 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.210
 because if you do not, the download goes away and 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.610
 good when you do not have I'm going to leave you 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.150
 this file is valid and the only thing you have 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.560
 what to do 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.720
 if you have windows 7 come here it's worth 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.940
 now the little button east of windows and 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.830
 put here in the seeker commit 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.240
 windows 8 I have to come here worth going 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.910
 so that we have good 28 come here 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.790
 you can then app percent data by 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.550
 hundred 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.840
 and the eyes they appear on this page 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.220
 which is called percent the search for 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.200
 roaming 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.090
 and nothing gets in the point minecraft that 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.490
 appears there and then when you are in 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.220
 point minecraft you enter in rzeszÃ³w 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.350
 sexual as I have done I already have a pack of 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.320
 textures and now the only thing that you have to 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.750
 do is put the file that you finish 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.030
 to download that has all this stuff 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.500
 only the winrar is worth 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.590
 you have to have downloaded the winrar 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.750
 worth that you look for softonic or so and already 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.360
 you download it jce is very easy very 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.520
 simple and now what you have to 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.530
 to do is to get into minecraft and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.630
 you will have the pure space of kraft that 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.959
 this is a very textures pack 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.830
 cool the truth that is very cool and nothing 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'm going to make a small transition and 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.970
 now we'll see you in minecraft so that 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.209
 ye see a little texture pack up 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.209
 now 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.920
 equal to all we are back for 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.690
 fill them in the texture pack 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.849
 and nothing this is all is a house that 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.280
 I already have a world 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.280
 So are the sources of the pac 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.610
 and nothing as these are the little things the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.090
 it's really cool to me 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.090
 I like a lot 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.560
 for example the sword the ax and the beak 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.560
 They are pretty cool 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.090
 from orito 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.090
 this is my 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.390
 trampoline to discuss water go down more 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.250
 Quick 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.380
 and here I have my horse without a name 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.310
 because it's difficult and he's going to get 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.090
 have the name but the stress 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.090
 and they say 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.050
 the session in the horses 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.540
 in this pack 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.810
 pretty real that deals true squares 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.810
 but 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.260
 good is that it is quite good and nothing 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.360

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.200
