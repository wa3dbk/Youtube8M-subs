00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.289
 brush piraputanga until golden the daughter 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.920
 only in it so let's go to the 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.920
 process 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.460
 for this scale using the sun 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.890
 standard numbering 10 used in flies 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.860
 dried up in detail if that variation 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.800
 2x which is bigger than big head and 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:39.250
 if that 3 millimeters and I 'll ball 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.250
 this scan with language that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.000
 now ours that dictation the numbering 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.110
 end of the table depends on the size of the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.230
 What are you doing? 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.030
 the une burger accepts several sizes like this 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.310
 as many colors then you can

 choose your preference 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:13.780
 here using a wire from the

 lighting 6 can put our 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.080
 framework 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.590
 remember that the mabu I cut there of the pause 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.590
 to make another bait 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.180
 here you can even some fibers 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:03:00.690
 as you called it for example 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:03:04.250
 to shine on the bait now take a 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.250
 feather of the cock crisis 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.300

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.630
 the unraveling feather of the grizzly rooster 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.110
 just gives the name of finalization 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.200
