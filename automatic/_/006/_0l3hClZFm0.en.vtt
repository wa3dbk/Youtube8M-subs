 by and boys do not have to go the other way you have to provoke the boys 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.650
 although we are strong 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.420
 Climate Change and Liberty on board to be able to give in and that 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.710
 motivates the war we are scary good mood she finds 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.509
 next to the guys are always happy 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.779
 as once in the service again with their application as years old 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.699
 when rotating in a commercial of the axis 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.160
 it is also very good as adults but from the victory she had the black one 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.179
 Magpie flows Graz 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.529
 Norderstedt was also very good at growing up 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.660
 the dance teacher athlete behind us the heirs dispensable but that is always 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.350
 especially he is that's exactly ours and 2 World Champion Hamilton Bob 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.510
 Bowman and that means he has all the mails are world champions we want the game 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.949
 winning and Dan Deacon 7 is terrifically motivating the kids all the while 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.879
 casual and actually very much value on casualness and agility 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.670
 and have almost overlooked bitter defeat 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.280
 because on 1 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.970
 but Bradl should drive once four points separate what are you doing so 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.970
 economical as parties 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.650
 That's why choreographer Detlef d 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.100
 I would not think there is no final report 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 works for two years 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.970
 100 employees 88 years old how long the last chance 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.840
 Is small 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.860
 and the EU needs to switch on or off 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.870
 that he beats back into the group then managed that 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.570
 Thank you and we wanted to have a look 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.890
 Never before have we been so committed to having a show 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.580
 done once now 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.270
 sharp back 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.420
 while whoever is fast to the now emerging acrobatic one can almost 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.100
 already say 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.180
 Men's single with initially scarce the loss is the investment 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.390
 of about 2 1 victory against 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 The AdLINK Group is always ready to be added 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.440
 Edipresse but missed 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.080
 It can put us together because it ends up with the musicality of music 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.460
 Body Any person who feels good in his body then move to it 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.680
 with music 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.490
 that one knows the music again about the body movements that it is soon the 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.749
 Message of the two 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.469
 We thought that it would be accepted by the deanery 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.200
 is measured because the educational needs are submitted 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.700
 and I think it's about quality and mine life 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.169
 of course he did not live to his art client and what happened 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.299
 He should be vice-world champion twice in the office 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.319
 Local participants with three new federal states also spectacular 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.269
 To have elements but it was a racing accident sometimes in sports 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.670
 It can happen quite normally 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.510
 Exactly we under pressure in this snappy and if it were an old girl 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.510
 not at all in the well again the same 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.089
 technically is thus successor to the Chelsea Finding Nemo seen 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:58.289
 tarantulas 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.289
 missed with it 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:02.379
 but that is already very advanced international 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.759
 Survey is the end indeed Hans is probably the one of Mo
