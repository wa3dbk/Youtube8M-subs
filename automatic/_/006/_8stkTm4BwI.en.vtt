Yang's<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.730> late<00:00:26.910> 70s<00:00:27.439> we're<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.619> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
Yang's in the late 70s we're going to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.999 
Yang's in the late 70s we're going to
reposition<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.519> device<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.019> fly<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
reposition the device for this fly so

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.889 
reposition the device for this fly so
that<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.279> will<00:00:32.399> act<00:00:32.669> more<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.180> Dyna<00:00:33.510> keying

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
that it will act more like a Dyna keying

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.950 
that it will act more like a Dyna keying
professional<00:00:34.800> than<00:00:35.640> an<00:00:35.910> inline<00:00:36.300> rotary<00:00:36.660> vise

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
professional than an inline rotary vise

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
professional than an inline rotary vise
we'll<00:00:37.290> get<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> inline<00:00:37.980> functions<00:00:38.550> on

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
we'll get to the inline functions on

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.110 
we'll get to the inline functions on
future<00:00:39.629> flies<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.820> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
future flies but you can see now that it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.680 
future flies but you can see now that it
does<00:00:42.270> not<00:00:42.450> turn<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.020> hook<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.610> on<00:00:44.610> an<00:00:44.910> inline

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
does not turn the hook on on an inline

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.500 
does not turn the hook on on an inline
axis<00:00:46.379> however<00:00:47.370> I'll<00:00:48.239> take<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> there

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
axis however I'll take that out of there

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.240 
axis however I'll take that out of there
does<00:00:51.510> still<00:00:51.809> allow<00:00:52.020> us<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.379> rotate<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.160> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
does still allow us to rotate this in a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.630 
does still allow us to rotate this in a
dozen

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
dozen

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.880 
dozen
we<00:00:53.910> still<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.360> rotate<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.960> jaws<00:00:55.260> should<00:00:55.739> we

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
we still can rotate the jaws should we

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.459 
we still can rotate the jaws should we
wish<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.859> but<00:00:59.480> tilting<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.629> rotating

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
wish to do so but tilting and rotating

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
table surface now with the vise in this
position<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.840> acts<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.979> dining

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
position it acts like a dining

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.920

professional and that when I give the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.760 
professional and that when I give the
flight<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> apply<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.890> rotation<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.409> hook<00:01:34.619> is

flight I apply a rotation the hook is
not<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.130> axis<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.119> you're<00:01:36.270> able<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> look<00:01:36.600> at

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
not on axis but you're able to look at

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.719 
not on axis but you're able to look at
the<00:01:36.840> other<00:01:36.960> side<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:38.100> let<00:01:38.250> me<00:01:38.340> start<00:01:38.549> my

the other side now let me start my

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.340 
the other side now let me start my
thread<00:01:38.970> base<00:01:39.180> slightly<00:01:39.780> forward<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.229> the

here that doesn't want to be get with

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.840 
here that doesn't want to be get with
the<00:02:04.380> program<00:02:04.710> either<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:05.130> rid<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:05.759> we

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the program either get rid of it here we

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.779 
the program either get rid of it here we
go<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> tail<00:02:06.930> will<00:02:07.140> be<00:02:07.200> slightly

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
go what the tail will be slightly

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.279 
go what the tail will be slightly
shorter<00:02:08.789> than<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> hook<00:02:09.390> shank<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.959> I'll<00:02:10.080> set

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
shorter than the hook shank so I'll set

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.780 
shorter than the hook shank so I'll set
that<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.530> position<00:02:10.920> now<00:02:11.039> untie<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.730> too

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
to get with the program so we'll take
