00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
supposed to be a platformer that the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.010 
supposed to be a platformer that the
NPCs<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.770> built<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.239> then<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> realized<00:00:42.750> that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
NPCs have built and then I realized that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.330 
NPCs have built and then I realized that
in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> background<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> red<00:00:44.309> one

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
in the background there was a red one

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.240 
in the background there was a red one
and<00:00:44.789> put<00:00:45.480> two<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.660> two<00:00:45.899> together<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.469> decided

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and put two and two together and decided

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.350 
and put two and two together and decided
that<00:00:47.280> they're<00:00:47.520> both<00:00:47.700> giant<00:00:48.000> mushrooms

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
that they're both giant mushrooms

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
that they're both giant mushrooms
although<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:48.989> sure<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.250> whole

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
although I'm not sure what the the whole

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
although I'm not sure what the the whole
point<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> them<00:00:51.030> will<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.300> we'll<00:00:51.780> find<00:00:52.050> out

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
point of them will be we'll find out

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.319 
point of them will be we'll find out
soon<00:00:52.469> I'm<00:00:52.739> guessing<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.610> yeah<00:00:54.030> let's<00:00:54.210> get

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.869 
soon I'm guessing but yeah let's get
into<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.410> village<00:00:55.980> itself<00:00:56.340> I'm<00:00:56.610> not

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
into it about the village itself I'm not

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.010 
into it about the village itself I'm not
sure<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.180> NPCs<00:00:57.870> will<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.649> in<00:01:00.020> human

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
sure that NPCs will actually be in human

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.900 
sure that NPCs will actually be in human
NPCs<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.219> their<00:01:02.430> building

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
NPCs that is will be in their building

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.539 
NPCs that is will be in their building
because<00:01:03.329> simply<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.280> not<00:01:05.280> shouldn't

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
because simply put not shouldn't

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.450 
because simply put not shouldn't
actually<00:01:05.850> lists<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:06.689> there'll<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.930> NPCs<00:01:07.470> human

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
actually lists at there'll be NPCs human

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
actually lists at there'll be NPCs human
NPC's<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.150> game<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.630> build<00:01:09.840> them<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.140> think

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
NPC's in the game to build them I think

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.170 
NPC's in the game to build them I think
there'll<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.130> randomly<00:01:11.580> generated

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
there'll just be randomly generated

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.560 
there'll just be randomly generated
because<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.020> fact<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.760> don't<00:01:14.760> think<00:01:14.939> NPC

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
because of that fact I don't think NPC

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.789 
because of that fact I don't think NPC
villages<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.049> gonna<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> highlight<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
villages are gonna be the highlight of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.800 
villages are gonna be the highlight of
it<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.490> other<00:01:17.700> things<00:01:18.060> such<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it I think the other things such as and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.300 
it I think the other things such as and
I'll<00:01:19.170> list<00:01:19.409> them<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.830> put<00:01:19.979> them<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I'll list them here and put them on the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.910 
I'll list them here and put them on the
screen<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.820> remember<00:01:21.500> randomly<00:01:22.500> generated

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
screen if I remember randomly generated

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.350 
screen if I remember randomly generated
dungeons<00:01:23.340> although<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.150> are<00:01:24.210> already

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
dungeons although there are already

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.920 
dungeons although there are already
dungeons<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.259> game<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
dungeons in the game I do think that

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.960 
dungeons in the game I do think that
they'll<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:27.960> they'll<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.009> better<00:01:29.369> there'll<00:01:29.909> be

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
they'll be they'll be better there'll be

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.170 
they'll be they'll be better there'll be
more<00:01:30.900> useful<00:01:31.049> maybe<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.790> like

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
more useful maybe you know there be like

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.330 
more useful maybe you know there be like
an<00:01:33.329> iron<00:01:33.689> door<00:01:33.930> or<00:01:34.170> something<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
an iron door or something like that and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.770 
an iron door or something like that and
you<00:01:35.490> go<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.820> there<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> fight

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you go in there and you have to fight

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.450 
you go in there and you have to fight
your<00:01:36.900> way<00:01:36.930> through<00:01:37.259> more<00:01:37.560> stuff<00:01:37.890> than<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.369> a

your way through more stuff than just a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.280 
your way through more stuff than just a
room<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.850> mossy<00:01:39.060> cobblestone<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.020> I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
room with mossy cobblestone and you I

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590 
room with mossy cobblestone and you I
don't<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:40.950> we'll<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.549> we'll<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:42.570> we

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
don't know we'll see we'll see when we

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
don't know we'll see we'll see when we
get<00:01:42.780> more<00:01:42.899> information<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.619> also<00:01:43.890> new

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
get more information but I also new

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100 
get more information but I also new
biome<00:01:44.520> code<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.360> think<00:01:45.600> either<00:01:45.750> means

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
biome code which I think either means

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.889 
biome code which I think either means
that<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> biomes<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.979> bigger<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.899> kind

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that the biomes will be bigger or kind

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.319 
that the biomes will be bigger or kind
of<00:01:49.049> more<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.770> don't<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> word<00:01:51.180> is

I hope moving on there be fully
functioning<00:02:16.400> creative<00:02:16.940> mode<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.360> then<00:02:17.810> in

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
creative mode which if you don't know

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.479 
creative mode which if you don't know
that<00:02:26.930> was<00:02:27.170> before<00:02:27.349> survival<00:02:28.040> mode<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.370> was

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
that was before survival mode that was

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.190 
that was before survival mode that was
where<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.849> didn't<00:02:29.150> actually<00:02:29.300> have<00:02:29.660> any<00:02:29.690> items

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
where you didn't actually have any items

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.650 
where you didn't actually have any items
you<00:02:30.319> just<00:02:30.440> could<00:02:31.160> destroy<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.790> create<00:02:32.209> blocks

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
you just could destroy and create blocks

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.160 
you just could destroy and create blocks
instantly<00:02:33.430> your<00:02:34.430> inventory<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.989> could

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
instantly your inventory you could

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.170 
instantly your inventory you could
choose<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.920> can<00:02:36.980> ramp<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.459> can<00:02:37.730> actually

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
choose I can ramp I can actually

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.710 
choose I can ramp I can actually
remember<00:02:38.569> playing<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.910> but<00:02:40.910> I'm<00:02:41.420> pretty<00:02:41.600> sure

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
remember playing it but I'm pretty sure

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.030 
remember playing it but I'm pretty sure
that<00:02:41.930> was<00:02:42.080> how<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.260> works<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.680> could<00:02:42.860> just

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
that was how it works you could just

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.949 
that was how it works you could just
instantly<00:02:43.430> destroy<00:02:43.730> stuff<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.209> play<00:02:44.660> stuff

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
instantly destroy stuff and play stuff

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.080 
instantly destroy stuff and play stuff
the<00:02:45.590> last<00:02:45.709> time<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.069> play<00:02:46.280> creative<00:02:46.610> mode<00:02:46.910> was

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
the last time I play creative mode was

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.970 
the last time I play creative mode was
before<00:02:47.450> survival<00:02:47.959> mode<00:02:48.110> came<00:02:48.319> out<00:02:48.470> which<00:02:48.650> was

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
before survival mode came out which was

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.520 
before survival mode came out which was
I<00:02:49.220> believe<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.600> stopped<00:02:51.590> playing<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.549> March

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
I believe I stopped playing it in March

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.640 
I believe I stopped playing it in March
2010<00:02:54.530> yeah<00:02:54.920> 2010<00:02:56.080> but<00:02:57.080> yeah<00:02:57.230> moving<00:02:57.530> on

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
2010 yeah 2010 but yeah moving on

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.430 
2010 yeah 2010 but yeah moving on
critical<00:02:58.310> hits<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.880> sprinting<00:02:59.810> sprinting<00:03:00.290> is

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
critical hits and sprinting sprinting is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.430 
critical hits and sprinting sprinting is
gonna<00:03:00.620> be<00:03:00.799> pretty<00:03:01.220> damn<00:03:02.060> useful<00:03:02.569> firstly<00:03:03.290> to

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
gonna be pretty damn useful firstly to

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.740 
gonna be pretty damn useful firstly to
get<00:03:03.590> away<00:03:03.650> from<00:03:03.739> bloody<00:03:04.130> creepers<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.940> second

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
get away from bloody creepers and second

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.809 
get away from bloody creepers and second
of<00:03:05.810> all<00:03:05.930> just<00:03:06.290> because<00:03:06.709> it'd<00:03:06.950> be<00:03:07.100> fun<00:03:07.340> sprint

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
of all just because it'd be fun sprint

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.750 
of all just because it'd be fun sprint
and<00:03:08.620> faster<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.739> get<00:03:09.890> around<00:03:10.160> it'd<00:03:10.459> be<00:03:10.549> cool<00:03:10.730> if

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
and faster to get around it'd be cool if

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.309 
and faster to get around it'd be cool if
you<00:03:10.940> put<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.269> horses<00:03:11.750> or<00:03:11.840> something<00:03:12.140> that's

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
you put in horses or something that's

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.070 
you put in horses or something that's
what<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:12.560> was<00:03:12.680> thinking<00:03:13.069> but<00:03:13.510> who<00:03:14.510> knows<00:03:14.750> who

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
what I was thinking but who knows who

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.870 
what I was thinking but who knows who
knows<00:03:15.290> what's<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.590> come<00:03:15.830> critical<00:03:16.670> hits

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
knows what's to come critical hits

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.220 
knows what's to come critical hits
basically<00:03:17.420> if<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.690> don't<00:03:17.840> know<00:03:17.989> what<00:03:18.079> that

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
basically if you don't know what that

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.289 
basically if you don't know what that
means<00:03:18.440> as<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.250> hear<00:03:20.650> you'll<00:03:21.650> hit<00:03:21.890> higher

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
means as you hear you'll hit higher

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.470 
means as you hear you'll hit higher
randomly<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.739> believe<00:03:24.739> it<00:03:25.430> will<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:26.060> will<00:03:26.180> kind

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
randomly I believe it will it will kind

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.180 
randomly I believe it will it will kind
of<00:03:26.570> matter<00:03:26.840> if<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.170> were<00:03:27.260> using<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.650> diamond

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
of matter if you were using a diamond

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.030 
of matter if you were using a diamond
sword<00:03:28.430> or<00:03:28.760> an<00:03:29.150> iron<00:03:29.989> sword<00:03:30.260> for<00:03:30.560> example<00:03:30.920> an

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
well not as soon but I can certainly

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.170 
well not as soon but I can certainly
remember<00:04:21.880> kind<00:04:22.880> of<00:04:23.830> autumn<00:04:24.830> autumn<00:04:25.130> 2010<00:04:25.970> you

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
remember kind of autumn autumn 2010 you

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.820 
remember kind of autumn autumn 2010 you
could

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
could

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.070 
could
and<00:04:27.099> stuff<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.120> was<00:04:28.449> definitely<00:04:28.599> in

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
and stuff so that was definitely in

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.860 
and stuff so that was definitely in
there<00:04:29.349> for<00:04:29.530> ages<00:04:30.000> but<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.060> think<00:04:31.360> he<00:04:31.509> means<00:04:31.720> like

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
there for ages but I think he means like

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.459 
there for ages but I think he means like
there<00:04:32.199> maybe<00:04:32.770> be<00:04:33.310> an<00:04:34.270> actual<00:04:34.780> system<00:04:35.080> for

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:35.469 
there maybe be an actual system for

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:36.899 
there maybe be an actual system for
collecting<00:04:35.620> more<00:04:35.979> maybe<00:04:36.219> it's<00:04:36.340> got<00:04:36.550> something

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
collecting more maybe it's got something

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.850 
collecting more maybe it's got something
to<00:04:36.939> do<00:04:37.090> Pistons<00:04:37.599> that<00:04:37.719> would<00:04:37.900> be<00:04:37.960> cool

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
to do Pistons that would be cool

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.159 
to do Pistons that would be cool

but yeah the the final thing that is

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.550 
but yeah the the final thing that is
actually<00:04:45.099> not<00:04:45.639> listed<00:04:46.000> on<00:04:46.090> his<00:04:46.240> blog<00:04:46.479> but<00:04:47.349> he

actually tweeted this and that is

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.140 
actually tweeted this and that is
brightness<00:04:50.379> you<00:04:51.129> can<00:04:51.310> actually<00:04:51.520> change<00:04:51.909> the

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
brightness you can actually change the

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.719 
brightness you can actually change the
brightness<00:04:52.330> now<00:04:52.569> and<00:04:53.250> slide<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.400> up<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:54.639> down

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
brightness now and slide it up and down

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.119 
brightness now and slide it up and down
depending<00:04:55.270> on<00:04:55.689> what<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.229> want<00:04:56.409> and<00:04:56.620> he<00:04:56.889> said

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129

real adventure now yeah real adventurers

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.149 
real adventure now yeah real adventurers
or<00:05:00.340> real<00:05:00.550> miners<00:05:00.940> play<00:05:01.900> on<00:05:02.139> lowest<00:05:02.590> practice

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
or real miners play on lowest practice

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.879 
or real miners play on lowest practice
but<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.330> reason<00:05:04.719> this<00:05:04.810> is<00:05:04.870> cool<00:05:05.349> is<00:05:05.680> because

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
but the reason this is cool is because

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.680 
but the reason this is cool is because
when<00:05:06.159> you're<00:05:06.310> recording<00:05:06.550> minecraft<00:05:07.210> for<00:05:07.479> some

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
when you're recording minecraft for some

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.779 
when you're recording minecraft for some
reason<00:05:08.110> this<00:05:08.530> happens<00:05:08.919> to<00:05:09.069> everybody<00:05:09.400> if

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
reason this happens to everybody if

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.550 
reason this happens to everybody if
you're<00:05:09.909> recording<00:05:10.270> for<00:05:11.020> some<00:05:11.169> reason<00:05:11.469> the

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
you're recording for some reason the

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.469 
you're recording for some reason the
saturation<00:05:12.099> is<00:05:12.340> terrible<00:05:12.819> and<00:05:12.909> you<00:05:13.000> can't<00:05:13.240> see

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
saturation is terrible and you can't see

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.240 
saturation is terrible and you can't see
very<00:05:13.509> fast<00:05:14.080> you<00:05:14.229> have<00:05:14.319> to<00:05:14.469> spam<00:05:14.770> torches

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
very fast you have to spam torches

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.700 
very fast you have to spam torches
everywhere<00:05:15.669> as<00:05:15.879> you<00:05:15.909> go<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.539> it's<00:05:17.289> not<00:05:17.469> really

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
everywhere as you go and it's not really

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.869 
everywhere as you go and it's not really
that<00:05:17.740> great<00:05:18.009> for<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.250> viewer<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:18.699> maybe

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
that great for the viewer so maybe

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.540 
that great for the viewer so maybe
brightness<00:05:19.509> turned<00:05:19.779> up<00:05:19.960> not<00:05:20.770> too<00:05:21.039> much<00:05:21.279> but<00:05:21.490> a

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
brightness turned up not too much but a

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.240 
brightness turned up not too much but a
little<00:05:21.759> bit<00:05:21.940> will<00:05:22.719> help<00:05:23.020> with<00:05:23.229> that<00:05:23.259> and<00:05:23.620> make

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
little bit will help with that and make

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.519 
little bit will help with that and make
things<00:05:24.879> look<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.180> lot<00:05:25.330> better<00:05:25.569> and<00:05:26.379> the<00:05:26.409> last

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 
things look a lot better and the last

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.129 
things look a lot better and the last

picture I want to know is this and this
is<00:05:29.319> a<00:05:29.349> four<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:29.919> I'm<00:05:30.819> gonna<00:05:31.000> move<00:05:31.210> straight

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
is a four and I'm gonna move straight

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.029 
is a four and I'm gonna move straight
past<00:05:31.690> this<00:05:31.900> and<00:05:32.080> go<00:05:32.169> onto<00:05:32.319> my<00:05:32.500> super-awesome

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
past this and go onto my super-awesome

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.830 
past this and go onto my super-awesome
edited<00:05:33.789> version<00:05:34.330> of<00:05:34.389> it<00:05:34.569> here<00:05:35.969> yeah<00:05:36.969> I'm<00:05:37.659> not

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.809 
edited version of it here yeah I'm not
too<00:05:37.960> great<00:05:38.199> in<00:05:38.349> the<00:05:38.590> fact<00:05:38.979> shot<00:05:39.219> go<00:05:39.400> admit<00:05:39.669> but

too great in the fact shot go admit but

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.059 
too great in the fact shot go admit but
I'm<00:05:39.969> this<00:05:40.690> is<00:05:40.870> just<00:05:41.050> crude<00:05:41.349> I<00:05:41.529> did<00:05:41.800> this<00:05:41.919> at

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:42.069 
I'm this is just crude I did this at

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:44.309 
I'm this is just crude I did this at
about<00:05:42.250> five<00:05:42.550> seconds<00:05:43.089> and<00:05:43.240> I<00:05:43.719> wanted<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.110> point

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
about five seconds and I wanted to point

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.040 
about five seconds and I wanted to point
out<00:05:44.500> a<00:05:44.529> few<00:05:44.620> things<00:05:44.949> can<00:05:45.250> you<00:05:45.339> kind<00:05:45.610> of<00:05:45.669> see<00:05:46.050> how

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
out a few things can you kind of see how

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.230 
out a few things can you kind of see how
the<00:05:47.529> blocks<00:05:47.889> don't<00:05:48.279> look<00:05:48.430> like<00:05:48.610> full<00:05:48.940> blocks

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
the blocks don't look like full blocks

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.450 
the blocks don't look like full blocks
it<00:05:49.479> might<00:05:49.599> just<00:05:49.750> be<00:05:49.810> me<00:05:50.050> honestly<00:05:50.409> it<00:05:50.830> may<00:05:51.250> just

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
it might just be me honestly it may just

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.450 
it might just be me honestly it may just
be<00:05:51.520> me<00:05:51.819> being<00:05:52.060> a<00:05:52.240> dumbass<00:05:52.930> but<00:05:53.889> it<00:05:54.009> does<00:05:54.219> look

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
be me being a dumbass but it does look

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.399 
be me being a dumbass but it does look
like<00:05:54.729> they're<00:05:55.089> a<00:05:55.120> quarter<00:05:55.569> blocks<00:05:55.960> now<00:05:56.199> in<00:05:56.319> the

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
like they're a quarter blocks now in the

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.980 
like they're a quarter blocks now in the
game<00:05:56.560> if<00:05:56.830> you<00:05:57.190> look<00:05:57.430> it<00:05:58.000> doesn't<00:05:58.180> like<00:05:58.330> look<00:05:58.810> at

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
game if you look it doesn't like look at

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.629 
game if you look it doesn't like look at
their<00:05:59.169> full<00:05:59.440> huge<00:05:59.949> blocks<00:06:00.279> because<00:06:00.520> you

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
their full huge blocks because you

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.550 
their full huge blocks because you
compare<00:06:01.089> them<00:06:01.210> with<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.360> trees<00:06:01.629> I<00:06:01.900> don't<00:06:02.500> know

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
compare them with the trees I don't know

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.879 
compare them with the trees I don't know
they<00:06:02.740> don't<00:06:02.860> look<00:06:03.069> come<00:06:04.050> fully<00:06:05.050> resized<00:06:05.440> I<00:06:05.680> was

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
they don't look come fully resized I was

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.200 
they don't look come fully resized I was
hoping<00:06:06.190> that<00:06:06.250> there'd<00:06:06.520> be<00:06:06.580> like<00:06:06.759> cow<00:06:07.150> to

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
hoping that there'd be like cow to

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.300 
hoping that there'd be like cow to
comparative<00:06:07.810> or<00:06:08.110> humans<00:06:08.560> so<00:06:08.680> we<00:06:08.800> actually<00:06:08.919> did

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
comparative or humans so we actually did

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.749 
comparative or humans so we actually did
know<00:06:09.490> but<00:06:10.479> it<00:06:10.629> appears<00:06:11.020> not<00:06:11.409> so<00:06:11.889> who<00:06:12.339> knows<00:06:12.550> it

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
know but it appears not so who knows it

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.610 
know but it appears not so who knows it
may<00:06:12.879> be<00:06:12.940> just<00:06:13.150> me<00:06:13.360> being<00:06:13.569> an<00:06:13.779> idiot<00:06:14.020> but<00:06:14.349> now<00:06:14.440> if

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
may be just me being an idiot but now if

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.010 
may be just me being an idiot but now if
you<00:06:14.680> look<00:06:14.770> behind<00:06:15.069> know<00:06:15.789> below<00:06:16.150> that<00:06:16.360> beam<00:06:16.659> and

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
you look behind know below that beam and

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.010 
you look behind know below that beam and
going<00:06:17.860> across<00:06:18.129> sort<00:06:18.580> of<00:06:18.669> the<00:06:18.789> mid<00:06:19.029> screen<00:06:19.360> if

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
going across sort of the mid screen if

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.480 
going across sort of the mid screen if
you<00:06:20.169> look<00:06:20.319> below<00:06:20.469> that<00:06:20.800> I'm<00:06:20.949> not<00:06:21.099> really<00:06:21.250> sure

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
you look below that I'm not really sure

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.309 
you look below that I'm not really sure
that<00:06:21.699> is<00:06:21.789> I<00:06:21.879> think<00:06:21.940> that<00:06:22.389> maybe<00:06:22.569> an<00:06:22.779> iron<00:06:23.139> gate

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 
that is I think that maybe an iron gate

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.379 
that is I think that maybe an iron gate
which<00:06:23.529> lately<00:06:24.129> also<00:06:24.550> led<00:06:24.759> me<00:06:24.879> to<00:06:25.000> believe<00:06:25.150> that

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
which lately also led me to believe that

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.749 
which lately also led me to believe that
this<00:06:25.539> could<00:06:25.810> maybe<00:06:26.050> be<00:06:26.319> the<00:06:26.469> entrance<00:06:26.949> into<00:06:27.490> a

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
this could maybe be the entrance into a

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.230 
this could maybe be the entrance into a
dungeon<00:06:28.529> I'm<00:06:29.529> not<00:06:29.830> I'm<00:06:29.919> not<00:06:29.949> sure<00:06:30.279> on<00:06:30.520> that<00:06:30.550> I

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
dungeon I'm not I'm not sure on that I

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.360 
dungeon I'm not I'm not sure on that I
don't<00:06:31.690> even<00:06:31.810> know<00:06:32.080> if<00:06:32.139> that<00:06:32.199> is<00:06:32.440> an<00:06:32.589> anion<00:06:33.009> gate

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
don't even know if that is an anion gate

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.430 
don't even know if that is an anion gate
below<00:06:33.879> that<00:06:34.089> it<00:06:34.210> could<00:06:34.389> just<00:06:34.419> be<00:06:34.690> some<00:06:35.229> sort<00:06:35.409> of

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
below that it could just be some sort of

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.079 
below that it could just be some sort of
cobweb<00:06:35.949> or<00:06:36.130> something<00:06:36.490> that<00:06:36.610> I<00:06:36.669> can't<00:06:36.940> even

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:37.089 
cobweb or something that I can't even

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:39.500 
cobweb or something that I can't even
recognize<00:06:37.360> some<00:06:38.319> idiot

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
recognize some idiot

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.480 
recognize some idiot
it<00:06:39.690> certainly<00:06:40.020> is<00:06:40.170> an<00:06:40.320> art<00:06:40.620> isn't<00:06:40.920> an<00:06:41.190> iron

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
it certainly is an art isn't an iron

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.150 
it certainly is an art isn't an iron
door<00:06:41.790> or<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.180> current<00:06:42.510> iron<00:06:42.750> door<00:06:42.990> and<00:06:43.200> also

door or the current iron door and also

door or the current iron door and also
forgot<00:06:44.610> to<00:06:44.640> mention<00:06:44.730> this<00:06:45.210> is<00:06:45.330> actually<00:06:45.660> the

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
forgot to mention this is actually the

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.550 
forgot to mention this is actually the
new<00:06:46.010> the<00:06:47.010> new<00:06:47.630> how<00:06:48.630> to<00:06:48.660> explain<00:06:49.110> it<00:06:49.170> the<00:06:49.350> new

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
image the new version of cobblestone and

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.380 
image the new version of cobblestone and
mossy<00:06:53.010> cobblestone<00:06:53.400> looks<00:06:53.730> a<00:06:53.820> lot<00:06:53.970> better<00:06:54.240> in

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.390 
mossy cobblestone looks a lot better in

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.310 
mossy cobblestone looks a lot better in
my<00:06:54.540> opinion<00:06:54.830> still<00:06:55.830> a<00:06:55.950> bit<00:06:56.280> just<00:06:56.640> upgraded

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320 
my opinion still a bit just upgraded

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.440 
my opinion still a bit just upgraded
which<00:06:58.320> is<00:06:58.530> maybe<00:06:58.950> why<00:06:59.400> it<00:06:59.430> looks<00:07:00.000> like<00:07:00.240> they're

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
which is maybe why it looks like they're

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.610 
which is maybe why it looks like they're
quarter<00:07:00.750> blocks<00:07:00.990> when<00:07:01.170> in<00:07:01.290> actual<00:07:01.560> fact

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
quarter blocks when in actual fact

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.260 
quarter blocks when in actual fact
they're<00:07:02.010> full<00:07:02.250> blocks<00:07:02.580> who<00:07:02.790> knows<00:07:03.000> it<00:07:03.180> would

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
they're full blocks who knows it would

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.730 
they're full blocks who knows it would
be<00:07:03.330> pretty<00:07:03.660> cool<00:07:03.870> if<00:07:03.930> you<00:07:04.050> dip<00:07:04.290> it<00:07:04.440> in<00:07:04.470> core

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
be pretty cool if you dip it in core

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.740 
be pretty cool if you dip it in core
blocks<00:07:05.040> for<00:07:05.280> there<00:07:05.370> I<00:07:05.670> think<00:07:06.240> it<00:07:06.330> may<00:07:06.450> just<00:07:06.660> be
