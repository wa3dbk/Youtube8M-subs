00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.639
 So these churches really the probes 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.360
 do get dwindling more money for themselves 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.580
 we go there 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
 loving only calls for freedom none 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.369
 Tax killed time to this state 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.880
 valley 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.470
 the consequences are office alarm red yet 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 thank god gives his savior in the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.369
 Not a real fight perfect 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.320
 crisis strategy we are fully social us 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 do not let you stand in the rain 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.190
 lead our direction I can 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.960
 next to go because it would need is 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.809
 but surely you clearly convert that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.640
 the end of the world how fast everything lies 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.680
 they were going to meet me and I know 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.100
 would only use the money private banks 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.809
 rescue 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.670
 we are the bags on it you can yours 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.289
 Land cover we are based on 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.350
 he tries not to apply 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.340
 whoever is there when you are 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:04.170
 he led his wait he stands for one 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.509
 full time is always the same 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.560
 is located just what is involved in 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.240
 full of harmony 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.240
 which was again to say 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.110
 even if it seems that we from 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.909
 a crisis will benefit the euro 1 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.700
 Too heavy, so we export more 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.680
 owe us interest and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.320
 we can report on it and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.479
 we fix that for you we are 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.520
 even so nice and give the super rich 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.110
 churches do not have to save anything 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.110
 for that is somehow outlining 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.630
 German weapons are great against Munich 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.399
 do 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.380
 in the end , but also dismiss the 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.429
 deserts cash in our money 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.440
 not at all 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.780
 but that's your fault I'm missing 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.270
 ready for profit so one of the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.130
 nation and now calls 40 too 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.399
 repairs for such a few 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.759

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:10.640
 that are simply missing for the topic 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.210
 what is always full of harmony what 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.210

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.450
 he is very serious it is me 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.490
 already guilty knows how that is one 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.160
 media truth and so after 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.860
 In this case, media democracy means that 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.750
 we do not explain politics 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.390
 just have to learn markus meal 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.550

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.730
