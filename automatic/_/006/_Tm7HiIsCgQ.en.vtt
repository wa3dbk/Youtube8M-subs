00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello today we will learn 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.059
 give life to new old things but 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.190
 Today we will take the package in normal 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.740
 cellophane package and which are in 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.260
 every house i think is huge 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.859
 quantity 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.300
 as they say was treated from the package with packages 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.510
 today we will learn 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.359
 from these packages do wonderful things 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.019
 I will say right away that the last one was done 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.570
 This is such a handbag disc and beautiful 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.020
 decision if you go for a walk outside 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.420
 the mug is not terrible sand and dirt and so 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.450
 further so what we need to do is take 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.489
 package and wonderful if they 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.090
 multicolored but they can be absolutely 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.090
 by any 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 we fold 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.940
 romka 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 phrase 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:10.720
 Here is the way of thinking package cut off 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.260
 edges 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.800
 water away to cut everything 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.090
 irregularities and everything is neat now 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:28.620
 keep and cut the stripes 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:36.820
 about a centimeter this way 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:41.020
 the package is not scary if it's labels 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:46.840
 some drawings in total mass it will be 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:50.650
 more precisely for and if the drawing is some bright 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.479
 tones circulating or even funny with me 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:02:00.960
 yellow packet and with red inscription 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:06.550
 the result is a long bag from 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:11.520
 raspberry cabbage like this 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.520
 cut into state block show 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:21.180
 next bag 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 here we also send all the lumps 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.569
 cut off the edge 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.569
 in the same way cut into strips 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:59.390
 product packages can be done not only 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.420
 handbag it could be a rug 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.720
 This is a great decision when for example 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.480
 Simon everybody knows the problem yes 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.310
 come from the street and wolf new 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.209
 carry 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.930
 a bunch of snow water well, and new advice on 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.480
 a newspaper 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.430
 but it doesn't look very aesthetically pleasing 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.370
 very beautiful so beautiful 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.760
 the solution is to make a rug as we 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.700
 now we will do and down just 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.980
 put a newspaper perfectly 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.600
 visible view of a beautiful newspaper absorbed 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.459
 see the result we got here 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.459
 such are the things 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.750
 see how we will connect here we are 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.079
 take 2 and insert it as a loop 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.959
 one to the other 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:04:01.600
 set then as usual absolutely 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:06.100
 usual draw out a friend 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.220
 good then do not tear 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:13.639
 all we got a long rope 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.920
 you can alternate two or three strips of one 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.340
 then you can add colors 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.630
 make each strip 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:29.780
 inserted a different color 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:33.260
 then again here neatly in general 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.820
 Here we will add further further 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.890
 how much do we need for our and style 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.690
 need something about the design to see us 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.550
 you need absolutely the same way we knit 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.080
 ordinary cornfields like no 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:54.380
 features do not take the hook from me here 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:05:00.760
 this start absolutely usually pay 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.760
 attention we knit two threads. 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.550
 value on usually how we associate 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:19.159
 of course at first it will be unusual 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:21.080
 the fact that all the same material is very 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.550
 quickly get used to it and see further 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:30.039
 will not notice that you knit package 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:42.530
 they type the usual chain like this 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:45.680
 absolutely ordinary and doing this 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.990
 the size of whom we need I will not do 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.930
 I'll show it to the end, just like 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.349
 reversal makes in this bag we 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.500
 we collect the number of loops 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:06:01.789
 so that was here in a circle in any way 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.039
 circular knitting do it like 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.900
 honestly don't remember how much with the loss 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.580
 it's not a big deal because 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.560
 what will you do handbag specially 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.630
 for themselves or it will be small 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.540
 Children's handbag like this or it will be 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.980
 large beach bag 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:20.050
 for you it will of course be big 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:25.780
 the size you type and usually loops 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.760
 without knit knit need here 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.640
 rectangle then on one side you 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.600
 connect him as absolutely normal 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:38.560
 knitting with then you do like that 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:41.640
 rectangular bottom you call ordinary 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.590
 rectangle of the same technology 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.710

 bottom then two creek handle i 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:57.490
 made on ordinary ringlets on which we 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.310
 we catch our keys it is possible and just 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:04.090
 put a bunch of holes in the holes 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:06.820
 you can cut it straight here from one of 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.850
 one block to another they are values â€‹â€‹like 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:13.380
 it is convenient for you so you are one and how can you 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:16.720
