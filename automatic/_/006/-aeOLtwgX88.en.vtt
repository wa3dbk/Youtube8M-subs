00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hi everyone is oryxa had to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.040
 today we find ourselves for new 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.930
 video I will introduce you all 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.179
 simply impossible stuff to have so 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.969
 items impossible to see except with 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.700
 mcp says where most are not 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.710
 available with mcp then says law all 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.570
 immediately started so seized theme well 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.960
 obviously these are the items that will be 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.859
 I think the dishes probably 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.260
 available in the next versions 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.910
 this map where there are all these hidden items 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.189
 all those who are available in the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.500
 zero point 8 points is the link 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.940
 to download it according to the description 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.079
 as well as how to install if you do not 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.219
 do not know how to do it and that's fine 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.630
 also in the description 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.340
 then we will immediately have commented 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.280
 started excuse me with what I have 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.629
 in my inventory so here I am 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.289
 will you translate will give you some 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.969
 assumptions as to what I know 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:52.050
 so that's just then already in 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.340
 will have there are two types of thumb more than 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.800
 yes it looks like tree shoots 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.480
 rather pikine shoots given 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.100
 the world tilt points pumpkins theme 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.719
 point name as there is little a clean 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 in there I can kick myself that there are some 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.650
 two and knowing that there are two types of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.400
 punk in mind that future mans we can 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.350
 to grow them then we have crops 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.210
 so crops it means to cultivate or 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.310
 harvested so I really have no 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.080
 hypothesis on it maybe this 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.330
 will be for some kind of system later 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.909
 for the red stone for simply 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.590
 harvest automatically but I think 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.330
 not that it will be that so I have not 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.119
 really assumptions and then on 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 then we have carrots and fata 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.979
 all that I have not much to say 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.259
 above 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.090
 this will be available in our next 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.890
 version finally that's after what is this 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.000
 that I have in my inventory so then 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.700
 we will be born these 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.479
 finally 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.130
 here and that's it then we'll start 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.229
 then spoke saddle so the symbols 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.030
 in fact it is to equip the horses 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.049
 so that means being given in 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.429
 more than we had bottom in this 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.189
 version there will surely be horses 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.009
 in the next version the 0.9 point 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.350
 zero but hey it's not official so 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.259
 maybe they are in the proper name 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.700
 in what after that so that's it 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.920
 dole is to equip the horses what 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.250
 c salts if you prefer and so 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.170
 here 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.700
 then we go to 1.9 but it's an egg 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.370
 quite special since it's a camera 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.140
 so this one it will be I think in 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.920
 long since it's been at least two 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.370
 pullovers at 0.4 zero point which makes little 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.000
 nearly a year a year and a half way she is 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.739
 available 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.500
 we will say they never really 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.290
 setting then i'm going to show you that 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.370
 does she really are here so there you 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.540
 see no shadow 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.700
 there I used it already and there you see that 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.410
 smoke when I stay 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.980
 and there you see that that but a kind 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.450
 which brice sees there there hop it adds 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.739
 shadows which means that there is the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.269
 camera but except that it is invisible 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.340
 since it has not been added yet 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.109
 by the developers then the slime 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.130
 bowl everyone knows what's good 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.889
 I do not need to introduce them 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.900
 I do not really know what it is and 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.060
 so here is the fire is the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.959
 frankly it burns in pure form this 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.630
 time because normally we have 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.880
 only by using lighters and 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.260
 this time we have in the inventory so 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.569
 frankly there is a nice animation 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.340
 me personally I love it I love the animation 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.829
 in inventory and all that changes from 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.660
 animated items it's pretty rare so then 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.579
 that's nothing or more basic actually 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.090
 create a flame and that's it 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:22.019
 then the inc bag so the hic bag in 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.420
 literally does that mean 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.120
 ink bag so maybe we could 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.730
 ink cartridges but otherwise I see 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.769
 really not useful that it could 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.280
 to be that it could have had - 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.170
 excuse me 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.940
 so frankly I do not really 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.560
 of hypotheses the tuber bon head as in 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.599
 will know more in future releases 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.739
 then the point names a block that was 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.859
 recently discovered 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.540
 so this block is unknown he's not even 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.730
 in name he is not known in the maine 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.530
 kraft pc either we do not know what 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.150
 so it may be an exclusive block 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.829
 or a blog that will be in the next 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.750
 version of minecraft and in the 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.760
 next from minecraft pocket edition 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.500
 so hangs he has a share that him 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.709
 happens a part that films the tension a 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.920
 particularity way the way where I had 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.959
 wrong 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.400
 so we can the twink instantly and 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.750
 yet I have no mode installed 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.570
 as you can see I put the time 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:18.340
 that it takes to undermine the sand and to 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.169
 the agglo ming obsidian it puts a lot 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.180
 of time so I 'm going to train 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.979
 last time hop this is instantly 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.479
 then we will switch to armor so 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.020
 this armor it's still been since 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.659
 roughly there 0.7 I believe she is 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.340
 available if I say no nonsense 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.599
 it is the armor in mesh dimension so 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.760
 this army in co2 but it is also 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.020
 available in the walls games like 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.870
 lifeboat if you do 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.130
 some is so this armor gives six 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.360
 points and frankly she gives a pretty 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.219
 style but it's been that it is 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.270
 present 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.440
 maybe they will add but that's good 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.460
 is still two versions 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.780
 it's there and they do not have to 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.880
 add so I do not know why 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.180
 yet it is finally over since 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.130
 can bring it she gives the number low 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.500
 it gives us the armor bridge name 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.889
 normal what for an armor they have a 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.910
 normal number we will not say too much abuse 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.080
 neither too much nor not enough 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.580
 well here it is normal there is nothing to 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.410
 repeat from June I do not see why he 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.380
 to add then there are two types 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.060
 of water and two types of avs so those 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.919
 we can have them with kim cpi says 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.870
 so then I specify I did not specify 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.430
 at the beginning of the video so these items they do not 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.560
 are not available natively in 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.870
 minecraft pocket edition so that's it 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.669
 so it's also she stays everything 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.949
 just right as you can see 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.370
 that these being completely 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:40.190
 so here are these two types after this one 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.789
 it is to make stairs in water 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.250
 quite simply 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:46.550
 then it's the same for lava as 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.039
 you can see this remains right that 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.300
 this one it just stretches 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.610
 ah no actually it's this that extends and 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.470
 this one which is what it's worth 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.539
 then what have we more we will 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:02.259
 just see 2 so I'm going 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.259
 add what i need 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:09.030
 so then we just try 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.350
 moon visible bedrock so we can not 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.820
 see if we can not first 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.000
 normally so that I think that's 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.820
 would never be available see I know 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.690
 not I would have one then we 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.100
 went the gates in hell so his 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.479
 iron doors that makes it extremely 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.580
 long as they have been available since 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:30.600
 at least the zero point 4.0 also or even 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.040
 the 0.3 point 3 I remember more 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.440
 exactly versions and everything he 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.310
 was in it and so its doors I 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.720
 think they will be added 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.340
 only when there is red 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.070
 zone since to open them otherwise it's 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.820
 completely impossible is impossible 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.610
 it's impossible 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.080
 then was 2 polo ming 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.479
 obsidian so in fact it's the 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.330
 stone who turn on everything 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.710
 just when you 're in the 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.660
 simply desert that we will 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.340
 activate your nose hours of which this one 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.510
 normally she seems not available 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.680
 natively even if they have nothing I do not 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.320
 can not say bullshit so I 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.960
 prefers to say nothing and lately we have 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.850
 snow so the snow just the 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.240
 recovery in fact as you can 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.830
 see the recovery journey so here 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.330
 here I am while waiting for that 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.979
 also changes the blog into a snow blog 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.570
 so me meanwhile I hope this 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:20.520
 video will have pleased you subscribers to 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.289
 share and do not forget to follow me 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.729
 on twitter and download the map 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:24.539
 read the description well it's very 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:26.370
 important for me 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:27.810
 and can we reach the 50 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.220
 lake for this video for this map 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.360
 exceptional with these items or 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.340
 explosives discovered 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.950
 and so here and if not the story to 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.200
 assumptions with respect to this block there 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.710
 unknown that's all I have to say to 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.710
 then everyone
