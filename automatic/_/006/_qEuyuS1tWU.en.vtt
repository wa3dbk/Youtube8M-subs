 Paris 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:14.330
 ah the turf there is mowing the fertilizers 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 watering 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.550
 the ideal it will be green grass resistant the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.940
 heat to drought but with little 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.850
 shearing 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:29.240
 so this revolutionary turf existed 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.460
 and there is this grass look this is the 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.130
 zodiac and folha night it's a 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.489
 Asian graminaceous it grows under 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.220
 rhizome shape rhizome that's it 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.950
 very dense network of thise which gives it 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.110
 in the end a light carpet appearance 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.110

 amazing more in the foot he more 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.340
 it is rare that he is very resistant to 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.710
 summer drought with a minimum 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.120
 watering while staying well green he 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.110
 therefore requires much less maintenance 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.110
 traditional turf 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.990
 hello alain hello froch you is the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.400
 pioneer in France of the zoo izia why 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.320
 this specialty there was a demand 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.540
 at the base is the search for opportunities 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.310
 that they save water dozens and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.979
 tea research needed to put 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.720
 at the point a grass growing process in 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.640
 plate and in rolls from this 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.590
 folha soviet plant that was known 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.170
 for its resistance to drought etc 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.430
 so me if I live in lyon in paris or 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.080
 even in Lille is what I can put

 a little jaude square ya at home 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.869
 it is not his region 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.210
 privileged against it will be necessary 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.289
 accept that it's winter day because 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.340
 that he does not like the accumulation of 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.180
 negative temperatures 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.130
 thank you to thank you franck zodiac 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.320
 marketed either in the form of 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.969
 rolls either in the form of plates 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.920
 ready for the break for the surfaces 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.090
 less like in this garden where we 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.090
 let's put it in place 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:55.850
 so for the break 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:58.219
 the soil must be very draining here he has 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.759
 been prepared on about 15 cm of 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.670
 depth 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.530
 we weed it we broke it we have 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.530
 eliminated on the surface the big pebbles 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.410
 the skin is like a floor 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.720
 pascal edge is typing 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.780
 with 7 loaches to facilitate 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.950
 the adhesion of the plates on the ground 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.780
 and play between the plates that are 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.550
 apparent will fade completely 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.060
 disappear with time ordered a 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.480
 completely flat and even surface 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.560
 and rooting will be well done 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.380
 when the plate can no longer be 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.530
 raised from the ground 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.360
 we will finish with a watering side maintenance 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.650
 it will only take three times less 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.170
 watering compared to a lawn 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.720
 classic only one to two 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.490
 annual nitrogen fertilization will suffice 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.670
 also and for mowing there it's the 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.010
 happiness six to eight interventions maximum 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.670
 per year to have a greasy lawn is 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.410
 completely date the zaï zaï 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.570
 unfortunately more expensive but 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.520
 the investment will be amortized in 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.560
 less than two years in view of the 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.080
 saving watering and mowing water 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.610
 that you will realize side taken for a 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.470
 garden of about 100 square meters the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.110
 price is of course depending on the surface 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.730
 count around 15 to 18 euros the 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.160
 square meter 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.050
 that's a solution you who live on 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.360
 the edges of the Mediterranean or 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.430
 the Atlantic in the agreement the visa 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.590
 do not like the cold but wherever you 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.190
 be in France for a small garden 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.770
 japanizing or a terrace like here 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.870
 not tempting you and well now to 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.700
 buttons there decor for me there's the

 sofa waiting for me is the nap
