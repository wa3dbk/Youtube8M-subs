 dotcom forest where they will discover a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.269
 dream that was built exactly 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.820
 20 years and today a group is a reality 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.739
 of friends we are three friends for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.320
 ingenios ospina luis eduardo moto a juan 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.320
 escobar that we got together and decided 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.719
 buy a property near bogota we are 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.179
 one hour away where what more 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.920
 we were passionate about what we were most interested in 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:00.300
 was to plant trees of this thermal floor 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.269
 trees of the cundiboyacense highlands in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.470
 this moment we have planted 6 thousand 200 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.370
 trees and inside there is a farm 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.259
 self-sufficient a great self-sufficient 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.970
 it is a place that supplies itself 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.230
 then we have goats 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.780
 rabbits sheep chickens different flames 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.330
 minor species and also 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.979
 we started to self-supply and the 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.310
 surplus we sold them outside to 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.740
 to be able to make a forest sustainable 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.600
 a part of the primary native forest and 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.770
 the others are the amount of trees that 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.590
 we have sown we have more or less 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.909
 around about 50 varieties and the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.549
 secret of this bread is because it has had 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.119
 to see a lot with passion love for 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.850
 nature respect to teach 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.430
 many people that it is still possible to see 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.450
 on this planet and we still have 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.910
 many opportunities to be here 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.130
 here we also receive schools that 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.560
 a visitor comes per day that is to say a 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.990
 school and we establish a series of 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.979
 pedagogical workshops where we teach them 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.990
 to young people not only to learn to 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.459
 put together the planet because yes but to 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.920
 recognize native species 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.100
 Colombians where we also strengthen 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.819
 values â€‹â€‹such as responsibility the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.220
 Solidarity commitment and above all 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.319
 self-esteem because a person then 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.720
 that you do not want you can not love anyone 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.530
 more but the idea is that from a 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.530
 work we do 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.750
 of awareness with nature 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.329
 you also work with people to 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.879
 when they visit us on the farm 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.200
 have a full pedagogical experience 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.870
 of life and especially in much 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.930
 colombianidad I was out of colom 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.420
 of a time and I saw a natural park already 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.829
 from there then like to start 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.390
 think about when to reach middle age 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.829
 find a space and a place for 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.379
 the young people could come here 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.829
 express yourself find what it means 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.290
 a farm an organic garden a 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.519
 livestock workshop or even things that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.980
 they have to do with art because it was 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.670
 mix art ecology and agriculture 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.400
 clean 'it has been three years since 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.220
 that makes us are visiting and we 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.010
 we've had around like about 20 thousand 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.450
 200 visitors during these three years and 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.480
 it's like a network of friends who have come 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.010
 growing up because I'm also a teacher 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.959
 I am a graduate of the national school 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.359
 of dramatic art with emphasis on 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.549
 mastery and in performing arts and in 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.740
 artistic pedagogy and we start how 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.410
 mix everything is a day here the people 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.870
 they visit us and we show them what 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.390
 What is this project that has already opened the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.010
 doors to all the altiplano 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.690
 cundiboyacense to the whole country because there 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.510
 other people who want to come and 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.700
 know the production systems in 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.750
 a self-sufficient farm I think that 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.790
 the most important thing is to have persistence 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.640
 I have seen during some 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.370
 opportunities people who have to 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.350
 they do very good things but they are very 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.470
 impatient then they want to get 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.340
 immediate results and instead of looking 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.290
 the goal they lose because they stay 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.930
 in the impediment the fact of being 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.430
 persevering to discover that all 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.730
 days is a different day in a 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.950
 business-level experience that is 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.920
 part of the enrichment and especially to 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.780
 from one of a single idea 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.510
 the first thing we decided was to plant 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.340
 trees everything else was unleashing and 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.000
 to fort and a way has been strengthened 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.820
 such that when we started then 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.770
 we were very very sardines but about 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.680
 we all had per se 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.699
 and an important thing is called passion the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.030
 passion is achieved with discipline and with 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.680
 strength and above all do not pay attention to 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.229
 the dream thieves that I call 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.090
 when people tell hinojosa that 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.669
 you're going to do it's not going to work in that 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.590
 place or that business if you do or not what 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.000
 What it's about is starting as a company 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.789
 example in this case this is a company 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.419
 of an environmental nature where we help 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.370
 those who have more capacity 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.870
 acquisitive as they help others to 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.240
 that we can talk about a project 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.009
 pedagogical that gave birth then to 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.190
 me the most important advice I just 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.289
 would put a single stop perseverance and 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.060
 perseverance have many ways 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.550
 to interpret and they are not immediate 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.889
 because the projects that become 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.889
 solids are kneaded in time
