pretty<00:00:15.210> good<00:00:15.389> technique<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:15.960> well<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.260> have

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
pretty good technique as well you have

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.689 
pretty good technique as well you have
the<00:00:16.529> nice<00:00:16.710> short<00:00:16.980> backswing<00:00:17.369> which<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the nice short backswing which is

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.099 
the nice short backswing which is
something<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.270> focus<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:18.990> at<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
something we do focus on here at the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.260 
something we do focus on here at the
academy<00:00:19.380> because<00:00:20.310> if<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.640> student<00:00:20.939> has<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
academy because if a student has the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.330 
academy because if a student has the
shorter<00:00:21.630> backswing<00:00:22.080> they<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.800> really<00:00:23.070> focus

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
shorter backswing they can really focus

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.400 
shorter backswing they can really focus
on<00:00:23.699> their<00:00:23.880> extension<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.689> driving<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
on their extension and driving the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
contact point all the way out to send

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.730

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.410 
the ball forward all right those who
choose<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.980> larger<00:00:32.399> backswing<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.000> know<00:00:33.120> it's

going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:33.899> bit<00:00:34.020> harder<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> time

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
going to be a little bit harder to time

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
see a little bit more smoother circle

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.750 
see a little bit more smoother circle
you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.680> about<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> other<00:00:49.980> than<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> mean

happens<00:00:52.590> seriously<00:00:52.860> when<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.070> go<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
happens seriously when you go to the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.029 
happens seriously when you go to the
side<00:00:53.640> then<00:00:53.910> there's<00:00:54.719> kind<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.110> sudden<00:00:55.620> drop

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
side then there's kind of a sudden drop

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.560 
side then there's kind of a sudden drop
there<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.489> sort<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> stops<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> sort

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
there and it sort of stops and it sort

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.090 
there and it sort of stops and it sort
of<00:00:57.629> realized<00:00:58.050> itself<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> come<00:00:58.710> around<00:00:58.829> is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
of realized itself to come around is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.709 
of realized itself to come around is
instead<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.789> like<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> roller<00:01:00.600> coaster

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
instead of a like a roller coaster

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.429 
instead of a like a roller coaster
circle<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.890> mean<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:03.229> you<00:01:04.229> do

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
circle you know what I mean but you do

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
circle you know what I mean but you do
play<00:01:04.470> very<00:01:05.129> well<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> mean<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.119> would<00:01:06.360> not

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
play very well so I mean I would not

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020 
play very well so I mean I would not
suggest<00:01:06.720> any<00:01:07.080> major<00:01:07.380> changes<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.189> they<00:01:08.850> see

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
suggest any major changes but they see

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.289 
suggest any major changes but they see
how<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> kinda<00:01:10.010> if<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.430> sort<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> goes<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
how it kinda if it sort of goes to the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.090 
how it kinda if it sort of goes to the
side<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:12.960> stops<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.470> goes<00:01:13.650> down<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
side and then stops and it goes down and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.910 
side and then stops and it goes down and
then<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.280> has<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.430> go<00:01:14.640> again<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.210> sort<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.920> you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
then it has to go again and sort of you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
then it has to go again and sort of you
know<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> mean<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:18.030> smooth<00:01:18.420> as

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
know what I mean it's not as smooth as

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.330 
know what I mean it's not as smooth as
it<00:01:18.659> could<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:19.979> make<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> little

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it could be so if you can make a little

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.530 
it could be so if you can make a little
more<00:01:20.400> smooth<00:01:20.700> i<00:01:20.820> might<00:01:21.000> help<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.330> but

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
more smooth i might help you but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
more smooth i might help you but
otherwise<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.650> elements<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.220> there

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
otherwise that the elements are there

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.679 
otherwise that the elements are there
you<00:01:23.520> turn<00:01:23.759> your<00:01:23.909> hips<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.240> shoulders<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
you turn your hips and shoulders to the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.840 
you turn your hips and shoulders to the
side<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.590> rackets<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> side<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
side the rackets on the side you have a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.219 
side the rackets on the side you have a
short<00:01:27.119> backswing<00:01:27.540> you're<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> separate

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
short backswing you're going to separate

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.899 
short backswing you're going to separate
those<00:01:28.380> hands<00:01:28.619> maybe<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.130> sooner<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
those hands maybe a little sooner and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
those hands maybe a little sooner and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
maybe try to get this arm up to catch

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
maybe try to get this arm up to catch
the<00:01:31.710> ball<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.159> bit<00:01:32.340> better<00:01:32.520> helps<00:01:33.180> you

the ball a little bit better helps you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.819 
the ball a little bit better helps you
find<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.600> contact<00:01:34.079> point<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.530> front<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
find that contact point out in front it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.499 
find that contact point out in front it
helps<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> weight<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.759> front<00:01:36.210> foot

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
helps you get the weight on front foot

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.899 
helps you get the weight on front foot
and<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.259> front<00:01:37.560> foot<00:01:37.740> pivot<00:01:38.070> would<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.610> on

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and the front foot pivot would be on

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.140 
and the front foot pivot would be on
that<00:01:39.060> front<00:01:39.360> foot<00:01:39.450> there<00:01:40.549> yep<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.729> all<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that front foot there yep and all the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240 
that front foot there yep and all the
way<00:01:42.240> around<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.380> by<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> way<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
way around so this is by the way this is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.740 
way around so this is by the way this is
the<00:01:44.310> second<00:01:44.670> forehand<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> hit<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.630> is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the second forehand then you hit this is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.389 
the second forehand then you hit this is
the<00:01:45.810> second<00:01:46.170> one<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.649> want<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> try<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> keep

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the second one so we want to try to keep

focus on his backswing slide him over a
little<00:02:29.989> bit<00:02:30.110> here<00:02:30.319> because<00:02:31.160> he<00:02:31.310> does<00:02:31.489> sort<00:02:31.730> of

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
little bit here because he does sort of

computer's<00:02:37.069> not<00:02:37.220> smoother<00:02:37.819> they're<00:02:38.569> all

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
computer's not smoother they're all

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.539 
computer's not smoother they're all
right<00:02:38.989> so<00:02:39.170> there<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.950> then<00:02:40.160> go<00:02:40.340> see<00:02:40.489> how

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
right so there it is and then go see how

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.150 
right so there it is and then go see how
goes<00:02:40.730> down<00:02:40.970> he<00:02:41.330> does<00:02:41.569> do<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.989> bit<00:02:42.080> but<00:02:42.920> it

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
goes down he does do that a bit but it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.670 
goes down he does do that a bit but it
is<00:02:43.459> one<00:02:43.700> continuous<00:02:43.940> loop<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.200> see<00:02:45.350> if<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.500> can

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
is one continuous loop and see if I can

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.729 
is one continuous loop and see if I can
just<00:02:45.830> let<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.280> play<00:02:46.310> all<00:02:46.640> by<00:02:46.760> itself<00:02:47.739> this

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
just let it play all by itself this

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.460 
just let it play all by itself this
might<00:02:48.950> be<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.100> little<00:02:49.250> bit<00:02:49.430> too<00:02:49.580> slow<00:02:50.470> that's

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
might be a little bit too slow that's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.830 
might be a little bit too slow that's
why<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.620> usually<00:02:51.920> do<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.100> manually<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:56.510> always

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
why I usually do it manually it always

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.960 
why I usually do it manually it always
moves<00:02:57.080> he<00:02:57.410> does<00:02:57.590> tend<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.220> turn<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.610> down<00:02:58.730> like

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
moves he does tend to turn it down like

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.840 
moves he does tend to turn it down like
that<00:02:59.150> but<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.620> always<00:03:00.890> keeps<00:03:01.190> on<00:03:01.400> moving<00:03:01.760> um<00:03:03.850> ok

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
that but it always keeps on moving um ok

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.349 
that but it always keeps on moving um ok
I'm<00:03:05.510> also<00:03:05.840> gonna<00:03:06.170> uh<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:07.730> know<00:03:07.850> all<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.209> other

way through good that was pretty good
good<00:04:01.890> on<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.130> flat<00:04:02.250> side<00:04:02.550> but<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.819> like<00:04:03.120> I've

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
good on the flat side but I like I've

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.970 
good on the flat side but I like I've
said<00:04:03.480> before<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.990> have<00:04:04.110> very<00:04:04.319> smooth<00:04:04.680> good

technique keeping the record on the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.710 
technique keeping the record on the
right<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.520> I'm<00:04:08.580> probably<00:04:08.819> got<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.360> racket

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
right and I'm probably got that racket

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.300 
right and I'm probably got that racket
back<00:04:09.870> down<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.410> little<00:04:10.620> bit<00:04:10.739> earlier<00:04:10.800> right

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
back down a little bit earlier right

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.190 
back down a little bit earlier right
this<00:04:12.120> one<00:04:12.330> probably<00:04:12.450> could<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.780> got<00:04:12.959> down<00:04:13.170> a

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
this one probably could have got down a

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.009 
this one probably could have got down a
little<00:04:13.470> bit<00:04:13.590> earlier<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:15.030> then<00:04:15.150> all<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.390> way

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
little bit earlier and then all the way

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.729 
little bit earlier and then all the way
out<00:04:16.220> okay<00:04:17.840> get<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> little<00:04:18.959> more<00:04:19.139> topspin<00:04:19.590> I

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
out okay get a little more topspin I

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.319 
out okay get a little more topspin I
should<00:04:19.889> see<00:04:20.040> some<00:04:20.250> strings<00:04:20.579> as<00:04:20.790> that<00:04:20.970> racket

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
should see some strings as that racket
