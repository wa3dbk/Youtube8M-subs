1 tsp active dry yeast

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
For the filling we will need:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
500 g unsalted pistachio, coarsely chopped.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
150 g (1½ cup) sugar syrup

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
1 tbsp caster sugar which will need to be mixed with the pistachio before we add the sugar syrup.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:32.000
To start the dough, make a well in the center of the flour and add the ghee and mix together. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Add quarter of the sugar and mix.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Transfer the dough onto a baking tray and chill in the fridge.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Mix the water with the remaining sugar and yeast.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:42.000
now add the yeast mixutre and stir with your hands just until incorporated. Do not knead.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Transfer the maamoul dough back to a bowl and knead it a little bit.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Transfer the dough again to the baking tray and chill for 30 minutes in the fridge.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:25.000
To make the filling, add the sugar to the pistachio along with 2 tbsp of water and mix well with your hand.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Add the sugar syrup in 2 batches and mix well.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Knead the dough a little until smooth.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Take half of the dough and shape it into a thin log. Cut 1 inch pieces.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Press the pieces flat and fill them with a piece of the pistachio mixture. 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Measure the same size of the pistachio mixture for each piece of dough.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Place the pistachio mixture in the center and fold the dough over to cover the filling. Then place it aside sealed side down.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Repeat the same process with the remaining dough and filling.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Now using a maamoul mould sprinkled with a bit of flour

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:41.000

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:56.000
shape the maamoul into their traditional form by pressing the top side into the mould.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:12.000
