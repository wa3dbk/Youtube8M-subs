00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.930
 to the bullseye we are with diana ostáriz 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.150
 here our neighbor in this contest 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.130
 enchanted with her as you see is without 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.200
 do nothing 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.900
 Diana would like us to give her her 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.869
 opinion 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.270
 about what three indispensable qualities 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.259
 must have a good dressage rider 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.690
 classical 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.770
 well I think that the first thing that should 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.530
 have is sensitivity because yes no 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.190
 impossible or very difficult 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.379
 after 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.180
 not what you have to have long before 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.640
 they are many was a very person 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.100
 worker 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.309
 and another very important quality for me 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.860
 is that you have an open mind because 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.110
 as here you can always improve and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.920
 you can always evolve for that 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.800
 you have to be open to see things 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 new is great so fine 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.310
 thank you diana and good luck in this 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.650
 kissing good championship taking advantage of that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.229
 Victor has not yet assembled his 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.440
 curious horse let's do it again 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.780
 the three questions of the day what 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.040
 qualities must have a good rider 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.990
 Dressage classic habit 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.930
 Well look at the truth is that if I knew 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.820
 I would work with myself but I do not know 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.610
 I believe that in one of these I discover them 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.020
 it's very good that's the fake take now 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.020
 let's do it seriously 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.900
 It would also be good but I do not know how to see 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.760
 I already told him the bodies that I do not know 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.040
 the qualities attempt to work the 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.350
 you doubt but I do not know if I get this I think 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.650
 which is the law of good that never 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.940
 explaining so that you have no competition 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.130
 but the truth is yes 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.510
 I would do the competition to myself that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.490
 actually no 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.130
 seriously do not give us the qualities 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.810
 to be a good rider that I do not know that 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.450
 It is that then would be a rider of 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.430
 God, but since I do not know, I'm not a horseman 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.500
 yes normal of those who work all the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.760
 days to try to get to work and 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.760
 until then 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.530
 before with that quality 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.650
 I wish I had qualities 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:41.629
 more or less it's very good that we're left 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.540
 you do not waste qualities but if you could 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.150
 do the letter to the kings who think 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.030
 should choose in that letter a good 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.019
 rider to get his maximum 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.019
 performance as such 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.819
 I'm very hardworking 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.530
 second 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.090
 be absolutely open to 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.519
 to the power 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.890
 do not stay locked in the little a 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.640
 given time you can know if you 're not 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.700
 open it is impossible for you to acquire more 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.420
 knowledge 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.420
 to have 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.410
 winter capacity 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.390
 the eyes as I say very open 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.990
 evolution of the ability to capture and 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.610
 to catch things from what from what 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:37.670
 they teach you and what others do 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.670
 and the third when the third 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.959
 worker the first worker will be 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.000
 open minded to be able to accept and 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.489
 can see where you are and learn 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.380
 of others and the third can learn 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.060
 exact and the third quality that that we 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.890
 it takes a bit of genetics to be 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.490
 Long enough for hahaha 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.030
 get to do something is worth it because we want 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.910
 that these three qualities are very 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.590
 patents in your life worth come thank you
