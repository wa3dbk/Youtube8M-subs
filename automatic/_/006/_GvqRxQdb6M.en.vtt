00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.080
 and rammstein is distilled by room 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.390
 shy'm i had with a friend of aix so 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.710
 it was a chain of I believe 89 if I 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.360
 do not cheat so here I go instead 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.890

 with a super bowl fucking people if he 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.140
 must choose a late this chain y 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:22.080
 to go I do not want to touch it because I 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:28.030
 found that you went 1 go 2 to the e3 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.229

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.390
 me but here I am from a hysteria not 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.520
 possible in addition to a trans level to say 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.189
 that it will evolve quickly that there is 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.680
 worse as ghadames at random tevatron 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.659
 expect to go 2 to the e3 yes yes it is 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.390

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.860
 yes yes yes I'm happy because it ends 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.159
 of course they gave me a nickname and 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.950
 no of a 2009 show it's an evil I'm going 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.520
 the blade key so why blast that 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.479
 means the soul actually in English I 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.510
 will call him but I'm cheating on hunting 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.530
 for I dreamed away from us if you 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.150
 more frankly at in the box 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.300
 time I look so I made a 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:30.510
 chain of I tell you to 89 it's simple 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.510
 I fight balls down -3 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.710
 was waiting so you saw that I have my 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.490
 old cock and make my hoc mask 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.760
 evolved into joko 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:48.030
 well then in time excuse me there I 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.910
 will you calm down a little late 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.960
 hi authors salsify kill 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.070
 synchro he did not have he is either their 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.200
 Nature I do not know what's that their 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.540
 sim not bad so that's good 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.580
 attack it gives me the defense and a 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.350
 great telethon special 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.880
 well it's not so bad for her 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.170
 counterpart to the mega lake of mauves in 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.620
 defense but I do not care so little for 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.120
 tell you good I propose that in addition I 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.170
 I doubted I think about it and so much 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.550
 dense and harass chenni told myself 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.540
 I'll stop at 400 because 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.630
 you apply in mind now I 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.010
 am sick and I have a great end and I 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.020
 trembles like a sick person since 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.570
 the time and I saw him appear star 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.010
 jani room i thought to myself but fucking 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.720
 what is it there when I have some 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.540
 mandals and yes you go didier chenet 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.590
 yeah and besides I was thinking I'm going 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.780
 react how when am I going to meet 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.150
 because I could write spells of 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.040
 a little hysterical way their fucking 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.840
 shiny to shine is amazing to the houlala 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.990
 or else I could have written 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.170
 so absolutely I do foutiste 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.450
 Chechnya flows without further ado and 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.920
 finally no I was finally finally 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.090
 the water I had to see but it's 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.040
 pretty funny as a reaction made so 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.790
 it was rather I drove late this 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.010
 chain puts a little good mouth mode 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.440
 it makes me three checks in this game it 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.950
 already makes me there in I do not care a 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.600
 repulsive 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.770
 so what's great is that you 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.450
 do not wait for me to explain the trick 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.350
 that I received watching what is 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.030
 really great is that I explain 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.530
 it was that I had done we could read 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.989
 I wanted to create a team entirely 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.120
 conceived of chagny and in fact what happened 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.390
 past is that I said to myself but I 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.390
 play 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.210
 I'm really going in fact and that's 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.139
 to have galam at nyx is what you 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.560
 do for me it's the hardest to 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.789
 get 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.440
 because I wanted in my team 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.759
 play the circus to meru so these next 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.099
 clichÃ©s it's the runaway euros 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:41.509
 each to the tubes the xx but that's it 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.710
 the thing this ars to Lille and system of 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.289
 mails would have papounet not been able to evolve 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.490
 so win there it's an evil whose 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.110
 could evolve look to see is in 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.930
 galley then I go clown and this by 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.879
 room I'm going to redo a guy to see 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.979
 I was not hoping for a girl to say this 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.590
 is not useful started that tarde of 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:02.930
 see these pokemon wines which is 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:04.039
 logically female bf years old and i'm going 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.169
 keep wales soul in my team 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.669
 I looked and blade and I'm going 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.750
 cherish with all my heart you super 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:22.669
 Frankly happy then we will live then 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:24.289
 a level 30 plus I took some 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.909
 pictures if you had the camera shifted 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.280
 I did not look at his potential 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.779
 against so there levies destiny so 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.460
 it's the movement camou full tilt a 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.889
 so i think i will keep private 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.110
 my destiny because we never know that 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.130
 can serve me 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.389
 but let's imagine that I meet him a 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.469
 pokemon rather powerful than jean the 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.550
 start pretty quickly I do 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.289
 destiny levies I know he's going 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.080
 kill my guy there but I do not care I 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:49.130
 do you want to yeah because I had a 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.389
 other attack that had memories in 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.919
 did that make me flipper because 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.300
 it's here by sahil to memories with 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.340
 he uses or menuires it puts him ko 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.349
 and I lose the kennel in front of me as 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.479
 it rhymes 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.849
 so what I'm going to do is that 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:05.360
 like because it's related to level 30 I'm going 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.710
 do and white that comes back not 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.270
 necessarily before your eyes but do it 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.400
 I will show the evolutions and 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.310
 then I show you the evolution in 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.310
 station to see and in gala astana
