00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
here we are in pitch blackness to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.300 
here we are in pitch blackness to
demonstrate<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.780> three<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.830> four<00:00:17.039> point

demonstrate to you three and four point
lighting<00:00:17.580> made<00:00:18.270> easy<00:00:18.510> we're<00:00:19.170> going<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.350> start

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
lighting made easy we're going to start

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.340 
lighting made easy we're going to start
with<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.740> softbox<00:00:20.250> turn<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> 500<00:00:21.570> watt<00:00:21.689> soft

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
with a softbox turn on a 500 watt soft

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.920 
with a softbox turn on a 500 watt soft
box<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.400> 500<00:00:23.910> watt<00:00:24.029> softbox<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.689> about

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
box and this 500 watt softbox is about

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.349 
box and this 500 watt softbox is about
six<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.529> half<00:00:25.560> feet<00:00:25.859> away<00:00:26.220> from<00:00:26.789> our<00:00:26.939> model

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
six and a half feet away from our model

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.929 
six and a half feet away from our model
coming<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.170> an<00:00:28.380> angle<00:00:28.740> about<00:00:29.340> four<00:00:29.640> feet<00:00:29.789> away

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
coming in an angle about four feet away

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
coming in an angle about four feet away
from<00:00:30.060> our<00:00:30.330> camera<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.099> she

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
from our camera and you can see she

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.010 
from our camera and you can see she
looks<00:00:32.430> pretty<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.120> there's<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> shadow<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
looks pretty but there's a shadow on the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.840 
looks pretty but there's a shadow on the
right<00:00:34.170> side<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.530> her<00:00:34.620> face<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.579> want

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
right side of her face now you do want

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.670 
right side of her face now you do want
shadows<00:00:36.270> because<00:00:36.480> shadows<00:00:37.079> denote<00:00:37.440> some

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
shadows because shadows denote some

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.139 
shadows because shadows denote some
death<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.340> don't<00:00:38.610> want<00:00:38.730> them<00:00:38.820> too<00:00:38.940> deep

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
death but you don't want them too deep

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.319 
death but you don't want them too deep
so<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.980> use<00:00:41.010> another<00:00:41.820> point<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
so we are going to use another point of

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.840 
so we are going to use another point of
light<00:00:42.540> not<00:00:43.050> actually<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> light<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.700> we're

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
light not actually a light but we're

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.029 
light not actually a light but we're
going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> use<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> reflector<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.680> bring<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.980> up

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
going to use a reflector to bring it up

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.459 
going to use a reflector to bring it up
so<00:00:47.190> let's<00:00:47.340> bring<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> reflector<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.989> hold

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
so let's bring up the reflector and hold

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
so let's bring up the reflector and hold
it<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.649> Wow<00:00:50.039> doesn't<00:00:50.789> she<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.210> pop<00:00:51.420> out

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it up Wow doesn't she really pop out

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
it up Wow doesn't she really pop out
from<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> background<00:00:52.050> now<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.770> two

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
from the background now this is two

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.910 
from the background now this is two
point<00:00:53.460> lighting<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.809> two<00:00:54.989> lights<00:00:55.260> one

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
point lighting we we have two lights one

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.790 
point lighting we we have two lights one
light<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:57.660> softbox<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> other<00:00:58.530> light

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
light is the softbox and the other light

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.060 
light is the softbox and the other light
is<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.399> reflector<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.530> count<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.920> as

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is the reflector but you can count it as

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.680 
is the reflector but you can count it as
light<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.789> actually<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> light

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
light because it actually is a light

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.929 
light because it actually is a light
source<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.290> we're<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.650> cheap<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.309> this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
source now we're really cheap on this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
source now we're really cheap on this
particular<00:01:06.210> video<00:01:06.689> tape<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.260> we're<00:01:07.740> not

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
particular video tape and we're not

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.340 
particular video tape and we're not
using<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.430> $90<00:01:09.390> reflector<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.049> are<00:01:10.170> actually

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
using a $90 reflector we are actually

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.929 
using a $90 reflector we are actually
using<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.979> car<00:01:12.530> sunshade<00:01:13.549> but<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.670> know<00:01:14.790> what

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
using a car sunshade but you know what

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.820 
using a car sunshade but you know what
it<00:01:15.090> does<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> job<00:01:15.600> let's<00:01:15.869> pull<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.229> sunshade

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it does the job let's pull that sunshade

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.820 
it does the job let's pull that sunshade
back<00:01:17.070> again<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> show<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> shadow<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
back again to show you the shadow and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.080 
back again to show you the shadow and
let's<00:01:19.830> bring<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> back<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.970> how<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
let's bring it back and you see how it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.310 
let's bring it back and you see how it
fills<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:21.869> still<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
fills in there's still going to be a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.140 
fills in there's still going to be a
shadow<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.009> side<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> her<00:01:23.369> face<00:01:23.580> but

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
shadow on the right side of her face but

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.550 
shadow on the right side of her face but
proportionately<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.290> less

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
proportionately it's going to be less

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.670 
proportionately it's going to be less
than<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.450> bright<00:01:27.689> light<00:01:27.900> coming<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.560> now

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
than the bright light coming in so now

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.440 
than the bright light coming in so now
we<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.829> our<00:01:28.979> two<00:01:29.220> point<00:01:29.520> lighting<00:01:29.729> okay<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
we have our two point lighting okay so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
we have our two point lighting okay so
you've<00:01:30.750> heard<00:01:30.930> about<00:01:31.049> three<00:01:31.590> point<00:01:31.890> lighting

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you've heard about three point lighting

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160 
you've heard about three point lighting
this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.549> two<00:01:32.729> point<00:01:33.000> well<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.509> will<00:01:33.659> heard<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this is two point well you will heard so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.539 
this is two point well you will heard so
much<00:01:34.290> about<00:01:34.350> three<00:01:34.799> point<00:01:34.979> lighting<00:01:35.159> which<00:01:35.400> is

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
much about three point lighting which is

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.850 
much about three point lighting which is
your<00:01:35.700> main<00:01:35.909> which<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> key<00:01:37.409> light<00:01:37.650> off

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
your main which we have a key light off

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620 
your main which we have a key light off
to<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> side<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> camera<00:01:39.060> about<00:01:39.270> six<00:01:39.509> feet

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
to the side of the camera about six feet

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.710 
to the side of the camera about six feet
away<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.680> our<00:01:40.950> fill<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.299> case<00:01:42.509> we're

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
away we have our fill in this case we're

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
away we have our fill in this case we're
using<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.990> reflector<00:01:43.470> which<00:01:43.500> works<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.100> as

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
using a reflector which works just as

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.819 
using a reflector which works just as
good<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> regular<00:01:45.299> light<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.409> need

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
good as a regular light and now we need

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.039 
good as a regular light and now we need
the<00:01:47.149> backlight<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.960> on

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the backlight and it's going to be on

going to be as strong in this case it's

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.650 
going to be as strong in this case it's
a<00:02:14.190> reflector<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.090> we<00:02:15.209> still<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:15.480> some

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
a reflector so we still have some

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.750 
a reflector so we still have some
shadows<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.230> they're<00:02:16.379> not<00:02:16.470> as<00:02:16.650> harsh<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.610> now

shadows but they're not as harsh and now

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.490 
shadows but they're not as harsh and now
we<00:02:18.120> have<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.390> back<00:02:18.569> light<00:02:18.840> which<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
we have the back light which is on the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.680 
we have the back light which is on the
hair<00:02:19.830> however<00:02:20.700> what<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.180> wanted<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> do

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
hair however what if we wanted to do

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.120 
hair however what if we wanted to do
four<00:02:22.319> point<00:02:22.620> lighting

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
four point lighting

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.830 
four point lighting
we<00:02:23.190> had<00:02:23.280> another<00:02:23.520> point<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:23.910> light<00:02:24.090> what<00:02:24.690> we

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
we had another point of light what we

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.650 
we had another point of light what we
would<00:02:24.990> do<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.380> we<00:02:25.410> would<00:02:25.560> want<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.360> not<00:02:27.360> deal

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
would do is we would want to not deal

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.360 
would do is we would want to not deal
with<00:02:27.810> our<00:02:27.960> subject<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:28.560> deal<00:02:28.800> with<00:02:29.040> what

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
with our subject but deal with what

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.950 
with our subject but deal with what
swaying<00:02:29.790> back<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.270> subject<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
swaying back of the subject the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.960 
swaying back of the subject the
background<00:02:31.440> light<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.310> we're<00:02:32.490> going<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.670> light

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
background light so we're going to light

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.700 
background light so we're going to light
our<00:02:33.000> background<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> fourth<00:02:34.080> point<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.500> light

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
our background the fourth point of light

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.100 
our background the fourth point of light
right<00:02:35.250> now<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.790> let's<00:02:36.240> turn<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.570> off<00:02:36.780> again

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
right now and let's turn that off again

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.580 
right now and let's turn that off again
really<00:02:37.620> quickly<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:39.030> again<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.540> all<00:02:40.350> that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
really quickly and on again and all that

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.290 
really quickly and on again and all that
is<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:43.070> light<00:02:44.070> that's<00:02:44.370> shining<00:02:44.460> through<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
is is a light that's shining through the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300 
is is a light that's shining through the
canvas<00:02:45.600> it's<00:02:46.050> not<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:46.530> glass<00:02:46.770> block<00:02:47.100> it's

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
canvas it's not really glass block it's

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.740 
canvas it's not really glass block it's
fake<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.700> she's<00:02:47.880> shining<00:02:48.150> through<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> canvas

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
fake is she's shining through the canvas

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.520 
fake is she's shining through the canvas
there<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.480> it's<00:02:51.480> making<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.140> background

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
there and it's making the background

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.260 
there and it's making the background
light<00:02:52.680> up<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.890> little<00:02:53.130> better<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.490> we're<00:02:54.150> going

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
light up a little better and we're going

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.690 
light up a little better and we're going
to<00:02:54.300> show<00:02:54.570> these<00:02:54.780> back<00:02:55.440> lights<00:02:55.800> without<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
to show these back lights without the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.990 
to show these back lights without the
main<00:02:56.880> light<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:59.190> let's<00:02:59.400> take<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.610> look<00:02:59.820> right

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
main light so let's take a look right

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.850 
main light so let's take a look right
now<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.420> see<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.960> have<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.320> backlight<00:03:01.830> and

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
now you see you have the backlight and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.440 
now you see you have the backlight and
the<00:03:02.160> hair<00:03:02.340> light<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.760> lot<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.060> times<00:03:03.240> people

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
the hair light a lot of times people

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.180 
the hair light a lot of times people
think<00:03:03.630> three<00:03:04.080> point<00:03:04.320> lighting<00:03:04.530> deals<00:03:04.830> with

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
think three point lighting deals with

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.370 
think three point lighting deals with
the<00:03:05.700> backlight<00:03:06.240> but<00:03:06.510> really<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.110> fourth

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the backlight but really it's a fourth

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.050 
the backlight but really it's a fourth
point<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.800> light<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.400> hair<00:03:08.670> light<00:03:08.880> is

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
point of light the hair light is

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.490 
point of light the hair light is
generally<00:03:09.450> assumed<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.810> be<00:03:09.870> your<00:03:10.050> third<00:03:10.200> point

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
generally assumed to be your third point

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.170 
generally assumed to be your third point
and<00:03:10.680> let's<00:03:11.070> turn<00:03:11.280> off<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.550> hair<00:03:11.730> light<00:03:11.940> for<00:03:12.150> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and let's turn off the hair light for a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
and let's turn off the hair light for a
second<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.660> let's<00:03:13.350> turn<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.740> soft<00:03:14.100> light

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
second and let's turn on the soft light

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.170 
second and let's turn on the soft light
so<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.470> only<00:03:16.650> had<00:03:16.860> two<00:03:17.040> lights<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:18.000> could

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
so if you only had two lights you could

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.790 
so if you only had two lights you could
do<00:03:18.300> this<00:03:18.480> let's<00:03:18.720> get<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.960> reflector<00:03:19.410> up<00:03:19.560> there

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
do this let's get the reflector up there

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.310 
do this let's get the reflector up there
you<00:03:20.550> can<00:03:20.700> do<00:03:20.790> an<00:03:20.910> interview<00:03:21.330> like<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.840> with

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
you can do an interview like this with

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.800 
you can do an interview like this with
just<00:03:22.620> two<00:03:22.890> lights<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.820> main<00:03:24.030> light<00:03:24.300> the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
just two lights the main light the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.780 
just two lights the main light the
reflector<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.440> not<00:03:25.650> really<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> light<00:03:26.280> but<00:03:26.610> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
reflector is not really a light but and
