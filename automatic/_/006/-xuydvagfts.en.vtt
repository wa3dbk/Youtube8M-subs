apps are really nice this could have

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.760

used a little bit of paint but that's
not<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> big<00:01:02.100> deal<00:01:02.780> these<00:01:03.780> arm<00:01:04.110> things<00:01:04.439> are<00:01:04.619> nice

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
not a big deal these arm things are nice

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
not a big deal these arm things are nice
and<00:01:05.040> flexible<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.610> soft<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.330> get

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
and flexible and soft so they don't get

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539 
and flexible and soft so they don't get
in<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> way<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.960> articulation<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:08.280> head

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
in the way of the articulation the head

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
in the way of the articulation the head
even<00:01:08.970> though<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> swivel<00:01:09.869> has<00:01:10.320> almost

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
even though it's on a swivel has almost

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.219 
even though it's on a swivel has almost
no<00:01:10.920> articulation<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.200> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
no articulation to it just because of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
no articulation to it just because of
the<00:01:13.350> collar<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.979> these<00:01:14.729> don't<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.509> any

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the collar there these don't have any

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.030 
the collar there these don't have any
sort<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.990> articulation<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:16.950> been

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
sort of articulation it would have been

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.590 
sort of articulation it would have been
cool<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.430> able<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.820> fold<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.450> out<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
cool to be able to like fold them out I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.539 
cool to be able to like fold them out I
think<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.259> yeah<00:01:19.680> no<00:01:19.979> big<00:01:20.159> deal

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
think but yeah no big deal

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.359 
think but yeah no big deal
they<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.659> separately<00:01:22.140> sculpted<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.040> they

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
they are separately sculpted and they

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.999 
they are separately sculpted and they
are<00:01:23.490> somewhat<00:01:23.820> flexible<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.799> nice

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
are somewhat flexible so it's nice

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.210 
are somewhat flexible so it's nice
enough<00:01:26.360> shoulder<00:01:27.360> articulation<00:01:28.080> big<00:01:28.979> ball

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
enough shoulder articulation big ball

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
enough shoulder articulation big ball
joint<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.640> normal<00:01:30.090> no<00:01:30.509> bicep<00:01:30.750> swivel<00:01:31.380> up

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
joint like normal no bicep swivel up

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.480 
joint like normal no bicep swivel up
there<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.939> elbows<00:01:33.780> there<00:01:34.310> with<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
there it is in the elbows there with the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.990 
there it is in the elbows there with the
elbow<00:01:35.790> hinge<00:01:36.380> which<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> okay<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.640> fine<00:01:38.790> by

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
elbow hinge which is okay it's fine by

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.840 
elbow hinge which is okay it's fine by
me<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> hand<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:41.840> swivel<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
me then the hand is on a swivel and a

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.319 
me then the hand is on a swivel and a
pivot<00:01:45.659> same<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.799> both<00:01:46.950> hands<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.909> decent

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
pivot same for both hands so decent

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.410 
pivot same for both hands so decent
enough<00:01:48.930> there<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.470> mean<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:49.920> somewhat

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
enough there I mean it's somewhat

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.969 
enough there I mean it's somewhat
hindered<00:01:51.420> by<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> sculpt<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.649> okay

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
hindered by the sculpt but that's okay

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.679 
hindered by the sculpt but that's okay
because<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> sculpt

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
because you have to have the sculpt

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.749 
because you have to have the sculpt
obviously<00:01:55.259> ab<00:01:55.770> crunch<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.520> normal

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
obviously ab crunch just like normal

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.520 
obviously ab crunch just like normal
