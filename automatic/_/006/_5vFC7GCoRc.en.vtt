for<00:00:58.569> me<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.739> course<00:01:00.010> I<00:01:00.159> put<00:01:00.339> in<00:01:00.429> some<00:01:00.609> disaster

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
for me of course I put in some disaster

for me of course I put in some disaster
planning<00:01:01.300> measures<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.870> I've<00:01:02.289> added<00:01:02.409> a

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
planning measures and I've added a

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.320 
planning measures and I've added a
battery<00:01:02.949> backup<00:01:02.980> for<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.550> vortex<00:01:03.969> as<00:01:04.150> well

battery backup for the vortex as well

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.060 
battery backup for the vortex as well
and<00:01:05.050> now<00:01:05.140> I<00:01:05.170> can<00:01:05.379> sleep<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.650> little<00:01:05.710> bit<00:01:05.920> easier

and<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.730> fact<00:01:24.940> that<00:01:25.030> I<00:01:25.150> can<00:01:25.330> vary<00:01:25.540> its<00:01:25.720> speed

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
and the fact that I can vary its speed

if need be the last hardware edition was
that<00:01:28.360> after<00:01:28.480> resisting<00:01:28.900> dosing<00:01:29.440> alkalinity
