00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480
 Memories of Gunplakit Review Armored Trooper Votoms 1/24 Scale 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.880
 Scope dog 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:17.199
 TAKARA 1/24 scale scope dog is as soon as it is released at the time of this anime broadcast 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.760
 It is beloved by the Votoms fan after that it is a plastic model that made its name known as a masterpiece kit 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:23.289
 30 years in a row 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.720
 It is a legendary kit that is said to talk about the Votoms version without making this kit 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.410
 Oh, 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.920
 It would have obtained something recovery and I say 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.370
 It seems like to say, but because it was actually so, it can not be helped. 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.989
 In particular, the modeler of the Gunpla Boom generation has absolute recognition 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.670
 As masterpiece kit of those days, it is a masterpiece along with 1/100 scale Baifamu of Mt. 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.199
 It was said to be a kit 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:52.030
 No odd feeling that has been exhausted talking about this kit thanks Hey, no path 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.910
 If it is a modeler, of course it was fundamental to know as general common sense , and a new story in the fellow 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.940
 To make a story of 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.780
 Remodeling the part that other modelers are not doing 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.480
 Where it also Nante hope that does not put me 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.350
 It's almost as if there were almost ill modelers. 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.080
 So these guys were the natural progression is to fit into the world of garage kit 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.080
 Even now the flow is being passed on 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:22.260
 If this guy makes a difficult kit or remodeling, the job popularity or my father is angry and why are they guys 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.980
 The modeler says that it would be easy to make it in your spare time like a recent model modeler 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.890
 Not 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.750
 Also Nante Nde presence of the family is not level make even off work if for making kit 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.270
 It is close to the modeler of the early scale model 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.719
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.909
 It is likely to get angry by the modeler of scale model 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.860
 In the case of a scale model, every time you make an exclusive area of a diorama or a finished product, you can use it at home 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.729
 Because the living space is getting smaller 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.200
 It would not be good if one in 100 people could get the understanding of the family 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:56.930
 Hey Since recently it became less of me at the finished product experience 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:00.500
 Unfortunately for those guns that were good and bad on average at that time , without memory correction 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.440
 However, the masterpiece kit which protruded was not put out 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.550
 Because there was enough sales even though there was no 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.280
 The price of the fit is 2000 yen, of course it is a resale version 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.930
 Because the kit released in 1983 was 1,000 yen spare 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.930
 Wakenanda we've doubled the price of 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.630
 The price of 1000 yen is an old man while the kit of the sentence becomes premium and difficult to obtain at that time 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.890
 There was a really reasonable price setting for the modeler . 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.620
 It is true recently because 1/20 Votoms series came out of Ulsan 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.909
 The Takara kit on the market has also become somewhat cheaper 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:40.349
 Of course if you're a Votoms fan you 've also bought a bandai kit but it's still up for the day and it's modern 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:42.960
 The old people who got used to the smashed Takara kit which has been shrunk into a smart proportion 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:48.140
 There was something wrong with the modeler 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:52.760
 I shell'm mon like a generation-specific allergic reaction to the cg animation there is a sense of discomfort 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.770
 Renovation point of the recommended'd Nan'nimo really really true Ne Nan'nimo 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:02.600
 Or guard the entire kit is to not'm cg like a now not mistake'm Te recovery 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:06.350
 When you stand out, there are many cases where the songs of the person you wrote for each scene remain 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.130
 It is a daily routine to change your balance 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.540
 In the case of Votoms, there is an animation 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:18.060
 When I did drawing, not only at but also the face of Kiriko was different. 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.720
 Although there were pros and cons, it is only natural that at that time the individuality of the film director appeared in each episode of animation 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.290
 In Tan 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.549
 If you want to make it old-fashioned, please take a look at the main anime for now 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.680
 If you dare to know the remodeling point, if you can see serious videos made by others 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:34.019
 Eee as good I thereof include 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:38.680
 The hips were weak and useful from Plamo's joints , right? 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:42.189
 The scope dog update set released by the web in 1998 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.280
 There was a hip joint and the recovered parts were also good evaluation 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.920
 Do not buy Scopedog 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.300
 The problem that a large number of male modelers occurred 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.599
 As a basic part, at is a robot with rivets, so it's a critic or a homemade one 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:59.770
 It is not good to rework with rivets in the basics of the basics 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:03.810
 The old pro modeler said that the bottoms were fighting against rivets ah 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.810
 Body odor is also associated with Kiriko and hell
