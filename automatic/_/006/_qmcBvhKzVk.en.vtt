00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
of four or five six thousand I think you

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.770 
of four or five six thousand I think you
know<00:01:11.700> you're<00:01:11.850> looking<00:01:11.940> at<00:01:12.210> percentage<00:01:12.660> of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
know you're looking at percentage of

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.950 
know you're looking at percentage of
saving<00:01:13.050> rather<00:01:13.560> than<00:01:13.890> value<00:01:14.840> depends<00:01:15.840> how

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
saving rather than value depends how

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080 
saving rather than value depends how
competitive<00:01:16.410> I<00:01:16.860> mean<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.880> it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
competitive I mean if it's do if it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570 
competitive I mean if it's do if it's
deemed<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.660> a<00:01:18.690> nice<00:01:18.960> car<00:01:19.460> it'll<00:01:20.460> be

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
deemed to be a nice car it'll be

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.120 
deemed to be a nice car it'll be
competitive<00:01:21.270> bidding<00:01:21.479> all<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> way<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.890> it's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
competitive bidding all the way if it's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.830 
competitive bidding all the way if it's
something<00:01:23.490> readily<00:01:23.850> available<00:01:23.940> then<00:01:24.570> yeah<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
something readily available then yeah I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.540 
something readily available then yeah I
think<00:01:25.080> there<00:01:25.200> will<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.380> some<00:01:26.130> considerable

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
think there will be some considerable

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.940 
think there will be some considerable
savings<00:01:27.090> today<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.990> when<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.590> look<00:01:28.920> around

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
savings today and when you look around

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.639 
savings today and when you look around
at<00:01:29.610> some<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> product<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.780> we've<00:01:30.990> got<00:01:31.229> I

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
at some of the product that we've got I

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.330 
at some of the product that we've got I
think<00:01:32.130> people's<00:01:33.320> views<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> particular<00:01:34.860> car

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
think people's views on a particular car

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.320 
think people's views on a particular car
may<00:01:35.790> vary

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
may vary

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.180 
may vary
you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.020> when<00:01:37.229> they<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.560> something<00:01:37.830> through

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
you know when they see something through

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.950 
you know when they see something through
and<00:01:38.399> go<00:01:38.940> to<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.330> reasonably<00:01:39.660> attractive

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and go to and the reasonably attractive

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.880 
and go to and the reasonably attractive
to<00:01:40.530> buy<00:01:40.710> something<00:01:41.070> else<00:01:41.190> entirely<00:01:42.229> but<00:01:43.229> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to buy something else entirely but it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.500 
to buy something else entirely but it's
going<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.160> be<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> big<00:01:44.520> event<00:01:44.640> today<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
going to be a big event today and I

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.850 
going to be a big event today and I
think<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.350> there's<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> be

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
think that you know there's going to be

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.190 
think that you know there's going to be
some<00:01:47.100> substantial<00:01:47.640> savings<00:01:47.990> for<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> good

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
some substantial savings for a good

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
some substantial savings for a good
number<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.470> people<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.880> annual<00:01:51.270> event
