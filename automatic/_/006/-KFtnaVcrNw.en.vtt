you<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:35.660> now<00:01:35.870> release<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.320> subsection<00:01:37.160> and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
you can now release the subsection and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.430 
you can now release the subsection and

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.910 

let's<00:02:44.569> look<00:02:44.810> at<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.110> forming<00:02:45.470> technique

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
let's look at the forming technique

00:02:45.920 --> 00:03:01.670 
let's look at the forming technique
again

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:10.940 

you

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.590 

continue<00:03:11.950> adding<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.520> extensions<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.390> fill

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
continue adding the extensions to fill

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.770 
continue adding the extensions to fill
the<00:03:13.780> top<00:03:13.990> row

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.190 

the<00:03:20.709> final<00:03:21.160> row<00:03:21.400> completed<00:03:22.300> is<00:03:22.480> very<00:03:22.780> small

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
the final row completed is very small

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.320 
the final row completed is very small
but<00:03:23.740> does<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.160> trick<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.459> blend<00:03:24.850> Jennifer's

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.270 

now<00:03:36.730> let's<00:03:37.660> drop<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.290> extension<00:03:38.830> here<00:03:39.100> and

now let's drop the extension here and
see<00:03:39.970> our<00:03:40.000> creation
