00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.579
 However 

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.579
 no 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.150
 The purpose of this internship was to see 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.590
 different techniques 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.949
 so especially at the level of techniques 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.690
 of mounting then on the sets we have 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.360
 sets that are much more 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.280
 sophisticated than others but when 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 one of the buch bodies is much more 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.780
 sophisticated editing is going to be a lot 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.570
 simpler way to have a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.390
 the level value that is 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.559
 at the best 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.140
 so that already brings some ways 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.400
 work to take by the jt 's 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.019
 recipes there on this message there it will be 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.339
 recipes after the little tricks 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.869
 not found in the table when 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.549
 we work we are in league between 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.119
 four walls and we do not see the what 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.439
 do the others 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.790
 we do not have much time to go see 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.710
 blow there we lose but we suffer all have 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.610
 could we eat together that we have a lot of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.630
 communication with others 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.650
 professionals who come from other 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.780
 other business locations 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:20.189
 frankly we had a very good internship 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.659
 was fine we were on a 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.120
 decoration a little less 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.860
 traditional but we still need 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.840
 the eye be drawn to the sets 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.210
 so I told them 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.520
 we did the simple between noticing 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 on the buffet and healthy bodies the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.119
 much more elaborate decorations for 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.929
 attract the eye of customers in the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.450
 showcase because that's what they 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.159
 come looking during classes he goes 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.319
 the novelty they want to leave home 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.149
 they too to see something else for 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.149
 to be able to evolve as we do
