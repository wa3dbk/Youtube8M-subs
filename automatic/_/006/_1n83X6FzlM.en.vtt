defensively<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:50.770> think<00:01:51.490> both<00:01:51.670> lines<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.299> the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
defensively I think both lines of the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.210 
defensively I think both lines of the
ball<00:01:52.540> is<00:01:52.689> what<00:01:52.869> warm<00:01:53.049> us<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.470> defense's<00:01:54.009> line

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
ball is what warm us the defense's line

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.990 
ball is what warm us the defense's line
and<00:01:54.490> offensive<00:01:54.909> line<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:57.070> was<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.220> defense<00:01:57.820> wins

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000
