00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.070
 Well, we are finally trying this 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.250
 We already wanted to get your hands on the plane 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.400
 this car 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 to prove it the pressure that we are 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.090
 testing is probably the one 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.939
 a group in most of the sales 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.970
 in a gasoline engine that is 1.2 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.610
 tsi of 105 horses 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.250
 it is a motor that gives a push 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.070
 far greater than the one that declares its 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.780
 power and we liked it very much moving 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.039
 the body of an altea xl 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.800
 this surprised us at the level of 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.070
 benefits but is that in this lion goes 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.579
 better 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.860
 it is the only fault that we did not like is 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.520
 the sound level of the engine sounds the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.410
 excess for our taste 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.700
 and even in the acceleration phase it seems 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.310
 more a diesel engine than an engine 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.340
 gasoline 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.739
 this unit that we are testing has 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.040
 some disparity of the equipment by 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.650
 example we have a flyer that is 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.410
 plastic but then we have air conditioner 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.360
 bizona heating on the seats a 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.950
 multimedia system with color screen 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.910
 Bluetooth bluetooth audio touch in order 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.910
 a series of characteristics 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.930
 we seemed worthy of review not 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.240
 we would have liked that in this unit 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.520
 there would be a leather steering wheel or so 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.689
 unless we were out of plastic yet 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.789
 we have to say that gloves 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.189
 plastic although it has a ring a 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.350
 little thin for our taste is right 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.450
 and it has a nice touch 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.020
 the finish of the seat leon good 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.760
 We believe that it has greatly improved the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 previous lion 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.630
 the most colorful plastics are in the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.630
 parts 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.990
 top of the dashboard in the console 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.050
 in the door panels in the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.729
 top the least showy are 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.050
 as in all vehicles on the part 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.910
 lower 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.910
 but it's a pretty nice car 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.290
 the seats as you can see have the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.330
 jumps just enough to hold 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.900
 well the body as it is normal be of 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.329
 high back seats 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.879
 the headrests are fine although I 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.870
 I wear it more regulated they look good to the 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.870
 height of the head 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.270
 correct 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.620
 and ergonomics was well studied 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.440
 in this car there are many controls that we 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.870
 remind other models of brands 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.709
 light football 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.340
 buttons for the control of environments 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.340
 of the doors 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.140
 we have for example to open the flow 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.380
 Roulette air are rubber that is a 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.810
 quality detail all the controls that 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.530
 they are around the column of 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.050
 address are all vehicles that 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.060
 we can find for much more money 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.550
 place the lyon benefits from some 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.520
 way of an economy of scale 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.320
 good in other vehicles because we pay 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.200
 much more for those systems and that's why 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.300
 when we have them 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.950
 we have to review 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.950
 audio equipment lion ' 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.220
 incredibly good 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.470
 but so amazing that we've been 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.020
 looking for the bass drawer because the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.730
 serious were spectacular much better 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.730
 that many cars that carried their lights 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.290
 a very high grade is very positive for 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.230
 to be doing 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.140
 an effort to equip their cars with 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.160
 a quality audio system in a 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.890
 car that good 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.190
 but he's going to bring young people and what 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.120
 You will want 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.650
 with enough quality 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.650
 dynamically it is a car 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.449
 despite having an axis 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.449
 back twist 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.090
 and even though it's good that people 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.090
 can think of a torsion shaft 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.090
 is a decrease in dynamic capacity 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.300
 of the concept 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.729
 it would not be all 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.580
 we carry tires on the green axle 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.390
 michelÃ­n 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.780
 look more 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.350
 [Music] 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.800
 the economy that the grip and still 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.110
 it's not surprising how good this musician is 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.830
 today that as you can see in his servant his 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.200
 wicked the wallet is very wet 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.380
 the car goes like rails 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.790
 at normal speeds 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.770
 but it is a car that is very good 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.000
 I really like the address is 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.480
 greatly improving the direction is 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.500
 Electric Manufacturers 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.500
 be started to find 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.920
 between the rise of 5 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.180
 with the explanation 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.180
 and that needs 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.630
 the design as you can see change 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.630
 radically it has more angular shapes 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.870
 inheriting a little the image of the ibe 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.870
 concept 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.110
 it is very strong it is true 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.300
 very attractive people look at it very 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.230
 many times 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:41.780
 designed look to be read it 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.780
 not that the car is liking 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:51.009
 good as we said before the engine 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.150
 it's an engine that's hard to believe that this 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.009
 1200 engine 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.100
 public 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:06:00.700
 and four cylinders before so much 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.540
 but it has a lot of 2000 3000 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.970
 4000 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.040
 and how low they pull to be an engine 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.050
 gasoline 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.000
 and this has a lot to see projection 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.170
 direct 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.150
 with how this engine 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.840
 managed with world 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.840
 but it is an engine 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.120
 and the speed that I go but 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.709
 it reaches it very quickly 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:36.130
 we had to look at the technical sheet 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.950
 to check that he had made a mistake 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.360
 by putting me 1.26 because we thought that 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.360
 it was 1400 percent 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.610
 and then with the consumption 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.680
 really content 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:58.440
 we are measuring 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:07:02.160
 to live rhythm a consumption of 6,300 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.260
 we forget that it has 1200 euros is a 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.090
 305 horsepower engine that moves 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.050
 a mass 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.550
 of around 1300 themselves 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.100
 it is a well 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.060
 very good for 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:23.570
 for we have to take 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.570
 but we did a 200 km journey 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.880
 at an economic pace 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:30.759
 we were in 5 with 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.340
 The best thing about this lion is the best 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.280
 engine that is not dry 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.230
 his behavior 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.200
 and the general quality 

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:52.370
 the touch the touch of 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.370
 so much with insurance
