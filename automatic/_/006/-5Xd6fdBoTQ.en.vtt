00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello everyone the truth is that you doubt about 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.960
 to do today's video we had idea 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.120
 only once to do a review 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.429
 of the sonic boom of 3ds since I want to give 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.019
 my opinion on this title and the other 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 was to talk about the first novelty 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.699
 sonic the hedgehog and the idea that they had 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 for the first game of this at the end I 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.810
 I chose this one if you want for the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.289
 next week I can do the review 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.630
 but that's what you want, I do not want either 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.670
 fill the video channel 'sonic in short 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.040
 choose you who are the ones you see 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.870
 the videos I also want to apologize if 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 Is there a mistake because the information the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.760
 I took from many places and I stayed 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.129
 with the most reliable once explained this 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 let's start many people think that the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.660
 first sonic couple was I left since 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.120
 existed before they released the sonic cd 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.829
 where in and had his first appearance in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.500
 the videogames but what few people 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.469
 know is that it was not first since its 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.539
 first appearance was in a manga in 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.760
 1992 a long time ago and it goes up and we talk about 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.420
 the origin of my rose I will leave the video 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.820
 in the description 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.629
 The fact is that before it was 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.369
 thought of me 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.590
 before he had thought about the 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.719
 video game on it refreshments had others 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.490
 blue parallel plans between them is that 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.000
 his girlfriend was going to be a human called 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.799
 madonna at that time sega and nintendo 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.079
 He got very bad and there was a lot 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.750
 competition he wanted to overcome 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.360
 nintendo and the idea they had was to create 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.939
 a new franchise to overcome the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.220
 most famous and nintendo super mario it 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.869
 They started creating a new pet to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.060
 that this was the protagonist of this 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.490
 new saga between the characters that 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.080
 they taught stabaek man that for the love 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.569
 that they caught him they changed him he taught 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.849
 returning the antagonist an armadillo 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.770
 called mighty forgiveness if he pronounced the 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:46.990
 magic killer's name made that too 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.610
 had several designs I think they would have 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.159
 put desman would have given much the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.170
 sing is mustachioed and stuffed like 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.259
 mario the game beta graphically 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.659
 it would be very different from the final version 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.970
 this beta was shown in 1990 in a 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.640
 toy fair in Tokyo this was the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.789
 the last time in this beta knew it 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.530
 you could play at greene hilton level 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.360
 Yuji Naka confirmed in an interview that 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.580
 they wanted to put this version on this 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.920
 the collection but that this prototype 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.080
 he was lost they did not find him 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.820
 no part of there also said in the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.650
 interview that the level shown had 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.560
 Seven layers to give a better 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.780
 feeling of depth and relief 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.730
 people tried to recreate the game even 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.740
 there was one that jokin here thought was the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.810
 lost version wondered where 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.030
 he had got it but in the end 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.620
 it also turned out to be fake since it went up 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.690
 another video of the supposed prototype and there 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.430
 was caught, you can still see content 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.680
 in used in the final version within the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.320
 game and now we refocus on 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.140
 madonna her hair was blond and short and 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.570
 she was wearing a tight red madonna dress 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.280
 I was completely crazy person to 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.950
 final madonna was removed by those of 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.200
 sega America and that relationship not 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.090
 they saw for a children audience a few years 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.100
 later yuji naka that another reason why 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.380
 the one that was removed are and that had to 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.630
 rescue madonna and that is a clichÃ© 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.580
 very used, besides, that idea is 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.280
 they were taking them to nintendo mario with 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.080
 pitch so they replaced madonna by 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.420
 the little animals and they focused on the 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.860
 history of that man and sonic apologize 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.930
 I make some mistake part of the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.030
 information to be translated into English 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.010
 also from what I could read the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.049
 relationship of sonic and madonna would be the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.150
 roger rabbit and jessica let's go 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.670
 it would be nothing unusual that a human 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.859
 was with a humanoid animal and that 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.659
 I was created to replace Madonna 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.000
 if we focus on the first appearance 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.280
 that he had in and in a video game in him are 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.799
 exceeded had a quite similar role already 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.819
 that sonic had to rescue emi but 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.950
 this is something that I can not 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.409
 confirm although amy's role starts 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.840
 with madonna in this game also 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.849
 that there were no animals there were plants 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.370
 how you destroy the robots and it does not fail me 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.200
 the memory is not sure if it is 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.569
 reliable information or not but equally 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.069
 I say it just in case you'll leave the link 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.169
 from the blog where did I get this info 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.209
 It's also about whether they wanted to use this 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.609
 idea in the sonic 2006 I may have 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.409
 left something but I wanted to focus on 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.939
 speak character madonna 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.709
 burn the whole quite interesting 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:11.340
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.340
 until next time
