I think that's 95% goalkeeping is

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.430 
I think that's 95% goalkeeping is
gratitude<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.120> if<00:01:40.750> you<00:01:40.900> all<00:01:41.050> got<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.230> positive

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.100 
gratitude and if you all got a positive
mindset<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.460> you're<00:01:43.120> confident<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:43.930> you're

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
mindset and you're confident and you're

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.620 
mindset and you're confident and you're
