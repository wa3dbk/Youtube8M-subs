can see whenever I say something they
are<00:02:59.580> right<00:03:00.180> here<00:03:00.210> so<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.080> makes<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.560> look<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.980> lot

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
are right here so it makes it look a lot

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.610 
are right here so it makes it look a lot
more<00:03:02.250> realistic<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:03.510> goes<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.780> hey<00:03:04.200> Troy

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
more realistic so then goes to hey Troy

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.800

so<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.310> incredibly<00:03:21.120> easy<00:03:21.209> then<00:03:21.840> for

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so that is incredibly easy then for

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.930 
so that is incredibly easy then for
those<00:03:22.470> who<00:03:22.650> were<00:03:22.770> honoring<00:03:23.220> how<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.459> got<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
timing right well I did a little bit

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.050 
timing right well I did a little bit
behind<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:28.020> scenes<00:03:28.140> work<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.640> got

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
behind the scenes work and that is I got

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.900 
behind the scenes work and that is I got
a<00:03:30.240> command<00:03:30.870> Oh<00:03:31.320> nope<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.250> don't<00:03:32.520> have<00:03:32.760> it

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
a command Oh nope I don't have it

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.930 
a command Oh nope I don't have it
anymore<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.750> had<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:34.110> command<00:03:34.620> which<00:03:35.400> would

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
anymore but I had a command which would

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.170 
anymore but I had a command which would
turn<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.630> block<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.830> red<00:03:38.250> wool<00:03:38.520> this<00:03:38.910> one

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
turn this block of red wool this one

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.290 
turn this block of red wool this one
into<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.660> block<00:03:39.990> of<00:03:40.200> redstone<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.120> then<00:03:42.120> I

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
into a block of redstone and then I

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.750 
into a block of redstone and then I
quickly<00:03:42.540> left<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.990> game<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.500> entered<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
quickly left the game and entered the

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.990 
quickly left the game and entered the
game<00:03:44.970> again<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.709> text<00:03:47.220> from<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.700> block

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
game again so that the text from a block

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.270 
game again so that the text from a block
placed<00:03:48.420> wouldn't<00:03:48.989> be<00:03:49.230> shown<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.800> then<00:03:50.040> as

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
placed wouldn't be shown and then as

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.080 
placed wouldn't be shown and then as
that<00:03:50.640> happens<00:03:51.410> this<00:03:52.410> repeater<00:03:52.920> row<00:03:53.670> gets

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
that happens this repeater row gets

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.000 
that happens this repeater row gets
powered<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.959> goes<00:03:55.230> all<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.470> way<00:03:55.680> over<00:03:55.980> here

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
powered and goes all the way over here

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.330 
powered and goes all the way over here
and<00:03:56.430> then<00:03:57.270> all<00:03:57.570> these<00:04:00.560> sticky<00:04:01.560> pistons<00:04:02.040> with

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
and then all these sticky pistons with

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.479 
and then all these sticky pistons with
block<00:04:02.700> of<00:04:02.850> red<00:04:03.060> stones<00:04:03.330> get<00:04:03.830> pulled<00:04:04.830> back<00:04:05.220> and

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
block of red stones get pulled back and

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.270 
block of red stones get pulled back and
I<00:04:06.120> have<00:04:06.270> feel<00:04:06.570> filled<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.260> these<00:04:07.650> with<00:04:08.040> a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
I have feel filled of these with a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.610 
I have feel filled of these with a
different<00:04:08.850> amount<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.390> blocks<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.230> those

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
different amount of blocks and those

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.800 
different amount of blocks and those
blocks<00:04:11.040> count<00:04:11.430> as<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.790> timer<00:04:12.120> because<00:04:12.390> as<00:04:12.690> you

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
blocks count as a timer because as you

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.880 
blocks count as a timer because as you
can<00:04:12.900> see<00:04:12.959> as<00:04:13.290> all<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.340> blocks<00:04:14.670> are<00:04:14.940> in<00:04:15.150> here

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
can see as all the blocks are in here

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.620 
can see as all the blocks are in here
all<00:04:16.890> these<00:04:17.100> torches<00:04:17.489> are<00:04:17.760> off<00:04:17.910> which<00:04:18.330> makes

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
all these torches are off which makes

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.539 
all these torches are off which makes
sure<00:04:19.020> that<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.620> command<00:04:20.070> blocks<00:04:20.310> aren't

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
sure that the command blocks aren't

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.030 
sure that the command blocks aren't
powered<00:04:20.940> but<00:04:21.480> as<00:04:21.630> soon<00:04:21.900> as<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.320> retract<00:04:22.830> them

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
powered but as soon as you retract them

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.010 
powered but as soon as you retract them
and<00:04:23.220> when<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.700> do<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.330> text<00:04:24.630> will<00:04:24.870> be

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
and when I do that the text will be

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.070 
and when I do that the text will be
displayed<00:04:25.050> as<00:04:25.880> you<00:04:26.880> can<00:04:27.030> see<00:04:27.210> not<00:04:27.479> showing<00:04:27.900> the

game<00:04:28.350> then

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.909 
says hello Troy and then I waited the
second<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.230> respond

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919

leave<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.250> link<00:04:37.669> in<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.880> description<00:04:38.000> by<00:04:38.570> the

leave a link in the description by the

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.740 
leave a link in the description by the
way<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.050> then<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:39.770> slowly<00:04:40.220> goes<00:04:40.729> over<00:04:41.479> all

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
way and then it slowly goes over all

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.080 
way and then it slowly goes over all
those<00:04:41.990> command<00:04:42.470> blocks<00:04:42.710> using<00:04:43.070> this<00:04:43.460> timing

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
those command blocks using this timing

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.379 
those command blocks using this timing
machine<00:04:44.449> because<00:04:45.260> as<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.460> just<00:04:46.699> really

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
machine because as you just really

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.960 
machine because as you just really
quickly<00:04:47.600> saw<00:04:48.050> over<00:04:48.410> there<00:04:48.770> all<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.280> items

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
quickly saw over there all the items

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.689 
quickly saw over there all the items
will<00:04:50.270> flow<00:04:50.570> from<00:04:50.930> this<00:04:51.380> hopper<00:04:51.860> over<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.639> the

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
will flow from this hopper over to the

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.510 
will flow from this hopper over to the
next<00:04:52.940> one<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.419> and<00:04:53.900> then<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.560> reset<00:04:55.130> it<00:04:55.280> all<00:04:55.400> I

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
next one and and then to reset it all I

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.480
