alright<00:00:02.010> it<00:00:02.190> took<00:00:02.429> time<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.790> do<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.689> wonder<00:00:03.959> is

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
alright it took time to do to wonder is

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.440 
alright it took time to do to wonder is
a<00:00:04.319> ssin<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.670> what<00:00:05.819> I've<00:00:05.940> been<00:00:05.970> doing<00:00:06.390> for

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
a ssin this is what I've been doing for

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.490 
a ssin this is what I've been doing for
the<00:00:06.540> last<00:00:06.600> couple<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:07.109> years

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the last couple of years

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.320 
the last couple of years
I<00:00:07.649> told<00:00:08.040> us<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.370> got<00:00:08.519> here<00:00:08.790> has<00:00:08.910> been<00:00:09.030> 4

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
I told us it's got here has been 4

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.540 
I told us it's got here has been 4
degrees<00:00:09.719> above<00:00:09.750> zero<00:00:10.230> Fahrenheit

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
degrees above zero Fahrenheit

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.230 
degrees above zero Fahrenheit
I<00:00:11.580> put<00:00:12.570> our<00:00:12.750> EFI<00:00:12.960> antifreeze<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:15.379> anyway<00:00:17.240> so

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
I put our EFI antifreeze in it anyway so

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.500 
I put our EFI antifreeze in it anyway so
you<00:00:18.330> got<00:00:18.570> your<00:00:18.779> thermostat<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.710> here<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.850> take

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
you got your thermostat in here I take

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.929 
you got your thermostat in here I take
this<00:00:21.779> plug<00:00:22.380> out<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.369> hole

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
this plug out of this hole

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.480 
this plug out of this hole
to<00:00:24.510> relieve<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> vacuum<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.890> line<00:00:26.160> I

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
to relieve the vacuum on this line I

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
to relieve the vacuum on this line I
usually<00:00:26.970> pull<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:28.189> hose<00:00:29.189> off<00:00:29.580> pour

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
usually pull this hose off pour

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.220 
usually pull this hose off pour
antifreeze<00:00:31.199> into<00:00:31.650> there<00:00:32.600> and<00:00:33.600> then<00:00:33.780> down<00:00:33.989> here

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
antifreeze into there and then down here

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.220 
antifreeze into there and then down here
on<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> block<00:00:35.000> you've<00:00:36.000> got<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.510> drain<00:00:36.840> plug

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
on the block you've got one drain plug

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
antifreeze in there and then then I'll

antifreeze in there and then then I'll
pull<00:01:30.930> them<00:01:30.990> out<00:01:31.140> usually<00:01:31.439> drain<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.100> because

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
pull them out usually drain it because

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
pull them out usually drain it because
air<00:01:32.670> won't<00:01:32.939> freeze<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.350> make

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
air won't freeze but I do want to make

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.490 
air won't freeze but I do want to make
sure<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.130> everything<00:01:36.380> kind<00:01:37.380> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
sure that I get everything kind of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
sure that I get everything kind of
diluted<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> antifreeze<00:01:38.549> mixture<00:01:39.390> in

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
diluted with the antifreeze mixture in

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.280 
diluted with the antifreeze mixture in
the<00:01:39.630> engine<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:41.329> then<00:01:42.329> you'll<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.659> ready<00:01:42.899> for

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the engine and then you'll be ready for

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.160 
the engine and then you'll be ready for
your<00:01:43.409> next<00:01:43.619> year's<00:01:44.390> run<00:01:45.390> again<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:45.990> may<00:01:46.140> be

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
your next year's run again there may be

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.980 
your next year's run again there may be
more<00:01:46.500> freeze<00:01:46.890> plugs<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.460> don't<00:01:47.790> know<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.869> I

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
more freeze plugs I don't know but as I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.850 
more freeze plugs I don't know but as I
recall<00:01:49.140> last<00:01:49.649> year<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.750> pull<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.049> top<00:01:52.409> plug

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
recall last year I pull this top plug

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.499 
recall last year I pull this top plug
out<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> said<00:01:53.549> well<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.790> poor<00:01:54.030> antifreeze

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
out and I said well my poor antifreeze

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.999 
out and I said well my poor antifreeze
in<00:01:54.720> there<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.200> actually<00:01:55.409> part<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
in there but that's actually part of the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.800 
in there but that's actually part of the
intake<00:01:56.280> manifold<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.210> fill<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
intake manifold and I fill one of the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.569 
intake manifold and I fill one of the
cylinders<00:01:58.259> out<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.560> antifreeze<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.340> had

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
cylinders out with antifreeze so I had

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.050 
cylinders out with antifreeze so I had
to<00:01:59.729> hold<00:02:00.659> another<00:02:00.960> set<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.409> problems<00:02:01.619> there<00:02:02.009> so

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
to hold another set of problems there so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.969 
to hold another set of problems there so
get<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> books<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.439> what<00:02:04.590> they<00:02:04.740> say

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
get all the books and do what they say

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.079 
get all the books and do what they say
and<00:02:05.280> when<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.640> doubt<00:02:05.820> take<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.659> dealer
