 vacation with us on 01net tv I you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.420
 reminds that throughout this month 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.490
 of August we propose to rediscover you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.980
 these objects that have marked our 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.540
 daily these objects obviously related to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.369
 new technologies and today 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.640
 jérôme we will play and do not talk about games 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.640
 video 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.609
 the game boy of nintendo mythical object 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.649
 if it came out in September 1990 she 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.149
 cost at the time holds very good 590 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.410
 francs to wil me I remember I had 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.820
 saved for a long time to be able to 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.579
 give it to me but for the time I had 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.350
 so the gameboy the gameboy attention ah 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.280
 yes the mistake 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.329
 watch out it's the game boy it's written 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.640
 like that in the user manual 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.960
 so I had the console the cable link 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.550
 to play two because we could 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.829
 play two because it was great 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.370
 and especially especially the mythical game 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.370
 tetris 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.820
 each game costs and 195 francs it's up to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.210
 say today the equivalent of 45 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.979
 euros 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.659
 so how did we get there in 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.610
 done and well nintendo companies 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.829
 Japanese make playing cards 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.020
 but one day the CEO hiroshi yamauchi and 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.380
 in the train and he sees a passenger 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.030
 who's having fun with his calculator and he 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.009
 says to himself but it would be great to invent 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.850
 a small electronic machine that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.610
 would play 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.170
 that's the beginning before the game 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.459
 boy there was I not know if you 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.860
 remember those little games that unfolded 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.819
 was it was donkey kong style or 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.479
 so little parachutes he 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.280
 you had to catch 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.840
 so it was the beginning of the game 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.759
 boy and then so the game boy has arrived 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.079
 a few years later is the real 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.569
 because of the success of the game boy it is 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.250
 his concept a console and 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.970
 cartridges to add all the games 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.799
 we want to 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.869
 with phenomenal power we were 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.929
 at 8 bits at the time jérôme love to have 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.890
 a big pixel like this that we 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.420
 to passionate anyway because we 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.840
 could stay hours in front of this 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.250
 console 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.679
 then it will be a commercial success this 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 game boy when it was released in France and 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.959
 in France he will sell 1.4 million 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.660
 copies a record that's it and the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.250
 sales explode from 1990 onwards 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.940
 done at the moment when the console comes through 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.620
 to tetris that will sell him alone to 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.359
 30 million copies it was without 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.750
 doubt one of the biggest successes of the game 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.880
 video 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.959
 after it must be said that the game boy stings 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.970
 a little bit of nose there are 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.650
 competing but it comes back in force 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.670
 on the market with a license 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.670
 historical 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.230
 the pokémons love the gameboy evolved 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.209
 of course the game boy color that is 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.230
 arrived a few years later in 98 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.420
 who as his name indicated t in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.000
 colors here is the game boy advance 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.849
 a few years later and then especially the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.650
 nintendo ds which is a little bit 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.150
 the big sister of the win it's true 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.560
 that for years and nintendo is going 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.630
 hand over by all will try to do 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.280
 last the pleasure to the maximum it continues 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.329
 still today even though it's a 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.340
 little bit harder by the times that 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.739
 run but the game boy is a success 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.669
 historical 118 million copies 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.099
 sold worldwide 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.549
 this is right after ps2 and nintendo 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.549
 ds 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.720
 did you know that françois or you 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.820
 Jerome know what the gameboy game boy 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.890
 was the first electronic reader 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.240
 in fact since at the time thanks to a 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.640
 little software called book 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.870
 reader you could buy books and 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.970
 read them on the small screen of the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.980
 awesome gameboy another anecdote the game 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.900
 boy went for a ride in space 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.550
 since to cosmonauts the name of 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.090
 alexander serov who was afraid of 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.520
 to be bored 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.050
 when the parties in space and 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.040
 well had won tetris on a 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.660
 gameboy and then it's true when you're 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.740
 in space in my opinion you have to 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.550
 find the long time so it'll be 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.510
 nice to play games anyway 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.610
 videos every time I go people 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.900
 carry a copy of chords and then 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.280
 watch out I told you 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.500
 the time we say a game boy and not 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.510
 a game we find ourselves very quickly to 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.459
 the rest of this series on objects 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.640
 mythical high-tech on 01net tv has very 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.640
 quick
