00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.749 

so<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.210> started<00:00:27.630> off<00:00:28.160> three<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.220> four<00:00:29.460> years

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
so we started off three or four years

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.299 
so we started off three or four years
ago<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.270> the<00:00:30.390> trail<00:00:30.660> layout<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.650> it

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
ago with the trail layout here and it

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.280 
ago with the trail layout here and it
starts<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> trees<00:00:33.300> first<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.199> it's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
starts in the trees first right and it's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
starts in the trees first right and it's
a<00:00:34.379> very<00:00:34.559> subjective<00:00:34.830> thing<00:00:35.190> spending<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.970> lot

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
a very subjective thing spending a lot

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.939 
a very subjective thing spending a lot
of<00:00:36.150> time<00:00:36.270> there<00:00:36.660> looking<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> terrain<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
of time there looking at the terrain and

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.479 
of time there looking at the terrain and
how<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.230> downhill<00:00:40.230> will<00:00:40.470> flow<00:00:40.769> top<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.340> bottom

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
how the downhill will flow top to bottom

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.689 
how the downhill will flow top to bottom
on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.970> hill<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.949> it's<00:00:43.949> been<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> challenging

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
on the hill and it's been a challenging

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.400 
on the hill and it's been a challenging
project<00:00:44.910> for<00:00:45.330> sure<00:00:45.480> there's<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> lot<00:00:46.019> of<00:00:46.140> really

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
project for sure there's a lot of really

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
project for sure there's a lot of really
unique<00:00:46.559> terrain<00:00:46.949> up<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.610> hill<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:47.820> very

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
unique terrain up on this hill and very

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.620 
unique terrain up on this hill and very
good<00:00:48.660> ski<00:00:48.989> racing<00:00:49.380> terrain<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.480> it<00:00:51.480> will

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
good ski racing terrain I think it will

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.920 
good ski racing terrain I think it will
be<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.170> very<00:00:52.559> nice<00:00:52.829> downhill<00:00:53.570> it's<00:00:54.570> very

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
be a very nice downhill it's very

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
be a very nice downhill it's very
challenging<00:00:55.370> especially<00:00:56.370> at<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:56.940> middle

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
challenging especially at the middle

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.470 
challenging especially at the middle
section<00:00:57.530> very<00:00:58.530> technical<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.820> connection

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
section very technical in connection

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.160 
section very technical in connection
with<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.870> high<00:01:00.989> altitude<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:03.140> hopefully<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
with the high altitude and hopefully a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.969 
with the high altitude and hopefully a
very<00:01:04.259> icy<00:01:04.830> heart<00:01:05.309> slope<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.380> very

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
very icy heart slope it will be a very

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.150 
very icy heart slope it will be a very
demanding<00:01:08.280> downhill<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.630> think<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.560> very

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
demanding downhill and I think a very

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.310 
demanding downhill and I think a very
good<00:01:11.399> downhill<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.600> next<00:01:13.200> three

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
good downhill for the next three

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.230 
good downhill for the next three
championships

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.540 

so<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> logging<00:01:22.530> operation<00:01:23.070> had<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> pretty

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
so the logging operation had a pretty

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.950 
so the logging operation had a pretty
unique<00:01:23.850> machine<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.450> called<00:01:24.660> a<00:01:24.750> feller

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
unique machine it's called a feller

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.840 
unique machine it's called a feller
buncher<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.500> looks<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.700> small

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
buncher it looks like a kind of a small

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
buncher it looks like a kind of a small
track<00:01:27.270> hoe<00:01:27.480> with<00:01:27.660> an<00:01:27.780> articulated<00:01:28.440> arm<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
track hoe with an articulated arm and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.860 
track hoe with an articulated arm and
it's<00:01:29.370> got<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.550> cutting<00:01:29.970> implement<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.690> end

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
it's got a cutting implement on the end

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.650 
it's got a cutting implement on the end
with<00:01:31.620> jaws<00:01:31.980> that<00:01:32.430> come<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> grab<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> tree

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
with jaws that come in and grab a tree

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.660 
with jaws that come in and grab a tree
and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.440> it's<00:01:34.620> got<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.800> cutting<00:01:35.160> blade<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and then it's got a cutting blade on it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.420 
and then it's got a cutting blade on it
that's<00:01:35.970> about<00:01:36.120> five<00:01:36.630> feet<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.140> diameter<00:01:37.430> with

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that's about five feet in diameter with

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.120 
that's about five feet in diameter with
2-inch<00:01:39.000> square<00:01:39.479> cutting<00:01:40.200> teeth<00:01:40.410> on<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.800> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
2-inch square cutting teeth on it it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.090 
2-inch square cutting teeth on it it
spins<00:01:41.400> at<00:01:41.610> five<00:01:41.850> six<00:01:42.150> thousand<00:01:42.570> rpm<00:01:42.990> it'll<00:01:43.920> cut

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
spins at five six thousand rpm it'll cut

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.400 
spins at five six thousand rpm it'll cut
a<00:01:44.130> tree<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.700> five<00:01:45.090> seconds<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.780> push<00:01:46.260> it

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
a tree in five seconds just push it

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.500 
a tree in five seconds just push it
through<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.650> tree<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.280> instantly<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.119> trees

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
through the tree and instantly the trees

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.350 
through the tree and instantly the trees
grabbed<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.520> grab<00:01:50.760> how<00:01:51.060> many<00:01:51.270> you

a hundred and ten thousand pounds each

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.730 
a hundred and ten thousand pounds each
they<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.660> move<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.960> lot<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.170> material<00:02:25.320> very

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
they can move a lot of material very

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.860 
they can move a lot of material very
efficiently<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.910> coasting<00:02:27.360> down<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.690> hill

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
efficiently just coasting down the hill

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.260 
efficiently just coasting down the hill
