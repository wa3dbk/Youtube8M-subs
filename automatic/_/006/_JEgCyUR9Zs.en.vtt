00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
added as a figure into the game and the

added as a figure into the game and the
developers<00:00:41.640> response<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.320> Darkwing<00:00:43.320> was

developers response was Darkwing was

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.830 
developers response was Darkwing was
this<00:00:43.890> close<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.670> being<00:00:44.880> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> game<00:00:45.330> I'm<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
this close to being in the game I'm a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.690 
this close to being in the game I'm a
big<00:00:46.080> fan<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.410> show<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:46.920> character<00:00:47.340> so

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
big fan of the show in the character so

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.240 
big fan of the show in the character so
we'll<00:00:47.880> see<00:00:48.150> and<00:00:48.330> when<00:00:48.750> he<00:00:48.810> said<00:00:48.990> this<00:00:49.170> close<00:00:49.560> he

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
we'll see and when he said this close he

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
we'll see and when he said this close he
was<00:00:50.340> holding<00:00:50.580> this<00:00:50.700> thumb<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> his<00:00:51.510> pointer

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
was holding this thumb and his pointer

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.330 
was holding this thumb and his pointer
finger<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.530> close<00:00:52.800> together<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.220> show

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
finger really close together to show

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
finger really close together to show
that<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.550> was<00:00:53.640> super<00:00:53.910> close<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.330> being<00:00:54.660> added

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that it was super close to being added

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560 
that it was super close to being added
into<00:00:55.200> the<00:00:55.290> game<00:00:55.760> now<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.880> doesn't<00:00:57.120> confirm

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
into the game now this doesn't confirm

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.660 
into the game now this doesn't confirm
anything<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.740> fact<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.130> it<00:00:59.430> sounded

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
anything but the fact that it sounded

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
anything but the fact that it sounded
like<00:00:59.730> darkwing<00:01:00.180> duck<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.540> super<00:01:00.840> far<00:01:01.020> into

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like darkwing duck was super far into

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.530 
like darkwing duck was super far into
development<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.860> it<00:01:01.950> kind<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> fell<00:01:02.400> apart

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
development and it kind of fell apart

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.969 
development and it kind of fell apart
means<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.750> could<00:01:04.079> we<00:01:04.170> potentially<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
means that could we potentially see it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.359 
means that could we potentially see it
in<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> wave<00:01:05.460> too<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.090> Disney<00:01:06.720> infinity<00:01:06.810> 2.0<00:01:07.530> we

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
in a wave too of Disney infinity 2.0 we

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
in a wave too of Disney infinity 2.0 we
have<00:01:08.549> no<00:01:08.759> idea<00:01:08.999> how<00:01:09.240> many<00:01:09.299> characters<00:01:09.869> we're

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
have no idea how many characters we're

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
have no idea how many characters we're
gonna<00:01:10.319> get<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.829> this<00:01:11.039> game<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:11.999> we've

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
gonna get in this game right now we've

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.239 
gonna get in this game right now we've
only<00:01:12.479> seen<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.899> a<00:01:12.990> bike<00:01:13.249> what

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:14.249 
only seen in a bike what

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:16.459 
only seen in a bike what
twenty-something<00:01:14.880> maybe<00:01:15.030> 2025<00:01:15.899> I'm<00:01:16.350> not

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
twenty-something maybe 2025 I'm not

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:17.569 
twenty-something maybe 2025 I'm not
exactly<00:01:16.679> sure<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.189> good<00:01:17.369> count

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
exactly sure I don't have a good count

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.609 
exactly sure I don't have a good count
but<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.329> haven't<00:01:18.600> seen<00:01:18.749> that<00:01:18.899> many<00:01:19.079> compared

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
but we haven't seen that many compared

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.779 
but we haven't seen that many compared
to<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.829> entire<00:01:19.950> amount<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> Disney<00:01:20.759> infinity

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
to the entire amount the Disney infinity

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.989 
to the entire amount the Disney infinity
one<00:01:21.299> had<00:01:21.539> and<00:01:21.840> my<00:01:22.649> guess<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.340> would<00:01:23.460> see<00:01:23.670> more

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
one had and my guess we would see more

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:25.609 
one had and my guess we would see more
than<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.420> entire<00:01:24.749> collection<00:01:25.109> from<00:01:25.289> Disney

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
than the entire collection from Disney

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.700 
than the entire collection from Disney
51<00:01:26.159> added<00:01:26.969> to<00:01:27.060> Disney<00:01:27.359> infinity<00:01:27.479> 2<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.560> my

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
51 added to Disney infinity 2 that's my

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.190 
51 added to Disney infinity 2 that's my
guess<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.130> least<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:30.030> maybe<00:01:30.450> could<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.840> see

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
guess at least so maybe could we see

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.349 
guess at least so maybe could we see
darkwing<00:01:31.649> duck<00:01:31.679> added<00:01:32.399> later<00:01:32.819> down<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.090> road

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
darkwing duck added later down the road

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.940 
darkwing duck added later down the road
maybe<00:01:33.539> is<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.749> a<00:01:33.840> series<00:01:34.109> 2<00:01:34.319> or<00:01:34.499> series<00:01:34.740> 3

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
maybe is like a series 2 or series 3

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770 
maybe is like a series 2 or series 3
figure<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.490> don't<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.359> think<00:01:36.539> it'd<00:01:36.749> be

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
figure I don't know I think it'd be

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.090 
figure I don't know I think it'd be
pretty<00:01:36.990> awesome<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.469> considering<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.069> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
pretty awesome and considering we have a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.879 
pretty awesome and considering we have a
good<00:01:38.429> amount<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.819> power<00:01:39.030> dysphoria<00:01:39.799> cool<00:01:40.799> to

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
good amount of power dysphoria cool to
