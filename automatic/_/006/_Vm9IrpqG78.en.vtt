nice<00:00:56.890> how's<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:57.920> going<00:00:58.190> guys<00:00:58.400> let's<00:00:58.580> go<00:00:58.760> yeah

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
nice how's it going guys let's go yeah

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.350 
nice how's it going guys let's go yeah
great<00:01:00.230> job<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.100> what<00:01:01.400> really<00:01:01.760> goes<00:01:01.940> into<00:01:02.240> this

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
great job so what really goes into this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.720 
great job so what really goes into this
art<00:01:02.720> of<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.960> dance<00:01:03.140> we<00:01:03.950> had<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.220> take<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:04.400> closer

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
art of the dance we had to take a closer

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.590 
art of the dance we had to take a closer
look<00:01:05.650> first<00:01:06.650> let's<00:01:07.340> slow<00:01:07.790> down<00:01:07.820> those<00:01:08.330> quick

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
look first let's slow down those quick

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.970 
look first let's slow down those quick
feet<00:01:08.870> to<00:01:09.200> appreciate<00:01:09.800> their<00:01:10.040> precision<00:01:11.980> what

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
feet to appreciate their precision what

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.670 
feet to appreciate their precision what
flies<00:01:13.310> by<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.820> blur<00:01:14.090> looks<00:01:14.660> near<00:01:15.140> like<00:01:15.410> in

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
flies by and a blur looks near like in

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:24.430 
flies by and a blur looks near like in
slow<00:01:15.980> motion<00:01:22.360> we<00:01:23.360> slowed<00:01:23.690> this<00:01:23.930> down<00:01:24.140> by<00:01:24.410> a

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
slow motion we slowed this down by a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.340 
slow motion we slowed this down by a
factor<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.130> 10<00:01:25.430> or<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.120> yeah<00:01:26.479> it's<00:01:26.630> 10<00:01:26.840> 10

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
factor of 10 or so so yeah it's 10 10

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.560 
factor of 10 or so so yeah it's 10 10
times<00:01:27.620> lower<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.100> you're<00:01:28.190> still<00:01:28.570> perfectly

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
times lower and you're still perfectly

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.430 
times lower and you're still perfectly
in<00:01:29.780> sync<00:01:30.880> timing<00:01:31.880> like<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:32.270> is<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.900> basis<00:01:33.320> of

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
in sync timing like this is the basis of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.969 
in sync timing like this is the basis of
all<00:01:33.680> great<00:01:34.100> dancing<00:01:34.610> but<00:01:35.119> feet<00:01:35.450> are<00:01:35.720> only<00:01:36.290> part

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
all great dancing but feet are only part

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.430 
all great dancing but feet are only part
of<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.160> yeah<00:01:38.000> you're<00:01:38.210> super<00:01:38.570> Walker<00:01:38.750> degree

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
of it yeah you're super Walker degree

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.040 
of it yeah you're super Walker degree
yeah<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:39.920> want<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.550> say<00:01:40.700> some<00:01:40.880> spins<00:01:41.180> wheel<00:01:41.600> spin

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
yeah I want to say some spins wheel spin

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.710 
yeah I want to say some spins wheel spin
let's<00:01:42.200> just<00:01:42.380> expense

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.670 

ready<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.870> spin<00:01:51.110> their<00:01:51.950> wheel<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:54.440> is<00:01:54.590> you

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
ready to spin their wheel this is you

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.140 
ready to spin their wheel this is you
guys<00:01:54.860> really<00:01:55.100> slow<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:58.130> have<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:58.580> admire<00:01:58.880> the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
guys really slow you have to admire the

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:09.130 
guys really slow you have to admire the
physics<00:01:59.540> as<00:01:59.690> much<00:02:00.080> as<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.410> physique<00:02:08.140> yeah

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
physics as much as the physique yeah

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.630 
physics as much as the physique yeah
most<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.740> things<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:10.009> we're<00:02:10.220> watching

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
most of the things that we're watching

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.670 
most of the things that we're watching
slow<00:02:10.850> down<00:02:11.120> are<00:02:11.450> completely<00:02:12.050> impossible<00:02:12.320> to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
slow down are completely impossible to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.470 
slow down are completely impossible to
do<00:02:12.800> at<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.100> speed<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.210> doing

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
do at that speed you have to be doing

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.880 
do at that speed you have to be doing
them<00:02:14.600> faster<00:02:14.960> you<00:02:15.050> have<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.200> be<00:02:15.290> using<00:02:15.560> that

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
them faster you have to be using that

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.770 
them faster you have to be using that
momentum<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.640> your<00:02:17.000> inertia<00:02:17.270> or<00:02:17.450> else<00:02:17.630> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
momentum and your inertia or else the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:28.080 
momentum and your inertia or else the
physics<00:02:18.080> don't<00:02:18.290> play<00:02:18.470> out<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.770> same

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.150

learn these things at a certain minimum

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.560 
learn these things at a certain minimum
speed<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.370> dynamically<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.209> can<00:03:44.360> stay

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
speed so that dynamically you can stay

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.780 
speed so that dynamically you can stay
balanced<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.800> it's<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.040> really<00:03:46.250> advanced

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790
