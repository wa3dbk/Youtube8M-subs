00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
bribes now as you can see there is a big

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.140 
bribes now as you can see there is a big
mess<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:21.030> wiring<00:02:21.390> here<00:02:21.840> which<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.760> know<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:23.910> may

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
mess of wiring here which you know I may

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.360 
mess of wiring here which you know I may
have<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.450> bring<00:02:24.629> an<00:02:24.810> electrician<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.739> get<00:02:26.190> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
have to bring an electrician to get that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.300 
have to bring an electrician to get that
done<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.170> reduce<00:02:28.170> all<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.470> wiring<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.010> hence

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
done and reduce all the wiring so hence

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.520 
done and reduce all the wiring so hence
the<00:02:29.910> weight<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.239> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.629> lot<00:02:30.810> less<00:02:31.050> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
the weight is going to be a lot less and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.860 
the weight is going to be a lot less and
also<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.390> notice<00:02:33.739> already<00:02:34.739> installed<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.880 
you know the fuel injection I've just
bolted<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.650> there<00:02:49.860> in<00:02:50.099> 2<00:02:50.250> 110<00:02:50.700> toys<00:02:51.890> you

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
bolted it in there in 2 110 toys you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.210 
bolted it in there in 2 110 toys you
know<00:02:52.950> about<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:55.140> that's<00:02:55.470> pretty<00:02:55.830> well<00:02:56.010> done

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
know about and that's pretty well done

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.520 
know about and that's pretty well done
so<00:02:56.879> we're<00:02:57.150> nearly<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.530> know<00:02:58.650> completed<00:02:59.370> is

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
so we're nearly you know completed is

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.899 
so we're nearly you know completed is
only<00:03:01.530> thing<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:02.099> I<00:03:02.580> got<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:02.940> boat<00:03:03.209> all<00:03:04.019> the

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
only thing is I got a boat all the

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.839 
only thing is I got a boat all the
displayed<00:03:05.909> back<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.810> same<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:08.700> is

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
displayed back on to the same that is

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.800 
displayed back on to the same that is
done<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:09.950> I'm<00:03:10.950> going<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.280> drill<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.269> hole<00:03:12.390> day

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
done then I'm going to drill a hole day

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.460 
done then I'm going to drill a hole day
and<00:03:14.269> they<00:03:15.269> don't<00:03:15.659> hold<00:03:15.870> will<00:03:16.019> be<00:03:16.050> somewhere<00:03:16.440> in

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
and they don't hold will be somewhere in

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.309 
and they don't hold will be somewhere in
here<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.640> cables<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.120> go<00:03:18.300> through<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
here so the cables can go through to the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.440 
here so the cables can go through to the
motor<00:03:19.849> now<00:03:20.849> other<00:03:21.209> than<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:22.790> they<00:03:23.790> are<00:03:24.269> also

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
motor now other than that they are also

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.660 
motor now other than that they are also
worked<00:03:24.870> out<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.739> curb<00:03:26.010> weight<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.580> the
