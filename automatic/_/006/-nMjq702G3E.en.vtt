00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.840
 you find now to repair on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.650
 technical base of the battalion east 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.590
 where trophy equipment is being repaired 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.200
 Our BTR and BRM are also being repaired and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.950
 who participated in fighting fights 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.430
 battles right now you can see 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.100
 2 sheets 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.190
 who hit the city of Donetsk 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.670
 now we are trying from these two techniques 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.890
 collect one so she further participated 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.720
 fighting 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.310
 may notice two bands this 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.370
 distinctive features of Ukrainian 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.210
 coloring while we did not touch them correspondent 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.650
 current technique will be done to repaint 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:06.970
 will put our logos and we will fight 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:09.520
 farther here is this technique with snow it 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.490
 The first is this 100 is the first 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.120
 offensive on our at the mercy of september 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.250
 month 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.619
 I ca n't even tell you about this technique 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.119
 his 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.740
 that is, the guys helped to call 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:30.789
 recognized us and now we are trying 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:32.439
 it is to make newspapers as long as there are three and two 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.719
 peter who are now on 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.700
 fighting here you can 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:43.619
 see the famous ukrainian btr 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.630
 who already fought for the army of new Russia 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.560
 we brought him to mind were problems with 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.829
 electronics now he is still with us 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:59.530
 on rearmament of the BTR-4 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:02.560
 was taken from you and now these phrases are ours 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.069
 during the fighting there was their 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.929
 this one was more or less damaged 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:14.379
 alive well in general he was and not on the go we 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.970
 he was dragged away as if by him 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.420
 tell we set right away like on 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.600
 repair of the instrument as if the whole remained 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.280
 so they thought to use it against 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.049
 them 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.139
 well tell tell tell on armor 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.450
 mesh let's say well so they assure that 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:34.389
 she really saves so far 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.980
 because the only thing that saves 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.950
 it helps the hall to walk on it 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.489
 the only thing that is probably days of good 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.299
 electronics completely btr on electronics 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:49.460
 that is, where allowed in the technique 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.760
 gears here are chips everywhere 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.370
 Well, all the electronics will be derived from 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.610
 building as if at the moment we do not 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.800
 can put in service before or as 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.230
 would drive him somewhere to the fighting 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.720
 position weapons up questions no good 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.760
 weapon 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.120
 not like the alarm bell in the ride on the BTR with 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:16.090
 70 80 as a machine gun stands KPVT 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.670
 large-caliber 14 5 here stands 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.820
 gun automatic 30 millimeter a 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.080
 gs small-caliber gun pips 762 here 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.610
 Electronics do nothing and husband 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.470
 so we will now understand 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.740
 somehow remake spend the night it's all 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.980
 and electronics all remove the post mechanics 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.670
 and the masses will work the engine screaming 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.800
 strongly he is noisy how would we do it all 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.010
 make a noise like do something to clean up the extra 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.400
 sounds in general we will put it on 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.880
 the wheels and their not the same technique will give 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.990
 repulse 1 ms will be ready soon 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.730
 a day or two and you need to go 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.150
 naturally only from there 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.550
 or started maybe she should be 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.940
 there we will do everything for this tooth 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.760
 oh well that is 150 millimeter cannon 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.350
 dill will turn against them can 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.530
 it is connected all painted it like us and 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.200
 we took them and put it is not here 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.600
 seen from they did something themselves 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.690
 its there I shoot here and no equipment 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.669
 omit that's what came to get the threads 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.700
 pride and repair is not just this 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.070
 mistakes once and give the eye for and protected 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.200
 thick sheets of metal is all 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.450
 what is needed to repair installers 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.330
 field conditions and if necessary she 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.950
 can and pull any equipment weighing up 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.289
 75 tons and already pulled out once 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.470
 such technology and fight 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.380
 unique technique 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.570
 what uniqueness is not invented by ours 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.620
 developers made on the basis of KAMAZ 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.760
 set 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:07.400
 png for them diva nice for us 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.470
 the militia began its struggle against 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.610
 pound boys and we are armed only 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.560
 shotgun 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.490
 and now at his disposal is quite 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.490
 modern combat
