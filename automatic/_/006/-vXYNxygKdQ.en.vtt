00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
right now because I just really started

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
right now because I just really started
doing<00:00:48.239> paid<00:00:48.390> crafts<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.809> these<00:00:48.930> are<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> ones

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.100 
doing paid crafts and these are the ones
I<00:00:49.530> did<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.129> first<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.149> did<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> creeper<00:00:51.840> he's

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
I did so first I did a creeper he's

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.619 
I did so first I did a creeper he's
trying<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> easiest<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.449> now<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> think

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
trying to easiest one and now I think

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.260 
trying to easiest one and now I think
about<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.219> stepped<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.460> level<00:00:56.640> every<00:00:57.030> time<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
about I stepped up a level every time I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
about I stepped up a level every time I
did<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.960> he<00:00:58.680> said<00:00:58.859> he's<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.039> only<00:00:59.370> just

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
did it but he said he's the only just

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.889 
did it but he said he's the only just
make<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> little<00:01:00.149> cube

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
make a little cube

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.960 
make a little cube
oh<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> cycle<00:01:02.760> um<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.580> paper<00:01:05.580> crafts

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
oh the cycle um I think paper crafts

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.960 
oh the cycle um I think paper crafts
minecraft<00:01:06.659> or<00:01:06.810> minecraft<00:01:07.320> papercraft<00:01:07.820> one<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
minecraft or minecraft papercraft one of

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.890 
minecraft or minecraft papercraft one of
each<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:10.250> um<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.729> vice<00:01:12.450> versa<00:01:12.869> or

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
each I think um like vice versa or

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
each I think um like vice versa or
something<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
something like that but this is a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
something like that but this is a
creeper<00:01:15.479> he's<00:01:15.720> probably<00:01:15.930> easiest<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
creeper he's probably easiest one to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.090 
creeper he's probably easiest one to
make<00:01:16.939> because<00:01:17.960> if<00:01:18.960> he<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.710> feet

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
make because if he is a little feet

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.640 
make because if he is a little feet
being<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.970> front<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.900> back

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
being the front in back

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.429 
being the front in back
so<00:01:23.400> he's<00:01:23.610> cool<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.299> he's<00:01:25.049> probably<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
so he's cool I he's probably one the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.530 
so he's cool I he's probably one the
best<00:01:25.710> made<00:01:25.920> guys<00:01:26.100> didn't<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> use<00:01:27.330> any

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
best made guys didn't have to use any

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.999

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
to and oh you're just saying this paper

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.150 
to and oh you're just saying this paper
it's<00:04:04.790> cardstock<00:04:05.790> because<00:04:06.389> um<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:07.980> like

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
it's cardstock because um it's it's like

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.870 
it's cardstock because um it's it's like
harder<00:04:08.880> it's<00:04:09.030> more<00:04:09.239> durable<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:10.880> you

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
harder it's more durable and if you you

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.840 
harder it's more durable and if you you
choose<00:04:12.120> use<00:04:12.329> cardstock<00:04:12.720> or<00:04:13.049> you<00:04:13.799> can<00:04:13.980> paste<00:04:14.459> it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
choose use cardstock or you can paste it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.909 
choose use cardstock or you can paste it
on<00:04:15.000> or<00:04:15.329> deli<00:04:15.540> sticky<00:04:15.959> paper<00:04:16.169> on<00:04:16.500> um

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.119 

construction<00:04:20.919> paper<00:04:21.159> and<00:04:22.860> then<00:04:23.860> it'll<00:04:24.039> be

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:24.129 
construction paper and then it'll be

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.430 
construction paper and then it'll be
okay<00:04:24.639> but<00:04:24.849> I<00:04:24.879> like<00:04:25.120> using<00:04:25.270> cardstock<00:04:25.750> better

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
okay but I like using cardstock better

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.300 
okay but I like using cardstock better
because<00:04:27.039> it's<00:04:27.490> just<00:04:27.819> a<00:04:28.030> lot<00:04:28.180> easier<00:04:28.629> to<00:04:29.020> just<00:04:29.409> a

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
because it's just a lot easier to just a

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.430 
because it's just a lot easier to just a
lot<00:04:30.460> easier

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
lot easier

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.629 
lot easier
