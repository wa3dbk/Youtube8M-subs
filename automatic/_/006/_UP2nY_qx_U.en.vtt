housing from here I'm going to just go

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.510 
housing from here I'm going to just go
ahead<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:08.410> slip<00:02:08.710> this<00:02:08.860> screw<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:09.280> there<00:02:09.400> to

hold it in place I'm going to run it
down<00:02:11.290> just<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.890> few<00:02:12.130> threads<00:02:12.520> we're<00:02:13.180> going<00:02:13.300> to

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
down just a few threads we're going to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.770 
down just a few threads we're going to
be<00:02:13.450> re<00:02:13.860> disassembling<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.010> here<00:02:15.220> shortly<00:02:15.780> on

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
be re disassembling this here shortly on

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.030 
be re disassembling this here shortly on
the<00:02:16.930> other<00:02:17.050> side<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.380> take<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.620> drop<00:02:17.740> my<00:02:17.890> nut

the other side and take and drop my nut

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.970 
the other side and take and drop my nut
back<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.080> slip<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.320> in<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.590> similar

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
back in and slip it in in a similar

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.150 
back in and slip it in in a similar
fashion<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:25.870> I'm<00:02:26.740> also<00:02:26.860> going<00:02:27.100> to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
fashion just like so I'm also going to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.580 
fashion just like so I'm also going to
spin<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.700> retaining<00:02:28.210> nut<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.990> retaining

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
spin that retaining nut in a retaining

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.300 
spin that retaining nut in a retaining
bolt<00:02:29.890> for<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.190> matter<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.190> a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
bolt for that matter just like so just a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.720 
bolt for that matter just like so just a
few<00:02:33.490> threads<00:02:33.760> until<00:02:34.120> we<00:02:34.210> get<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.480> loaded

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
few threads until we get it loaded

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.870 
few threads until we get it loaded
now<00:02:36.730> how<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:36.970> load<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.960> voltage<00:02:38.380> regulator

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
now how you load the voltage regulator

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.790 
now how you load the voltage regulator
we're<00:02:39.880> going<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.060> take<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:40.270> spring<00:02:40.690> like<00:02:41.500> they

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
we're going to take a spring like they

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.070 
we're going to take a spring like they
come<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.100> new<00:02:42.220> Springs<00:02:42.840> drop<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.990> down

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
come with new Springs drop it down

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.650 
come with new Springs drop it down
inside<00:02:44.470> take<00:02:45.370> another<00:02:45.670> spring<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.270> drop<00:02:46.510> it

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
inside take another spring and drop it

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.730 
inside take another spring and drop it
down<00:02:46.840> inside<00:02:47.290> just<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.720> now<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.780> wire<00:02:50.470> is

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
down inside just like so now the wire is

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.410 
down inside just like so now the wire is
going<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.950> take<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.310> loop<00:02:51.430> around<00:02:51.550> down

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
going to take and loop around down

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
going to take and loop around down
through<00:02:52.720> here<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.200> slip<00:02:54.190> inside<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:56.290> like

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
through here and slip inside just like

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.140 
through here and slip inside just like
that<00:02:57.780> once<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.959> have<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.500> there<00:03:00.150> we're

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
that once you have that in there we're

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.660 
that once you have that in there we're
