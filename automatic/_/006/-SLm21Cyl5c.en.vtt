00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
little bit faster so and I had to make

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.940 
little bit faster so and I had to make
some<00:00:38.399> passes<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.899> first<00:00:39.950> rhythm

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
some passes and it was the first rhythm

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.100 
some passes and it was the first rhythm
there<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.149> mean<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.870> close<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
there it was I mean I was so close to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.729 
there it was I mean I was so close to
that<00:00:43.230> blocks<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> had<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.989> safe<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.620> know

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739

I'm<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.399> down<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.020> you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
I'm not going down because that then you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.209

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
lose too many points for the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.340 
lose too many points for the
championship<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> had<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.989> small<00:00:52.320> and
