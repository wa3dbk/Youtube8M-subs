on the tenth fret and you can think of
your<00:00:57.360> pentatonic<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.620> kind<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.859> the

your pentatonic as it's kind of the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:08.030 
your pentatonic as it's kind of the
skeleton<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> little<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:07.979> you

skeleton and this is a little way you
can<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.580> take<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.880> skeleton<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.689> it's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
can kind of take that skeleton and it's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.020 
can kind of take that skeleton and it's
really<00:01:10.200> though<00:01:10.470> we're<00:01:11.130> changing<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> few<00:01:11.790> notes

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030

really though we're changing a few notes
to<00:01:12.180> make<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.540> what's<00:01:12.689> called<00:01:12.750> D<00:01:13.080> mixolydian

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
to make it what's called D mixolydian

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.270 
to make it what's called D mixolydian
it's<00:01:14.610> definitely<00:01:14.939> more<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.240> major<00:01:15.960> e<00:01:16.280> you

that be the straight minor pentatonic
but<00:01:50.670> when<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:50.970> mixolydian<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.750> actually

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
but when it's mixolydian it's actually

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:08.000 
but when it's mixolydian it's actually
1514<00:01:55.080> not<00:01:55.440> 1513<00:01:57.170> then<00:01:58.970> 1514<00:01:59.970> on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.150> B<00:02:00.300> and<00:02:07.010> so

the little trick is this you hit it with
your<00:02:10.140> ring<00:02:10.440> finger<00:02:11.270> then<00:02:12.270> from<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:13.740> got<00:02:13.890> 15

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
your ring finger then from so we got 15

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.750 
your ring finger then from so we got 15
then<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.630> 14<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.440> Bend<00:02:16.680> up<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> same<00:02:17.550> note

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
then the 14 you Bend up to the same note

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.780 
then the 14 you Bend up to the same note
as<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.060> 15<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.340> let<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.490> go<00:02:23.580> back

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
as the 15 and you can let it go back

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:47.600 
as the 15 and you can let it go back
down<00:02:38.209> then<00:02:39.230> 15<00:02:40.230> 13<00:02:41.070> on<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.459> B<00:02:46.100> then<00:02:47.100> we're

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
down then 15 13 on the B then we're

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.310 
down then 15 13 on the B then we're
gonna<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.910> same<00:02:48.120> concept<00:02:48.630> with<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.050> note

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
gonna do the same concept with this note

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.470 
gonna do the same concept with this note
and<00:02:49.590> we're<00:02:49.890> gonna<00:02:49.980> slide<00:02:50.370> down<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> 12<00:02:51.209> and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
and we're gonna slide down to the 12 and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.510 
and we're gonna slide down to the 12 and
then<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.840> up<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.530> note

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:26.100 

so<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.090> far<00:02:56.240> we<00:02:56.390> have<00:02:56.420> this<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:22.520> so<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.810> can<00:03:24.410> go

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
1412 on the G then 11 on G same same

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:54.880 
1412 on the G then 11 on G same same
idea<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.590> watch<00:03:53.290> saying<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.440> same<00:03:54.650> things

gonna go all the way down and you know
it's<00:03:56.630> not<00:03:56.750> necessarily<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:57.290> lick<00:03:57.500> where<00:03:57.710> you're

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
it's not necessarily a lick where you're

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.590 
it's not necessarily a lick where you're
gonna<00:03:57.980> do<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.340> all<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.820> way<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.030> know<00:03:59.390> and

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
gonna do it all the way you know and

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.050 
gonna do it all the way you know and
it's<00:03:59.810> many<00:04:00.080> octaves<00:04:00.350> as<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.770> as<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.220> can<00:04:01.250> it's

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
it's many octaves as you as you can it's

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.760 
it's many octaves as you as you can it's
just<00:04:02.120> another<00:04:02.480> concept<00:04:02.990> even<00:04:03.110> if<00:04:03.320> I'm<00:04:03.440> just<00:04:03.590> in

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
just another concept even if I'm just in

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:14.130 
just another concept even if I'm just in
this<00:04:03.890> little<00:04:04.100> box<00:04:04.640> right

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.080 

you<00:04:15.140> know<00:04:15.260> it's<00:04:15.680> just<00:04:15.830> new<00:04:16.250> ideas<00:04:16.669> basically

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
you know it's just new ideas basically

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:26.650 
you know it's just new ideas basically
so<00:04:17.239> we<00:04:17.329> have<00:04:24.610> then<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.729> can<00:04:25.850> go<00:04:25.970> ring<00:04:26.240> finger

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
so we have then you can go ring finger

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.190 
so we have then you can go ring finger
to<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.710> 12th<00:04:28.070> fret<00:04:28.280> on<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.820> D<00:04:32.020> when<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.080> get

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
to the 12th fret on the D when you get

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.990 
to the 12th fret on the D when you get
to<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.410> knight<00:04:33.590> on<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.919> D<00:04:34.070> we<00:04:34.700> can<00:04:34.850> actually

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
to the knight on the D we can actually

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.280 
to the knight on the D we can actually
once<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.360> get<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.690> D<00:04:35.840> string<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.110> kind<00:04:36.260> of

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
once you get to the D string you kind of

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.690 
once you get to the D string you kind of
want<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.500> bend<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:36.919> this<00:04:37.040> way<00:04:37.250> as<00:04:37.370> opposed<00:04:37.639> to

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
want to bend it this way as opposed to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.450 
want to bend it this way as opposed to
up<00:04:37.910> so<00:04:38.479> we're<00:04:38.570> gonna<00:04:38.630> run<00:04:38.900> out<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.080> neck<00:04:39.950> so

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
up so we're gonna run out of neck so

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:52.420 
up so we're gonna run out of neck so
we've<00:04:40.610> got<00:04:41.770> number<00:04:42.770> one<00:04:42.919> D<00:04:51.160> then<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.250> same

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
we've got number one D then the same

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:41.410 
we've got number one D then the same
thing<00:04:52.610> on<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.820> a<00:04:52.850> string<00:05:01.660> one<00:05:02.660> more<00:05:02.780> time

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.360 

so<00:05:42.420> that's<00:05:42.570> all<00:05:42.720> kind<00:05:43.050> of<00:05:43.110> mix<00:05:43.680> of<00:05:43.830> Liddy<00:05:44.070> D

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
so that's all kind of mix of Liddy D

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.670 
so that's all kind of mix of Liddy D
mixolydian<00:05:44.820> concept<00:05:45.420> so<00:05:46.110> now<00:05:46.230> let<00:05:46.440> me<00:05:46.530> just

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
mixolydian concept so now let me just

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.920 
mixolydian concept so now let me just
show<00:05:46.830> you<00:05:46.890> in<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.280> home<00:05:47.640> row<00:05:47.910> kind<00:05:48.330> of<00:05:48.480> version

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
show you in the home row kind of version

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.040 
show you in the home row kind of version
of<00:05:49.020> that<00:05:49.200> we<00:05:49.860> can<00:05:50.010> go<00:05:50.190> on<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.880> B<00:05:51.030> string<00:05:51.090> pinkie

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
of that we can go on the B string pinkie

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.450 
of that we can go on the B string pinkie
on<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.850> 13th<00:05:53.850> fret<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.620> then<00:05:55.620> ring<00:05:55.950> finger<00:05:56.310> on

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
on the 13th fret and then ring finger on

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.720 
on the 13th fret and then ring finger on
the<00:05:56.550> twelfth<00:05:56.880> fret<00:05:56.970> bending<00:05:57.540> up<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:57.870> that<00:05:58.020> note
