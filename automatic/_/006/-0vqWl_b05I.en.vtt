00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.660
 hello friends welcome to another video 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.050
 tutorial of viva argentina 2013 all 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.470
 for our new windows 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.740
 good in this opportunity we will treat the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.169
 issue of how to limit the band of 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.430
 internet that our group will use 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.940
 8 since as you know windows 8 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.940
 bring 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.960
 start of tiles 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.790
 in which we have many many 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.630
 options 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.190
 and if you are connected to the internet 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.620
 permanently above all also the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.490
 store which networks updates 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.280
 of all 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.530
 are these tiles that we will go 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.909
 installing in our start menu 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.800
 and as much as in Windows 7 footballer 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.950
 You can control this 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.520
 raise the one that puts windows for the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.820
 system needs 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.219
 well i will leave you a file delete in 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.860
 which will be able to download my page 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.320
 section web all right like 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.060
 method when loading will have it 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.700
 this rap we give you the right to bring 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.740
 Here is this notebook and 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.240
 then opening a computer here copy in 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.380
 this code 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.549
 they can also take it from video 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.820
 do web we will at least run 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:47.030
 we will paste this code 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.610
 and we will give you to accept 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.950
 we'll wait for the editor to open 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.950
 directive of our 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.869
 local group and here we will have to 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.659
 will direct the templates option 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.329
 administrative but of directives of the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.939
 local equipment configuration team 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:08.660
 and user configuration 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.450
 Team configuration by clicking on it 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.900
 that appears on the right side this other 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.300
 submenu we will answer you click already 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.569
 who are looking for the one that says programmer 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.780
 of packages like that we give double click 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.220
 and activate this your menus you want 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.069
 limit 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.010
 bandwidth reservation speak 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.739
 we give double hit and this will open 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.310
 another window to you will disappear to 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.950
 configured ok 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.610
 now what they will have to use is 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 this option to enable and you by 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.730
 defect here will disappear 80 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.459
 if you stop to read a little bit this 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.709
 it says determines the percentage of width of 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.780
 band of the connection in the system that 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.909
 can reserve this value limits to the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.040
 reserves of the combined bandwidth of 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.530
 all programs that run on 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.480
 the system by default the 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.049
 packet scheduler limits the 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.530
 system at 80% of the bandwidth of a 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.900
 connection although it can be can use 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.609
 this option to invalidate the value 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.219
 predetermined so we're going to 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:22.519
 perform us if you enable this 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.500
 option can use width limit box 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.319
 band to adjust the amount of 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.709
 bandwidth that the system can 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.859
 book if you disable this action or not 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.970
 the configure the system uses the value 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:43.040
 default of 80% of the connection 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.630
 ok now we will configure this 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.110
 according to the needs of our team 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.150
 for example I in my personal case the 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.960
 tile menu practically not what 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.890
 I use I keep using windows like I used 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.060
 minutes 72 times seen the truth that no 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.610
 I'm interested 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.400
 new start menu in which we have 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.910
 tiles and we have applications the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.220
 will have many fun things 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.930
 and useful also to be able to enroll 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.570
 from there but I 'm not interested 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.750
 then I will reset it 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.030
 I do not want windows to take me 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.130
 book my internet band for 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.290
 these things so much for the 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.440
 updates 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.750
 so you limit by default 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.340
 come 80 times and you will use 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.770
 these options so that navigation 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.820
 be a little more fluid you can put it 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.550
 40% to 20% in my case I put it to 0 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:47.020
 because I want to use the speed of 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.850
 my internet for my browsers and no no 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.180
 I want to use this means of starting well 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.800
 that I give 0 and I give to apply and 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.110
 I give to accept 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.000
 then I close this window and we'll be 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.530
 limiting the bandwidth 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.280
 why 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:10.100
 inside and for example to the news 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.810
 do not fear a zero configuration that 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.540
 reserves the bandwidth but this does not 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.840
 means that it will not take 20 years in 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.840
 open 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.490
 because it took too long 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.240
 so well this will be depending on 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.500
 the needs 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.040
 have you when you use your 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.730
 new bosco 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.560
 hi friends as I told you before 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:44.570
 this notebook can be downloaded 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.250
 from the web of the section everything very 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.440
 deserved a big hug to all and we 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.370
 we will see in the next video tutorial of 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.370
