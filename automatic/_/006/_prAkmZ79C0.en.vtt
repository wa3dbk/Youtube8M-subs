I'm<00:02:26.650> just<00:02:27.040> going<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.190> open<00:02:27.520> these<00:02:27.670> seeds<00:02:28.000> up

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
I'm just going to open these seeds up

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.730 
I'm just going to open these seeds up
here<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.870> seed<00:02:29.140> packet<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:32.080> happy<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
here the seed packet so happy that the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.320 
here the seed packet so happy that the
seeds<00:02:32.950> came<00:02:33.160> through<00:02:35.340> I'll<00:02:36.340> also<00:02:36.490> post<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:37.120> link

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
seeds came through I'll also post a link

in the video look at all the seeds she
gave<00:02:50.200> me<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.190> generous<00:02:51.610> thank<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:51.970> so

much<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:53.560> am<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:54.460> I<00:02:54.580> said<00:02:54.760> I'm<00:02:54.850> only<00:02:55.030> planting

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
much I am like I said I'm only planting

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.120 
much I am like I said I'm only planting
them<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.810> 3<00:02:56.020> inch<00:02:56.140> pot<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.470> hope<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:56.980> is

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
them in a 3 inch pot I hope this is

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.510 
them in a 3 inch pot I hope this is
enough<00:02:57.280> space<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:58.920> think<00:02:59.920> they've<00:03:00.130> got<00:03:00.280> such<00:03:00.490> a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
enough space I think they've got such a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.210 
enough space I think they've got such a
cool<00:03:00.790> looking<00:03:01.060> seed<00:03:01.620> little<00:03:02.620> wings<00:03:02.860> on<00:03:03.130> the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
cool looking seed little wings on the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.560 
cool looking seed little wings on the
side<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:05.550> think<00:03:06.550> I'm<00:03:06.730> catching<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:07.090> cold<00:03:07.120> I've

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
side I think I'm catching a cold I've

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:15.420 
side I think I'm catching a cold I've
got<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.680> sniffles<00:03:12.450> trying<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.570> space<00:03:14.430> space

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
got the sniffles trying to space space

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.400 
got the sniffles trying to space space
these<00:03:15.790> seeds<00:03:16.120> out<00:03:16.300> as<00:03:16.480> much<00:03:16.630> as<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.840> can

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
these seeds out as much as I can

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.760 
these seeds out as much as I can
the<00:03:18.190> germination<00:03:18.610> rate<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.180> these<00:03:19.450> is<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.960> low

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
the germination rate on these is is low

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.790 
the germination rate on these is is low
and<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.390> need<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.480> have<00:03:22.630> fresh<00:03:22.960> fresh<00:03:23.320> seed

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
and you need to have fresh fresh seed

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.010 
and you need to have fresh fresh seed
she<00:03:24.040> tells<00:03:24.280> me<00:03:24.490> so<00:03:24.730> that's<00:03:25.450> where<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.720> lot<00:03:25.870> of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
she tells me so that's where a lot of

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.420 
she tells me so that's where a lot of
the<00:03:26.080> problems<00:03:26.440> come<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:26.770> I<00:03:26.800> guess<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.160> lot<00:03:27.400> of

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
the problems come in I guess a lot of

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.620 
the problems come in I guess a lot of
suppliers<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.630> seed<00:03:28.840> keep<00:03:29.200> their<00:03:29.380> seeds<00:03:29.620> for

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
suppliers of seed keep their seeds for

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.570 
suppliers of seed keep their seeds for
longer<00:03:31.630> than<00:03:31.890> suggested<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:35.310> supposedly<00:03:36.310> the

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
longer than suggested and supposedly the

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.949 
longer than suggested and supposedly the
fresher<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.060> seeds<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.600> better<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
fresher the seeds the better the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.150 
fresher the seeds the better the
germination<00:03:38.410> rate<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:40.709> being<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:41.830> I'm<00:03:41.950> new

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
germination rate and being that I'm new

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.750 
germination rate and being that I'm new
to<00:03:42.190> this

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
to this

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.530 
to this
I<00:03:43.470> respect<00:03:44.470> what<00:03:44.709> she's<00:03:44.920> saying<00:03:45.300> well<00:03:46.300> and

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
I respect what she's saying well and

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.660 
I respect what she's saying well and
also<00:03:46.690> did<00:03:47.280> she's<00:03:48.280> got<00:03:48.459> proven<00:03:48.940> results<00:03:49.600> so

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
also did she's got proven results so

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.050 
also did she's got proven results so
can't<00:03:51.670> really<00:03:52.560> can't<00:03:53.560> really<00:03:53.709> deny<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:54.190> I'm

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
can't really can't really deny that I'm

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.310 
can't really can't really deny that I'm
going<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.300> pull<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.570> pot<00:03:55.840> out<00:03:56.020> of<00:03:56.050> here

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
going to pull this pot out of here

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.530 
going to pull this pot out of here
static<00:03:57.280> on<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.610> bag<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:58.030> catching<00:03:58.330> some<00:03:58.510> of

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
static on the bag is catching some of

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:08.010 
static on the bag is catching some of
the<00:03:58.630> seeds<00:04:03.510> ok<00:04:06.000> put<00:04:07.000> all<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.270> seeds<00:04:07.510> in<00:04:07.720> here

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
the seeds ok put all the seeds in here

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.880 
the seeds ok put all the seeds in here
can<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.380> see<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:10.709> okay<00:04:11.709> no<00:04:12.400> more<00:04:12.550> seeds<00:04:12.820> left

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
can you see that okay no more seeds left

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.130 
can you see that okay no more seeds left
you<00:04:14.890> just<00:04:15.100> double-check

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.690 

so<00:04:19.140> one<00:04:19.470> seed<00:04:19.770> is<00:04:20.100> here<00:04:21.950> on<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.280> edge<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
so one seed is here on the edge of the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.400 
so one seed is here on the edge of the
bag<00:04:23.880> watch<00:04:24.540> those<00:04:24.840> are<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.020> ones<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.350> would

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
bag watch those are the ones that would

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.740 
bag watch those are the ones that would
grow<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:26.490> ones<00:04:26.670> sitting<00:04:26.850> on<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> side<00:04:27.360> is<00:04:27.600> it

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
grow the ones sitting on the side is it

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.660 
grow the ones sitting on the side is it
blocked<00:04:27.960> back

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
blocked back

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.410 
blocked back
okay<00:04:30.230> there's<00:04:31.230> one<00:04:31.290> seed<00:04:31.740> they're<00:04:32.270> just<00:04:33.270> going

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
okay there's one seed they're just going

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.950 
okay there's one seed they're just going
to<00:04:33.510> tap<00:04:34.410> them<00:04:34.650> down<00:04:34.890> just<00:04:35.790> get<00:04:36.090> them<00:04:36.300> some<00:04:36.600> some

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
to tap them down just get them some some

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.650 
to tap them down just get them some some
