00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.770
 hi Guys 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.710
 hello dear retro friends today i have 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:15.430
 a little special for you and that 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.350
 I present you the retro 3 console 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.020
 this currently on the American 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.240
 market and who knows that 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.300
 then at some point there will not be any 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.480
 beliebtes console your mind 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.609
 and what are we going to buy again 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.019
 the same console again in the hope 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.569
 that will last a bit longer 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.879
 or let's get a new console 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:39.789
 of course remedy directly on 3 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.370
 The console is also very practical outside 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.350
 that is, back fresh just do it 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.109
 brand new and japan warranty on it 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.379
 and what the thing never under the box 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.420
 Has 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.420
 let's take a closer look 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.100
 we start with the optics of the retro 3 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.040
 console 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.769
 yes i have to say that when i put the thing here 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.159
 Unpacking the thing is not only 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.740
 cheap plastic processed but thinks 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.990
 also like the hell pretty shabby at 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.409
 best after unpacking you leave that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.780
 ding times determined definitely kws 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.610
 but the thing is still so under the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.799
 hood, I'll tell you the same 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.080
 from the optics is to say 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.810
 simple design, it is no optics 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.119
 grenade some say the thing was 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.110
 ugly but what does the thing have then 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.060
 on the box 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.630
 we can with the e tron ​​3 console ds 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:43.229
 genesis and super nintendo module 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.149
 Play and that will be in small 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.550
 video displayed there 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:53.789
 we can choose perovic alter us 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.890
 which module just behind console 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.610
 We have a power switch 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.360
 and a reset switch and yes it has it 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.130
 on the front we see for example 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 controller ports for super nintendo us 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.140
 can connect two controllers 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.590
 we also have leds on the left side 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.920
 controller ports also each two pieces 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.280
 and on the right side we have sega 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.440
 Genesis controller ports also two pieces 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.140
 but what the thing here still has that 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.120
 I'll show you right away and that's it 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.310
 this game pad from hyper chin with at 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.170
 the console included but so 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.350
 I do not think that's as heady as it is 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.890
 The thing is so simple 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.990
 the console is there 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.630
 By the way, in two colors once in this 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.050
 red here and of course in black 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.050
 you have all weapons there for this 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.459
 Play requires our back consoles 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.890
 or console games 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.040
 we have a select or bake bar 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.970
 an emergency or a reset button we 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.570
 have everything possible abc xyz you can 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.040
 to set it all up manually and what I do 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.270
 Shit on this 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.250
 controller behind the battery compartment that 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.770
 Battery compartment is again with a 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.660
 Extra screw provided so that you 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.570
 do not just insert the batteries 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.180
 you could do that with one 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.970
 cross slot screws very much at sea 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.989
 or on and then you could do it first 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.350
 changing batteries 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.110
 the whole thing is going to be infrared here 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.540
 but I do not feed in console 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.180
 found so cool in the practical test has revealed 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.370
 that the range of this controller 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.769
 not the best is yours 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.920
 controller currency are also smoked off 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.350
 you can also a cheap 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.510
 and cheap alternative or imitation 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.700
 on Amazon 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.370
 Of course I'll let you all the links to it 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.470
 in the video description bangs it would be 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.480
 nice if you take me immediately and over the 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.400
 but you do not have to order link 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.220
 I would like to have noticed that you 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.500
 all links to the things here in too 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.660
 the description is how we come 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.670
 but to the back and that is 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.760
 the most exciting thing about this console 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.489
 we have the audio inputs there 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.430
 is natural for stereo sound 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.100
 once the red cable and the white one 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.419
 kabel and we have a video on gagen 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.550
 the yellow cable 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.280
 but what's special about this 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.070
 back is this little switch 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.530
 here and you can not only do that 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.770
 normal amin module play you can 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.150
 including European and Japanese 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.880
 play module 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.380
 This will simply make you stand on the j 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.000
 and of course you can do yours 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.750
 play Japanese modules 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.610
 then we have a s video input and 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.610
 also the power input 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.710
 I really want something again 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.260
 to this power adapter here say this 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.630
 power adapter is not just one 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.880
 American adapter in ours 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.980
 European sockets do not fit 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.380
 no you can just me 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.680
 Buy tower because it mocks you 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.220
 your console the european sockets 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.580
 have over 200 volts and this part here 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.570
 needs around 120 volts what can you do 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.960
 so do that 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.169
 you buy at Amazon for ten 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.340
 There is one of the words of the euro 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.740
 electricity converts our stream from 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.730
 220 volt is adjusted to the ami level 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.220
 that's about 120 volts and that 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.290
 can you safely and well with your advises 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.180
 It's not just the little ones who play 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.000
 take plug because you have this 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.130
 put in and yes that through ours 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.130
 Storm puts you through the console 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.369
 In the background you can already see me 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:09.819
 to test these three games here we have 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:12.189
 yes once stock exchange that is a ntsc 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:14.529
 game say a mummy module that has 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.989
 I tested works fine 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:19.209
 then I have the American 

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:22.119
 killer instinct as a super nintendo 

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:23.859
 version also works plugged in 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:26.079
 also wonderful but i thought 

00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:27.999
 Come on, let's do this here 

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:30.489
 ultimate test and hunt 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:33.309
 japanese genesis module in there and 

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:35.999
 Although the alien storm is here at the 

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:38.769
 can see the packaging is a 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:44.079
 Awesome Japanese module and see 

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:46.929
 since that works too it asks her 

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:49.329
 you determine where it is such a scrap 

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:51.729
 I would like to replicate this sport here 

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:54.609
 not directly say I have all 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:57.789
 original retro consoles but how is that 

00:06:54.609 --> 00:07:00.069
 from time to time by age-related things 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:02.529
 the consoles just lubricate me 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:03.159
 I'm not a fan of innovation and stuff 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:05.769
 continue 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:07.929
 you already know that but the thing 

00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:09.819
 here is a real alternative if 

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:12.549
 you still have retro consoles 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:15.909
 or play retro games 

00:07:12.549 --> 00:07:16.989
 and of course at best 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:18.969
 original 

00:07:16.989 --> 00:07:21.249
 then i would definitely do that 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:24.189
 recommend here console what costs then 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:26.199
 sting the thing costs around $ 70 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:29.079
 and if we all that in euros now 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:31.629
 I would say we pay that way 

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:33.489
 around the 70 80 euro because it come yes 

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:36.089
 of course, the customs fees 

00:07:33.489 --> 00:07:36.089
 it 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.620
 In that sense that was mine of yours 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.629
 woman 10 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.740
 I hope you had fun on this 

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.990
 small video 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.419
 I also hope that I will ask all your questions 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.129
 answered if not or 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:52.539
 if I forgot something 

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:53.680
 Can you of course in the 

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:55.509
 make strummed comments 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.849
 I'm trying a little bit with you 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:59.319
 advice and act to stand aside so 

00:07:57.849 --> 00:08:00.250
 Feel free to do the thing here 

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:02.949
 Leave a Comment 

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:06.180
 and in that sense keep on rocking euro 

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:06.180
 Nevertheless , it's good
