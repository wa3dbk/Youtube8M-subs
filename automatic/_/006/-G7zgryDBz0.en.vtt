is as far down as it can go I like it
this<00:00:27.750> way<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.039> my<00:00:29.130> way<00:00:29.310> when

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
this way just so it's not in my way when

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.510 
this way just so it's not in my way when
I'm<00:00:29.640> doing<00:00:30.179> tricks<00:00:30.599> or<00:00:30.750> whatever<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.520> it's

I'm doing tricks or whatever and it's
it's<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:33.960> far<00:00:34.200> out<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> way<00:00:34.649> that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it's it's not so far out of the way that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.100 
it's it's not so far out of the way that
I<00:00:35.040> can't<00:00:35.399> reach<00:00:35.670> down<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:35.969> grab<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.649> but<00:00:37.649> um

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
I can't reach down and grab it but um

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.000 
I can't reach down and grab it but um
yeah<00:00:40.940> that's<00:00:41.940> maxed<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.989> you'll<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.890> it's

almost touching the bars right here may

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.979 
almost touching the bars right here may
focus<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:48.180> actually<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.570> touching<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
focus in it actually is touching the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.150

for<00:00:53.399> tire<00:00:53.610> pressure<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.710> run<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.860> tires<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
for tire pressure I run my tires that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.569 
for tire pressure I run my tires that
anywhere<00:00:56.699> between<00:00:57.800> 120<00:00:58.800> psi<00:00:59.719> to<00:01:00.719> around<00:01:01.260> 75<00:01:02.250> or

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
anywhere between 120 psi to around 75 or

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.080 
anywhere between 120 psi to around 75 or
80<00:01:02.789> depending<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.170> tire<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:05.339> tires<00:01:05.670> i

80 depending on what tire these tires i

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.690 
80 depending on what tire these tires i
had<00:01:06.270> 120<00:01:06.840> psi<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> little

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
had 120 psi in them I know it's a little

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910 
had 120 psi in them I know it's a little
stiff<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.090> that's<00:01:09.450> that's<00:01:09.689> no<00:01:10.560> home<00:01:10.770> well

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
stiff but that's that's no home well

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.719 
stiff but that's that's no home well
that's<00:01:11.070> how<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:13.220> yeah<00:01:16.369> in<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> quick
