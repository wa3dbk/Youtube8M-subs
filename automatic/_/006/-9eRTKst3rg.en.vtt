hey guys it's AK and Tet and let me be

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.030 
hey guys it's AK and Tet and let me be
bringing<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.720> guys<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:04.110> comparison<00:00:04.859> between

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
bringing you guys a comparison between

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.980 
bringing you guys a comparison between
the<00:00:05.460> vq<00:00:06.210> 7<00:00:06.420> by<00:00:06.660> 7<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.259> shin-chan<00:00:07.500> 7<00:00:08.010> by<00:00:08.160> 7

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
the vq 7 by 7 and the shin-chan 7 by 7

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.089 
the vq 7 by 7 and the shin-chan 7 by 7
first<00:00:09.990> I'm<00:00:10.110> just<00:00:10.170> gonna<00:00:10.349> go<00:00:10.530> over<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.860> little

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
first I'm just gonna go over the little

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.600 
first I'm just gonna go over the little
stuff<00:00:11.429> like<00:00:11.550> size<00:00:12.330> comparison<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:14.040> kind

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
stuff like size comparison so it's kind

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.140 
stuff like size comparison so it's kind
of<00:00:14.700> hard<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> compare<00:00:15.450> them<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:17.580> V<00:00:17.850> cube

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
of hard to compare them but the V cube

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.019 
of hard to compare them but the V cube
looks<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.720> little<00:00:18.990> bit<00:00:19.230> taller<00:00:19.550> but<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.760> shin

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
looks a little bit taller but the shin

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.910 
looks a little bit taller but the shin
Chou<00:00:21.240> feels<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:22.050> kind<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.380> bigger<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.769> your

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
Chou feels like kind of bigger in your

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.460 
Chou feels like kind of bigger in your
hands<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.640> does<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:25.230> hard<00:00:25.410> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
hands and this does it's it's hard to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.470 
hands and this does it's it's hard to
explain<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> 2<00:00:27.269> then

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
explain but if you have the 2 then

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.390 
explain but if you have the 2 then
you'll<00:00:27.630> definitely<00:00:27.779> know<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:29.279> this

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
you'll definitely know like what this

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.189 
you'll definitely know like what this
feels<00:00:29.640> like

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
feels like

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.530 
feels like
sticker<00:00:31.199> quality<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.189> I'll<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.850> compare<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
sticker quality so I'll just compare the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.990 
sticker quality so I'll just compare the
two<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.380> V<00:00:34.530> Cube<00:00:34.800> Green<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.309> definitely<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> lot

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
two the V Cube Green is definitely a lot

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.540 
two the V Cube Green is definitely a lot
nicer<00:00:36.890> red<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.190> probably<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> same<00:00:40.250> BQ<00:00:41.250> blue

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
nicer red is probably the same BQ blue

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.880 
nicer red is probably the same BQ blue
is<00:00:41.700> definitely<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.180> lot<00:00:42.360> brighter

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
is definitely a lot brighter

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.940 
is definitely a lot brighter
you<00:00:43.890> cube<00:00:44.129> orange<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> lot<00:00:44.910> brighter<00:00:45.950> yellow

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you cube orange is a lot brighter yellow

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.459 
you cube orange is a lot brighter yellow
is<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.430> brighter<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.690> white<00:00:49.079> black<00:00:49.320> I

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
is a lot brighter and then white black I

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.650 
is a lot brighter and then white black I
can't<00:00:49.649> compare<00:00:49.829> them<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.270> V<00:00:51.420> Cube

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
can't compare them so the V Cube

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.080 
can't compare them so the V Cube
definitely<00:00:52.320> wins<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.829> color<00:00:53.129> scheme<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.699> mean

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
definitely wins in color scheme I mean

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.029 
definitely wins in color scheme I mean
everybody<00:00:54.570> knows<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> hue<00:00:55.260> has<00:00:55.469> really

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
everybody knows that the hue has really

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.849 
everybody knows that the hue has really
good<00:00:56.160> stickers<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> obviously<00:00:58.500> comes<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
good stickers and obviously comes with a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.549 
good stickers and obviously comes with a
v-cube<00:00:59.190> logo<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.120> my<00:01:00.329> shun<00:01:00.539> ciao<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.989> put<00:01:01.289> my

v-cube logo and on my shun ciao I put my

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.620 
v-cube logo and on my shun ciao I put my
logo<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.760> algorithm<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.300> made<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.600> me

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630

weight<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.869> these<00:01:07.080> two<00:01:07.290> cubes<00:01:09.920> hmm<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.390> feel

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
weight of these two cubes hmm I feel

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.670 
weight of these two cubes hmm I feel
kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> same<00:01:13.770> I'd<00:01:13.950> say<00:01:15.439> maybe<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
kind of about the same I'd say maybe the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.830 
kind of about the same I'd say maybe the
VQ<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.090> tiny<00:01:18.570> tiny<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:19.020> heavier

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
VQ is like just a tiny tiny bit heavier

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.590 
VQ is like just a tiny tiny bit heavier

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
little bit further and it went okay

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.770 
little bit further and it went okay
alright<00:01:54.720> peace<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> half<00:01:55.610> okay<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
alright peace and a half okay this I

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.520 
alright peace and a half okay this I
didn't<00:01:58.079> know<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.290> could<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.530> this<00:02:00.320> yeah<00:02:01.320> that's

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
didn't know it could do this yeah that's

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.469 
didn't know it could do this yeah that's
about<00:02:01.619> its<00:02:01.860> limit<00:02:02.189> however<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> V<00:02:03.000> Cube<00:02:03.299> can

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
about its limit however the V Cube can

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.630 
about its limit however the V Cube can
do<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.869> staircase<00:02:04.829> thing<00:02:05.369> or<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
do this staircase thing or you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.800 
do this staircase thing or you
misaligned<00:02:06.090> each<00:02:06.390> layer

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
misaligned each layer

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.020 
misaligned each layer
and<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:09.009> should<00:02:09.250> be<00:02:09.399> able<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.610> cut<00:02:09.850> right

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
and it should be able to cut right

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.890 
and it should be able to cut right
through<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:14.380> kind<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:15.690> freaking<00:02:16.690> center

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
through that so kind of freaking center

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.130 
through that so kind of freaking center
cap<00:02:17.080> always<00:02:17.319> pops<00:02:17.530> off<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:18.010> don't<00:02:18.370> know<00:02:18.430> why<00:02:18.610> oh

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
cap always pops off I don't know why oh

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.660 
cap always pops off I don't know why oh
wait<00:02:20.140> let<00:02:20.440> me<00:02:20.470> let<00:02:20.709> me<00:02:20.740> try<00:02:20.980> making<00:02:21.580> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
wait let me let me try making a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.720 
wait let me let me try making a
staircase<00:02:21.880> go<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.420> other<00:02:22.569> way<00:02:22.690> like<00:02:22.990> this<00:02:25.290> so

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
staircase go the other way like this so

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.080 
staircase go the other way like this so
yeah<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:28.030> did<00:02:28.239> cut<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:30.130> if<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.790> corner

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
yeah it did cut that so if you corner

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.979 
yeah it did cut that so if you corner
cutting<00:02:31.239> that's<00:02:31.450> pretty<00:02:31.600> nice

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
cutting that's pretty nice

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.160 
cutting that's pretty nice
I<00:02:32.020> know<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.800> shin<00:02:32.980> Shou<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:34.180> let's<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.080> go

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
I know the shin Shou so let's just go

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.750 
I know the shin Shou so let's just go
line<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.530> line<00:02:35.590> quickly<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:36.940> cuts<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.709> uh

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
line to line quickly and it cuts it uh

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.229 
line to line quickly and it cuts it uh
piece<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.940> half<00:02:41.340> I'm<00:02:42.340> not<00:02:42.730> quite<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.120> kind

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
piece and a half I'm not quite it kind

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.050 
piece and a half I'm not quite it kind
of<00:02:43.330> got<00:02:43.420> stuck<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.620> yeah<00:02:44.830> V<00:02:45.580> few<00:02:45.790> wins<00:02:46.269> with<00:02:46.590> uh

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
of got stuck so yeah V few wins with uh

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.210 
of got stuck so yeah V few wins with uh
you<00:02:49.060> know<00:02:49.090> outer<00:02:49.420> layer<00:02:49.690> corner<00:02:50.019> cutting<00:02:50.220> now

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
you know outer layer corner cutting now

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.530 
you know outer layer corner cutting now
let's<00:02:51.400> try<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.610> do<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:51.880> staircase<00:02:52.120> thing<00:02:57.540> hmm

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
let's try to do this staircase thing hmm

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.690 
let's try to do this staircase thing hmm
okay<00:02:58.980> we<00:02:59.980> try<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.220> from<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.519> other<00:03:01.170> angle

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
okay we try it from this other angle

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:11.100 
okay we try it from this other angle
like<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:04.890> okay<00:03:05.890> yeah<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.459> cut<00:03:09.720> now<00:03:10.720> let's

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
like this okay yeah that cut now let's

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.350 
like this okay yeah that cut now let's
try<00:03:11.290> awesome<00:03:11.709> Center<00:03:12.010> cutting<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.209> these

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
try awesome Center cutting so that these

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.600 
try awesome Center cutting so that these
are<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.600> three<00:03:13.690> layer<00:03:13.930> turns<00:03:14.400> cuts<00:03:15.400> about<00:03:15.549> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
are the three layer turns cuts about a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.650 
are the three layer turns cuts about a
piece<00:03:15.820> their<00:03:16.620> stride<00:03:17.620> piece<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> half<00:03:18.660> no

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
piece their stride piece and a half no

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.410 
piece their stride piece and a half no
not<00:03:19.870> quite<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.680> cut<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.239> third

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
not quite so it can cut so the third

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.500 
not quite so it can cut so the third
layer<00:03:22.570> turns<00:03:22.840> they<00:03:23.049> can<00:03:23.230> cut<00:03:23.410> up<00:03:23.860> one<00:03:24.070> piece

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
layer turns they can cut up one piece

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.920 
layer turns they can cut up one piece
happy<00:03:25.510> cube<00:03:29.100> nope<00:03:30.100> can't<00:03:30.820> cut<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.780> can

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
happy cube nope can't cut that you can

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.039 
happy cube nope can't cut that you can
see<00:03:32.079> it's<00:03:32.260> just<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:36.359> I'm<00:03:37.359> not<00:03:37.510> sure<00:03:37.570> exactly

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
see it's just so I'm not sure exactly

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.440 
see it's just so I'm not sure exactly
who<00:03:38.500> would<00:03:38.650> win<00:03:38.799> in<00:03:38.920> corner<00:03:39.190> cutting<00:03:39.400> Oh<00:03:39.730> V

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
who would win in corner cutting Oh V

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.970 
who would win in corner cutting Oh V
Cube<00:03:40.690> has<00:03:40.720> better<00:03:41.140> outer<00:03:41.380> layer<00:03:41.590> corner

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
Cube has better outer layer corner

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.430 
Cube has better outer layer corner
cutting<00:03:42.130> I'd<00:03:42.430> say<00:03:42.790> but<00:03:43.570> passion<00:03:44.049> shot<00:03:44.290> has

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
cutting I'd say but passion shot has

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.670 
cutting I'd say but passion shot has
better<00:03:44.650> three<00:03:45.340> layer<00:03:45.519> intercutting<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.680> I'd

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
better three layer intercutting so I'd

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.310 
better three layer intercutting so I'd
say<00:03:47.829> it's<00:03:47.950> about<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.100> tie<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.660> for<00:03:49.930> pops<00:03:50.109> and

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
say it's about a tie so for pops and

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.770 
say it's about a tie so for pops and
lockups<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:51.310> V<00:03:51.430> Cube<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.880> will<00:03:52.180> probably<00:03:52.600> pop

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
lockups the V Cube it will probably pop

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.449 
lockups the V Cube it will probably pop
one<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.200> these<00:03:53.290> inner<00:03:53.680> pieces<00:03:53.980> somewhere

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
one of these inner pieces somewhere

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.539 
one of these inner pieces somewhere
about<00:03:55.150> one<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.570> every<00:03:55.690> self<00:03:56.079> so<00:03:56.549> that's

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
about one in every self so that's

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.310 
about one in every self so that's
annoying<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.299> also<00:03:58.510> my<00:03:58.630> center<00:03:58.900> cap<00:03:59.079> keeps

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
annoying and also my center cap keeps

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.780 
annoying and also my center cap keeps
coming<00:03:59.590> off<00:03:59.709> that's<00:04:00.340> probably<00:04:00.549> just<00:04:00.640> me

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
coming off that's probably just me

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.880 
coming off that's probably just me
though<00:04:00.940> but<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:01.930> yeah<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.380> duty<00:04:02.680> cube

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
though but so yeah the duty cube

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.250 
though but so yeah the duty cube
definitely<00:04:03.220> does<00:04:03.340> pop<00:04:03.549> ash<00:04:04.420> enshou<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.049> all

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
definitely does pop ash enshou and all

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.170 
definitely does pop ash enshou and all
the<00:04:05.410> time<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.709> I've<00:04:05.829> had<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.579> has<00:04:06.820> not

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
the time that I've had it it has not

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.690 
the time that I've had it it has not
popped<00:04:07.480> once<00:04:08.140> however<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:09.010> does<00:04:09.250> get<00:04:09.489> these

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
popped once however it does get these

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.030 
popped once however it does get these
lock<00:04:10.030> ups<00:04:10.320> probably<00:04:11.320> something<00:04:11.680> like<00:04:11.709> that

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
lock ups probably something like that

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.370 
lock ups probably something like that
kind<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.489> where<00:04:13.209> it's<00:04:13.329> like<00:04:13.510> it's<00:04:14.230> just

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
kind of where it's like it's just

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.949 
kind of where it's like it's just
completely<00:04:14.890> locked<00:04:15.190> up<00:04:16.109> like

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
completely locked up like

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.779 
completely locked up like
I<00:04:17.989> don't<00:04:18.620> know<00:04:18.680> I<00:04:18.739> can't<00:04:19.250> really<00:04:19.430> make<00:04:19.519> it<00:04:19.579> do

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
I don't know I can't really make it do

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.150 
I don't know I can't really make it do
it<00:04:19.910> right<00:04:20.060> now<00:04:20.239> but<00:04:20.479> if<00:04:21.440> any<00:04:21.620> of<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.799> guys<00:04:21.919> have

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
it right now but if any of you guys have

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.180 
it right now but if any of you guys have
this<00:04:22.340> cube<00:04:22.580> or<00:04:22.759> even<00:04:23.210> have<00:04:23.360> like<00:04:23.600> um<00:04:23.979> but<00:04:24.979> week

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
this cube or even have like um but week

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.090 
this cube or even have like um but week
la<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.360> Shen<00:04:26.810> shall<00:04:26.990> 5x5<00:04:27.470> then<00:04:27.770> you'll<00:04:27.919> know

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
la a Shen shall 5x5 then you'll know

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.830 
la a Shen shall 5x5 then you'll know
like<00:04:28.280> what<00:04:28.430> kind<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.699> lock<00:04:28.880> ups<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.660> can

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
like what kind of lock ups that can

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.800 
like what kind of lock ups that can
happen<00:04:30.110> with<00:04:30.259> these<00:04:30.350> inner<00:04:30.560> pieces<00:04:31.419> so<00:04:32.419> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
happen with these inner pieces so the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.650 
happen with these inner pieces so the
v-cube<00:04:33.139> pops<00:04:33.850> shen<00:04:34.850> shall<00:04:35.240> has<00:04:35.389> those

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
v-cube pops shen shall has those

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.920 
v-cube pops shen shall has those
annoying<00:04:36.139> bottoms<00:04:36.560> so<00:04:37.449> now<00:04:38.449> we'll<00:04:38.630> just<00:04:38.810> get

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
annoying bottoms so now we'll just get

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.260 
annoying bottoms so now we'll just get
into<00:04:39.050> turning<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:39.830> we'll<00:04:39.979> start<00:04:40.160> with<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.490> V<00:04:41.030> Q

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
into turning so we'll start with the V Q

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.860 
into turning so we'll start with the V Q
so<00:04:42.139> outer<00:04:42.530> layers<00:04:45.520> they<00:04:46.520> they<00:04:47.240> really<00:04:47.509> do<00:04:47.660> turn

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
so outer layers they they really do turn

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.850 
so outer layers they they really do turn
pretty<00:04:48.139> nice<00:04:49.810> as<00:04:50.810> you<00:04:50.960> can<00:04:51.080> see<00:04:51.259> however<00:04:51.530> they

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
pretty nice as you can see however they

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.150 
pretty nice as you can see however they
do<00:04:51.919> take<00:04:52.250> kind<00:04:52.849> of<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:52.970> bit<00:04:53.090> of<00:04:53.120> force<00:04:53.389> to<00:04:53.660> turn

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
do take kind of a bit of force to turn

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.589 
do take kind of a bit of force to turn
the<00:04:55.160> center<00:04:55.430> cabin<00:04:55.759> maybe<00:04:55.940> Hugh<00:04:56.180> always<00:04:56.389> pops

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
the center cabin maybe Hugh always pops

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.620 
the center cabin maybe Hugh always pops
out<00:04:56.780> not<00:04:57.050> sure<00:04:57.199> why<00:04:57.789> so<00:04:58.789> now<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.300> second

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
out not sure why so now the second

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:10.060 
out not sure why so now the second
layers<00:05:04.630> they<00:05:05.630> all<00:05:06.110> turn<00:05:06.410> pretty<00:05:06.740> nice<00:05:08.199> and<00:05:09.199> the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
layers they all turn pretty nice and the

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.480 
layers they all turn pretty nice and the
third<00:05:10.669> layer<00:05:11.650> they're<00:05:12.650> kind<00:05:12.889> of<00:05:12.949> lumpy<00:05:13.280> if<00:05:13.370> you

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
third layer they're kind of lumpy if you

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.270 
third layer they're kind of lumpy if you
can<00:05:13.639> hear<00:05:17.199> however<00:05:18.199> this<00:05:18.470> does<00:05:18.710> take<00:05:18.949> quite<00:05:19.160> a

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
can hear however this does take quite a

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.480 
can hear however this does take quite a
bit<00:05:19.430> of<00:05:19.550> force<00:05:19.669> to<00:05:19.910> turn<00:05:20.060> like<00:05:20.889> I'm<00:05:21.889> actually

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
bit of force to turn like I'm actually

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.980 
bit of force to turn like I'm actually
putting<00:05:22.940> quite<00:05:23.240> a<00:05:23.270> bit<00:05:23.449> of<00:05:23.510> pressure<00:05:23.659> into

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
putting quite a bit of pressure into

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:32.620 
putting quite a bit of pressure into
this<00:05:27.520> yeah<00:05:28.550> whereas<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:29.360> Shin<00:05:29.570> Shou<00:05:31.630> turns

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
this yeah whereas the Shin Shou turns

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.439 
this yeah whereas the Shin Shou turns
very<00:05:32.900> fast<00:05:33.289> and<00:05:33.590> very<00:05:33.620> smooth<00:05:36.909> C<00:05:37.909> double<00:05:38.330> layer

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
very fast and very smooth C double layer

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:47.950 
very fast and very smooth C double layer
turns<00:05:43.539> so<00:05:45.130> sense<00:05:46.130> of<00:05:46.340> terms<00:05:46.880> a<00:05:47.150> lot<00:05:47.330> smoother

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
turns so sense of terms a lot smoother

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.260 
turns so sense of terms a lot smoother
and<00:05:48.139> it<00:05:48.620> requires<00:05:49.070> a<00:05:49.310> lot<00:05:49.340> less<00:05:49.789> effort<00:05:50.000> to

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
and it requires a lot less effort to

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.939 
and it requires a lot less effort to
turn<00:05:50.419> like<00:05:50.659> I'm<00:05:50.900> hardly<00:05:51.259> putting<00:05:51.620> any<00:05:51.800> effort

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
turn like I'm hardly putting any effort

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:58.920 
turn like I'm hardly putting any effort
into<00:05:52.250> this<00:05:52.430> turn<00:05:56.889> so<00:05:57.889> to<00:05:58.070> sum<00:05:58.250> it<00:05:58.280> up

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
into this turn so to sum it up

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.990 
into this turn so to sum it up
shun<00:05:59.930> Xiao<00:06:00.169> in<00:06:00.320> my<00:06:00.440> opinion<00:06:00.830> turns<00:06:01.099> faster<00:06:01.880> and

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
shun Xiao in my opinion turns faster and

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.570 
shun Xiao in my opinion turns faster and
smoother<00:06:02.389> and<00:06:02.740> requires<00:06:03.740> a<00:06:04.009> lot<00:06:04.039> less<00:06:04.400> effort

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
smoother and requires a lot less effort

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.189 
smoother and requires a lot less effort
to<00:06:04.940> turn<00:06:06.580> overall<00:06:07.580> I<00:06:07.820> would<00:06:08.150> definitely<00:06:08.960> buy

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
to turn overall I would definitely buy

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.570 
to turn overall I would definitely buy
the<00:06:09.259> Shen<00:06:09.680> Xiao<00:06:09.919> 7x7<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:11.090> V<00:06:11.270> Cube<00:06:11.509> it's<00:06:11.810> just

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
the Shen Xiao 7x7 the V Cube it's just

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.200 
the Shen Xiao 7x7 the V Cube it's just
too<00:06:13.580> expensive

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
too expensive

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.159 
too expensive
it's<00:06:14.570> pillowed<00:06:15.259> as<00:06:15.560> you<00:06:15.770> can<00:06:15.949> see<00:06:16.099> whereas<00:06:16.400> the

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
it's pillowed as you can see whereas the

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.790 
it's pillowed as you can see whereas the
shen<00:06:18.169> shey<00:06:18.320> house<00:06:18.440> cubic<00:06:18.979> and<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:20.590> VQ<00:06:21.590> just

shen shey house cubic and the VQ just

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.589 
shen shey house cubic and the VQ just
take<00:06:22.009> it<00:06:22.250> has<00:06:22.460> a<00:06:22.490> lot<00:06:22.759> more<00:06:22.789> like<00:06:23.090> resistance

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
take it has a lot more like resistance

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.510 
take it has a lot more like resistance
to<00:06:23.870> it<00:06:23.990> it's<00:06:24.259> kind<00:06:24.409> of<00:06:24.650> hard<00:06:24.710> to<00:06:24.889> explain<00:06:25.220> but

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
to it it's kind of hard to explain but

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.420 
to it it's kind of hard to explain but
it's<00:06:25.789> just<00:06:26.050> like<00:06:27.050> a<00:06:27.229> lot<00:06:27.469> harder<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:28.039> turn<00:06:28.190> than

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
it's just like a lot harder to turn than

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.890 
it's just like a lot harder to turn than
the<00:06:28.520> Shan<00:06:28.729> Shan<00:06:29.330> Zhai<00:06:29.479> was<00:06:29.599> just<00:06:29.779> so

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
the Shan Shan Zhai was just so

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.720 
the Shan Shan Zhai was just so
effortless

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
effortless

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.850 
effortless
Basti<00:06:32.730> smooth<00:06:34.220> and<00:06:35.220> it's<00:06:35.430> only<00:06:36.110> $30<00:06:37.110> in<00:06:37.680> most

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
Basti smooth and it's only $30 in most

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.330 
Basti smooth and it's only $30 in most
places<00:06:38.960> so<00:06:39.960> that's<00:06:40.290> it<00:06:40.680> I<00:06:40.710> guess

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
places so that's it I guess

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.790
