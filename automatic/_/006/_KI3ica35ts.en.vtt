blog we're here to take a look at the
new<00:00:28.740> Nikon<00:00:29.550> d4<00:00:31.040> DSLR<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.279> more<00:00:32.910> importantly

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
new Nikon d4 DSLR and more importantly

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.380 
new Nikon d4 DSLR and more importantly
not<00:00:33.720> so<00:00:33.930> much<00:00:34.080> the<00:00:34.350> d4<00:00:34.770> itself<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.270> I'm

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
not so much the d4 itself but what I'm

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.420 
not so much the d4 itself but what I'm
really<00:00:36.420> intrigued<00:00:36.960> by<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.710> new<00:00:37.890> wireless

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
really intrigued by is the new wireless

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.080 
really intrigued by is the new wireless
module<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.660> wt5<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.830> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.879> this

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
module the wt5 as you can see it's this

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.910 
module the wt5 as you can see it's this
little<00:00:42.510> module<00:00:42.900> that<00:00:43.019> sticks<00:00:43.379> off<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> side

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
little module that sticks off the side

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.710 
little module that sticks off the side
of<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.129> camera<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.879> course<00:00:45.510> it's

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
of the camera here of course it's

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.799 
of the camera here of course it's
optional<00:00:46.199> very<00:00:46.650> expensively<00:00:47.460> optional<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
optional very expensively optional as I

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.560 
optional very expensively optional as I
might<00:00:49.170> add<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.570> significantly

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
might add but it is significantly

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
might add but it is significantly
smaller<00:00:51.989> than<00:00:52.290> all<00:00:52.890> previous<00:00:52.920> attempts<00:00:53.790> by

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
smaller than all previous attempts by

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.150 
smaller than all previous attempts by

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
I wanted to do today was do a test to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800 
I wanted to do today was do a test to
see<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.649> I<00:01:16.800> could<00:01:16.860> cut<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> wire<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.940> do<00:01:18.630> my

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
see if I could cut the wire and do my

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.350 
see if I could cut the wire and do my
fashion<00:01:19.289> shoot<00:01:19.530> without<00:01:20.220> having<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.179> be

fashion shoot without having to be

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.219 
fashion shoot without having to be
connected<00:01:22.310> via<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.369> cable<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.840> did<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
connected via a cable and I did the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.930 
connected via a cable and I did the
shoot<00:01:25.440> it<00:01:25.619> worked<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:25.979> great<00:01:26.190> but<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.670> wanted

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
shoot it worked out great but I wanted

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.149 
shoot it worked out great but I wanted
to<00:01:27.090> basically<00:01:27.570> give<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> review<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
to basically give a review to you to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.490 
to basically give a review to you to
show<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.240> give<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
show you what you give up and what you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.429 
show you what you give up and what you
gain<00:01:31.830> with<00:01:32.580> this<00:01:32.790> module<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.990> model

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
gain with this module now the model

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.840 
gain with this module now the model
itself<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.250> configured<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.729> multiple

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
itself can be configured with multiple

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.569 
itself can be configured with multiple
profiles<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
profiles you can do that right in the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.600 
profiles you can do that right in the
camera<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.930> course<00:01:40.229> there's<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> network

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
camera and of course there's a network

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
camera and of course there's a network
option<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.650> that<00:01:43.650> basically<00:01:43.979> allows

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
option right here that basically allows

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.510 
option right here that basically allows
me<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.390> set<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.310> type

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
me to go in and set it up for the type

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.039 
me to go in and set it up for the type
of<00:01:47.549> connections<00:01:48.150> that<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.360> want<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
of connections that I want to do so

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 
of connections that I want to do so
right<00:01:49.229> now<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.590> connecting<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.100> my<00:01:50.400> Wi-Fi

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
right now it's connecting to my Wi-Fi

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.539 
right now it's connecting to my Wi-Fi
network<00:01:50.939> since<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.750> am<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.200> studio<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.920> once

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
network since I am in studio and once

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.859 
network since I am in studio and once
it's<00:01:53.700> connected<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> network

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it's connected to the network

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.480 
it's connected to the network
then<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.470> begin<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.710> look<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
then it will begin to look for the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.179 
then it will begin to look for the
wireless<00:01:56.970> software<00:01:57.899> running<00:01:58.320> from<00:01:58.590> Nikon<00:01:59.009> on

wireless software running from Nikon on
my<00:01:59.310> computer<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.909> we're<00:02:00.659> green<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.350> we're

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
my computer and we're green so we're

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.760 
my computer and we're green so we're
ready<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.899> module<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.500> also

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
ready to go now the the module can also

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.180 
ready to go now the the module can also
do<00:02:05.490> ad<00:02:05.820> hoc<00:02:06.360> networks<00:02:06.960> meaning<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.770> set<00:02:08.070> up

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
do ad hoc networks meaning it can set up

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.400 
do ad hoc networks meaning it can set up
its<00:02:08.399> own<00:02:08.640> Wi-Fi<00:02:09.450> network<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.049> if<00:02:10.140> you're<00:02:10.259> out

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
let's go in and do a simple test now I

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.680 
let's go in and do a simple test now I
will<00:02:30.900> forewarn<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:32.609> the<00:02:32.850> problem<00:02:33.329> with

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
will forewarn you that the problem with

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.140 
will forewarn you that the problem with
shooting<00:02:34.080> wirelessly<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.580> that

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
shooting wirelessly like this is that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.750 
shooting wirelessly like this is that
the<00:02:36.300> initial<00:02:36.750> image<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.440> take<00:02:37.650> anywhere<00:02:38.400> from

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the initial image can take anywhere from

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.200 
the initial image can take anywhere from
30<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.240> 60<00:02:39.570> seconds<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.950> come<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.370> because<00:02:42.060> as

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
30 to 60 seconds to come in because as

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.730 
30 to 60 seconds to come in because as
you<00:02:42.330> can<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.690> since<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:43.140> didn't<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.500> anything

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
you can see since I didn't do anything

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.700 
you can see since I didn't do anything
the<00:02:44.430> module<00:02:44.910> went<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.270> sleep<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.110> camera<00:02:46.500> went

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
the module went to sleep the camera went

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.740 
the module went to sleep the camera went
to<00:02:46.830> sleep<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:48.030> minute<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.300> fire<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
to sleep and the minute I fire the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.870 
to sleep and the minute I fire the
shutter<00:02:48.930> all<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.830> has<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.040> wake<00:02:50.400> up<00:02:50.580> again

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
shutter all of that has to wake up again

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.210 
shutter all of that has to wake up again
and<00:02:51.120> do<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.420> connectivity<00:02:52.200> again<00:02:52.500> that's

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
and do the connectivity again that's

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.370 
and do the connectivity again that's
what<00:02:53.610> at<00:02:53.760> that's<00:02:54.390> why<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.870> thirty<00:02:55.170> to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
what at that's why it's a thirty to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.500 
what at that's why it's a thirty to
sixty<00:02:55.560> second<00:02:56.160> range<00:02:56.430> that's<00:02:56.700> what<00:02:56.910> adds<00:02:57.150> to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
sixty second range that's what adds to

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.330 
sixty second range that's what adds to
it<00:02:57.660> but<00:02:58.500> let's<00:02:58.680> go<00:02:58.860> in

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
it but let's go in

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.460 
it but let's go in
let's<00:02:59.640> hit<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> menu<00:03:00.240> again<00:03:00.330> let's<00:03:01.230> go<00:03:01.410> to

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
let's hit the menu again let's go to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.020 
let's hit the menu again let's go to
network<00:03:01.890> let's<00:03:02.370> wake<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:04.340> let's<00:03:05.340> get

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
network let's wake it up and let's get

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.670 
network let's wake it up and let's get
it<00:03:06.180> going<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.840> we<00:03:06.990> can<00:03:07.200> at<00:03:07.290> least<00:03:07.320> cut

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
it going so that we can at least cut

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.850 
it going so that we can at least cut
that<00:03:07.830> tap<00:03:08.160> time<00:03:08.520> down<00:03:08.790> manually<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:10.350> we<00:03:10.590> got<00:03:10.740> it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
that tap time down manually so we got it

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.890 
that tap time down manually so we got it
connecting<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.490> network<00:03:11.660> takes<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.780> few

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
connecting to the network takes a few

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.990 
connecting to the network takes a few
seconds<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.410> do<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.650> now<00:03:14.550> it's<00:03:14.730> connected

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
seconds to do that now it's connected

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.480 
seconds to do that now it's connected
now<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.660> found<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.020> computer<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.710> we'll

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
now it's found the computer and we'll

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.640 
now it's found the computer and we'll
now<00:03:17.670> take<00:03:17.700> our<00:03:18.120> first<00:03:18.360> shot<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.410> start

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
now take our first shot so you can start

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.520 
now take our first shot so you can start
your<00:03:19.800> timers<00:03:20.190> now<00:03:20.840> there's<00:03:21.840> our<00:03:22.020> first<00:03:22.200> shot

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
your timers now there's our first shot

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.580 
your timers now there's our first shot
right<00:03:23.130> there<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.520> camera<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.380> now<00:03:25.380> we're

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
right there on the camera and now we're

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.100 
right there on the camera and now we're
waiting<00:03:25.830> for<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.540> transfer<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.720> happen

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
waiting for that transfer to happen

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.960 
waiting for that transfer to happen
which<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.410> see<00:03:28.620> my<00:03:28.770> green<00:03:29.040> lights<00:03:29.340> flashing

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
which I see my green lights flashing

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.510 
which I see my green lights flashing
we're<00:03:30.600> waiting<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:30.960> it<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.560> send<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.490> a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
we're waiting for it to send it to a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.990 
we're waiting for it to send it to a
folder<00:03:32.960> over<00:03:33.960> here<00:03:34.200> on<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.860> MacBook<00:03:35.430> Pro<00:03:35.670> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
folder over here on the MacBook Pro and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.160 
folder over here on the MacBook Pro and
then<00:03:36.540> Lightroom<00:03:37.110> I've<00:03:37.260> got<00:03:37.440> set<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.830> auto

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
then Lightroom I've got set to auto

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.190 
then Lightroom I've got set to auto
basically<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.380> auto<00:03:41.090> import<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.209> using<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
basically to auto import it using the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.290 
basically to auto import it using the
method<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:43.680> used<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.070> use<00:03:44.250> before<00:03:44.520> tethering

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
method we used to use before tethering

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.620 
method we used to use before tethering
so<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.350> took<00:03:46.770> it<00:03:46.890> into<00:03:47.010> my<00:03:47.190> auto<00:03:47.400> import<00:03:47.910> folder

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
so it took it into my auto import folder

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.040 
so it took it into my auto import folder
and<00:03:48.989> there<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.330> wasn't<00:03:51.660> bad

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
and there it is so that wasn't bad

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.260 
and there it is so that wasn't bad
because<00:03:52.680> we<00:03:52.860> woke<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.250> up<00:03:53.370> first<00:03:53.640> now<00:03:54.209> the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
because we woke it up first now the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.900 
because we woke it up first now the
advantage<00:03:54.900> though<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.890> once<00:03:56.250> you've<00:03:56.580> got

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
advantage though is that once you've got

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.260 
advantage though is that once you've got
it<00:03:56.940> going<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.530> continue<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.250> take<00:03:59.910> shots

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
it going and you continue to take shots

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.930 
it going and you continue to take shots
here<00:04:01.170> I'll<00:04:01.290> just<00:04:01.470> focus<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.459> on<00:04:02.580> different

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
here I'll just focus in on different

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.090 
here I'll just focus in on different
areas<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.690> couch<00:04:03.900> there<00:04:05.090> we<00:04:06.590> there<00:04:07.590> we<00:04:07.709> go

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
areas of the couch there we there we go

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.210 
areas of the couch there we there we go
once<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.150> take<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.660> first<00:04:10.080> initial<00:04:10.920> image

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
once you take that first initial image

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.020 
once you take that first initial image
and<00:04:11.570> then<00:04:12.570> you<00:04:12.750> keep<00:04:13.019> going<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:14.250> images<00:04:14.790> don't

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
and then you keep going the images don't

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.229 
and then you keep going the images don't
take<00:04:15.450> 30<00:04:15.989> seconds<00:04:16.530> anymore<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.280> come<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.669> so

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
take 30 seconds anymore to come in so

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.909 
take 30 seconds anymore to come in so
that's<00:04:18.480> what<00:04:18.750> makes<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.169> solution<00:04:19.500> actually

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
that's what makes the solution actually

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.220 
that's what makes the solution actually
usable<00:04:20.669> now<00:04:21.150> again<00:04:21.450> it's<00:04:21.630> still<00:04:21.900> processing

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
usable now again it's still processing

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.920 
usable now again it's still processing
still<00:04:22.919> sending<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.520> second<00:04:24.300> image<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.900> that

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
still sending that second image and that

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.080 
still sending that second image and that
one<00:04:25.590> might<00:04:25.770> take<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.040> few<00:04:26.160> seconds<00:04:26.669> because<00:04:26.790> it

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
one might take a few seconds because it

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.090 
one might take a few seconds because it
had<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.330> wake<00:04:27.510> up<00:04:27.720> but<00:04:28.350> there's<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.680> second

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
had to wake up but there's a second

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.250 
had to wake up but there's a second
image<00:04:29.220> coming<00:04:29.550> in<00:04:29.760> on<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.910> film<00:04:30.210> strip<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.750> here

image coming in on a film strip and here

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.500 
image coming in on a film strip and here
I'll<00:04:31.410> fire<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.710> few<00:04:32.010> more<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:33.060> third<00:04:33.270> one

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
I'll fire a few more and the third one

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.020 
I'll fire a few more and the third one
didn't<00:04:33.780> take<00:04:33.900> 30<00:04:34.110> seconds<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:35.460> fourth<00:04:35.790> one<00:04:36.000> is

they're<00:04:40.740> going<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:40.980> come<00:04:41.190> in<00:04:41.370> anywhere<00:04:41.880> from<00:04:42.210> 5

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539

they're going to come in anywhere from 5
to<00:04:42.870> 15<00:04:43.320> seconds<00:04:43.860> apiece<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:44.940> there's<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.270> next

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
to 15 seconds apiece so there's the next

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
I'm waiting is much more reasonable or

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.580 
I'm waiting is much more reasonable or
flexible<00:05:00.729> for<00:05:01.030> me<00:05:01.180> than<00:05:01.930> shooting<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:03.310> a<00:05:03.610> cable

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590

computer and always tripping over that
cable<00:05:10.419> as<00:05:10.509> I've<00:05:10.660> done<00:05:10.900> in<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.110> past<00:05:11.139> and<00:05:12.000> not

cable as I've done in the past and not
having<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.330> be<00:05:13.449> bothered<00:05:13.780> with<00:05:13.870> any<00:05:14.050> of<00:05:14.199> that

having to be bothered with any of that

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:15.930 
having to be bothered with any of that
so<00:05:14.620> even<00:05:14.830> though<00:05:14.979> I<00:05:15.009> could<00:05:15.220> do<00:05:15.310> Ethernet<00:05:15.910> on

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
so even though I could do Ethernet on

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.210 
so even though I could do Ethernet on
this<00:05:16.150> camera<00:05:16.539> I<00:05:16.690> would<00:05:17.259> still<00:05:17.560> prefer<00:05:18.190> to

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
this camera I would still prefer to

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.640 
this camera I would still prefer to
shoot<00:05:18.699> wirelessly<00:05:19.389> and<00:05:19.690> that<00:05:20.169> means<00:05:20.440> I<00:05:20.590> can

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
shoot wirelessly and that means I can

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.640 
shoot wirelessly and that means I can
pick<00:05:21.070> this<00:05:21.280> camera<00:05:21.699> up<00:05:21.880> take<00:05:22.479> it<00:05:22.660> anywhere<00:05:23.349> in

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
pick this camera up take it anywhere in

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.339 
pick this camera up take it anywhere in
my<00:05:23.919> studio<00:05:24.280> because<00:05:25.150> my<00:05:25.300> entire<00:05:25.690> studio<00:05:26.169> is

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
my studio because my entire studio is

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.650 
my studio because my entire studio is
blanketed<00:05:26.919> with<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.250> same<00:05:27.520> network<00:05:27.789> and<00:05:28.210> when

blanketed with the same network and when

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.439 
blanketed with the same network and when
I<00:05:28.690> come<00:05:28.960> back<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.199> my<00:05:29.470> computer<00:05:30.060> those<00:05:31.060> images

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
I come back to my computer those images

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.330 
I come back to my computer those images
will<00:05:31.599> be<00:05:31.750> there<00:05:31.930> no<00:05:32.110> matter<00:05:32.320> where<00:05:32.770> I<00:05:32.800> went<00:05:33.190> off

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
will be there no matter where I went off

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.570 
will be there no matter where I went off
shooting<00:05:33.820> to<00:05:34.030> so<00:05:34.810> I<00:05:34.840> can<00:05:35.110> go<00:05:35.380> on<00:05:35.410> location<00:05:35.680> take

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580

not and just leave the laptop where it

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.550 
not and just leave the laptop where it
is<00:05:42.340> but<00:05:42.580> when<00:05:42.729> I<00:05:42.759> get<00:05:42.849> back<00:05:43.120> to<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.479> laptop<00:05:43.840> the

is but when I get back to the laptop the

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.560 
is but when I get back to the laptop the

Ethernet tethering but fast enough to

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.920 
Ethernet tethering but fast enough to
give<00:05:56.919> up<00:05:57.099> the<00:05:57.280> cable<00:05:57.699> and<00:05:57.880> that<00:05:57.909> was<00:05:58.720> my<00:05:58.900> goal

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
give up the cable and that was my goal

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.399 
give up the cable and that was my goal
here<00:05:59.470> with<00:05:59.860> purchasing<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.580> wt5<00:06:01.300> module<00:06:01.840> so
