by<00:04:57.419> fours<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.020> cost<00:04:58.530> about<00:04:58.770> eight<00:04:59.010> dollars<00:04:59.250> to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
by fours and cost about eight dollars to

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.400 
by fours and cost about eight dollars to
make<00:04:59.850> when<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.150> consider<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.780> glue<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.320> the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
make when you consider the glue and the

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.000 
make when you consider the glue and the
wood<00:05:01.620> screws

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
wood screws

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.219 
wood screws
I<00:05:02.250> can<00:05:02.820> make<00:05:03.000> one<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.210> these<00:05:03.419> in<00:05:03.660> under<00:05:03.870> 20

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
I can make one of these in under 20

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.780 
I can make one of these in under 20
minutes<00:05:04.410> because<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.800> make<00:05:05.010> a<00:05:05.040> lot<00:05:05.160> of<00:05:05.340> them<00:05:05.610> but

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
minutes because I make a lot of them but

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.640 
minutes because I make a lot of them but
it'll<00:05:05.970> probably<00:05:06.180> take<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:06.900> around<00:05:06.990> 3035

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
it'll probably take you around 3035

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.129 
it'll probably take you around 3035
minutes<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.430> do<00:05:08.550> this<00:05:08.700> project<00:05:11.810> so<00:05:12.810> we<00:05:12.960> now

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
minutes to do this project so we now

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.650 
minutes to do this project so we now
have<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.500> new<00:05:13.860> perfect<00:05:14.190> circle<00:05:14.790> your<00:05:15.330> blade

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
have a new perfect circle your blade

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.290 
have a new perfect circle your blade
will<00:05:15.690> last<00:05:16.260> several<00:05:16.740> hundred<00:05:17.010> cuts<00:05:17.850> like<00:05:18.060> this

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
will last several hundred cuts like this

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.409 
will last several hundred cuts like this
and<00:05:18.870> I<00:05:18.990> thing<00:05:19.260> about<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:19.680> is<00:05:19.919> that<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.190> hole

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
and I thing about this is that the hole

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.360 
and I thing about this is that the hole
is<00:05:21.419> Center<00:05:21.990> so<00:05:22.500> that's<00:05:22.710> where<00:05:22.890> your<00:05:23.039> Center<00:05:23.340> is

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
is Center so that's where your Center is

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.950 
is Center so that's where your Center is
so<00:05:23.669> if<00:05:23.729> you<00:05:23.820> want<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.030> make<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> flywheel<00:05:24.690> all

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
so if you want to make a flywheel all

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.960 
so if you want to make a flywheel all
you<00:05:25.050> have<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.350> do<00:05:25.530> put<00:05:26.220> some<00:05:26.400> weights<00:05:26.610> on<00:05:26.789> it

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
you have to do put some weights on it

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.850 
you have to do put some weights on it
balanced<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.510> out<00:05:27.600> you're<00:05:27.840> good<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.140> go<00:05:28.169> you

balanced and out you're good to go you

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.219 
balanced and out you're good to go you
can<00:05:29.010> sand<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.400> edges<00:05:29.580> down<00:05:29.970> on<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.300> sander<00:05:30.810> I'm

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
can sand the edges down on a sander I'm

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.740 
can sand the edges down on a sander I'm
going<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.440> be<00:05:31.530> using<00:05:31.919> this<00:05:32.100> for<00:05:32.490> project<00:05:33.150> this
