00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.160
 skoda presents qua paris fabia combi e 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.259
 normal thing changes 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.150
 substantially the fabia length 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.419
 normal most suitable for an audience 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.700
 young and sporty drift 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.410
 basically from the pole 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.689
 let us look inside even tried in 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.310
 interior resume leon's infotainment 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.330
 the great photo of di leon that you 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.670
 you know very well about the quality 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.130
 motorizations taken entirely from the park 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.800
 of the volkswagen three- cylinder group 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:38.050
 four cylinders 1000 1400 we go to 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.879
 see the front very aggressive the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.320
 frontal by the way very much 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.000
 customizable little we will go to see the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.520
 various versions of this fabian I have to 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.890
 see also behind and then do one 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:54.579
 quick ride from the combi we can here 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.800
 see the rear seats 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.699
 rear I opened the trunk to do 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.019
 see how wide it really is deep 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.820
 the cockpit maybe not very comfortable for 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.310
 load but very large and the trunk but 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 I have to see that of the frontal combi 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.150
 see the same we do the tour for 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.890
 seeing it from the side inside is the same 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.750
 so I don't do the car 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.110
 see why we find it equitable with one 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.940
 dashboard with matching color 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.470
 outside the body and this is one 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.170
 of the many customizations also the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.430
 steering wheel to the inserts of the same 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.580
 body color but here it is e 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:42.190
 here the latter is here that changes 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.650
 see let's look at the capacity of 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.540
 load I would say remarkable very long a lot 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.480
 deep with the handle to access the 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.190
 lower cockpit but I was talking about 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.900
 customization then let's go to 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.910
 see all available colors or 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.730
 however most of the colors that 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.310
 are available for this new factory 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.120
 beautiful green frog green color with 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.330
 roof with black roof a little trivial the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.780
 black but the station version comes to an end 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.090
 yellow wagon 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
 I don't know if it makes in video but I have to say 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.730
 that live is not bad especially in 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.800
 aggressive but very nice version 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.459
 this two-tone gray you see more roof 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.500
 clear darker bodywork inserts into 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.600
 aluminum I know if you can see 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.190
 the inserts in the aluminum dashboard 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.770
 but what they seem to be is a bit of lemon 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.250
 inside you know I like it more and this 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.630
 gray with red roof with even i 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.959
 red and white circles so you have it 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.250
 saw fabia fabia combi novelty of paris 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.250
 and great customization
