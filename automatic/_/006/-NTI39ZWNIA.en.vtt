00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
type things are called the fly wire and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.410 
type things are called the fly wire and
the<00:00:25.769> whole<00:00:25.920> upper<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.430> based<00:00:26.730> around<00:00:26.939> flying

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the whole upper is based around flying
