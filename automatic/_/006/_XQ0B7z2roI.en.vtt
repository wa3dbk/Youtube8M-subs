reducing injuries using by using a back
protector<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:47.160> decided<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> move<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.120> step

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
protector but we decided to move a step

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.819 
protector but we decided to move a step
forward<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.670> we<00:00:50.670> did<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.750> developed<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.379> system

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
forward so we did we developed a system

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
forward so we did we developed a system
that<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.129> integrated<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> chest

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
that is integrated with the chest

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.580 
that is integrated with the chest
protector<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:55.170> well

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
protector as well

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.630 
protector as well
so<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> buy<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.350> complete<00:00:58.980> set

so what you buy here is a complete set
of<00:00:59.690> protection<00:01:01.160> let's<00:01:02.160> focus<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.180> back

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
of protection let's focus on the back

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.740 
of protection let's focus on the back
part<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.589> second<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.610> comes<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.240> from

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
part for a second this comes right from

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.390 
part for a second this comes right from
the<00:01:07.760> from<00:01:08.760> our<00:01:08.880> classic<00:01:09.770> backward<00:01:10.770> protector

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the from our classic backward protector

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.830 
the from our classic backward protector
which<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> level<00:01:12.860> c2<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.509> shock<00:01:15.509> absorbing

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
which is a level c2 of shock absorbing

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
which is a level c2 of shock absorbing
level<00:01:18.840> which<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> top<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.729> range<00:01:20.820> right

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
level which is a top of the range right

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.999 
level which is a top of the range right
now<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.950> also<00:01:22.950> comes<00:01:23.310> with<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.030> several

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
now and also comes with the several

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.490 
now and also comes with the several
advanced<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:27.170> are<00:01:28.170> very<00:01:28.439> useful<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.159> let<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
advanced that are very useful to let the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.999 
advanced that are very useful to let the
warm<00:01:31.500> air<00:01:32.869> from<00:01:33.869> from<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> inside<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.979> outside

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
warm air from from the inside to outside

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.440 
warm air from from the inside to outside
of<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:37.259> protector<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.460> also<00:01:38.729> extremely

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
of the protector it's also extremely

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.050 
of the protector it's also extremely
light<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.200> whole<00:01:40.439> system<00:01:41.009> weights<00:01:41.579> just

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
light the whole system weights just

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.550 
light the whole system weights just
about<00:01:42.950> 700<00:01:43.950> grams<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:45.960> doesn't

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
about 700 grams so it really doesn't

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.649 
about 700 grams so it really doesn't
affect<00:01:46.680> your<00:01:47.399> riding<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.360> very

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
kind of morphology but most importantly

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.170 
kind of morphology but most importantly
this<00:02:46.560> equipment<00:02:47.160> comes<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:48.019> four<00:02:49.019> different

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
this equipment comes in four different

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.470 
this equipment comes in four different
models<00:02:51.500> yeah<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.010> basic<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.120> same

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
models yeah the the basic is the same

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.300 
models yeah the the basic is the same
but<00:02:54.720> we<00:02:55.110> have<00:02:56.120> definitely<00:02:57.120> changed<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:58.349> size

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
but we have definitely changed the size

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.000 
but we have definitely changed the size
and<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.849> shape<00:02:59.880> of<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:01.230> back<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.769> chest

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
and the shape of the back and the chest

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.750 
and the shape of the back and the chest
to<00:03:03.110> better<00:03:04.110> fit<00:03:05.030> people<00:03:06.030> from<00:03:07.760> 145

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
to better fit people from 145

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.740 
to better fit people from 145
centimeters<00:03:09.000> up<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:10.079> 195<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.209> have<00:03:12.329> four

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
centimeters up to 195 so we have four

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.400 
centimeters up to 195 so we have four
different<00:03:12.930> models<00:03:13.349> for<00:03:14.340> each<00:03:14.930> hate<00:03:15.930> range<00:03:16.380> and

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
different models for each hate range and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.340
