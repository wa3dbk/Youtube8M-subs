snakes rear up at me

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.179 
snakes rear up at me
but<00:02:39.480> generally<00:02:39.870> they<00:02:40.019> if<00:02:40.439> they<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:41.040> they

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
but generally they if they see you they

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.599 
but generally they if they see you they
try<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.549> get<00:02:41.700> out<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.939> your<00:02:42.030> road<00:02:43.609> they

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
try and get out of your road they

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.360 
try and get out of your road they
actually<00:02:44.939> have<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.209> ability<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:46.189> limit<00:02:47.189> or

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
actually have the ability to limit or

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.459 
actually have the ability to limit or
judge<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.450> amount<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.750> poison<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.290> they

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
judge the amount of poison that they

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.740 
judge the amount of poison that they
inject<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.010> with<00:02:50.040> when<00:02:51.030> they<00:02:51.180> bite<00:02:51.359> you

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
inject you with when they bite you

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.619 
inject you with when they bite you
so<00:02:52.739> they're<00:02:53.370> actually<00:02:53.489> not<00:02:53.819> considered<00:02:54.329> that

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
so they're actually not considered that

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.780 
so they're actually not considered that
dangerous<00:02:55.170> although<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.889> wouldn't<00:02:56.609> like<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
dangerous although I wouldn't like to

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.010 
dangerous although I wouldn't like to
get<00:02:57.030> bitten<00:02:57.269> by<00:02:57.450> one<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.659> these

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.290 

three<00:03:00.890> or<00:03:00.980> four<00:03:01.040> hundred<00:03:01.310> meters<00:03:01.850> past<00:03:02.060> the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
three or four hundred meters past the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.530 
three or four hundred meters past the
rainforest<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:04.430> creek<00:03:04.700> has<00:03:04.850> just<00:03:05.090> turned

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
rainforest and the creek has just turned

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.130 
rainforest and the creek has just turned

into this nice pools but they're

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.740 
into this nice pools but they're
completely<00:03:09.620> different<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:11.180> when<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.510> think

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
completely different just when you think

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.310

the<00:03:11.900> creek<00:03:12.170> gets<00:03:12.410> smaller<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.930> pop<00:03:14.930> over<00:03:15.290> a

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
the creek gets smaller you pop over a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.660 
the creek gets smaller you pop over a
little<00:03:15.560> legs<00:03:15.770> like<00:03:16.040> this

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
little legs like this

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.640 
little legs like this
and<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:18.050> just<00:03:18.230> opens<00:03:18.620> right<00:03:19.460> up<00:03:19.760> again<00:03:20.650> moss

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
and it just opens right up again moss

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.410 
and it just opens right up again moss
and<00:03:22.280> palm<00:03:22.580> trees<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.510> just<00:03:24.970> everything<00:03:25.970> is

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
and palm trees and just everything is
