00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:10.150
 a strong wind came out on the first day 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.589
 expeditions 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.019
 forgiveness of his tone capital new 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.019
 zealand 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.330
 German scientific research 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
 the vessel zone will operate in the southern 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
 parts of the pacific 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.079
 on board the geophysicist was whether 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.180
 his team of scientists 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.010
 researchers are searching for one day 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.010
 ordinary substance 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.080
 team engaged 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.230
 we want to find these gas hydrates 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.120
 crystalline compounds of the future 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.210
 can be a new source of energy 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.830
 we are already very interested to understand 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.230
 hydrate formation mechanism and principles 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.580
 the existence of natural conditions 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.180
 also recognize when in them 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150
 changes occur 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
 as he said at a press conference 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.140
 methane hydrate deposit 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.770
 need to look deep under water 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 they are closed at the very bottom of the ocean 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.770
 for example off the coast of New Zealand 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.310
 This process Kovtun remained methane hydrate 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.470
 and those who take six times the estimated 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.140
 Specialists in Methane Valida deposits 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.340
 significantly more energy than all 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.490
 currently explored oil reserves 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.750
 natural gas and coal and together 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.000
 taken with maybe gas hydrates not 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.610
 will become the main people of the future resources 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.430
 its use will surely open 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.729
 opportunities on a gradual path 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.619
 transition from traditional 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.340
 energy sources from renewable but i 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 cans 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.440
 second day 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 weather unsuitable 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.150
 two days no opportunity for 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 scientific work 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.890
 finally half a year now is getting better 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 scientists need to catch up 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.620
 to search for methane attracts 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.779
 special appliances appliances surround on 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.779
 thousand meter depth 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.540
 seventh day today premiere two years 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.359
 for the first time direct the so-called 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.359
 puppet 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.399
 satisfied 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.489
 according to artemiev face 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.739
 this device which by 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.340
 electromagnetic waves will be 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.019
 shine through the seabed 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.019
 facilitate exploration of methane hydrate 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.109
 in the exhibition involved a whole 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.540
 search engine 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.829
 they allow septim inaccuracy to find out 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.120
 stages of gas hydrate deposits and where possible 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.609
 drill the seabed according to 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.560
 need to collect as much as possible 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.409
 geographic information 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.349
 gas hydrate distribution 120 cm 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.469
 and one of the assistants here is such 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.730
 piggy so dubbed the scientist this 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.840
 good luck level 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.840
 data cables 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.099
 This document is made in connection with 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.599
 what's in the submarine expo 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.249
 research such a risk is always 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.249
 congress captain of the ship of speculation 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.849
 True information obtained through 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.119
 to a friend 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:31.699
 and allows scientists to map 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.109
 seabed indicating 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.109
 prospective deposits 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:40.329
 but in other places like drilling is better 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.709
 refuse it can happen 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.659
 releasing dangerous greenhouse 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.389
 gases 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.049
 before that doctors azarov 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.839
 now we can surely recognize 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:50.839
 like safe use 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.680
 gas hydrates where you can proceed to 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.490
 his prey 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.240
 and certain areas that are better 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.880
 sidestep to avoid 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.320
 climate malware 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.440
 uncontrolled methane emissions with 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.440
 reason Russia 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:07.939
 instead, scientists are looking for options 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.409
 burial in the sea of ​​another gas 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.409
 public words 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.919
 whites wants to prevent the overshoot 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.269
 into the atmosphere of co2 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.060
 he is looking for ways to counselors and warehousing at the bottom 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.060
 of the ocean 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.229
 but it is worthwhile in other words to lose this 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.400
 climate hazardous exhaust gas 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400
 air power stations and pump 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.400
 its similar structure in the form 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.479
 new cancer 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.559
 and it should function so after 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:38.759
 Istanbul does not open 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.759
 methane hydrate deposits 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.620
 to this storage by pipeline 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.490
 served only two produced 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.960
 for example some power stations 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.610
 Salavat drives out natanze grants while 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.190
 remains in the seabed but released 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.590
 tank 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.590
 goes to the power station 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.759
 as the five Alla Spartak says 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.819
 kill two birds with one stone 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.710
 new energy source at the same time 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.629
 take time out of the atmosphere for climate 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.000
 as many as two follows what else with his reliable 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 burials 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.189
 one of that night's night aboard 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.969
 zone for some flight participants she 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.969
 will be the culmination of the expedition hair 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.860
 traditionally the pipe on the steamer is inferior 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.550
 samples from the seabed and suddenly finally 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.550
 scientists discover cedar methane 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.169
 remnants of walkie-talkie 1 for all 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.819
 he refused to match with Russia 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.250
 in the press service 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.240
 after all, even you will be taken as great 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.350
 because this is exactly what we are looking for the play 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.070
 massive piece of gas hydrates 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.039
 look live weight direct flights 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.039
 Medvedev blew his whistle 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.169
 time to sum up first and how u 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.800
 New Zealand coast there 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.249
 large deposits of methane hydrate however 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:14.919
 not at all stages of chickens 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.539
 developments 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.469
 we must have acquired everything else from us 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.159
 had the opportunity to try new 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.830
 appliances 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.580
 which we after test a few 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.159
 modified now we can 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:26.710
 suggest these search engines 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.949
 countries like china india new 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.039
 of zealand which may also be 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.039
 engage in the extraction of methane hydrate 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.909

 New Zealand kuklin yes 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.819
 the expedition came to an end 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:43.819
 reached 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.240
 the search for methane hydrate scientists intend 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.999
 resume in 2013 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:51.899
 study areas are on cardboard 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:52.649
