the fours and that's it so I have this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.639 
the fours and that's it so I have this
dude<00:01:47.340> behind<00:01:47.520> me<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.420> he's<00:01:49.079> asking<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
dude behind me that is he's asking a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.139

bunch of people around him I guess they

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.179 
bunch of people around him I guess they
could<00:01:51.329> get<00:01:51.509> him<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> pair<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.979> whites

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
metaphor is that I thought were out of

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.429 
metaphor is that I thought were out of
my<00:05:12.729> hands<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.419> if<00:05:13.509> those<00:05:13.659> invisibility

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 
my hands and if those invisibility

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.320 
my hands and if those invisibility
cloaks<00:05:14.860> would<00:05:15.159> have<00:05:15.250> just<00:05:15.430> released<00:05:15.580> once<00:05:16.029> and

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
cloaks would have just released once and

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.480 
cloaks would have just released once and
not<00:05:16.449> restock<00:05:16.930> like<00:05:17.199> this<00:05:17.379> six<00:05:17.620> times<00:05:17.680> after<00:05:18.310> I

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
not restock like this six times after I

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.279 
not restock like this six times after I
really<00:05:18.849> think<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.479> price<00:05:19.689> would<00:05:19.870> be<00:05:19.930> a

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
really think that the price would be a

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.019 
really think that the price would be a
lot<00:05:20.680> higher<00:05:20.949> than<00:05:21.219> what<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:21.430> see<00:05:21.699> them<00:05:21.789> for

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.029 
lot higher than what you see them for

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.269 
lot higher than what you see them for
right<00:05:22.240> now<00:05:22.270> because<00:05:23.099> everybody<00:05:24.099> was

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
right now because everybody was

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:25.740 
right now because everybody was
regretting<00:05:24.639> not<00:05:24.819> picking<00:05:25.180> them<00:05:25.300> up<00:05:25.419> like

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
regretting not picking them up like

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.990 
regretting not picking them up like
after<00:05:26.199> they<00:05:26.289> first<00:05:26.770> released<00:05:26.979> they<00:05:27.729> once<00:05:27.909> they

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
after they first released they once they

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.969 
after they first released they once they
restock<00:05:28.509> I<00:05:28.750> feel<00:05:28.900> like<00:05:29.020> everybody<00:05:29.500> had<00:05:29.680> if<00:05:29.860> the
