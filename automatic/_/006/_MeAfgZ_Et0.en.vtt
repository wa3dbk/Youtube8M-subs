the contest to end like that but anyway

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.620 
the contest to end like that but anyway
what<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> contest<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
what do I think of the contest as a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.320 
what do I think of the contest as a
whole

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
whole

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.260 
whole
unfortunately<00:00:30.590> despite<00:00:31.610> what<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> predicted

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
unfortunately despite what I predicted

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.910 
unfortunately despite what I predicted
in<00:00:33.420> Raich<00:00:33.660> fest<00:00:33.960> 1<00:00:34.170> where<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:34.559> gonna<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.800> so

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
in Raich fest 1 where was gonna be so

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
in Raich fest 1 where was gonna be so
much<00:00:35.070> better<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.460> stuff<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:37.110> turned

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
much better and stuff it really turned

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.510 
much better and stuff it really turned
out<00:00:38.300> essentially<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.780> lot<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.200> sequels<00:00:40.739> do

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
out essentially like a lot of sequels do

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.590 
out essentially like a lot of sequels do
really<00:00:42.390> bad<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:44.300> not<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.719> great<00:00:47.510> that's<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
really bad and not that great that's a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.160 
really bad and not that great that's a
bit<00:00:48.750> redundant<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.850> guess<00:00:51.600> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
bit redundant but you know I guess it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
bit redundant but you know I guess it
was<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.590> expected<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:53.190> lot<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> people<00:00:53.820> who

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
was to be expected a lot of people who

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.610 
was to be expected a lot of people who
entered<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> contest<00:00:54.930> pulled<00:00:55.440> their

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
entered the contest pulled their

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.700 
entered the contest pulled their
submissions<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.750> are<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.350> putting

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
submissions and are going to be putting

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.060 
submissions and are going to be putting
it<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.010> Raich<00:00:59.520> fest<00:00:59.789> 3<00:01:00.090> most<00:01:00.359> likely<00:01:00.719> so

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
it in Raich fest 3 most likely so

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.479 
it in Raich fest 3 most likely so
despite<00:01:02.070> rage<00:01:02.280> fest<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.789> being<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.570> bust<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
despite rage fest to being a bust I

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.399 
despite rage fest to being a bust I
consider<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.000> prelude<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.960> rage

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
consider it more of a prelude to rage

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.320 
consider it more of a prelude to rage
Festus<00:01:07.830> area<00:01:08.010> which<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.369> predict<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
Festus area which I predict is going to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.289 
Festus area which I predict is going to
be<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.260> best<00:01:10.470> rate<00:01:10.740> fest<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.220> far<00:01:11.430> assuming

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
be the best rate fest so far assuming

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.510 
be the best rate fest so far assuming
people<00:01:12.840> don't<00:01:13.170> drop<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.799> flies<00:01:15.049> if<00:01:16.049> that

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
people don't drop out like flies if that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.789 
people don't drop out like flies if that
alec<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:18.810> metaphor<00:01:19.229> didn't<00:01:19.470> even<00:01:19.560> make

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
alec that metaphor didn't even make

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.310 
alec that metaphor didn't even make
sense<00:01:20.390> but<00:01:21.390> regardless<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:26.810> I'm<00:01:27.810> still

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
sense but regardless I I'm still

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.980 
sense but regardless I I'm still
