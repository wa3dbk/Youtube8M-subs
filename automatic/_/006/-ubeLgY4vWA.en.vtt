grill so I take the pork tongs and I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.250 
grill so I take the pork tongs and I
leave<00:02:49.550> them<00:02:49.760> sit<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.209> there<00:02:50.390> for<00:02:50.420> about<00:02:50.660> five

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
leave them sit in there for about five

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.229 
leave them sit in there for about five
to<00:02:51.590> seven<00:02:51.830> minutes<00:02:52.130> we<00:02:52.430> have<00:02:52.580> another<00:02:52.820> couple

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.350 
to seven minutes we have another couple
of<00:02:53.300> moments<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:55.010> tongues<00:02:55.310> will<00:02:56.000> get

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
of moments and the tongues will get

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
of moments and the tongues will get
really<00:02:56.840> really<00:02:57.670> red-hot<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.260> only<00:03:00.260> at<00:03:00.350> that

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
really really red-hot and only at that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.580 
really really red-hot and only at that
point<00:03:00.590> are<00:03:01.340> they<00:03:01.820> adequate<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:03.080> put<00:03:03.320> on<00:03:03.470> the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
point are they adequate to put on the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.680 
point are they adequate to put on the
bottle<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.190> you'll<00:03:04.520> see<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.940> all<00:03:05.000> done<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.600> a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
bottle and you'll see that all done in a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.330 
bottle and you'll see that all done in a
moment<00:03:09.100> okay

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
moment okay

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.180 
moment okay
I<00:03:10.370> am<00:03:10.670> reproaching<00:03:11.660> with<00:03:11.840> very<00:03:12.440> hot<00:03:12.769> four

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
I am reproaching with very hot four

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.509 
I am reproaching with very hot four
times<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.870> will<00:03:15.110> put<00:03:15.440> this<00:03:15.620> directly<00:03:15.890> on

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
times and I will put this directly on

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.000 
times and I will put this directly on
the<00:03:16.760> neck<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.269> bottle

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.050 

and<00:03:20.269> leave<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.450> there<00:03:21.720> for<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.170> moment<00:03:22.970> give<00:03:23.970> it

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
and leave it there for a moment give it

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.979 
and leave it there for a moment give it
a<00:03:24.180> chance<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.810> really<00:03:25.260> heat<00:03:26.159> up<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:28.200> neck<00:03:29.989> and

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
a chance to really heat up the neck and

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.550 
a chance to really heat up the neck and
make<00:03:31.260> an<00:03:31.440> impression<00:03:31.799> on

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.680 

the<00:03:34.950> bottle<00:03:35.340> itself<00:03:37.819> so<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:39.000> when<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.360> apply

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
the bottle itself so that when we apply

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.170 
the bottle itself so that when we apply
the<00:03:39.810> cold<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.860> will<00:03:40.980> see<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.670> hopefully

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
the cold you will see and hopefully

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.990 
the cold you will see and hopefully
you'll<00:03:42.569> be<00:03:42.630> able<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.080> hear<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:44.100> actual<00:03:44.340> crack

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
you'll be able to hear the actual crack

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.080 
you'll be able to hear the actual crack
as<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:46.560> fissure<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.069> we'll<00:03:47.490> be<00:03:47.850> able<00:03:47.940> to

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
as the fissure and we'll be able to

00:03:48.090 --> 00:04:18.120 
as the fissure and we'll be able to
separate<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.840> two<00:03:49.080> sides<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:50.340> bottle

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:26.150 

okay<00:04:18.910> that<00:04:19.180> should<00:04:19.420> be<00:04:19.480> plenty<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.110> time<00:04:23.070> okay

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.110 

now<00:04:27.160> we<00:04:27.280> take<00:04:27.580> our<00:04:28.230> cold<00:04:29.230> iced<00:04:29.710> towel<00:04:30.610> and

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
now we take our cold iced towel and

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.820 
now we take our cold iced towel and
place<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.440> right<00:04:32.740> around<00:04:32.920> that<00:04:33.250> bottle<00:04:33.760> and

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
place it right around that bottle and

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.710 
place it right around that bottle and
you<00:04:35.830> should<00:04:36.010> have<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.190> nice<00:04:36.490> crack<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.450> I<00:04:37.510> hope

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
you should have a nice crack and I hope

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.250 
you should have a nice crack and I hope
you<00:04:37.930> heard<00:04:38.080> that<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:40.000> two<00:04:40.210> parts<00:04:40.630> separate

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
you heard that the two parts separate

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.760 
you heard that the two parts separate
and<00:04:42.100> then<00:04:43.090> what<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.330> like<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:43.810> do<00:04:44.020> because<00:04:44.530> some

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
and then what I like to do because some

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.380 
and then what I like to do because some
people<00:04:45.070> are<00:04:45.190> a<00:04:45.220> little<00:04:45.400> concerned<00:04:46.060> about

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
people are a little concerned about

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.480 
people are a little concerned about
getting<00:04:46.780> glass<00:04:47.260> in<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.620> bottle<00:04:47.980> but<00:04:48.130> as<00:04:48.310> you

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
getting glass in the bottle but as you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.940 
getting glass in the bottle but as you
can<00:04:48.670> see<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.840> two<00:04:50.050> parts<00:04:50.410> are<00:04:50.500> pretty<00:04:50.770> well

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
can see the two parts are pretty well

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:59.170 
can see the two parts are pretty well
separated

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.129 

we<00:05:00.180> have<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.750> neck<00:05:02.030> with<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.270> capsule<00:05:03.900> and

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
we have the neck with the capsule and

the<00:05:04.740> cork<00:05:05.100> fully<00:05:05.759> intact<00:05:06.560> so<00:05:07.560> that<00:05:07.740> later<00:05:07.949> we

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
the cork fully intact so that later we

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.249 
the cork fully intact so that later we
can<00:05:08.280> remove<00:05:08.789> the<00:05:09.060> cork<00:05:09.449> so<00:05:09.780> if<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:09.990> have<00:05:10.110> any

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
what we're going to do now is to count

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.730 
what we're going to do now is to count
the<00:05:29.520> bottle

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
the bottle

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.290 
the bottle
through<00:05:32.740> some<00:05:32.980> cheesecloth<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:33.880> I<00:05:34.000> take<00:05:34.270> a

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
through some cheesecloth and I take a

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.210 
through some cheesecloth and I take a
piece<00:05:34.630> of<00:05:34.660> cheesecloth<00:05:35.350> and<00:05:35.620> I<00:05:35.680> doubled<00:05:36.130> it

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
piece of cheesecloth and I doubled it

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.150 
piece of cheesecloth and I doubled it
over<00:05:36.610> hold<00:05:37.390> on<00:05:37.540> a<00:05:37.570> second<00:05:37.990> honey<00:05:38.200> and<00:05:38.560> what

over hold on a second honey and what

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.940 
over hold on a second honey and what
this<00:05:39.340> does<00:05:39.640> it<00:05:40.030> allows<00:05:40.330> not<00:05:41.200> only<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:41.710> capture

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
this does it allows not only to capture

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.460 
this does it allows not only to capture
all<00:05:42.370> of<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.730> sediment<00:05:43.090> but<00:05:43.990> just<00:05:44.260> in<00:05:44.440> case

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
all of the sediment but just in case

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.250 
all of the sediment but just in case
there's<00:05:45.100> any<00:05:45.280> glass<00:05:45.730> shards<00:05:46.480> on<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.810> top<00:05:47.080> of

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
there's any glass shards on the top of

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.910 
there's any glass shards on the top of
the<00:05:47.350> bottle

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
the bottle

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.360 
the bottle
this<00:05:48.490> will<00:05:48.730> prevent<00:05:49.150> that<00:05:49.420> from<00:05:50.010> getting<00:05:51.010> into

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
this will prevent that from getting into

00:05:51.370 --> 00:06:01.490 
this will prevent that from getting into
your<00:05:52.060> decanter<00:05:52.840> come<00:05:53.530> up<00:05:53.650> here
