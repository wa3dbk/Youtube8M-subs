00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.319
 cd fingering gem uh, let's look at hammering won when playing the country's laws 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.309
 It's used in techniques. 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:15.179
 Uh lead to a unique colorful play of the three-finger ring 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.180
 In addition to hammering overlapping circles that little bit more to upgrade 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.720
 Google is more beautiful, but I'm using it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.590
 Hasineunge too often you can not tell me iteunikka appropriate use 3 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.359
 good 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.500
 Once I've decorated my words in the first code word takes our 10-skiing 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.430
 Except when fingering the practice once I knew straight line pattern 23 times 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.590
 I'll try. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:43.489
 Where to look over the open part of the week in the middle of writing characters h 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.489
 Yes, as a four-day press of an open press 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.399
 The important thing here is that since the guitar's chord is resting, 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.539
 Back down 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:02.469
 It means that you need to make a sense of stability by constructing the openness code . 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:06.089
 At that moment, because it is ornamental, 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.089
 Because it can be heard as a mixture of meaning 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.830
 That means we have to get down again. Let's take a look at the next one. 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.340
 c Code Wearing Keyboard C code 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.330
 From 0% to 1 press this week 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.060
 We are playing here. On the contrary , 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.060
 I'll have to keep the Dodo. 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.530
 Continue right, then give up, because the poison is not composed of Mr. code c 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.530
 You have to hold down 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:48.310
 Now let's see the d7 pod. 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.200
 You can see. 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.200
 In line 1, press 0% slowly, and head to head today. 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.140
 If the sound insulation is not a constituent sound of the d7 code 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.520
 This week's configuration is due to be held down 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.520
 That's where I decorate 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.060
 And then again, the first part of the g code. 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.060
 The same 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.800
 I'll try playing four of them. 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.800
 5 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.070
