00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 and the dishes are from 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.719
 the yucatan peninsula have traits and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.519
 very special features derived 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.700
 of the history that the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.949
 states that make it today I encouraged myself to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.480
 cooking a stuffed cheese to me I have 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.880
 said that the women that we live in 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.270
 this state we must learn to do 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.240
 this delicious recipe is with me 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.670
 the stuffed cheese was a creation of the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.890
 Yucatecans , however, due to the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.370
 closeness that Quintana roo has with the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.070
 neighboring state of Yucatan here also 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.070
 I usually eat it this dish is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.809
 European influence we have from the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820
 sauce the cabbage that is very similar has not 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.540
 done wrong until the cheese ingredient 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.330
 of the meats 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.700
 these are some traits that left us 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.460
 the colonies that there was good here that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.790
 stepped on this European food depends on 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 a fundamental ingredient the famous 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.280
 Ball cheese that is combined with others 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.160
 ingredients first we must dig the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.720
 cheese until it looks like a pot 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.149
 well after doing the cheese dump 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.310
 now let's sew the meat that is 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.610
 one of the most important points in 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.140
 this chef recipe how it is done is 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.660
 let's start by putting in a pan a 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.950
 little fat butter fat 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.630
 add onion garlic and on the meat a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.069
 Once the meat is fried , 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.330
 Integrates the almonds raisins olives 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:35.530
 capers and season 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.760
 with cinnamon clove oregano and eating it 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.650
 mix all this until it 's okay 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.320
 fried and the hard-boiled egg is 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.380
 after our meat is already well 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.080
 cooked and mixed is time to fill 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.810
 the cheese to then wrap it in 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.900
 our blanket from the sky and place it 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.680
 for 20 minutes in a pot with a bath 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.460
 Mary and here is our cheese 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.600
 filling now the presentation is 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.170
 indispensable so this dish 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.900
 it is served with two sauces one of cabbage that 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.420
 goes under the cheese and the tomato 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.060
 it is served on the saucer 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.250
 finished my stuffed cheese and I'm with 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.410

 You can get married very well but the doubt 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.640
 He did not stay in me and I wanted to know what 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.180
 My fellow Aztecs thought 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.180
 Quintana Roo 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.910
 proof exceeded the stuffed cheese too 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.450
 it's part of those unmatched flavors 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.330
