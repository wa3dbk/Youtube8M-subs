00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
channel out of all the nerve reviews I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.880 
channel out of all the nerve reviews I
think<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.050> probably<00:00:28.349> one<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> best

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
think this is probably one of the best

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.189 
think this is probably one of the best
guns<00:00:29.240> really<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.570> good<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.960> shoots

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
guns really really good this shoots

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.340 
guns really really good this shoots
almost<00:00:31.650> upset<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.009> think<00:00:32.070> about<00:00:32.579> 35<00:00:33.300> 35<00:00:34.020> feet<00:00:34.230> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
almost upset I think about 35 35 feet I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.610 
almost upset I think about 35 35 feet I
think<00:00:34.590> yeah<00:00:34.860> some<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.750> ready<00:00:36.750> set<00:00:36.960> I'd

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
think yeah some like that ready set I'd

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.139 
think yeah some like that ready set I'd
say<00:00:37.890> she's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> more<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.670> 60<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> 50<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.200> maybe

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
say she's a more like 60 to 50 but maybe

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.040 
say she's a more like 60 to 50 but maybe
so<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.360> buy<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.570> comes<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> 18
