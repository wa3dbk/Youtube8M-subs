00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 well then says after reassembling the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 spiral we also reassemble the barbell 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.250
 complete is on the bridge 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:21.810
 take the bridge lubricate it 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:24.300
 we publish the sheath dress then before the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.960
 replacement remember to check 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.980
 that the vine is completely above 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.160
 outside the seat of the painter 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:40.190
 is inverted, the barbell I recommend 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.070
 precision in assembly 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.090
 also because you remember that then the ear 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.860
 the first explained inside the 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.059
 of the two guides for the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.059
 adjustment so do it very calmly 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.989
 place it positioned well and in place 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.510
 direction of the opening 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.510
 triangular for the python 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.840
 here is the pedestrian to the datum in seat raised 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.310
 slowly the barbell without 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.380
 flip only to check that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.410
 the spire is in the perfect sweet la 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.020
 plug in the guides to getting it to me so 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.510
 I recommend it is very athletic deity not 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.100
 let us go off the flyer from the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.570
 bridge I recommend you do a lot 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.970
 be careful to take the screwdriver 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.430
 place it only on the screw e 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.240
 rotate the a31 only supported you don't have to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.100
 absolutely press because if you exit 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.580
 out of the cut of life could 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.690
 go to ruin then spiral 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.830
 I rested it only and rotated this far 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.830
 from a lifetime we will get stuck 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.090
 here it is 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.370
 very well friends at this point the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.609
 mounted barbell we have slightly 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.689
 let's check that the challenge is in the two 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:34.870
 perfect guides then at this point no 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:40.180
 it remains for us to postpone the barbell is 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.790
 verify that everything works well friends 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.540
 then completed the assembly of the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.250
 We need only check the balance 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.219
 the whole 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.909
 then at this point we already have 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:57.040
 classified the ruby ​​bridge dress yes 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.189
 he also called the ruby ​​of the plateau 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.459
 a small oil kitchen to avoid 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.379
 any kind of friction with online with 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.699
 the correct and then we move a 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:14.319
 put the bar in place we put the 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:19.120
 movement and between movement on 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:22.150
 support and reassemble in b read fairies 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.009
 attention in replacement specially 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.620
 allam assassinating first tends to 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:32.079
 under the wheel center and attention 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.900
 pay close attention to the spiral e 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.199
 obviously address the ruby ​​of the dl 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.229
 look towards the nco read look at the 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:43.389
 shift read move from this 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:46.449
 side so let's go to address 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:49.829
 passing the wheel under the center wheel 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:52.329
 barbell and by inserting into the 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:57.069
 rubinho 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:04:03.370
 we leave the bridge we address with the 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:06.370
 screw bush if you look 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.169
 jacques chirac was slightly squill yes 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.419
 medical anchor moves then 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.629
 we lower slightly with a lot 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.910
 delicacy a clock and drain 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.700
 that watch does not 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:22.920
 it still doesn't work we always have to 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.920
 make sure before giving the charge 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:34.720
 perfect fine at this point 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:38.590
 we reassemble the vine we live without 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.740
 restrict it too well 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:46.510
 point it remains only to give us the rope 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.430
 to and see a little bit as bad 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.100
 let's see if the clock starts 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.290
 look at the clock its starting a 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.560
 scillaazione we gave a couple of 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.490
 giri remember clear plan let's load 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.330
 practically a goal of the clock 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.410
 we see that it is the scilla action is more 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.620
 wide and hanging a very good one 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:14.100
 oscillation we see the spiral that has 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.070
 excellent oscillation as well 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:22.270
 an extension of the same for us 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:25.500
 we continue to load load at the 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.290
 maximum and we see that 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.550
 and barbell took an excellent one 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.470
 as you can well see oscillation with 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.400
 the same spiral that expands so 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.060
 perfect fine that enemies and for me it is 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.040
 a beautiful 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:46.310
 a great satisfaction in doing these 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:52.290
 work we did a job that is 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:58.020
 quite complex and I hope this 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:00.570
 video is for you all to try 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.340
 experience this with this 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.180
 type of repair or the axis of the 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.000
 barbell was repair 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.210
 let's say more important than a watch 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.830
 so I urge you to try your hand 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:19.590
 certainly watching the video is better 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.950
 if you start with big clocks e 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:28.080
 best pocket watches to have 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:29.610
 more easily the feedback with the 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.440
 video I made 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.250
 also because the pieces being larger 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.570
 TV will be easier to do the job 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.500
 very well my dear friends as usual 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:44.870
 I thank you for your attention and to 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.870
 soon to hear from other videos
