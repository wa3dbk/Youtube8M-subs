00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:10.160
 friend in a rather rude way here 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.210
 to start the s10 test there singer 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.549
 explaining has already been explained in the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.740
 comments from milks munhoz vice 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.990
 President and also of Carlos Barba 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.060
 is the purpose of the relevant market 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.420
 they explained that singing is up to me 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.369
 analyze the dynamic part of the field here 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
 that it is nothing more than s10 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.740
 with some evolutions some exchanges of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.410
 busts two people in order to make it one 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.050
 even safer in curves 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 some calibration readjustments of the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.600
 pensions are what they have also 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.640
 income in making hayden and comfort 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.950
 even better gait 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.960
 he was beaten now by his at 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.480
 We care about the defender Carlos Beard and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.320
 also by Samuel Gold I know what is the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.840
 marketing director of gm but what the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.480
 explanations for us is that we end up in the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.570
 practice with them will initiate the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.150
 Ours we disagree I disagree on 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.000
 a lot of practice and I usually 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.549
 to disagree with marketing as much as 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.250
 that I analyze vehicle in the chat 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.409
 practice of dynamic runway 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.299
 vehicle matters a lot and here I 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.900
 I explained to see you that the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.710
 1 the track of a get 4 thousand and 300 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.650
 meters 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.140
 she can simply simulate almost 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.020
 all conditions of use second 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.979
 tremendous that more than popcorn is the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.990
 conditions of use that we find in 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.119
 and dark tiled floors in the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.880
 Brazil I 'm walking a subject here 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.590
 completely uneven curves in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.960
 irregular asphalt are curved 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.780
 very dangerous for the average driver 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.090
 it can be betrayed by its quality and 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.610
 taken to set the trajectory for example 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.070
 an excessive jump in pensions and we 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.189
 we remind you that every vehicle with a bucket 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.790
 from triplicate hazard potential 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.310
 because the weight of the unloaded hopper 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.180
 one that the vehicle is carrying is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.420
 one is one is something that can lead to 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.860
 loss of a directional trajectory that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.780
 will know the directional 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.570
 here we dine for example already here it is 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.360
 the best that is already the perfect asphalt and 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.250
 I see ks 10 continues that vehicle 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.400
 helped by the stability program 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.590
 which is essential for vehicles with 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.810
 mainly and I'm using 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.700
 here simply the automatic gearbox 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.290
 so I'll have to stay a little longer 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.120
 in the curb because the curves of life is a 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.800
 are dark 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.600
 I'm here paying attention to everyone 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.730
 the details because the first vehicle 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.720
 Second only that it is not expensive 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.360
 sporty 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.830
 I already walked here on this track of 1 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.170
 forcing the bar a few 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.290
 genii line cars 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.140
 vectra walked the line do and years and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.060
 years I do tests here on g1 and 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.810
 also on the high-speed track that 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.790
 imitate an infinite line is here and similar 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 an infinite line where I've already been converting 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.060
 there are 271 times in parabolic curve 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.640
 will cling to the wall by force 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.640
 always pw and throw the car against the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.989
 and he joins here he has on the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.090
 high speed 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.640
 two walls that are truly a 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.110
 wall that informal which is to test the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.200
 episode resistance 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.510
 Good, I'm still on my way. 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.390
 my opinion on the s10 although it is 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.100
 a metal body that we agree on is not 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.680
 but is fully malleable 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.540
 full eh eh eh eh a dunga it 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.510
 was conducted in a totally 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.019
 sure and always remembering that 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.970
 these rich people always remember made of tite 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.940
 carry a bucket 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.160
 they demanded very great respect from 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.470
 who is not accustomed to dealing 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.870
 complicated then sailors of 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.820
 first stay stay you have to open 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.890
 the eye because a car can also 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.769
 have the vehicle that can have a reaction 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.800
 as much as surprising in curve 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.720
 in person 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.640
 the mantra quito you see that it makes a 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.600
 good job extension, let's go there tava 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.120
 empty 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.239
 the vehicle does not leave the path even 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.180
 dark floors that gives one and this is a 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.850
 merit and it is very comfortable a 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.070
 fairly accurate direction have improved 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.600
 here too the measure rod is 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.640
 improve another group as 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.100
 regularize the suspension has more to 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.410
 guarantee to the sun and the direction of the measure 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.810
 certainty is not overly 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.610
 large is a direction of the exact size 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.740
 for backup and with assistance 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.400
 very precise electrohydraulic 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.860
 it is not does not disconnect it at all 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.230
 pavement pickup you have to feel 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.750
 the floor mainly on the vehicle 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.360
 to become a 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.280
 safe driving came up twisting here 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.620
 told me that we are in a 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.260
 circuit of 4 meters 4 thousand meters and 300 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.690
 that totally sinuous it aims 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.130
 precisely here for the pilots of 10 only 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.350
 it gives a task a car - 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.480
 they go to very high limits to know 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.790
 what are the limits of pensions is 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.669
 test day and the drivers of 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.040
 10 to 18 and 24 hours a day this is 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.770
 three courses here from eight o'clock they 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.810
 are constantly running on these 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.540
 thesis tracks and they by anyone 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.330
 looks like all the technology in the 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.720
 calibration there are engineers make 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.360
 testing is in practice they will feel the 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.760
 body feeling dre motor vehicle 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.980
 gradually adjusting the brake 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.080
 suspensions steering system 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.660
 still in the auto industry a 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.000
 human factor is fundamental added 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.580
 on the broken asphalt only for the 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.590
 egypt by that tremendous now dimensions 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.240
 but without losing its traditional 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.100
 very important that is the human factor 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.840
 Just as I'm feeling car 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.540
 for test engineering for a 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.850
 the automaker's engineering is fundamental to 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.669
 last word on the line of the vehicle 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.560
 assembly giver is not the theft or the 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.390
 electronic computer brain is the 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.060
 man himself is an experienced man 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:13.150
 experienced engineer who felt the car 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.770
 and regulates and calibrates the should arrive 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.380
 in an appropriate market 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.380
 then we end our test a s10 of 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.760
 track of a kind as I say it simulates 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.070
 all types of flooring and has 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.600
 Brazil here in the complex and 10 of the jomotos 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.600
