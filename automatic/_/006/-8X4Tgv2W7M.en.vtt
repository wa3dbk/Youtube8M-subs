 because it comes out lilac black screen and so on 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.460

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.390
 we remove and finally 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.040
 and finally 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.040
 we bring these drawings 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.270

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.270
 so designate everything and I have 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.770
 now 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.770
 we open 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.879
 already works of which we have a 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.879
 departure 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.880
 of equal 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.249
 we give to pulling world 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.910
 segovia you 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.160
 your children are worth 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:26.040
 because once inside we go to the air 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.260
 and he knows all these new things then 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.600
 all from outside the editing model 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:36.030
 activated you can now be at any 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:40.970
 mode and why it's called get book that 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.970
 we just have to look for it here, it's worth 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.970
 a book that we know good is very 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.720
 easy to create if you do not know how to create it 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:55.330
 you take a normal book and you get red 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.710
 squid ticket 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.080
 doing this 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.930
 we take a wench spend or do not put and 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.180
 we take 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.360
 I tried 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.430
 and a book speaks to us in the book we give 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.850
 to the right button and with the wheel of the 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.530
 mouse 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.590
 we are going to change and we can find 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.280
 anything seen one well 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.759
 So, against anything, if not 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.759
 you know how to 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.409
 and this was the simple way for 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.479
 you see that the mode works and then the 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.809
 two things and no black screen or 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.119
 milan and look or anything if there is any 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:40.569
 problem you tell me investigated and I do a 

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:45.139
