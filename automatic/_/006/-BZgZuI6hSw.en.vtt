00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
future ahead of them we'll break down

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.779 
future ahead of them we'll break down
his<00:00:20.520> swing<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.029> see<00:00:21.990> if<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.710> can't<00:00:22.949> take

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
his swing and see if you can't take

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.980 
his swing and see if you can't take
something<00:00:23.820> away<00:00:24.150> from<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.750> hopefully

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
something away from this and hopefully

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.560 
something away from this and hopefully
apply<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.650> your<00:00:25.769> game<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.130> well<00:00:26.449> so<00:00:27.449> we

basic stance balanced hands high pretty
straightforward<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:36.260> then<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.680> play

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920

forward you see starts to prepare this
is<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.850> call<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.210> load<00:00:42.480> face<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.110> he's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
important it will help him generate

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
important it will help him generate
power<00:01:12.920> through<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> ball<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:17.040> he<00:01:17.250> brings

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
foot at this point his weight is pretty

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.910 
foot at this point his weight is pretty
evenly<00:01:28.680> distributed<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.439> as<00:01:31.439> soon<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:31.799> he

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
evenly distributed and as soon as he

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.730 
evenly distributed and as soon as he
that<00:01:32.759> front<00:01:33.090> foot<00:01:33.450> lands<00:01:36.020> will<00:01:37.020> start<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> see

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that front foot lands will start to see

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.399 
that front foot lands will start to see
his<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:39.060> foot<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.780> hips<00:01:40.079> start<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
his back foot and this hips start to

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.850 
his back foot and this hips start to
rotate<00:01:41.720> now<00:01:42.720> I'm<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> draw<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> line<00:01:43.530> here

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
rotate now I'm going to draw a line here

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.179 
rotate now I'm going to draw a line here
cut<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.250> through<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> center<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.450> trout

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
cut right through the center of trout

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.539 
cut right through the center of trout
and<00:01:47.189> you'll<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:49.170> his<00:01:49.409> hips<00:01:49.740> will<00:01:50.280> rotate

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
and you'll see that his hips will rotate

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.060 
and you'll see that his hips will rotate
pretty<00:01:51.119> much<00:01:51.270> exactly<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.409> line<00:01:52.680> through

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
pretty much exactly on this line through

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.770 
pretty much exactly on this line through
the<00:01:53.159> pitch<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.649> exactly<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.780> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the pitch and this is exactly what you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.880 
the pitch and this is exactly what you
want<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.110> see<00:01:58.369> in<00:01:59.369> any<00:01:59.549> hitter<00:01:59.820> at<00:02:00.000> any<00:02:00.149> age<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
want to see in any hitter at any age is

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.249 
want to see in any hitter at any age is
him<00:02:01.890> kind<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.250> pivoting<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.659> point

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
him kind of pivoting on it on a point

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.050 
him kind of pivoting on it on a point
and<00:02:04.640> rotating<00:02:05.640> right<00:02:06.060> around<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:07.879> this<00:02:08.879> is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and rotating right around that this is

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.190 
and rotating right around that this is
how<00:02:09.179> trout<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.629> going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:09.959> able<00:02:10.050> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
how trout is going to be able to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.610 
how trout is going to be able to
generate<00:02:10.590> his<00:02:11.250> power

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
generate his power

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.830 
generate his power
and<00:02:13.180> contact<00:02:14.180> through<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.450> zone<00:02:15.069> by<00:02:16.069> spinning

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and contact through the zone by spinning

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.740 
and contact through the zone by spinning
right<00:02:17.840> around<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.379> point<00:02:19.480> now<00:02:20.480> another

right around this point now another

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.440

interesting thing to note is his back

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.750 
interesting thing to note is his back
foot<00:02:23.780> now<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.590> hear<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.860> lot<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.099> coaches<00:02:25.550> talk

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
foot now you hear a lot of coaches talk

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.750 
foot now you hear a lot of coaches talk
about<00:02:26.030> squishing<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.989> bug<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:28.280> basically

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
about squishing the bug and basically

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.690 
about squishing the bug and basically
turning<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.629> back<00:02:29.989> foot<00:02:30.290> around<00:02:30.739> but<00:02:31.580> you'll

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
turning that back foot around but you'll

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.160 
turning that back foot around but you'll
see<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.000> trout<00:02:32.660> actually<00:02:34.569> picks<00:02:35.569> his<00:02:35.870> foot

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
see that trout actually picks his foot

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.059 
see that trout actually picks his foot
up<00:02:36.319> slightly<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.599> moves<00:02:38.599> it<00:02:38.780> forward<00:02:39.049> you<00:02:39.920> can

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
up slightly and moves it forward you can

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.309 
up slightly and moves it forward you can
see<00:02:40.099> with<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.580> circle<00:02:41.030> there<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.420> this<00:02:42.260> is

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
see with the circle there and this is

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.520 
see with the circle there and this is
fairly<00:02:43.220> common<00:02:43.700> among<00:02:44.090> all<00:02:44.299> major<00:02:45.260> league

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
fairly common among all major league

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.270 
fairly common among all major league
hitters<00:02:46.480> they're<00:02:47.480> not<00:02:47.660> going<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.019> keep<00:02:49.010> that

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
hitters they're not going to keep that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.350 
hitters they're not going to keep that
back<00:02:49.519> foot<00:02:49.819> right<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.930> ground<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.349> spin

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
back foot right in the ground and spin

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.110 
back foot right in the ground and spin
because<00:02:53.360> your<00:02:53.720> weight<00:02:53.900> has<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.170> be<00:02:55.120> balanced

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
because your weight has to be balanced

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.970 
because your weight has to be balanced
and<00:02:56.329> slightly<00:02:56.810> forward<00:02:57.290> as<00:02:57.410> you're<00:02:57.620> swinging

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
and slightly forward as you're swinging

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.979 
and slightly forward as you're swinging
through<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.400> ball<00:02:58.640> if<00:02:58.819> it's<00:02:58.970> fall<00:02:59.810> your

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
through the ball if it's fall your

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.240 
through the ball if it's fall your
weight<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.319> in<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.500> back<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.920> you're<00:03:01.010> turning

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
weight is in the back and you're turning

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.819 
weight is in the back and you're turning
off<00:03:01.340> your<00:03:01.519> back<00:03:01.670> foot<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:03.319> know<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:03.709> be

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
off your back foot you know I can be

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.259 
off your back foot you know I can be
able<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.129> really<00:03:04.400> drive<00:03:04.670> through<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> ball

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
able to really drive through the ball

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.280 
able to really drive through the ball
which<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:06.370> obviously<00:03:07.370> something<00:03:07.819> that<00:03:07.849> trout

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
which is obviously something that trout

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.910 
which is obviously something that trout
does<00:03:09.290> very<00:03:09.590> well<00:03:11.470> something<00:03:12.470> else<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.890> note

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
does very well something else to note

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.420 
does very well something else to note
here<00:03:13.610> is<00:03:14.650> does<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.739> really<00:03:15.920> good<00:03:16.160> job<00:03:16.370> of

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
here is does a really good job of

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.720 
here is does a really good job of
getting<00:03:16.760> his<00:03:16.970> hands<00:03:17.269> inside<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.200> ball<00:03:18.730> this

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
getting his hands inside the ball this

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.750 
getting his hands inside the ball this
is<00:03:19.940> probably<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.829> pitch<00:03:21.829> on<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.130> inner<00:03:22.370> third

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
is probably a pitch on the inner third

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.220 
is probably a pitch on the inner third
of<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.060> plate<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:25.489> can<00:03:25.639> see<00:03:25.910> that<00:03:26.480> trout<00:03:26.930> you

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
of the plate you can see that trout you

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.190 
of the plate you can see that trout you
know<00:03:27.410> his<00:03:27.680> arm<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.310> almost<00:03:28.519> in<00:03:28.849> a<00:03:28.970> 90<00:03:29.840> degree

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
know his arm is almost in a 90 degree

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.270 
know his arm is almost in a 90 degree
angle<00:03:30.230> there<00:03:32.410> just<00:03:33.410> as<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.590> really<00:03:33.829> good<00:03:34.040> job

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
know as we take a look at trout

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.589 
know as we take a look at trout
certainly<00:04:21.729> got<00:04:22.729> a<00:04:22.760> bright<00:04:23.030> future<00:04:23.060> ahead<00:04:23.390> of

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
certainly got a bright future ahead of

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:24.670 
certainly got a bright future ahead of
them<00:04:23.719> and

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
them and

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.800 
them and
we'll<00:04:25.680> see<00:04:25.940> we'll<00:04:26.940> see<00:04:26.970> what<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.390> can<00:04:27.510> do<00:04:27.630> this

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
we'll see we'll see what you can do this

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.990 
we'll see we'll see what you can do this
year
