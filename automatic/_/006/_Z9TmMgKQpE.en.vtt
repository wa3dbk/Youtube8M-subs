competitive flurry who is celebrating

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.250 
competitive flurry who is celebrating
his<00:00:23.340> certification<00:00:23.880> process<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.660> very<00:00:24.960> common

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
his certification process is very common

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.380 
his certification process is very common
so<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.560> actually<00:00:25.859> there<00:00:26.580> are<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.119> many

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
so on actually there are so many

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.660 
so on actually there are so many
certifications<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.769> already<00:00:29.460> not

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
certifications and it's already not

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
certifications and it's already not
clear<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:30.929> watch<00:00:31.170> so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
clear what is a really good watch so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.830 
clear what is a really good watch so
when<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> put<00:00:31.859> certification<00:00:32.759> upon<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
when you put certification upon that it

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.229 
when you put certification upon that it
makes<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> things<00:00:35.460> very<00:00:35.730> unclear

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
makes really of the things very unclear

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.090 
makes really of the things very unclear
for<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> customers<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.980> say

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
for the customers what you have to say

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
for the customers what you have to say
about<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> fqf<00:00:38.850> certification<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.809> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
about the fqf certification is that it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.220 
about the fqf certification is that it
is<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.950> most<00:00:41.629> demanding<00:00:42.629> segregation

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
is one of the most demanding segregation

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.049 
is one of the most demanding segregation
even<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.649> most<00:00:43.860> demanding<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.850> test

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
even the most demanding because it test

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.729 
even the most demanding because it test
is<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> whole<00:00:45.600> watch<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.079> must<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.350> beautiful

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
is the whole watch it must be beautiful

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.580 
is the whole watch it must be beautiful
and<00:00:47.280> reliable<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.420> make<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> simple<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.320> short

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and reliable to make it simple and short

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950 
and reliable to make it simple and short
but<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.370> also<00:00:50.550> very<00:00:51.000> demanding<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.899> terms

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
but it is also very demanding in terms

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
but it is also very demanding in terms
of<00:00:52.230> codes<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> brands<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.670> takes

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
of codes for the brands because it takes

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
of codes for the brands because it takes
a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.030> time<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> invest<00:00:55.500> into

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
a lot of time they have to invest into

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.189 
a lot of time they have to invest into
many<00:00:56.329> aspects<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> production<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
many aspects of the production of the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.080 
many aspects of the production of the
watch<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> conception<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.699> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
watch at the conception as the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.450 
watch at the conception as the
production<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> process<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.890> testing<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
production as the process of testing the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.700 
production as the process of testing the
watches<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.780> make<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
watches and all of this make that a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.700 
watches and all of this make that a
paradox<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.790> somehow<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.720> F<00:01:06.930> curve<00:01:07.200> watches

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
paradox and somehow the F curve watches

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
paradox and somehow the F curve watches
are<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.340> long<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:09.869> long<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
are very long to get a very long to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.649 
are very long to get a very long to
establish<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> create<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.479> stick

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
establish and create so this is to stick

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.450 
establish and create so this is to stick
a<00:01:12.689> lid<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.320> F<00:01:13.470> curve<00:01:13.740> certification

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
a lid about the F curve certification

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039 
a lid about the F curve certification
but<00:01:14.580> what<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> amazing<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
but what is amazing about this

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.990 
but what is amazing about this
certification<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.920> Switzerland<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
certification is Switzerland is that you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.999 
certification is Switzerland is that you
have<00:01:18.119> segregation<00:01:18.750> inflow<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.770> little

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
have segregation inflow a a little

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
have segregation inflow a a little
village<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> Couture<00:01:21.090> initiative<00:01:21.600> where

have also to touch to get certification
and<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.040> new<00:01:29.310> certification

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and you have now a new certification

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.719 
and you have now a new certification
from<00:01:30.540> Omega<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.619> metas<00:01:31.979> there<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.520> just

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
from Omega with the metas there we just

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.969 
from Omega with the metas there we just
we<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.030> her<00:01:33.299> learn<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.530> only<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
we just her learn about that only a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.090 
we just her learn about that only a
couple<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.340> days<00:01:35.460> ago<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:37.229> kind<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.890> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
couple of days ago and it's kind of it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.210 
couple of days ago and it's kind of it
was<00:01:38.250> initiated<00:01:38.850> by<00:01:39.270> Omega<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.470> yeah<00:01:40.950> exactly

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
was initiated by Omega so yeah exactly

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.370 
was initiated by Omega so yeah exactly
it<00:01:41.520> makes<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.000> Omega<00:01:42.600> started<00:01:43.200> something

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it makes that Omega started something

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.350 
it makes that Omega started something
with<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.979> Swiss<00:01:44.189> government<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
with the Swiss government in the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.050 
with the Swiss government in the
Institute<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.049> metronomy<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.880> it's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
Institute for metronomy and so it's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.850 
Institute for metronomy and so it's
really<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> very<00:01:48.420> important<00:01:49.020> level<00:01:49.170> another

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
really a very important level another

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.980 
really a very important level another
one<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.340> new

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
one a new

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.170 
one a new
and<00:01:51.080> what<00:01:51.799> could<00:01:52.280> be<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.430> little<00:01:52.610> difficult<00:01:52.880> for

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
and what could be a little difficult for

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.520 
and what could be a little difficult for
the<00:01:53.240> customer<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.750> at<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.020> end<00:01:54.170> he<00:01:54.229> have

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
the customer is at the end he have

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.530 
the customer is at the end he have
plenty<00:01:54.799> of<00:01:54.979> labels<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.150> have<00:01:56.240> all<00:01:56.479> of

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
plenty of labels that you have all of

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.510 
plenty of labels that you have all of
them<00:01:56.930> are<00:01:57.140> good<00:01:57.440> but<00:01:57.740> they<00:01:57.860> don't<00:01:57.890> don't<00:01:58.310> test

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
them are good but they don't don't test

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.700 
them are good but they don't don't test
everything<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.300> could<00:01:59.869> create<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.350> little

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
everything and could create a little

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.850 
everything and could create a little
mess<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:01.430> what<00:02:01.820> we<00:02:02.000> hope<00:02:02.180> is<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.420> these<00:02:03.380> said

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
mess so what we hope is that these said

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.710 
mess so what we hope is that these said
this<00:02:04.369> certification<00:02:04.700> will<00:02:05.300> be<00:02:05.450> better

jeweler to fry en use also and you can
still<00:02:55.310> feel<00:02:55.519> it

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
still feel it

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.880 
still feel it
with<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.269> certification<00:02:56.630> which<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.260> in<00:02:57.680> my

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
with this certification which is in my

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.039 
with this certification which is in my
opinion<00:02:58.070> some<00:02:58.790> kind<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.120> somehow<00:02:59.360> the

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
opinion some kind of somehow the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.220 
opinion some kind of somehow the
weakness<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:01.489> specification<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.480> then

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
weakness of the specification and then

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.960 
weakness of the specification and then
there<00:03:03.530> are<00:03:03.620> even<00:03:03.799> brands<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.549> have<00:03:04.610> their

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
there are even brands that have their

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.240 
there are even brands that have their
own<00:03:05.090> certification<00:03:05.690> process<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:06.769> affiliate

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
own certification process but affiliate

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.670 
own certification process but affiliate
for<00:03:07.459> instance<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.110> guess<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.440> makes<00:03:09.620> a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
for instance so it I guess it makes a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.500 
for instance so it I guess it makes a
little<00:03:09.890> bit<00:03:09.980> complicated<00:03:10.280> but<00:03:10.850> at<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.480> end

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
little bit complicated but at the end

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.120 
little bit complicated but at the end
it's<00:03:11.870> all<00:03:12.110> good<00:03:12.320> for<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.620> customer<00:03:13.010> because

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
it's all good for the customer because

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.830 
it's all good for the customer because
it's<00:03:13.489> really<00:03:13.880> growing<00:03:14.180> your<00:03:14.420> week<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.630> mean

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
it's really growing your week I mean

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.930 
it's really growing your week I mean
putting<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.769> level<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.130> bit<00:03:16.280> higher<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.910> the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
putting the level a bit higher of the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.660 
putting the level a bit higher of the

really every element of the watch so in
a<00:03:25.190> mean<00:03:25.310> it's<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.730> good<00:03:25.940> thing<00:03:26.209> it's<00:03:26.480> just

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
a mean it's it's a good thing it's just

understand it so we'll see about that in
a<00:03:32.090> couple<00:03:32.299> of<00:03:32.450> years<00:03:32.660> how<00:03:33.170> that<00:03:33.410> has<00:03:33.859> evolved
