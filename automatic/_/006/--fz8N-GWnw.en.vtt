00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.370
 hello my name is nadine I continue 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.920
 I'm independent because off demonstrator 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.439
 in in my video today i want to 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.630
 my swap for the awards travel 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:21.169
 imagine that it's this little mini 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.220
 album and the minimum I have done 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:28.039
 with the help of the punch selected pendant 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.550
 for such an album needs the all 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:36.290
 first time a piece of cardboard in the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.000
 size 2 x 11 in the dimensions for this 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.060
 piece I have chosen him because it 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.980
 After that, punching is easier 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:49.270
 trough here in the state has in fact 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.420
 a size of exactly 2 inches and therefore 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.700
 we work with in chips just so 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.730
 here it needs next 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.790
 simple god or another wrong 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.890
 partie after what you have at home 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.170
 I've been here at 4 and at 7 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.070
 In. Put a mark on it 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.560
 make sense for me with my case 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.320
 Pen after I left the paper above 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.620
 If I have laid flush in the corner 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.170
 then at 4 inches and 7 already 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.170
 inbetween always at every half in 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.120
 that's what you want if you have to 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.690
 everything you can then the leaf 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.690
 put it away again 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.830
 next you take the punch and 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.830
 punch both sides 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.640
 that is actually already the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.520
 Main work has been for the envelope and 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.980
 although he only needs the here now 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.840
 whole if lines again by chance 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.550
 are 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.170
 So I know that then just around 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.930
 I 've already done that 27 times today 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.880
 I now have exercise then it is all over 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.170
 just again with the price at after 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.250
 wrong and then you have the the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.170
 Foundation for your album already finished in 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.690
 this album would come in 4 1 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.960
 leaves the few leaves all have 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.060
 a size of four and a half times 16 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.650
 centimeter you already realize here I am 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.280
 gone back in the centimeter because 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.800
 I feel more comfortable with that 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.100
 the paper these four strips you 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.940
 in the format 45 x 16 centimeters 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.000
 then cut at 8 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.570
 centimeter exactly in the middle 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.520
 folded that ever prepared and 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.470
 we have to do that now with double-sided 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.190
 we provide this in the tape 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.350
 can stick album purely 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.290
 to you do when two of the four inlaid 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.489
 leaves on both sides one 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.470
 and the other two 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.310
 you do it only on one side respectively 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.310
 a tape 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:45.989
 that is the one with the double and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.180
 now we do one with only one 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:59.549
 always adhere to the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:04:01.920
 folded knew how to glue and how you 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.629
 I know that on cooking programs 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.480
 already prepared something so I have 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.450
 now here two scroll from the insert 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.769
 which have double adhesive strips and 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.500
 two just a simple one 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.370
 have adhesive strips 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:20.340
 Now I take my preconceived 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.940
 envelope and best of all the easiest 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.470
 I'll take a pair of tweezers 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.370
 we start with the inner lining 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.830
 scroll to 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:36.419
 I pull the paper from this carrier 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.970
 strip the self- clammy and stick 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.039
 then a mooring is that I look 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.590
 I here from the distance to the left and 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:51.840
 Right then I'm stuck that then 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:55.470
 between yes one of these bags 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.680
 that I have folded there so it looks 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.330
 I will do the same with the same 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.330
 second few sheets 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:18.150
 See that I'm about left 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:20.130
 and right now and then right now 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:25.670
 still the one where he just streaked 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.670
 where have my god forgive me 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.210
 German misfires ok here you have only 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.890
 a sticker what is that then 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.080
 to point inside so we have to go here 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.690
 if you work out then here afterwards 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:47.250
 nice to open completely there can 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:49.520
 nothing sticks like that and now that 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.520
 latest 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:08.930
 I have finished my album what 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.330
 i can do it now i can do it in 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.440
 decorate various species pfitzner 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.480
 I would have dripped on the stand 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.950
 Partly put that this is not 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.419
 already apart as so 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.370
 harmonica diverges 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.900
 but that is a matter of taste so ever 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.710
 after how that would like to have 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.389
 and here in front of me are this 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.780
 hole of the trailer stood so he lies 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.850
 on top of each other then i can be wonderful 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:47.990
 here a piece of swept loop 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:48.680
 go through and then here my album too 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.960
 tie 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.979
 Let's see that is exactly what needed to be done 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.979
 also comes out 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:14.360
 So yes, I can still flower 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.800
 live on it or you can do it 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.810
 I also want to determine you 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.970
 recommend that before you are 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:25.730
 wrong and got up and done 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.810
 is the little mini album I hope you 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.260
 was fun 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.750
 You could understand everything I did 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.370
 so have given by asking with her 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.100
 leave a comment or 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:40.330

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.330
