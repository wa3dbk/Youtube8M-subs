00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
I am a part of this community but I feel

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.420 
I am a part of this community but I feel
like<00:04:35.050> I'm<00:04:35.140> more<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.410> part<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:35.920> booktube

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
like I'm more a part of the booktube

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.040 
like I'm more a part of the booktube
community<00:04:36.580> like<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.090> feel<00:04:37.240> like<00:04:37.330> it's<00:04:37.480> its<00:04:37.780> own

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
community like I feel like it's its own

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.020 
community like I feel like it's its own
little<00:04:38.320> hub<00:04:38.560> within<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.520> YouTube<00:04:39.790> community

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
little hub within the YouTube community

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.210 
little hub within the YouTube community
and<00:04:40.420> so<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.200> don't<00:04:41.590> have<00:04:41.650> much<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:41.980> say<00:04:42.100> about

and so I don't have much to say about

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.860 
and so I don't have much to say about
the<00:04:42.430> YouTube<00:04:42.760> community<00:04:42.910> there<00:04:43.360> has<00:04:43.390> been<00:04:43.810> a

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.420 
the YouTube community there has been a
lot<00:04:44.080> of<00:04:44.110> crap<00:04:44.470> that's<00:04:44.620> been<00:04:44.770> going<00:04:45.040> down<00:04:45.190> and

lot of crap that's been going down and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.820 
lot of crap that's been going down and
it's<00:04:45.520> just<00:04:45.580> really<00:04:46.240> unfortunate<00:04:46.540> but<00:04:47.440> as<00:04:47.620> for

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
and it just has kind of evolved into

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.090 
and it just has kind of evolved into
something<00:05:19.990> bigger<00:05:20.380> than<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.620> ever<00:05:20.650> thought<00:05:20.890> it

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
something bigger than I ever thought it

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.040 
something bigger than I ever thought it

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
would become and I just don't know how

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.570 
would become and I just don't know how
it<00:05:23.140> even<00:05:23.320> got<00:05:23.440> to<00:05:23.500> this<00:05:23.650> point<00:05:23.860> really<00:05:24.070> I<00:05:24.190> just

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580
