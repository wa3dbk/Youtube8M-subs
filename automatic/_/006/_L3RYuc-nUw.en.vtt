tape<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.130> duck<00:01:32.520> brand<00:01:32.729> makes<00:01:32.970> reason<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.720> use

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
tape that duck brand makes reason I use

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
tape that duck brand makes reason I use
is<00:01:34.049> because<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> fabric<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.670> won't

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
is because it's like a fabric it won't

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.370 
is because it's like a fabric it won't
rip<00:01:36.329> easily<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.790> why<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> use<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:40.229> you

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
rip easily so that's why I use it as you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.749 
rip easily so that's why I use it as you
can<00:01:40.530> see<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.799> moves<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.100> lot<00:01:41.220> less<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:43.640> if<00:01:44.640> you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
can see it moves a lot less and if you

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.319 
can see it moves a lot less and if you
can<00:01:44.909> hear<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.700> you'll<00:01:47.909> want<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> leave

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329

but<00:02:37.300> I've<00:02:37.660> already<00:02:37.810> tested<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.380> one<00:02:38.590> it's

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
but I've already tested this one it's

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.840 
but I've already tested this one it's
pretty<00:02:38.890> good<00:02:39.040> i'm<00:02:39.220> gonna<00:02:39.370> send<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.670> one<00:02:39.790> to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
pretty good i'm gonna send this one to

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.820 
pretty good i'm gonna send this one to
zombie<00:02:40.150> go<00:02:40.240> then<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:41.200> now<00:02:41.470> i'm<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.740> show

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
zombie go then but now i'm going to show

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:51.350 
zombie go then but now i'm going to show
you<00:02:41.860> how<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.490> finish<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.560> prototype<00:02:44.560> one<00:02:48.480> this

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
you how to finish the prototype one this

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.960 
you how to finish the prototype one this
so<00:02:52.360> go<00:02:52.990> out<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.170> buy<00:02:53.500> yourself<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:54.160> printed

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
so go out and buy yourself a printed

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.090 
so go out and buy yourself a printed
duct<00:02:55.210> tape<00:02:55.480> because<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.680> more<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:56.980> a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
duct tape because it's like more of a

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.850 
duct tape because it's like more of a
fabric<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.840> duck<00:03:02.050> brand<00:03:02.290> because<00:03:02.590> there's<00:03:02.740> is

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
fabric for duck brand because there's is

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:15.750 
fabric for duck brand because there's is
always<00:03:03.100> better<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.890> just<00:03:15.010> take<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.460> and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
always better and you just take it and

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.810 
always better and you just take it and
as<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.120> said<00:03:16.180> wrap<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:18.570> around<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.820> that'll

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
as I said wrap it around it and that'll

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.250 
as I said wrap it around it and that'll
hold<00:03:22.090> pretty<00:03:22.450> secure<00:03:24.690> if<00:03:25.690> you're<00:03:25.900> fighting

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
hold pretty secure if you're fighting

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.220 
hold pretty secure if you're fighting
zombies<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.570> you'll<00:03:28.570> probably<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:28.930> want<00:03:29.170> to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
zombies and you'll probably just want to

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.410 
zombies and you'll probably just want to
wrap<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:29.890> think<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.520> wrap<00:03:31.030> enough

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
wrap it to you think it is wrap enough

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.530 
wrap it to you think it is wrap enough
where<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:31.780> won't<00:03:31.959> worry<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:33.239> do<00:03:34.239> what<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.480> just

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
where you won't worry so do what I just

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.520 
where you won't worry so do what I just
did<00:03:34.780> about<00:03:35.170> 10<00:03:35.590> times<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.520> you'll<00:03:37.000> be<00:03:37.120> good

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
did about 10 times and you'll be good

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.690 
did about 10 times and you'll be good
and<00:03:38.530> wrap<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.040> around<00:03:39.100> here<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.550> bottom

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
and wrap it around here on the bottom

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.820 
and wrap it around here on the bottom
too<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.330> it<00:03:40.420> doesn't<00:03:40.690> slide<00:03:40.870> down<00:03:41.170> cuz<00:03:41.770> you

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
too so it doesn't slide down cuz you

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.449 
too so it doesn't slide down cuz you
could<00:03:41.950> hammer<00:03:42.190> with<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.690> like<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.459> you

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
could hammer with it like that and you

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.150 
could hammer with it like that and you
could<00:03:45.700> hold<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.239> like<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.450> on<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.350> spiked<00:03:47.860> in

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
could hold it like this on the spiked in

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.949 
could hold it like this on the spiked in
and<00:03:48.720> deflect<00:03:50.430> put<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.580> like<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:51.730> right<00:03:52.480> here

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.530 

your<00:03:55.959> hand<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.350> wrap<00:03:56.739> your<00:03:57.010> fist<00:03:57.310> around<00:03:57.540> you

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
your hand and wrap your fist around you

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.460 
your hand and wrap your fist around you
could<00:03:58.840> block<00:03:59.680> up<00:03:59.980> Bloxham<00:04:00.850> fists<00:04:01.470> striking

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
could block up Bloxham fists striking

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.880 
could block up Bloxham fists striking
they'll<00:04:02.950> break<00:04:03.280> their<00:04:03.489> knuckles<00:04:04.140> well<00:04:05.140> wrist

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
they'll break their knuckles well wrist

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.820 
they'll break their knuckles well wrist
and<00:04:06.820> just<00:04:07.150> do<00:04:07.239> that<00:04:07.360> about<00:04:07.600> 10<00:04:08.560> more<00:04:08.680> times

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
and just do that about 10 more times

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.410 
and just do that about 10 more times
around<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.370> don't<00:04:09.610> forget<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:09.910> bottom<00:04:10.269> part

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
around it don't forget this bottom part

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.009 
around it don't forget this bottom part
so<00:04:11.380> you'll<00:04:11.590> probably<00:04:11.800> need<00:04:12.570> not<00:04:13.570> much<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.930> this

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
so you'll probably need not much of this

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:21.750 
so you'll probably need not much of this
tape<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:16.299> yeah<00:04:18.720> that's<00:04:19.720> how<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.109> make<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.760> um

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
tape so yeah that's how you make it um

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.480 
tape so yeah that's how you make it um
if<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:23.020> had<00:04:23.200> my<00:04:23.320> finished<00:04:23.650> product<00:04:24.070> I'd<00:04:24.220> come

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
if I had my finished product I'd come

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.910 
if I had my finished product I'd come
and<00:04:24.520> show<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.240> because<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.229> have<00:04:26.380> a
