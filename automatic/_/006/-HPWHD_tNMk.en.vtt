the beyond today show without really

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.910 
the beyond today show without really
thinking<00:05:16.670> about<00:05:17.240> how<00:05:17.930> many<00:05:17.990> people<00:05:18.290> it<00:05:18.620> takes

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
thinking about how many people it takes

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.060

to<00:05:19.850> put<00:05:20.480> this<00:05:20.630> together<00:05:20.870> how<00:05:21.380> much<00:05:21.560> time<00:05:21.860> and

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
to put this together how much time and

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.670 
to put this together how much time and
effort<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.640> energy<00:05:22.790> is<00:05:23.240> spent<00:05:23.390> in<00:05:23.870> to<00:05:24.440> just

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
effort and energy is spent in to just

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
one issue or just one episode and it

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.890 
one issue or just one episode and it
