00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
think that the first time this has been

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.130 
think that the first time this has been
my<00:00:32.410> worst<00:00:33.010> offline<00:00:33.850> event<00:00:34.180> ever<00:00:34.420> I<00:00:34.720> have<00:00:35.020> been

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
to a lot of Evans and to be honest if it

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.880 
to a lot of Evans and to be honest if it
wasn't<00:00:37.660> because<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:37.990> season<00:00:38.410> points<00:00:38.560> here

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
wasn't because the season points here

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.200 
wasn't because the season points here
and<00:00:39.100> if<00:00:39.280> I<00:00:39.340> didn't<00:00:39.550> have<00:00:39.580> to<00:00:39.790> care<00:00:39.940> about<00:00:40.030> my

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210

to<00:01:51.609> be<00:01:51.729> here<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.149> i<00:01:52.420> think<00:01:52.479> it's<00:01:52.719> kind<00:01:53.170> of

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
to be here and i think it's kind of

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.779 
to be here and i think it's kind of
disgusting<00:01:53.319> because<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.130> puts<00:01:54.340> people<00:01:54.609> that

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
disgusting because it puts people that

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.249 
disgusting because it puts people that
always<00:01:54.939> have<00:01:55.179> season<00:01:55.450> points<00:01:55.600> at<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.049> top

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
always have season points at the top

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.809 
always have season points at the top
like<00:01:56.469> i<00:01:56.740> think<00:01:57.249> it<00:01:57.310> should<00:01:57.429> be<00:01:57.459> a<00:01:57.579> fairly

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
like i think it should be a fairly

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.269 
like i think it should be a fairly
instead<00:01:58.479> of<00:01:58.630> having<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.990> league<00:01:59.170> if<00:02:00.009> you

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.279 
instead of having a league if you

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.129 
instead of having a league if you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.020 
point and also finger did okay on top so
I<00:03:00.800> don't<00:03:01.190> think<00:03:01.340> that's<00:03:01.490> that<00:03:01.550> big<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.940> an

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
I don't think that's that big of an

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.670 
I don't think that's that big of an
issue<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.690> smaller<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.230> picks

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
issue it's smaller the picks

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.910 
issue it's smaller the picks
anyway<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.510> what<00:03:05.810> what<00:03:06.110> about<00:03:06.290> besides<00:03:06.470> top

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
anyway so what what about besides top

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.510 
anyway so what what about besides top
like<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.460> guys<00:03:07.790> really<00:03:08.330> close<00:03:08.660> third<00:03:09.080> game<00:03:09.520> do

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
like you guys really close third game do

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.130 
like you guys really close third game do
you<00:03:10.580> think<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:11.030> TSM<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.540> just<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.780> little<00:03:12.050> bit

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
you think that TSM is just a little bit

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.450 
you think that TSM is just a little bit
better<00:03:12.260> than<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.530> right<00:03:12.710> now<00:03:12.920> or<00:03:13.130> what<00:03:13.400> are

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
better than you right now or what are

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.880 
better than you right now or what are
your<00:03:13.580> opinions<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:14.030> them<00:03:14.150> as<00:03:14.240> a<00:03:14.270> team<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:15.800> be

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
your opinions on them as a team to be

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.400 
your opinions on them as a team to be
honest<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.520> think<00:03:16.640> that<00:03:17.330> overall<00:03:17.930> would<00:03:18.320> be

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
honest I think that overall would be

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.979 
honest I think that overall would be
played<00:03:18.739> but<00:03:18.920> on<00:03:19.010> them<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:20.510> first<00:03:20.720> game

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
played but on them and the first game

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.110 
played but on them and the first game
you<00:03:21.320> get<00:03:21.770> screwed<00:03:21.980> over<00:03:22.160> because<00:03:22.430> settings<00:03:22.880> no

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
you get screwed over because settings no

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.850 
you get screwed over because settings no
sounds<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:24.050> what<00:03:24.230> can<00:03:24.350> we<00:03:24.440> do<00:03:24.560> we<00:03:24.650> have<00:03:24.770> to

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
sounds like what can we do we have to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.320 
sounds like what can we do we have to
get<00:03:24.980> used<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.310> having<00:03:25.400> no<00:03:25.640> sounds<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.209> on

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
get used to having no sounds and so on

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.510 
get used to having no sounds and so on
then<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.200> second<00:03:27.500> game<00:03:27.680> we<00:03:27.830> actually<00:03:28.010> managed

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
then the second game we actually managed

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.370 
then the second game we actually managed
to<00:03:28.550> win<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:28.850> game<00:03:29.090> out<00:03:29.600> sounds<00:03:30.020> because<00:03:30.230> we're

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
to win the game out sounds because we're

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.140 
to win the game out sounds because we're
getting<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.650> more<00:03:30.830> used<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:31.880> then<00:03:32.000> we're

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
getting a more used to it but then we're

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.520 
getting a more used to it but then we're
losing<00:03:32.480> our<00:03:32.600> voices<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.050> so<00:03:33.200> on<00:03:33.290> so<00:03:33.410> it's

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
losing our voices and so on so it's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.280 
losing our voices and so on so it's
really<00:03:33.560> terrible<00:03:34.040> for<00:03:34.100> us<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.459> we<00:03:34.550> felt<00:03:34.730> bad
