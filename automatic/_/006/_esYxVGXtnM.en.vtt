here<00:04:57.099> so<00:04:58.599> I'll<00:04:59.599> let<00:04:59.810> you<00:04:59.990> decide<00:05:00.320> on<00:05:01.010> whether

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
here so I'll let you decide on whether

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.879 
here so I'll let you decide on whether
or<00:05:02.030> not<00:05:02.380> this<00:05:03.380> is<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.680> make<00:05:03.949> up<00:05:04.070> break<00:05:04.250> for<00:05:04.490> you

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
or not this is a make up break for you

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.310 
or not this is a make up break for you
for<00:05:06.889> me<00:05:06.979> it's<00:05:07.130> not<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:07.340> break<00:05:07.699> but<00:05:08.599> it<00:05:08.900> could

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
for me it's not a break but it could
