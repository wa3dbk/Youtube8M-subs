toe cramp on the Evo is just step up

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.039 
toe cramp on the Evo is just step up
from<00:00:47.159> the<00:00:47.190> classic<00:00:47.699> series<00:00:48.089> it<00:00:48.570> has<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.750> better

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
from the classic series it has a better

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.630 
from the classic series it has a better
binding<00:00:49.470> than<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.650> classic<00:00:50.070> or<00:00:50.220> I<00:00:50.250> should<00:00:50.460> say

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
binding than the classic or I should say

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.490 
binding than the classic or I should say
an<00:00:50.909> easier<00:00:51.390> planet<00:00:51.720> to<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:51.960> into<00:00:52.229> and<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.440> of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
an easier planet to get into and out of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.829 
an easier planet to get into and out of
the<00:00:52.650> materials<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> bit<00:00:53.309> stiffer<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:54.479> design

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
the materials a bit stiffer the design

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.270 
the materials a bit stiffer the design
of<00:00:55.049> the<00:00:55.140> frame<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.619> a<00:00:55.650> little<00:00:55.860> bit<00:00:55.949> different

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
of the frame is a little bit different

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.829 
of the frame is a little bit different
than<00:00:56.369> the<00:00:56.519> classic<00:00:57.000> has<00:00:57.330> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.540> more<00:00:57.659> room

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
than the classic has a little more room

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.689 
than the classic has a little more room
in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.049> front<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> bigger<00:00:58.769> boot<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.549> when

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
in the front for a bigger boot so when

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.490 
in the front for a bigger boot so when
you<00:00:59.790> are<00:00:59.939> in<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.180> deeps<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.570> siberia<00:01:01.170> you've

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you are in the deeps of siberia you've

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.890 
you are in the deeps of siberia you've
got<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.799> giant<00:01:02.189> snow<00:01:02.430> boot<00:01:02.610> on<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.780> won't

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
got your giant snow boot on you won't

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.210 
got your giant snow boot on you won't
have<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.140> worry<00:01:04.320> about<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.650> toe<00:01:04.830> hitting<00:01:05.159> the

have to worry about your toe hitting the
end<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> snowshoe<00:01:06.530> today<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.950> we're

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
end of the snowshoe today because we're

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.859 
end of the snowshoe today because we're
a<00:01:08.159> siberia<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.729> snow<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.600> deep

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
a siberia the snow is really really deep

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.370 
a siberia the snow is really really deep
so<00:01:10.530> I've<00:01:10.680> got<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:11.479> extension<00:01:12.479> extension<00:01:12.900> tail

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
so I've got my extension extension tail

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.940 
so I've got my extension extension tail
here<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.310> simply<00:01:14.869> attaches<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> back<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
here it simply attaches to the back of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.170 
here it simply attaches to the back of
the<00:01:17.040> snowshoe<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.550> provide<00:01:17.850> better

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the snowshoe to provide better

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.610 
the snowshoe to provide better
floatation<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.200> always<00:01:19.350> need

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
floatation now you don't always need

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.020 
floatation now you don't always need
this<00:01:19.800> if<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.100> out<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.340> Vermont<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:20.940> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
this if you're out in Vermont a lot of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.180 
this if you're out in Vermont a lot of
times<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.480> pretty<00:01:21.690> dense<00:01:21.990> snow<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.620> want

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
times we have pretty dense snow I want

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.430 
times we have pretty dense snow I want
my<00:01:23.340> snowshoe<00:01:23.730> for<00:01:23.940> traction<00:01:24.480> more<00:01:25.290> than

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
my snowshoe for traction more than

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.960 
my snowshoe for traction more than
anything<00:01:25.590> else<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.280> bit<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.520> floatation

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
anything else a little bit of floatation

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.430 
anything else a little bit of floatation
but<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.450> you're<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.690> really<00:01:27.840> deep<00:01:28.080> fluffy

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
but when you're in really deep fluffy

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
powder like we got here in Siberia you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450 
powder like we got here in Siberia you
want<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> slide<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.050> this<00:01:31.260> extension<00:01:31.710> tail<00:01:32.040> so
