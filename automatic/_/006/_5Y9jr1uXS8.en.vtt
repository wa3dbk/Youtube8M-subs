 earth everything you know about dinosaurs 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.600
 you're going to learn just touch my screen and 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.600
 you will see it very well 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.110
 the dinosaurs lived long ago 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.090
 time actually makes 66 million 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:26.110
 years and still before wow that seems 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.110
 a lot of time some were giants 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.420
 while others were very small 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.200
 there were many types of dinosaurs and 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.540
 all belonged to one of the groups 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.200
 carnivorous herbivores 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.019
 or like two dinosaur blogs 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.409
 you could call it dinosaurs like that 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.709
 herbivores were quiet while 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.750
 the carnivores were actually wild 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.569
 some of the sauro loops more 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.780
 small ones were more dangerous than their 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.770
 giant brothers 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.770
 if I want to say 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.650
 Market Stall 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.800
 while some of the biggest 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.290
 that looked like fearsome dinosaurs were 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.530
 actually calm herbivores wow 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.320
 the dinosaurs are very interesting sep 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.440
 and there is something else that you will find very 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.810
 interesting all the dinosaurs are born 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.600
 of eggs 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.370
 great as the hens that sit 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.390
 in their eggs and then their 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.810
 chicks 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:38.040
 if something to do and I bet you did not know 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.210
 that some dinosaurs could fly 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.200
 and it can not be like birds 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.600
 actually a long time ago the 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.470
 grandparents of the grandparents of the birds were 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.470
 dinosaurs 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.420
 which juniors were right the dinosaurs 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.280
 they are amazing and the greatest thing is that 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.900
 there is still much more to learn from 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:09.240

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:15.170
 raptor the tyrannosaurus rex the iguanodon 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.600
 or that's easy to look at hedgehogs 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.970
 wow juniors I do not think you can 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.490
 learn all in a day 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.090

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.790

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.130
