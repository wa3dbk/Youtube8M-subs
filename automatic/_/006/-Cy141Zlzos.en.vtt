00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.900
 professional bodybuilder we are here in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.429
 the gym good I will do your 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 personal trainer let's start 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.250
 doing training at the initial level 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.430
 basic above all to learn the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.710
 correct execution of the movement and 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.840
 try to avoid injuries and especially 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.820
 then we will go up a little bit the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 level for more advanced and then also 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 we will make some precompetition deliverable 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.600
 of high intensity techniques but 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.149
 good we'll start with the basics we're 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.850
 here in perfect bodies and nothing 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.730
 willing to teach you everything I know 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.370
 about good training now in this 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.559
 new training phase and that's what 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.140
 I will teach what is what is the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.760
 correct execution of the movement let's 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.469
 to start with what I did because it is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.390
 a muscle that you really like that you do not 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.420
 like to have a big dress then 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.550
 let's teach you how to do the right thing and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.440
 perfectly to get the most out of it 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.539
 performance to exercise and especially 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.580
 avoid injuries take from the dumbbells 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.830
 Mario' 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.560
 it's about keeping the palms towards the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.020
 front we always start doing it like that 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.540
 without turning the arms well attached to the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.760
 body we rotate the wrist is a little 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.870
 backwards and now we flex the two 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.960
 looking for her 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.150
 the maximum shrinkage we endure a 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.730
 jiffy to the contraction and stretch 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.250
 we return to the full arm travel 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:36.590
 again up with we bring and we stretch 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.440
 up maximum contraction against more 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.690
 contraction muscle beech more benefit 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.170
 we will have more muscular gains and 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.090
 we stretch to is very well 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.549
 for beginners we can work 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.460
 between 8 and 12 repetitions depends on the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.110
 morphology of the person but good that 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.990
 we will open it a little more 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.510
 ahead 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.620
 very well varied 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.950
 contract contracted separate the elbows 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.930
 super great very good good os 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.020

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.020
 treat these videos the topic especially 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.840
 started execution right now 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.490
 correct movement and especially 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.770

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.900
 our training and then the subject of 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.060
 avoid injuries that is what is not 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.990
 we want in future videos os 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.990
 we will count much more 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.980
 to our 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.690
