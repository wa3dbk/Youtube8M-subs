says you know take rudiments and apply
them<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.420> drumset<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.109> come<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.529> with

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
I'm gonna spend the time behind the drum

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.000 
I'm gonna spend the time behind the drum
set<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.689> want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> work<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> something<00:00:28.859> that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
set I want to work on something that

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.790 
set I want to work on something that
gives<00:00:29.340> me<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.929> infinite<00:00:30.929> possibilities<00:00:31.590> not

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
gives me like infinite possibilities not

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.600 
gives me like infinite possibilities not
like<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.940> thing<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.170> speed<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:35.399> one

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
like one thing at one speed in one

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
like one thing at one speed in one
subdivision<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.840> mean<00:00:36.960> it's

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
subdivision you know what I mean it's

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.420 
subdivision you know what I mean it's
just<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.620> doesn't<00:00:37.770> make<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> lot<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> sense

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
just like it doesn't make a lot of sense

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430 
just like it doesn't make a lot of sense
and<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.120> we're<00:00:39.329> gonna<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.600> modulating<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and this we're gonna be modulating a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.410 
and this we're gonna be modulating a
single<00:00:40.950> paradiddle<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.460> displacing<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
single paradiddle and displacing in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
single paradiddle and displacing in
every<00:00:42.660> way<00:00:42.840> while<00:00:43.320> modulating<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
every way while modulating it if you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
every way while modulating it if you
look<00:00:44.460> at<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> bar<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> eighth<00:00:45.210> notes<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.750> mean

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
look at a bar of eighth notes I mean

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.860 
look at a bar of eighth notes I mean
there's<00:00:46.489> eight<00:00:47.489> notes<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.420> bar<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
there's eight notes in the bar a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.900 
there's eight notes in the bar a
paradiddle<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:50.129> left<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.730> right

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
paradiddle is right left right right

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.819 
paradiddle is right left right right
left<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.870> left<00:00:52.020> left

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
left right left left

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.160 
left right left left
that's<00:00:53.010> eighth<00:00:53.219> notes<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.030> two<00:00:54.510> paradiddles

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that's eighth notes so two paradiddles

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.549 
that's eighth notes so two paradiddles
fit<00:00:56.100> into<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.399> bar<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.789> eighth<00:00:56.910> notes<00:00:56.940> perfectly

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.049 

the<00:01:01.559> next<00:01:01.859> bar<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> exercise<00:01:02.730> we're<00:01:03.000> gonna

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the next bar in the exercise we're gonna

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.420 
the next bar in the exercise we're gonna
be<00:01:03.270> playing<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.629> exact<00:01:03.989> same<00:01:04.229> sticking<00:01:04.769> but

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
be playing the exact same sticking but

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.460 
be playing the exact same sticking but
as<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> bar<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> triplets<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.510> there's<00:01:06.810> twelve

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
as a bar of triplets so there's twelve

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.080 
as a bar of triplets so there's twelve
notes<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> bar<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.280> triplets<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.880> just

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
notes in a bar of triplets so that just

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
notes in a bar of triplets so that just
means<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> tag<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.799> pedal

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
means you have to tag on one more pedal

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
means you have to tag on one more pedal
to<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.549> end<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.210> right<00:01:12.510> left<00:01:12.900> right<00:01:13.110> right

right<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.920> third<00:01:20.189> bar<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> exercise<00:01:21.030> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
right the third bar in the exercise is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.240 
right the third bar in the exercise is
just<00:01:21.299> sixteenth<00:01:21.960> notes<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.890> then<00:01:25.890> back<00:01:26.220> down

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
just sixteenth notes and then back down

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.429 
just sixteenth notes and then back down
to<00:01:26.520> triplets<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:29.659> then<00:01:30.659> you're<00:01:30.840> set<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.170> again

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
to triplets and then you're set up again

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.660 
to triplets and then you're set up again
for<00:01:31.619> eighth<00:01:31.799> notes<00:01:32.070> where<00:01:32.310> you're<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
for eighth notes where you're going to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
for eighth notes where you're going to
displace<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.689> we're<00:01:33.869> doing<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> exact

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
displace it so we're doing the exact

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469 
displace it so we're doing the exact
same<00:01:34.799> thing<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.369> did<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> displace<00:01:36.180> single

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
same thing we did in the displace single

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.910 
same thing we did in the displace single
paradiddle<00:01:36.780> challenge<00:01:37.259> we're<00:01:37.409> applying<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
paradiddle challenge we're applying to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
paradiddle challenge we're applying to
the<00:01:38.040> subdivision<00:01:38.460> pyramid<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.600> goes

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the subdivision pyramid you know it goes

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
the subdivision pyramid you know it goes
up<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.290> speeds<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:41.189> slows<00:01:41.549> down

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
up it speeds up and then slows down

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.520 
up it speeds up and then slows down
speeds<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.479> slows<00:01:42.540> down<00:01:42.960> I'm<00:01:43.170> gonna<00:01:43.320> play

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
speeds up and slows down I'm gonna play

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.889 
speeds up and slows down I'm gonna play
it<00:01:43.649> at<00:01:43.740> 80<00:01:43.979> beats<00:01:44.310> per<00:01:44.399> minute<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.850> 130<00:01:45.689> beats

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
it at 80 beats per minute and 130 beats

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.149 
it at 80 beats per minute and 130 beats
per<00:01:46.140> minute<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.530> when<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.740> listening<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
per minute and when you're listening to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.770 
per minute and when you're listening to
this<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.549> imagine<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.360> stuff<00:01:48.600> would

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
this just imagine what this stuff would

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.660 
this just imagine what this stuff would
sound<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.110> moved<00:01:49.500> around<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.950> kit<00:01:50.189> that's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
sound like moved around the kit that's
