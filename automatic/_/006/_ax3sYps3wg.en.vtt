00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello welcome everyone to the channel 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.569
 leopard with with you alexander today on 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.420
 repair ottobre 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.509
 we remove the steering gear from the car 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.840
 rake very knock our steering iodine fold 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:21.590
 see here we pull the rail and hear 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.590
 only nastuchi 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:50.660
 I hope you can hear everything in here 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:55.010
 bangs rick you show backlash slats and 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:00.960
 services here from the wheel on the side of the wheel 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:09.330
 the scheme we pull in general is kind of like 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:11.930
 the leader tried to show already 3 she still 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.930
 more more 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.000
 Now we will rent a car 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.610
 briefly told followed by which 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 we plan to do this here we raise 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.900
 car immediately of course there may be 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.220
 not necessarily in every case, we 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.850
 lifted the car removed the wheel and we 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.990
 it is seen 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.119
 note there is an opening under the wheels 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.820
 here we are going to try through this opening 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.439
 I unscrew our rail from the front panel 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.009
 bring here's through this opening show 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.250
 top 4 nuts mounting mass rail 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.290
 attached to the front of the body here 4 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.290
 bolted here and a little bit to the left 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.660
 raised 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.140
 wallpaper can be seen right here and here four 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.700
 bolts bolts 14 here it will be necessary them 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.050
 unscrew but previously we also 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.820
 unscrew the bracket that is bolted to 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.360
 the end of the rake with us 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.730
 ends with a shaft there bracket python 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.350
 bracket and with a bunch of our thrust steering 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:35.390
 so we unscrew our bracket unscrew 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:38.180
 body rack from the body and in fact 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:45.310
 there is still one bolt to unscrew the cabin 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:51.470
 this is the shaft bolt in the cabin the steering shaft has 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:55.070
 when nismo river is called compression but he 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.250
 squeezes forgot okay shorter steering shaft 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.900
 where it connects to the shaft of the rail 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.959
 there's a bolt of this God it will 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.420
 unscrew and in general that all the rivers will be 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.260
 removed almost proceed now 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:13.540
 diving into the pit and unscrew the bracket 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.540
 from our steering rack 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.370
 where is she and our pedals and here is our helmsman 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.370
 the shaft covered us this bolt 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:46.560
 unscrew this bolt first thing 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:50.400
 then we will unscrew under the hood here 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.030
 we unscrewed 4 crankcase mounting bolts 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.790
 steering gear 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.820
 now here is my assistant will take out 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:08.040
 the entire rail assembly 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:10.110
 I take out your assistant military glove 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.400
 first like cars forward 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:22.170
 remove girlfriend from the slots display 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:28.590
 which wheel our river found there 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:30.750
 teleping on safari on the stairs of others 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:36.450
 how many hear well try to enter 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:42.090
 and hard yes well than pounded on specifically 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:44.520
 very well in general we took off and in 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.890
 principle in general showed how she 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.540
 removed it is put in reverse 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:54.500
 sequences too nothing complicated 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.770
 neatly we start to get the shaft 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.430
 slots 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:07.650
 the steering shaft is then bolted 4 nuts and 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.860
 dressing at the end of our river then 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.540
 directly details of the rake is called 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.920
 Further such cloves go with a rake 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.660
 called rake but on rake we 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.410
 dress then the bracket that we have 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:29.100
 stayed i'll show maz bracket stayed 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:29.990
 by car here it is our bracket it 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.450
 he stayed 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:39.050
 from the steering rods can not interfere with anything 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:43.400
 so just then collect in 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.380
 reverse sequence when 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.000
 steering installation 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:53.300
 if one nuance is a rectilinear motion 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.010
 car will be provided with 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.630
 certain position 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:02.780
 our nuts are inside the mechanism therefore 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.610
 to properly put on the steering slots 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.490
 shaft and correctly looked at the wheel 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.020
 steering should be set 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.450
 steering rack to and expose 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:18.670
 the following characteristic must be met 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:22.580
 here we have a mounting hole 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:26.860
 of our mechanism and the end of the slats here in 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.860
 in this position between these two 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:34.700
 here mono 0 in the middle of the hole and take 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.080
 to the end of the river should be one hundred and seventy 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:43.070
 three millimeters this is shown in such 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.560
 our river position is in 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.060
 mid kris center position 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.680
 left and right will be the same angle 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.530
 turning and it corresponds 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.600
 rectilinear car movement here 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.170
 so here we must try to put our 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.970
 rail 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:07:01.120
 at assembly everything is on it all thanks to 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.120
