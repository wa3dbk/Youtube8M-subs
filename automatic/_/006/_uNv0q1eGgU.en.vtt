hi<00:00:00.690> on<00:00:01.050> these<00:00:01.410> videos<00:00:01.709> about<00:00:02.149> isometric

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi on these videos about isometric

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.630 
hi on these videos about isometric
drawing<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.319> projection<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.370> cone

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
drawing and the projection of the cone

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.140 
drawing and the projection of the cone
so<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:07.379> particular<00:00:07.620> cone<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.490> sitting<00:00:09.000> in

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
so this particular cone is sitting in

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.209 
so this particular cone is sitting in
the<00:00:09.330> first<00:00:09.690> angle<00:00:10.099> on<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.370> first<00:00:11.730> plane<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.540> I

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
the first angle on the first plane so I

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.220 
the first angle on the first plane so I
need<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.340> draw<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.610> office<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.750> need<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.020> draw

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
need to draw the office I need to draw

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.120 
need to draw the office I need to draw
the<00:00:17.359> country<00:00:18.359> or<00:00:18.720> plant<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.710> side<00:00:19.949> view

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the country or plant and the side view

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.439 
the country or plant and the side view
and<00:00:20.660> once<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.869> draw<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.500> from<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:24.180> says

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
and once I draw that from it it says

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.599 
and once I draw that from it it says
that<00:00:24.480> okay<00:00:24.990> how<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> projection<00:00:26.189> look<00:00:26.369> like

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
that okay how the projection look like

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.349 
that okay how the projection look like
when<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.720> tilt<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.490> object<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.119> 30

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
when you tilt this this object at a 30

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.200 
when you tilt this this object at a 30
degree<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.859> kind<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.340> problem<00:00:33.059> are

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
degree so this kind of problem are

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.389 
degree so this kind of problem are
common<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> engineering<00:00:34.290> drawing<00:00:34.590> so

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
common in the engineering drawing so

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.700 
common in the engineering drawing so
first<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.360> will<00:00:36.540> draw<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> projection<00:00:37.530> without

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
first I will draw the projection without

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
first I will draw the projection without
this<00:00:38.250> tilt<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.270> will<00:00:39.450> draw<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
this tilt and then I will draw the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.380 
this tilt and then I will draw the
projection<00:00:40.440> with<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> 30<00:00:41.460> degree<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
projection with the 30 degree of the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.889 
projection with the 30 degree of the
tilt<00:00:43.140> okay<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.250> let's<00:00:44.670> start<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
tilt okay so let's start with so this is

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.830 
tilt okay so let's start with so this is
the<00:00:46.320> projection<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:47.940> look<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.719> when

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the projection it will look like so when

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200 
the projection it will look like so when
you<00:00:48.870> look<00:00:49.140> from<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.530> top<00:00:49.739> view<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.820> be

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
you look from the top view you will be

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.590 
you look from the top view you will be
you<00:00:51.989> will<00:00:52.020> able<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> circle<00:00:53.600> front

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
you will able to see the circle front

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.439 
you will able to see the circle front
view<00:00:54.809> will<00:00:55.199> look<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:56.399> simple<00:00:56.940> triangle

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
view will look like a simple triangle

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.470 
view will look like a simple triangle
and<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.859> side<00:00:59.070> view<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.820> also

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
and the right in side view it will also

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.590 
and the right in side view it will also
look<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.230> triangle<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.910> right-hand<00:01:03.359> side

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
look like a triangle the right-hand side

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.350 
look like a triangle the right-hand side
view<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.019> coming<00:01:04.500> from<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.030> draw<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
view is coming from here if I draw the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.539 
view is coming from here if I draw the
arrow<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.990> coming<00:01:07.500> all<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:07.950> hand<00:01:08.159> side<00:01:08.369> view

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
arrow is coming all right hand side view

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.050 
arrow is coming all right hand side view
will<00:01:08.760> come<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.720> from<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.890> side<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:14.060> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
will come here from this side and and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.420 
will come here from this side and and
the<00:01:15.210> projection<00:01:15.720> will<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.860> like

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the projection will will go here like

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.910 
the projection will will go here like
triangle<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.689> flip<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
triangle and then when you flip the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.060 
triangle and then when you flip the
plane<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:20.909> go<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.420> okay<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
plane it will go here okay so in the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.480 
plane it will go here okay so in the
first<00:01:23.280> angle<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.750> look<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
first angle or when you look at in the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.510 
first angle or when you look at in the
first<00:01:26.880> angle<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> look<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.680> from

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
first angle or when you look at the from

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.850 
first angle or when you look at the from
the<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.700> hand<00:01:30.090> side<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:31.049> projection<00:01:31.619> will

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the right hand side the projection will

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
the right hand side the projection will
go<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> left<00:01:32.549> hand<00:01:32.759> side<00:01:33.060> okay<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.570> that's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
go on the left hand side okay so that's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.429 
go on the left hand side okay so that's
what<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.530> shown<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:36.090> now<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:37.170> one

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
what I have shown here and now this one

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.560 
what I have shown here and now this one
is<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.350> when<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> Tate<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.670> menu

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
is the is the when you Tate the menu

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.020 
is the is the when you Tate the menu
till<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.930> corn<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> 30<00:01:44.159> degree<00:01:44.520> so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
till the corn and the 30 degree so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.109 
till the corn and the 30 degree so
that's<00:01:45.240> what<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> start<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:46.310> first<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that's what you start with first so you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.609 
that's what you start with first so you
start<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:50.210> this<00:01:51.210> triangle<00:01:51.780> first<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.350> 30

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
start this this triangle first the 30

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.350 
start this this triangle first the 30
degree<00:01:52.950> because<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.729> one<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.060> able

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
degree because that's the one you able

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.940 
degree because that's the one you able
to<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.890> extend<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> lines<00:01:57.000> so

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
to see and then you extend the lines so

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.910 
to see and then you extend the lines so
here<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.850> or<00:02:00.360> extend<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> lines<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:01.710> at

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
here I have or extend the lines here at

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.480 
here I have or extend the lines here at
the<00:02:02.100> 45<00:02:02.610> degree<00:02:02.969> so

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
the 45 degree so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.940 
the 45 degree so
those<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.729> shown<00:02:05.970> as<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> dotted<00:02:06.509> line<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
those are shown as a dotted line and and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.520 
those are shown as a dotted line and and
you<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.940> also<00:02:09.030> extend<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.690> tip<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you have to also extend the tip of the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.120 
you have to also extend the tip of the
cone<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.550> when<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:11.970> extend<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.930> when<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.950> is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
cone so when you extend and when this is

the this tip will come from here the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.410 
the this tip will come from here the
width<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.170> extend<00:02:40.819> from<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.910> bottom

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
width you can extend from the bottom

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.320 
width you can extend from the bottom
side<00:02:42.720> here<00:02:42.750> okay<00:02:43.459> so<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.330> isometric

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
side here okay so this is the isometric

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.259 
side here okay so this is the isometric
projection<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.769> cone<00:02:50.040> or<00:02:50.670> with<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.000> third

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
projection of the cone or with the third

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.770 
projection of the cone or with the third
with<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.989> tilt<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.380> 30<00:02:52.650> degree<00:02:53.780> hopefully

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
with the tilt of 30 degree hopefully

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.570 
with the tilt of 30 degree hopefully
