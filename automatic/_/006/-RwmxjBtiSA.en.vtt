 leo wind 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.259
 england 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.570
 on the one hand between the dog and us it is also question of education indeed 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.660
 how to turn your today's pet into a bus company 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.260

 if the question is not the case the owner of drain a real bowl 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.920
 nice solidarity all they could share his interest in 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.119
 bring back the day to 4 and a half years 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.580
 h &amp; r eads reported his discomfort 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.250
 a good old way is just at its head and the question I would like 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.030

 a lot of people is showing that we are very strong physically it's over 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.510
 nonsense in dogs 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.570
 the leader is the most difficult one must be consistent define rules 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.540
 accurate and then stick to it and the money would be respected by your pet 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.400
 the very important thing 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.749
 it's not doing things upside down 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:02.930
 it is the best 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.660
 finally the chains owner company always has a tendency to 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.020
 congratulate when he would ask his dog when something is missing at 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.980
 get angry at the racing station lying and standing up screaming but canteen does 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.330
 asks nothing he tends to expand simply because it's good to not 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.770
 more see the contract 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.360
 when you have nothing to ask your dog you are not interested 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.860
 when you ask for something that's where I praised not 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.490
 to be extremely kind 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.630
 no need to try to hit your dog to make it bless it's no use 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.490
 what I do is an animal that runs very fast 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.610
 so the success of putting a coup 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.020
 it happens yet all the senses aware and 5 people you are 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.730
 example 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.880

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.430

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.960
 before the great traveler and filmmaker nicolas vanier be equipped chef 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.520
 when driving a pack of sled dogs it is a responsibility of 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.420
 every moment too often we encounter 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.630
 people who according to their mood of the day 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.420
 to allow them some things to chelsea the next day before 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.950
 authorize the dogs they have not increased to that allow them to 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.760
 understand that this kind of evolution what little to understand a human the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.989
 cat does not understand so the dog again if we like them 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.979
 it must be said where is the yes 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:21.429
 where is the name 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:25.999
 - the total 30% there may be a frame of maybe but all that has to be 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.500
 well defined 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.490
 already at the man when we negotiate for the boss and we throw that have 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.010
 drives a pack of sled dogs and well if we have more morale 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.219
 times not to show that it's a little bit like a fitted chef 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.669
 when you are a well equipped chef it's a responsibility 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.339
 first and foremost 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.499
 keep your head upright when things go wrong because 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.369
