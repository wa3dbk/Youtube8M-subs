00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.620
 Grand Master tell me the secret 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.170
 the balsamic vinegar are the centuries of 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.150
 history tradition the truth lies in 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.710
 time the time that makes it ferment 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.360
 mature aging a good loft site 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.690
 in the plain of Modena as here a 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.850
 spilamberto a long time so much patience e 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.760
 abnegation patience that today often 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.330
 missing but on the balsamic essentials e 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.680
 na kim which is what you want 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.229
 exactly the alchemy is ours 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.710
 industriousness in making withdrawals 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.020
 in the tanks of those who are not really one 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.090
 levy with the old sahafa breath like 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.369
 it was done once to be able to withdraw 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.100
 from the smaller barrel the product more 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.090
 precious that in the attic that is a no in 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.040
 cellar 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.320
 absolutely not because in the cellar there 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.790
 save and somehow the wine 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.340
 contrasts with traditional balsamic 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.560
 because it is not a product that derives 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.810
 from the certification of the wine but of the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.190
 must that before being wine comes 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.619
 boiled 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.380
 then later it is placed in the barrels 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.810
 mature fermentation ages for which it must 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.819
 be away from the cellar and to 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.310
 this is in the attic yes but in the attic 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.990
 no hurry there is warm that is his 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.490
 wonder why the balsamic of the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.610
 tradition lives on this great 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.039
 contrast of the Padan climate an intense 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.569
 damp cold in winter 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.150
 make his life is absolutely not 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.340
 coin breath is a very hot 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.900
 just as humid in summer with few 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.180
 half seasons of these greats 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.349
 contrasts live it at the summit cooking 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.819
 lousy wonderful product once 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.299
 such 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.859
 exact if we were in you 23 oct. nothing 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:31.180
 because he even thought in a nice climate 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:34.030
 mountain well that is why we are here 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.889
 it is a kind of redemption of the Po climate 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.889
 that gives us this wonderful product 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:41.079
 cooked must then with a grape juice 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.359
 trebiano lambrusco from spain 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:47.500
 our zones and lamberto castelvetro 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:50.650
 castelnuovo here exact squeezing the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.650
 next day before boiling 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.319
 on very low heat it healed of copper 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.689
 no we stop before the first room 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.090
 of his first room and then 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.489
 we have this concentration of the must 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.489
 which begins its fermentation of the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.159
 larger and then mother barrels 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.829
 decanted year after having the barrels 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:14.590
 we in the smallest barrel act call 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.569
 the most precious product that is in charge of 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.150
 a few decades become balsamic e 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.980
 old from the next barrel 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.230
 we place the product in the barrel more 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.599
 small and gradually until you get to the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.209
 the largest barrel is the largest barrel 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.030
 it is tucked in with the cooked must that it is 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.340
 been placed in the mother barrel where 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.000
 a fermentation process begins 16 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.620
 sorry but the origin of this 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.290
 very elaborate strategy to have a 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.109
 strange product but there is a secret and it is 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.090
 difficult to reveal we know that 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.870
 since ancient times already in georgiche 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.040
 the black-headed cook of Virgil 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.769
 they talked about using this 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.409
 product we know the musts 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.359
 concentrates served as sweeteners 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.970
 along with the honey they were produced 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.669
 really delicious so it is born this way 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.709
 in ancient times even to sweeten 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.919
 somehow in a first phase 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.919
 probably from some sort of error it is 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.569
 the first fermentation process was born 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:16.180
 and from there it was understood that it was possible 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.250
 get an extraordinary product like 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.900
 the evolution of man were not 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.449
 intelligent 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.120
 teradata balsamic vinegar is a product 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.310
 which has a very narrow market of its own 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.320
 because from a quintal of grapes not 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.960
 we succeed in obtaining after two years 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.600
 maybe two liters of balsamic vinegar 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.620
 traditional and therefore it turns out really 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.740
 an absolute rarity 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.320
 the most precious product is obvious that the 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.240
 customer the consumer must approach 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.550
 to this product like all products 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.470
 imported looking for it directly at 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.050
 source and growing together with the product 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.660
 discovering in differences from 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.050
 products that try to mimic it of 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.039
 imitate it in a way that absolutely 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.590
 in short, inadequate is a question of 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.570
 palate absolutely if I will have it 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.110
 palace refinement to be able to 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.270
 to distinguish a 25-year-old balsamic class 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.639
 from a few years old to spilamberto 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.250
 in the balsamic house we go further 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.530
 4,000 tastings with visitors to us 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.970
 and I must say that virtually everyone 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.300
 when they taste balsamic 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.310
 true traditional discover the difference 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.110
 and they remember it and at that point we go back to 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:29.970
 spilamberto to find the path is 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:32.490
 well then i'm ready but the thing 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.210
 you are doing and balsamic home 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:39.030
 non-balsamic stravecchio of 25 years of 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.490
 12 here we can see the difference of 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.060
 color density that of flavors e 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.030
 scents 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.949
 we will be able to taste it after it seems the 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.810
 blood of san gennaro arrive a 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:54.210
 balsamic extravecchio was a kind of 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:56.400
 ignorant and therefore a secular miracle then 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.470
 you let me taste it or nine companies is 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.180
 better please francs 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.340
 a city at least 25 years old my mom 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.900
 watch put bad spoon that of a 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.669
 cycle mom my mom my mom my 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.380
 the Japanese are a bit like that 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.550
 if they dream about it 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.949
 I am convinced that the consumer the 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.050
 gourmet the enthusiast the gourmet 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.880
 should come is not the product that should 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.250
 travel man the woman they must 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:35.690
 travel to the product but when you do 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:37.800
 it's about this philosophy has qualities 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.300
 aphrodisiac and digestive 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.979
 anti-aging matilde of canossa 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.060
 he probably ate it from the Pope 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.360
 emperor 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.849
 that's why he put them together with canossa e 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.800
 at least she with the traditional balsamic of 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.800
 spilamberto instead make peace
