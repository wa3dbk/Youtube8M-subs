00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.879
 good in this video tutorial we are going to 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:11.519
 perform the recovery installation 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:14.940
 original for good so in case of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.540
 need to install it again because 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.650
 we have installed previously the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:26.220
 cwm recovery say that this one we're going 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.140
 to perform right now is the recovery 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 which is pre-installed in all 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.969
 phones with what good then in a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.300
 principle is that we will have something that 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.309
 we have changed it for him cwm recovery 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.510
 for this process we need the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.640
 application since we can find in 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.710
 www.cai.es in the downloads section or 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.710
 in the play store once downloaded the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 we open 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:00.370
 we go to the download section 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.130
 and we search and download the one that 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.030
 indicates official recovery in this case is 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.369
 a g4 b 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.120
 with which the content that is going to 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.290
 appear is only from this terminal 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.290
 we downloaded it 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.190
 once the download is finished we 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.550
 let's go to rom tools 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.880
 this part of installing recovery only 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.270
 appears if we are root in our 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.180
 terminal if not also in 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.040
 youtube channel you have a video 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.590
 tutorial or you have a couple of 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.420
 videotutorials to perform the routing 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.720
 of the terminal depending on the version 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.780
 Android that we have 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.020
 well once again in this menu at 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.370
 press the install recovery button 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.210
 a drop-down and a button appear 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.740
 unoccupied 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.520
 we open the drop-down and select 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.020
 in this case the recovery g4 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.470
 and the install recovery button is enabled 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.050
 we click on him 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.000
 once the process of 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.570
 installation asks us if we want 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.420
 restart in this case we will accept and 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.530
 to restart to verify that it has 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.530
 installed correctly 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.480
 and as we can see we see the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.319
 Android lying with admiration 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.670
 this is this is the aspect that the 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.099
 official or original recovery 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.680
 It varies depending on each terminal as 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.800
 good to show the menu of the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.620
 options is by pressing a button one or the other 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.040
 in this case in c4 is by pressing the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.200
 power button 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.560
 and we can access good to the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.860
 options provided by the recovery 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.320
 official 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.030
 and nothing to keep abreast of all 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.480

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.480
