00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.340 
be angle of opposite of our second tier
so<00:03:12.340> we're<00:03:12.459> going<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.640> start<00:03:12.880> with<00:03:13.000> our<00:03:13.350> angled

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
so we're going to start with our angled

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:25.100 
so we're going to start with our angled
spacer<00:03:15.840> slide<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:17.020> down<00:03:18.510> take<00:03:19.510> our<00:03:19.690> plate

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.530 

slide<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.260> over<00:03:26.380> then<00:03:27.280> we'll<00:03:27.430> take<00:03:27.610> our<00:03:27.640> second

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
slide it over then we'll take our second

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.590 
slide it over then we'll take our second
angled<00:03:29.140> spacer<00:03:30.959> on<00:03:31.959> top<00:03:33.239> then<00:03:34.239> we'll<00:03:34.390> take<00:03:34.570> our

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
angled spacer on top then we'll take our

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:44.930 
angled spacer on top then we'll take our
center<00:03:35.140> post<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:39.130> get<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.790> nice<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.060> tight

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.250 

and<00:03:45.940> as<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.180> can<00:03:46.300> see<00:03:46.360> here<00:03:46.870> I'm<00:03:47.050> not<00:03:47.200> using

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
and as you can see here I'm not using

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.110 
and as you can see here I'm not using
any<00:03:48.900> any<00:03:49.900> threaded<00:03:50.800> dowels<00:03:51.040> for<00:03:51.489> support

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
any any threaded dowels for support

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.030 
any any threaded dowels for support
because<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.750> really<00:03:53.110> doesn't<00:03:53.350> need<00:03:53.680> it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040
