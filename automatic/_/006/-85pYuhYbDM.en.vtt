00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.710
 DVD review with another trailer 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.780
 check or rather this check too 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.880
 at the new movie with joseph gordon levitt 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.469
 in the lead role but there also led 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:29.039
 even direct and with it we throw one 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:32.869
 short look at the families not 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.869
 my brothers and a sister 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.110
 I do not know what's serious yet 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.840
 honest teaser teaser not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.640
 really much except that you're in here 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.990
 joseph gordon levitt and the wonderful 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.120
 scarlett johansson together in 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.280
 a little teder little ted at the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.810
 front door may experience but here is the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.060
 story told in london by 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.410
 marcello materials played by joseph 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.970
 gordon levitt is a young man who 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.470
 that's enough 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.900
 His car is his flat over his money 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.100
 to the deficit numbers hang to the internet 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 porn and he is fine with that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.880
 Through life he can do one or the other 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.470
 Woman loosely towing at his 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.360
 That's why only don john means friends 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.890
 but really satisfying to those 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.690
 not as if he did 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.700
 internet porn looks like one though 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.900
 Day encounters a woman plays from 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.060
 scarlett johansson the turn 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.350
 is an idealist and a little more 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.330
 wants to be just a quick one 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 infraction namely mister right bites 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.750
 he also meets granite and above all 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.009
 He then also at the evening school one 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 woman played by julien only the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.369
 Actually rather like that and there 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.110
 he finds himself on two sides again 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.970
 and the question which is the right one 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.160
 and the whole thing is packed in here then 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 a romance comedy drama somewhere 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.210
 in between a romantic comedy 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.860
 if you will , I wonder what that is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.210
 joseph gordon levitt is working in 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.890
 this direction would have delivered 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.020
 such a thriller or psycho thriller 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.360
 action would have been more suited to him but 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.729
 one may be curious as don john 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.970
 is in ascot is correct that ascot 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.530

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.940
 I'm curious about German cinemas 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.590
