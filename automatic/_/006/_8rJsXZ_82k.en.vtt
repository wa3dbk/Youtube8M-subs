00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.010
 small announcement namely a fresh 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.270
 pressed facebook fanpage and homepage 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.850
 from focal point 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.080

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 Actually, I almost go out of it 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.399
 then you should love and support them 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.899
 with a small boat on the fanpage 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.770
