00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.340
 form we find ourselves today for 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.040

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.049

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.820
 the john rock form sturridge so that 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.650
 will go very very fast you go the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.750
 see in this episode you did not 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.760
 badly good waves we will not get 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.289
 hide it and go right away 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.150
 to see that anyway I really 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.019
 want to talk to you about something in this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.080
 episode it's the market crash that goes that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.980
 running away and day by day 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.180
 in the sense that the market and that's the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.440
 big brothel we honestly for the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 moment the market is the big mess 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.700
 prices are only falling relative 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.070
 to the players for example talking about the guys 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 like yaya shot i miss one of the guys 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.579
 as messi who went under the bar 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 from the million to the Latins went under the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.270
 million ronaldo bar has gone down well 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.890
 also finally all that kind of big 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.039
 players who cost more than 20 credit 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.660
 have dropped well and I hope in everything 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.059
 case that you thought to resell all 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.320
 your big players because if you 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.500
 plan to resell them during this 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.409
 septime of the season to buy you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 packs you risk losing a max 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.370
 credit so to explain everything to you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.440
 today is Wednesday and 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.850
 and tonight there will be the three 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.910
 teams of the season the first three 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.010
 and that's emotion 600 so it's in 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.330
 done it's the players who were the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.680
 more regular this season but who 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.040
 have not had a booster card yet 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.340
 having treatment at odds modes 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.010
 consistent 1 in silver bronze but 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.170
 also in gold so in my opinion it will be 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.480
 maybe not the best teams will be 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.600
 not the one of the best teams of 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.090
 the season on the nine who will I have 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.610
 believe it seems to me or 7 I remember 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.290
 more about the cool but me what can I 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.550
 advise you to wait for the most 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.600
 big team of the season that is to say 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.830
 where there will be the liga bbva 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.960
 even league 1 if that you 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.160
 especially interested the first league 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.530
 because the first league that risk 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.910
 be very expensive and now tell me 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.160
 in the comments if you count 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.180
 buy packs years this team of the 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.500
 season and and that's saying far in the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.710
 comments me anyway I think the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.480
 make 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.850
 tell me in the comments if that 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.410
 you would also like me to do 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.530
 an opening pack during this team of 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.070
 the season or tell me during which 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.880
 anyway 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.450
 and I thought I was waiting for the first 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.190
 league 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.570
 afterwards to you to tell me in the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.739
 comments what do you prefer if 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.390
 you prefer right now 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.290
 I'm waiting for the first league not 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.630
 tell me all this in the comments 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.880
 it will be downright simpler so as 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.190
 you could see an excellent wave 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.750
 with that particular bronze players 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.560
 with booster players so what 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.840
 I did it is that of a minimum price 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.070
 I put five thousand helping maximum price 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.920
 in fact I put the number of credits 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.750
 that I had and I came across very 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.680
 good offer 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.630
 there are even fake people do 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.030
 overbidding is not even so I 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.310
 their cost was 8000 more so 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.350
 this is a technique that I have 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.130
 discovered by chance because here I am 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.720
 I said to myself here is a bronze player 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.670
 booster it is above 5 credit 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.190
 so here I did a little bit like 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.260
 as I felt I put 80 me and 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.959
 in short I found that so I was rather 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.360
 happy and do not hesitate to test it 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.610
 after all the teams of the season 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.069
 so there are a lot of people who 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.409
 also ask for my comments 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.389
 when is it necessary to rebuild a team and 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.799
 all that to rebuild a team 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.730
 me what can I advise you this and 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.560
 his 2 to wait for the latest team of 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.519
 the season ie even the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.989
 very last 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.310
 if not if you remember well 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.260
 last year there was one last 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.819
 timos of cydia we he had grouped together in 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.439
 did it was a team actually there 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.340
 had all the best cards 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.769
 17.6 you remember there was beautiful 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.760
 blue vidal blue all that I know 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.870
 What I advise you is to buy 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.980
 your team 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.810
 at this point in the middle of the week 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.129
 like that you're going to make a max of 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.169
 good if you sell it and 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.790
 few weeks after seeing that there 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.439
 will have the prices that go totally 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.269
 raise again so that's what I can 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.730
 advise you to do so as you 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.219
 can see we've already arrived at 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.449
 our height and jean shape so in 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.919
 four episodes is fun it's 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.150
 true that I really wanted to hurry 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.310
 to be able to offer you a pack 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.660
 opening as soon as possible on this 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.310
 team of the season so I'll see 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.630
 when I proposed this to you anyway 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.160

 comments one of the players let's say between 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.110
 100 and 200 thousand credit that could be 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.120
 friendly 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.500

 and why not choose a 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.650
 team player adds up that could 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.000
