00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.339
 and good this thing that it harms is 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.770
 comments I bring gameplay from black ops 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.480
 all and many of you have asked me for a 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.420
 half more or less talking about what is 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.920
 what all this dlc has looked like and 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.490
 Well the truth is that I also had 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.350
 something to talk about because custom 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.900
 that they are taking out new times mediating 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.930
 mind that what are the things that I 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.580
 like to go to give what are the ones that do not 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.470
 lately I do not know why I'm like no 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.410
 know how to explain the truth is , 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.170
 it's not that it's burned as a known 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.520
 any game that is shopping so 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.190
 say competitive 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.760
 face to upload it to youtube I explain 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.230
 that is to say I am playing I know any 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.120
 another game to improved the far cry or 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.530
 any game where I am alone 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.780
 others me playing with people in white a 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.220
 friend I hope so to speak 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.640
 cooperative no more than more than 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.110
 competitive is to say a little more like 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.120
 for the image that there is in youtube is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.190
 say because I do not like to play these 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.659
 games but because game let's say there's 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.610
 many games that did not even come to 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.619
 upload any video but what I 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.909
 refers is that I do not know when it is a 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.590
 part of youtube always someone expects 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.869
 like which eye has to be the best and if not 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040
 I do this and that and the moment you go up 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.659
 any other video that has nothing 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.740
 what to do with demonstrating is the best because 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.630
 I have already told you a thousand times that in which 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.280
 my games, let's look better 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.900
 simply your games that I like and 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.159
 games that are better these that are 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.710
 worse than the funniest of others that 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.110
 they are less but I try to be let's say 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.970
 that entertaining problems that I 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.979
 would like to see is to say games in the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.270
 which if suddenly someone not 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.860
 appreciate listening to me ways so I can 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.380
 flip me and just see the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.820
 games is what I say 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.149
 good as it is to say it any time 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.500
 that I go up as I say farcry or any 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.100
 game if the best of the areas in the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.140
 which I do not speak practically anything 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.210
 let's say that about a good game of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.619
 nothing simply, even if it's entertaining 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.740
 not because those videos are the ones that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.149
 tend to like and also when 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.220
 example I upload zombies that is not for nothing 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.720
 be the best or anything like that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.670
 it's just to laugh or laugh 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.590
 when I play with someone because those 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.509
 videos that you like more generally not 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.590
 I say I say it for the views but what 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.119
 it's generally because it's clear that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.310
 a lot of people who watch my videos and do not 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.590
 is subscribed another so much that sees my 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.120
 videos and not even because we see that neither 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.160
 they even vote and comment 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.480
 nothing, but I am aware of 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.680
 that there are a lot of people who see the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.410
 videos more than anything because the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.910
 statistics that watch the videos and do not 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.190
 commit more with the channel is not to say 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.360
 watch videos and you are done yet with 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.069
 others 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.560
 let's say that any other type of 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.870
 games that are not 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.170
 let's say competitive so to speak 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.590
 there is as much better roll in terms of 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.420
 whether it's me according to a video of a world 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.670
 truck that maybe less people by the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.280
 people who see it I do not know how to say it is 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.750
 like good vibes in general that would be the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.360
 word that is breathed as a 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.310
 atmosphere like that of an equal 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.560
 tranquility of all of good vibes not 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.260
 just be able to with the minecraft channel in 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.300
 which but it's comments and I think 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.550
 I do not even know if there's more to the image 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.380
 people who drink from Latin America that 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.290
 of people from Spain for example and without 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.170
 But I've never seen anyone fight 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.000
 of let's say that among them is to say 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.100
 anyone any time that 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.049
 example I'm a comments implies 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.780
 in that fight about being a Spaniard 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.910
 Spanish between a Spanish and even not 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.980
 because you are from another country or anything because of 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.569
 style but simply by any 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.910
 foolishness among Spaniards there is always 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.200
 fights between the people of Spain always 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.660
 there are some insulting each other even 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.269
 inside we indicate that we the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.769
 own others these same people from 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.750
 Spain that insults because factors of 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.890
 cataluÃ±a then I do not know that you this country 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.290
 that is to say 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.390
 not only that the people of Latin America 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.220
 They are much more receptive to the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.870
 statistics that I have on the channel in 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.490
 the two channels the people of 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.620
 Latin America votes much more videos 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.150
 they comment more much more active the 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.950
 comments are more positive and it is what 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.360
 what do I tell you or almost never do 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.010
 that someone has entered and not even 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.930
 subscribed that well because there is some 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.140
 friend was found to like or have 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.340
 tweeted some video of me and all the people 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.050
 that usually comes from Latin America never 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.090
 has seen insulting one who says to 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.069
 asshole is not that these I do not know how many 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.540
 because people that maybe are not me 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.480
 but it's not finished with that 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.180
 because some friend has entered but is 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.660
 what is what I say to you or I do not know by 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.190
 what is that is not that is that culture that 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.060
 we obviously have a 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.440
 video I'm not going to say it was to change 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.000
 nothing but I want you to give yourself 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.460
 realize that when you go to a channel and 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.620
 then you observe the miners, not if you go to 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.419
 my minecraft mayor channel that 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.610
 I have then there you can see 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.200
 perfectly that is the people who enter 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.280
 vote to videos facebook people 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.480
 for example I have a lot more people in 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.150
 Facebook 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.580
 from Latin America than from Spain ' 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.730
 let's say that after this I do not know how to say it 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.810
 simply that I do not know what happens to us 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.250
 Spanish albert data 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.700
 I would love to know it honestly 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.710
 because we are like this or that represents 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.000
 especially the feeling and I do not say it 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.970
 what's talked about with a lot of people 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.860
 of youtubers and others and friends that is 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.480
 what they say or when here for 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.100
 example a Spaniard of dalea we like a 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.780
 video of you a comment and other French 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.940
 like you have to be a debt in 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.630
 an eternal debt in plan 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.460
 thanks for forever and I do not know 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.840
 it's like that's another mindset 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.880
 totally different the truth is that no 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.040
 for more but could not explain 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.540
 simply restricting because it 's that 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.270
 are the statistics is there no longer what 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.740
 I said practically some time ago 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.290
 times and looking more because the people of 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.970
 minecraft, more and more people follow me 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.520
 latin america and asia countries of mexico 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.530
 colombia argentina venezuela are also 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.570
 the countries with more than I mentioned you but 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.870
 practically everywhere the truth 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.580
 that is not like a lot of countries 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.500
 all mixed and all super happy 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.460
 in a channel, it's main, so 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.500
 say it in gal of colombia 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.539
 there are a lot more people from a single country 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.080
 that is to say from Spain and all I see are 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:57.440
 bad rolls and things that I do not know is like 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.330
 the air that is breathed is a video that 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.150
 well thanks wilberto thank you very much 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.069
 thank you very much that is everything is very not 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.810
 I would know how to say it but it's like very 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.180
 good vibes not if you are going to be us 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.340
 youtubers in which I say that 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.009
 I'm still on twitter and they say the same and all 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.229
 let's say that quite agree is 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.139
 simply simply that I do not know 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.449
 why are we so ungrateful 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.880
 and I include myself or is it simply something 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.530
 that we have here that something is wrong 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.210
 that we have and let's say it's the way 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.039
 with which what we have been educated 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.020
 but what is breathed therefore in the 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.000
 television or whatever I do not know why 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.220
 will be but we have that your reason will have 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.199
 because it is not that you are as a person or 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.050
 I as a person but it is once like 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.060
 the culture that is here is not where the 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.070
 envy is what reigns where if someone 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.300
 they do something to you because if you do not earn anything it's 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.370
 super good but the moment that 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.050
 getting something is not cool anymore because 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.699
 we always want to feel like 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.250
 on top of others it is not a bit like that 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.030
 like a bit strange and what I say 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.200
 I do not know why 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.550
 is a reason why yes but this is 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.620
 What I have proven most is that 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.380
 you will be there that is there from youtube 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.570
 That's what I could have done the most 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.190
 observe so well I do not know what you 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.210
 it seems to you if you have noticed it 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.120

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.420

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.680
 ways to speak the way of all the 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:30.110

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.120
 Latin America that country that is good 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.470

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.630
