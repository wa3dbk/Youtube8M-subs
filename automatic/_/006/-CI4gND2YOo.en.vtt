00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.760 

I'll<00:02:45.760> leave<00:02:45.940> everything<00:02:46.540> where<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.380> and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
I'll leave everything where it is and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.430 
I'll leave everything where it is and
you're<00:02:48.400> gonna<00:02:48.490> put<00:02:48.730> your<00:02:48.790> pinkie<00:02:49.180> down<00:02:49.330> on<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
those notes slice the bottom four

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.030 
those notes slice the bottom four
strings<00:02:54.460> now<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:59.080> that's<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.470> basic<00:02:59.890> idea

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
strings now so so that's the basic idea

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.150 
strings now so so that's the basic idea
for<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.490> wrist<00:03:00.730> suddenly<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:01.240> slightly<00:03:01.540> so

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.620 

then<00:03:06.160> just<00:03:06.340> go<00:03:06.460> back<00:03:06.490> down<00:03:06.700> take<00:03:07.270> your<00:03:07.390> pinkie

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
then just go back down take your pinkie

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.960 
then just go back down take your pinkie
finger<00:03:07.660> off<00:03:07.990> two<00:03:08.260> more<00:03:08.410> times<00:03:11.310> that's<00:03:12.310> pretty

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
finger off two more times that's pretty

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.420 
finger off two more times that's pretty
much<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.300> entire<00:03:13.660> idea<00:03:14.020> for<00:03:14.860> over<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.280> 1

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
much the entire idea for over the 1

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.980 
much the entire idea for over the 1
chord<00:03:15.700> over<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.940> e<00:03:15.970> chord<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.450> do<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.750> over

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
chord over the e chord just do that over

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:31.230 
chord over the e chord just do that over
and<00:03:17.080> over<00:03:17.170> again<00:03:29.520> for<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.610> first<00:03:30.850> four

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
and over again for the first four

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.880 
and over again for the first four
measures<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.930> irregular<00:03:32.260> 12<00:03:32.500> bar<00:03:32.860> blues
