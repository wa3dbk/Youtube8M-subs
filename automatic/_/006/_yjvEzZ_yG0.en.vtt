open up minecraft for I'm assuming you
have<00:00:50.340> played<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> there'll<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.989> 1.6<00:00:52.649> point

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
have played it there'll be a 1.6 point

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.100 
have played it there'll be a 1.6 point
to<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> use<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.059> forage<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.449> jizz

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to here or if you use to forage for jizz

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.790 
to here or if you use to forage for jizz
right<00:00:55.289> here<00:00:55.610> now<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.199> actually<00:00:58.199> think<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
right here now I actually think that you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.369 
right here now I actually think that you
should<00:00:59.030> drag<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.180> file<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.050> put<00:01:01.289> on

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
should drag this file out and put on

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.630 
should drag this file out and put on
your<00:01:01.440> desktop<00:01:01.800> or<00:01:01.920> selling<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
your desktop or selling so you have a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820 
your desktop or selling so you have a
backup<00:01:03.049> just<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.260> case<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.500> screw<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> up

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
backup just in case you screw it up

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.710 
backup just in case you screw it up
because<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.159> force<00:01:05.460> updating<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.060> takes<00:01:06.299> way

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
because it's force updating it takes way

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.390 
because it's force updating it takes way
longer<00:01:07.020> than<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:07.920> dragging<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
longer than just you know dragging it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.969 
longer than just you know dragging it
back<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.720> make<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> copy<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.799> and

back in so just make a copy of this and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.200 
back in so just make a copy of this and
put<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.189> somewhere<00:01:11.220> else<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> folder
