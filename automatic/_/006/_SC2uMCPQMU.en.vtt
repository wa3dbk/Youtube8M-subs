00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
lived it you know you have a agrarian

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.480 
lived it you know you have a agrarian
would<00:04:42.229> have<00:04:42.350> grown<00:04:42.500> all<00:04:42.710> their<00:04:42.830> own<00:04:42.919> food<00:04:43.190> in

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
would have grown all their own food in

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.659 
would have grown all their own food in
small<00:04:44.150> spaces<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.750> live<00:04:44.900> just<00:04:45.139> fine<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:46.160> we

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
small spaces and live just fine and we

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:47.920 
small spaces and live just fine and we
don't<00:04:46.850> we<00:04:47.120> don't<00:04:47.270> know<00:04:47.389> that<00:04:47.630> because<00:04:47.780> we're

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
don't we don't know that because we're

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.270 
don't we don't know that because we're
not<00:04:47.960> taught<00:04:48.169> history<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.680> so<00:04:48.770> we<00:04:48.860> think<00:04:48.889> this

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
not taught history and so we think this

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.540 
not taught history and so we think this
is<00:04:49.490> how<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:49.729> have<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.180> do<00:04:50.360> it
