00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.950 
pretty good they surpassed my
expectations<00:01:52.290> by<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.610> lot<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.330> thought<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
expectations by a lot I thought the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.230 
expectations by a lot I thought the
hushpuppy<00:01:55.650> coating<00:01:56.010> was<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.520> pretty

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
hushpuppy coating was going to be pretty

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.180 
hushpuppy coating was going to be pretty
soft<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.020> actually<00:01:58.200> stayed<00:01:58.590> really

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
soft but it actually stayed really

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.249 
soft but it actually stayed really
crispy<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> first<00:02:00.390> flavors<00:02:00.900> that<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.049> got

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
crispy so the first flavors that I got

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.680 
crispy so the first flavors that I got
right<00:02:01.440> away<00:02:01.650> I<00:02:01.860> got<00:02:02.670> some<00:02:02.880> sweetness<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.509> guess

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
right away I got some sweetness I guess

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.170 
right away I got some sweetness I guess
it's<00:02:03.869> probably<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.979> shrimp<00:02:05.369> parm<00:02:05.700> what

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.609 
they have in the hushpuppy the hushpuppy
taste<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.929> standard<00:02:09.929> hush<00:02:10.140> puppy<00:02:10.470> which
