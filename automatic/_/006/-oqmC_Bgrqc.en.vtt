stream<00:03:31.860> yeah<00:03:32.489> sometimes<00:03:33.120> if<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:34.140> not<00:03:34.380> if<00:03:34.530> it

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
stream yeah sometimes if it's not if it

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.890 
stream yeah sometimes if it's not if it
all<00:03:34.920> else<00:03:35.190> fails<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:35.880> taking<00:03:36.480> all<00:03:36.690> your

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
all else fails and you taking all your

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.690 
all else fails and you taking all your
keys<00:03:37.170> out<00:03:37.410> you've<00:03:37.650> done<00:03:37.920> everything<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.580> can

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
keys out you've done everything you can

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.550 
keys out you've done everything you can
be<00:03:38.910> managed<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.239> can<00:03:39.390> think<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.780> there's

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
be managed you can think of there's

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.620 
be managed you can think of there's
another<00:03:40.980> option<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.269> could<00:03:42.510> be

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
another option because it could be

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.729 
another option because it could be
there's<00:03:42.810> something<00:03:43.019> wrong<00:03:43.140> with<00:03:43.290> your<00:03:43.410> screen

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
there's something wrong with your screen

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.440 
there's something wrong with your screen
so<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.070> make<00:03:44.370> paper<00:03:44.880> let's<00:03:45.180> called

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
so you just make paper let's called

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.870 
so you just make paper let's called
screen<00:03:45.810> recalibration<00:03:46.709> at<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.400> point<00:03:47.700> shall

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
screen recalibration at this point shall

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.400 
screen recalibration at this point shall
we<00:03:47.970> plug<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.269> back<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.600> erie<00:03:48.750> see<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:49.260> it's

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
we plug it back in erie see if it's

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.440 
we plug it back in erie see if it's
working<00:03:49.590> age<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.040> might<00:03:50.459> work<00:03:50.640> now<00:03:50.850> let's<00:03:51.239> do<00:03:51.420> a

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
working age it might work now let's do a

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.490 
working age it might work now let's do a
little<00:03:51.600> bit<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.959> know<00:03:53.959> that<00:03:54.959> think<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.350> i

think that did it yeah I can definitely
see<00:03:57.959> how<00:03:58.170> much<00:03:58.290> more<00:03:58.500> flexible<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.160> screen<00:03:59.430> is

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
see how much more flexible the screen is

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.449 
see how much more flexible the screen is
