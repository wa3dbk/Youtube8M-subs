00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and over you're getting an example of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.640 
and over you're getting an example of
that<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.960> tick<00:01:10.110> top<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:10.500> doing

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that this little tick top that I'm doing

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.990 
that this little tick top that I'm doing
there<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:11.010> doing<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> rhythm<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> right

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
there I'm doing a rhythm of the right

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.719 
there I'm doing a rhythm of the right
hand<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.409> making<00:01:13.710> things<00:01:14.130> sound<00:01:14.369> cool

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
hand and it's making things sound cool

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.420 
hand and it's making things sound cool
and<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.509> I've<00:01:15.630> discovered<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.950> have

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and what I've discovered is if you have

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.890 
and what I've discovered is if you have
a<00:01:17.460> really<00:01:17.790> good<00:01:17.880> right<00:01:18.090> hand<00:01:18.299> technique<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
a really good right hand technique you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
a really good right hand technique you
don't<00:01:18.930> actually<00:01:19.320> need<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.920> much<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
don't actually need to do much with the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.060 
don't actually need to do much with the
left<00:01:20.820> hand<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.900> you're<00:01:22.140> doing<00:01:22.409> let's<00:01:22.860> say

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
left hand so if you're doing let's say

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
left hand so if you're doing let's say
you're<00:01:23.369> doing<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.700> funky<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.299> minor<00:01:24.720> pentatonic

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you're doing a funky a minor pentatonic

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.890 
you're doing a funky a minor pentatonic
scale<00:01:25.740> shape<00:01:25.860> that's<00:01:26.280> done<00:01:26.520> scale<00:01:26.850> shape<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
scale shape that's done scale shape is

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.990 
scale shape that's done scale shape is
the<00:01:28.110> first<00:01:28.380> girl<00:01:28.680> shape<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> ear<00:01:29.400> where<00:01:29.939> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the first girl shape the ear where I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.160 
the first girl shape the ear where I
teach<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> first<00:01:30.840> pentatonic<00:01:31.439> shape

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
teach you to the first pentatonic shape

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.290 
teach you to the first pentatonic shape
and<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:34.010> play<00:01:34.190> along<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.670> jam<00:01:34.880> track<00:01:35.060> that's

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
maybe in the key of a then what I would

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.490 
maybe in the key of a then what I would
do<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.610> just<00:01:37.640> pick<00:01:37.940> one<00:01:38.120> note<00:01:38.360> maybe<00:01:39.110> just<00:01:39.380> the

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
starting to get funky and so we just

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.750 
starting to get funky and so we just
placed<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.960> within<00:04:32.140> our<00:04:32.410> strums<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:36.430> I'm<00:04:36.490> going

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
placed it within our strums so I'm going

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.750 
placed it within our strums so I'm going
down<00:04:36.940> that's<00:04:37.090> constantly<00:04:37.630> then<00:04:38.260> yeah<00:04:38.760> there's

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
down that's constantly then yeah there's

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.400 
down that's constantly then yeah there's
a<00:04:39.789> note<00:04:39.940> on<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.180> up<00:04:40.360> there<00:04:40.630> then<00:04:40.870> it's<00:04:41.020> hard<00:04:41.229> to

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
a note on it up there then it's hard to

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.140 
a note on it up there then it's hard to
do<00:04:41.530> when<00:04:41.680> you<00:04:41.770> first<00:04:41.950> try<00:04:42.250> this<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.610> note<00:04:43.000> on<00:04:43.030> the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
do when you first try this a note on the

do when you first try this a note on the
up<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.810> you're<00:04:43.960> muting<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.289> string<00:04:44.590> can<00:04:45.130> be

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
up and you're muting a string can be

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.770 
up and you're muting a string can be
trickier<00:04:45.640> than<00:04:45.669> you're<00:04:45.910> doing<00:04:45.940> a<00:04:46.210> downstroke

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
trickier than you're doing a downstroke

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.000 
trickier than you're doing a downstroke
you'll<00:04:47.020> see<00:04:47.200> what<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.350> mean<00:04:47.410> when<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:47.650> try<00:04:47.950> this

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
you'll see what I mean when you try this

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.050 
you'll see what I mean when you try this
so<00:04:50.100> now<00:04:51.100> what<00:04:51.250> I'm<00:04:51.340> doing<00:04:51.520> with<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.669> left<00:04:51.850> hand

so now what I'm doing with the left hand
is<00:04:52.240> I'm<00:04:52.360> relaxing<00:04:52.810> my<00:04:52.870> fingers<00:04:53.320> it's<00:04:53.530> very

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
subtle here but then we don't want the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.750 
subtle here but then we don't want the
note<00:04:55.870> I<00:04:56.050> just<00:04:56.080> see<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.770> put<00:04:57.160> tension<00:04:57.400> on<00:04:57.639> the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
note I just see I put tension on the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
note and then I relax the note when I

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.860 
note and then I relax the note when I
don't<00:04:59.830> want<00:05:00.039> it<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.220> be<00:05:00.340> unlike<00:05:00.639> so<00:05:01.150> we<00:05:01.690> don't

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
don't want it to be unlike so we don't

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.360

and then from there you can develop more
funky<00:06:32.860> things<00:06:33.100> but<00:06:33.669> you<00:06:33.759> don't<00:06:33.970> actually<00:06:34.090> need
