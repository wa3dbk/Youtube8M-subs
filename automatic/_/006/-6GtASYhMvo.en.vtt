what's called local sensing that is our
vacuum<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.130> see<00:00:14.309> what<00:00:14.549> location<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.269> in

vacuum can see what location it is in

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.220 
vacuum can see what location it is in
and<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.619> see<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.460> what's<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.900> in

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and it can see the what's going on in

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.080 
and it can see the what's going on in
the<00:00:19.350> current<00:00:19.619> location<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.550> whether

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the current location that is whether

the current location that is whether
there's<00:00:21.390> dirt<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> current<00:00:22.230> location<00:00:22.320> or

there's dirt in the current location or

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.189 
there's dirt in the current location or
not<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> can't<00:00:24.060> see<00:00:24.240> anything<00:00:24.810> about

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
not but I can't see anything about

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.509 
not but I can't see anything about
whether<00:00:25.500> there's<00:00:25.800> dirt<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.160> any<00:00:26.340> other

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
whether there's dirt in any other

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.589 
whether there's dirt in any other
location<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:29.070> here's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.369> partial<00:00:29.670> diagram<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
location so here's a partial diagram of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.010 
location so here's a partial diagram of
the<00:00:31.399> part<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.669> belief<00:00:33.059> state<00:00:33.329> from<00:00:33.960> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the part of the belief state from that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.729 
the part of the belief state from that
world<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.940> wanted<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.719> show<00:00:36.960> how<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
world and I wanted to show how the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.889 
world and I wanted to show how the
belief<00:00:38.070> state<00:00:38.219> unfolds<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.270> two<00:00:39.629> things

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
belief state unfolds as two things

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.600 
belief state unfolds as two things
happen<00:00:40.340> first<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:42.059> take<00:00:42.300> action<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.770> we

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
happen first as we take action so we

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.119 
happen first as we take action so we
start<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.210> state<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:46.320> move<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.950> take

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
start in this state and we move we take

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.930 
start in this state and we move we take
the<00:00:47.250> action<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.850> right<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:49.730> in<00:00:50.730> this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the action of going right and in this

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.010 
the action of going right and in this
case<00:00:51.530> we<00:00:52.530> still<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:52.920> from<00:00:53.219> two<00:00:53.690> world<00:00:54.690> states

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
case we still go from two world states

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.040 
case we still go from two world states
in<00:00:55.199> our<00:00:55.289> belief<00:00:55.530> state<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.489> two<00:00:56.640> new<00:00:56.879> ones<00:00:57.059> but

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
in our belief state to two new ones but

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.770 
in our belief state to two new ones but
then<00:00:58.320> after<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.520> action<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.660> an

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
then after we do in action we do an

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
then after we do in action we do an
observation<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> act<00:01:02.489> per<00:01:03.000> step

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
observation we have the act per step

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.450 
observation we have the act per step
cycle<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.769> once<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
cycle and now once we get the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.240 
cycle and now once we get the
observation<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.750> split<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.200> world<00:01:07.650> we

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
observation we can split that world we

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
observation we can split that world we
can<00:01:08.400> split<00:01:08.580> our<00:01:08.760> belief<00:01:09.000> state<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.869> say<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.650> we

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
can split our belief state to say if we

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.060 
can split our belief state to say if we
observe<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:12.420> we're<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.200> location<00:01:13.710> B<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
observe that we're in location B and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.660 
observe that we're in location B and
it's<00:01:14.189> dirty

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it's dirty

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.490 
it's dirty
then<00:01:15.150> we're<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.450> we're<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> belief

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
then we're now we're in this belief

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
then we're now we're in this belief
state<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.159> which<00:01:17.490> happens<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.030> exactly

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
state here which happens to have exactly

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.200 
state here which happens to have exactly
one<00:01:18.810> world<00:01:19.350> state<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.030> observe

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
one world state in it and if we observe

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
one world state in it and if we observe
that<00:01:21.840> we're<00:01:22.020> clean<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.159> whether

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that we're clean then we know whether

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.920 
that we're clean then we know whether
we're<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.729> state<00:01:23.850> which<00:01:24.479> also<00:01:24.659> has

we're in this state which also has

exactly 1 in it now what is the Act

exactly one other one that's what we

the<00:01:58.649> world<00:01:58.829> what<00:01:59.280> we're<00:01:59.430> doing<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.759> we're

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the world what we're doing is we're

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.760 
the world what we're doing is we're
taking<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> current<00:02:00.750> belief<00:02:01.079> state<00:02:01.380> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
taking in the current belief state and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.270 
taking in the current belief state and
partitioning<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:03.000> into<00:02:03.360> pieces

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
partitioning it up into pieces

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.190 
partitioning it up into pieces
observations<00:02:05.280> alone<00:02:05.640> can't<00:02:06.090> introduce<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.869> new

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
observations alone can't introduce a new

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.320 
observations alone can't introduce a new
state<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.890> new<00:02:08.129> world<00:02:08.340> state<00:02:08.640> into<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> belief

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
state a new world state into the belief

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.830 
state a new world state into the belief
state<00:02:09.629> all<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.679> do<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.430> say<00:02:11.720> some<00:02:12.720> of

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
state all they can do is say some of

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.790 
state all they can do is say some of
them<00:02:12.959> go<00:02:13.140> here

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
them go here

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.310 
them go here
and<00:02:13.980> some<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.340> them<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.550> go<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:15.020> now<00:02:16.020> maybe

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
and some of them to go here now maybe

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.980 
and some of them to go here now maybe
that<00:02:16.590> for<00:02:16.770> some<00:02:16.970> observation<00:02:18.000> all<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.780> belief

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
that for some observation all the belief

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.890 
that for some observation all the belief
states<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.470> into<00:02:19.770> one<00:02:19.950> bin<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.630> make<00:02:21.780> an

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
states go into one bin and so we make an

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.240 
states go into one bin and so we make an
observation<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.620> don't<00:02:22.800> learn<00:02:22.920> anything

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
observation that we don't learn anything

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.880 
observation that we don't learn anything
new<00:02:23.430> but<00:02:24.360> at<00:02:24.480> least<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.840> observation<00:02:25.470> can't

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
new but at least the observation can't

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.800 
new but at least the observation can't
make<00:02:26.340> us<00:02:26.520> more<00:02:26.820> confused<00:02:27.330> than<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.660> were

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
make us more confused than we were

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.340 
make us more confused than we were
before<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.620> observation
