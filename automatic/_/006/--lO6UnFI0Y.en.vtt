been slightly louder it's clear but it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.090

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.409 
now during my gaming review with this
phone<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.680> found<00:04:52.220> temperatures<00:04:52.850> right<00:04:53.180> through

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
phone I found temperatures right through

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.010 
phone I found temperatures right through
about<00:04:53.600> 40<00:04:54.020> to<00:04:54.139> 42<00:04:54.440> degrees<00:04:54.889> centigrade<00:04:55.040> and

about 40 to 42 degrees centigrade and

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.050 
about 40 to 42 degrees centigrade and
then<00:04:57.020> thermal<00:04:57.500> throttling<00:04:57.740> begins<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:58.970> you

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
then thermal throttling begins so you

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.939 
then thermal throttling begins so you
can<00:04:59.240> see<00:04:59.479> Nova<00:04:59.690> 3<00:05:00.020> lagging<00:05:00.500> here<00:05:00.710> quite<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.370> bit

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949

throttling<00:06:00.260> begins<00:06:00.889> and<00:06:01.100> you<00:06:01.520> see<00:06:01.760> a<00:06:01.789> lot<00:06:02.060> of

lag which I can now see in modern combat
5<00:06:05.990> as<00:06:06.200> well<00:06:11.139> but<00:06:12.139> other<00:06:12.380> than<00:06:12.590> that<00:06:12.729> this<00:06:13.729> phone

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030

can basically play all the games that

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.670 
can basically play all the games that
you<00:06:16.010> throw<00:06:16.280> at<00:06:16.430> it<00:06:16.599> but<00:06:17.599> some<00:06:17.900> games<00:06:18.229> you<00:06:18.500> would

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
you throw at it but some games you would

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.120 
you throw at it but some games you would
observe<00:06:19.220> a<00:06:19.460> bit<00:06:20.150> of<00:06:20.330> lag<00:06:20.720> as<00:06:20.960> you<00:06:21.650> see<00:06:21.889> in

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
observe a bit of lag as you see in

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:32.540 
observe a bit of lag as you see in
modern<00:06:22.580> combat<00:06:22.820> 5<00:06:23.210> and<00:06:24.430> over<00:06:25.430> 3<00:06:25.669> as<00:06:25.849> well

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.010 

now<00:06:33.550> there<00:06:33.760> are<00:06:33.790> software<00:06:34.330> side<00:06:34.780> of<00:06:34.840> things

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
now there are software side of things

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.990 
now there are software side of things
which<00:06:35.560> can<00:06:35.800> be<00:06:36.010> fixed<00:06:36.280> by<00:06:36.400> cyanogen

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
which can be fixed by cyanogen

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.690 
which can be fixed by cyanogen
themselves<00:06:37.510> or<00:06:37.800> you<00:06:38.800> can<00:06:38.920> simply<00:06:39.160> root<00:06:39.490> this

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
themselves or you can simply root this

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.620 
themselves or you can simply root this
phone<00:06:39.760> and<00:06:40.210> tweak<00:06:41.020> yourself<00:06:42.210> now<00:06:43.210> this<00:06:43.330> is<00:06:43.510> the
