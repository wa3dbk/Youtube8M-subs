00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:19.810
 it is what more did he kilometer 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.810
 stay upright ok 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.779
 Here we go over to slow this down 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.460
 is the foot brake kicking must start 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.140
 inside is not good at all 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.520
 simultaneously with the hoe on the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.920
 gas pedal is ok you can also with 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.910
 then brake a foot with the heel 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.910
 are you also from the danger area 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.699
 if you can put the handbrake on 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.800
 you support her with the foot 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.870
 then there is another rush 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.140
 It is important that you put on the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.729
 jack leaves free 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.190
 even when you let go with the foot short 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.549
 support with a short press then 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:06.790
 it is easy and always makes 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:08.380
 again I have one here 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.750
 annoying whistling sound built-in 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:17.409
 but he goes so far in the engine noise 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.390
 Driving under the mountain is important 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.470
 that you also have the handbrake in your hand 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.210
 take it as you would in the driving school 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.970
 have learned if you do not do that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.700
 and keeps the tractor with the foot giving 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.760
 the tractor at the beginning of pressure then 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.320
 the hand brake is pure 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.330
 Therefore, please brake in the hand 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.330
 voser glass and slowly pass 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.120
 gaspedal once once failed here 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.120

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.740
 hand gas on full throttle weather started 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.690
 then you take back the hand guest so 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.320
 at about 10 o'clock has a bit 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.630
 play 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.979

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.570
 the lower the lower the more 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.220
 less it pushes the backup and 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.340
 the gears are easier to turn 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.220
 Ok turned off the engine in the man 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.769
 completely over death at 12 o'clock no more fuel 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.690
 it is better to go in the castle 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.420

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.420

 remove the key and into the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.810
 economical if you do not have it 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.400

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.049
 goes back there is in it 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.420

 switch first level is bloom second 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:47.980
 stage possible leave it if you 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.549
 On the way, we reach 30 seconds 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.290
 green and afterwards for the occasion 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.719
 we glock so you resist 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.700
 in the cool and blooming for that 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:02.040
 keep second level out with it 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.620
 Starter exactly cows last 30 seconds 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.439
 then do you start so long is that 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.689
 Red Charge Control will go off ok if 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.769
 the engine runs out fast 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:16.569
 enough you can let go of the district 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.909
 important to me is still if you the state 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.859
 once you have released your finger far away 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.840
 do not pull again does not have any 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.029
 again cause serious companions including the 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.739
 starter in the burn engine no 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.739
 ugly noise from the gear-take 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:38.120
 therefore would have to be blinkers or black 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.879
 Knead down shows tablet and you see 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.870

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.870

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.739
 OK 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.480
 to reverse gear is 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.620
 left front 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.710
 you drive forward with the second one 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:08.060
 and then slowly switches to the third one 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.650
 times short break so I will times from I 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.110
 really the tractor a bit 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.410
 while being switched on is slow in 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.910
 the ears well if you you're in the third 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.920
 that you go to your 310 as soon as possible 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.140
 km / h come is the air cooled is the 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.450
 it also needs it as air flow 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:29.510
 The oil pressure is ok if you are in the factory 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.770
 stallion fix steinberg then you will 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.650
 very quickly notice that the porsche 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.510
 not much power if you have less than 10 km 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.520
 h are you coming to torment third 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.410

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.820
 double clutch and intergas if it is 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.890

 Standstill and field moves in the second 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.400
 Just start again 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.940
 to the strong 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.940
 Let's start with hand 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.910

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.169
 and get out with it 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.030
 which runs when you notice your sharing 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.070
