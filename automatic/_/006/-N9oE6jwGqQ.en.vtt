now<00:03:58.650> what<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.069> Kubota<00:03:59.490> brings<00:03:59.970> again<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:01.110> ease

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
now what the Kubota brings again is ease

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.970 
now what the Kubota brings again is ease
of<00:04:01.470> handling<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.690> production<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.319> what<00:04:04.860> we

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
of handling and production so what we

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.280 
of handling and production so what we
have<00:04:05.160> here<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.670> bevel<00:04:06.330> gear<00:04:06.540> front<00:04:06.959> drive

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.520 
have here is a bevel gear front drive
system<00:04:07.890> basically<00:04:08.250> what<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.700> means<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.720> when

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
system basically what that means is when

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.850 
system basically what that means is when

you select a by speed button you need to

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.190 
you select a by speed button you need to
press<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.670> you're<00:04:15.240> making<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.630> turn<00:04:15.870> and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
press it and you're making a turn and

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.990 
press it and you're making a turn and
you<00:04:16.290> turn<00:04:16.530> these<00:04:16.739> wills<00:04:17.040> greater<00:04:17.430> than<00:04:17.700> 30

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
you turn these wills greater than 30

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.680 
you turn these wills greater than 30
degrees<00:04:18.450> these<00:04:19.230> wills<00:04:19.769> spin<00:04:20.579> twice<00:04:21.060> as<00:04:21.390> fast

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690

clutch before you cross the question to
go<00:06:14.650> back<00:06:15.599> so<00:06:16.599> now<00:06:16.719> we're<00:06:16.930> going<00:06:17.020> to<00:06:17.080> go<00:06:17.229> ahead

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
go back so now we're going to go ahead

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:35.450 
go back so now we're going to go ahead
and<00:06:17.530> demonstrate<00:06:17.650> is<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.370> hydraulic<00:06:19.270> shuttle

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.860 

so<00:06:52.819> today<00:06:53.029> we've<00:06:53.210> talked<00:06:53.419> about<00:06:53.539> the<00:06:53.689> major

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
so today we've talked about the major

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.659 
so today we've talked about the major
differences<00:06:54.349> between<00:06:54.409> the<00:06:54.830> Kubota<00:06:55.340> and

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
differences between the Kubota and

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:00.489 
differences between the Kubota and
hollens<00:06:56.300> mission<00:06:57.550> throttle<00:06:58.550> gears<00:06:59.240> and<00:07:00.110> so

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:00.499 
hollens mission throttle gears and so

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.909 
hollens mission throttle gears and so
forth

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
forth

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:02.769 
forth
however<00:07:01.219> what's<00:07:01.849> more<00:07:02.059> important<00:07:02.419> talk<00:07:02.569> about

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:02.779 
however what's more important talk about

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:05.739 
however what's more important talk about
is<00:07:02.990> the<00:07:03.169> actual<00:07:03.469> cost<00:07:03.740> of<00:07:03.919> operation<00:07:04.550> as<00:07:05.330> I

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:05.749 
is the actual cost of operation as I

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:07.959 
is the actual cost of operation as I
mentioned<00:07:06.169> previously<00:07:06.610> the<00:07:07.610> fuel<00:07:07.819> savings

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:07.969

period<00:07:38.890> versus<00:07:39.890> them<00:07:40.070> so<00:07:40.820> I<00:07:40.850> guess<00:07:41.000> my

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.030 
period versus them so I guess my
question<00:07:41.150> to<00:07:41.540> you<00:07:41.720> is<00:07:41.750> which<00:07:42.530> table<00:07:42.890> with<00:07:42.980> an

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.040 
question to you is which table with an

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.330 
question to you is which table with an
extra<00:07:43.340> 14<00:07:43.790> thousand<00:07:44.920> again<00:07:45.920> like<00:07:46.100> to<00:07:46.160> say

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:46.340
