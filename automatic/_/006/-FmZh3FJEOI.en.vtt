00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
start sending the camera that means

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.479 
start sending the camera that means
taking<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.660> positioner<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.769> current<00:03:02.250> cover

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
taking the positioner is current cover

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.500 
taking the positioner is current cover
little<00:03:02.819> bit<00:03:02.940> much<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.420> I'm<00:03:04.410> guessing<00:03:04.620> that

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
little bit much but I'm guessing that

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.150 
little bit much but I'm guessing that
that<00:03:06.510> falls<00:03:06.750> out<00:03:07.049> somehow

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that falls out somehow

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.460 
that falls out somehow
yeah<00:03:09.090> well<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:10.820> they<00:03:11.820> can<00:03:12.000> just<00:03:12.180> put<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.600> on<00:03:12.720> and

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
yeah well up they can just put it on and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.990 
yeah well up they can just put it on and
then<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.160> course<00:03:14.190> USB<00:03:16.190> standard<00:03:17.190> I'm<00:03:17.549> guessing

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
then of course USB standard I'm guessing

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.170 
then of course USB standard I'm guessing
