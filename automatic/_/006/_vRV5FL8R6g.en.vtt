so d/c out 9g with a bee base b flat 6

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
so d/c out 9g with a bee base b flat 6
see<00:00:18.440> in<00:00:19.440> the<00:00:19.590> verses<00:00:19.950> or<00:00:20.190> with<00:00:20.340> them

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.420 

right<00:00:25.200> and<00:00:25.410> then<00:00:25.590> II<00:00:25.740> sus4

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
right and then II sus4

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.190 
right and then II sus4
got<00:00:27.940> like<00:00:28.090> an<00:00:28.210> a<00:00:28.330> chord<00:00:28.540> on<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.750> wrong<00:00:28.870> strings

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
got like an a chord on the wrong strings

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.840 
got like an a chord on the wrong strings
to<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.410> e

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.700 

and<00:00:31.940> there<00:00:32.540> is<00:00:32.630> one<00:00:32.840> little<00:00:32.989> variation<00:00:33.620> that

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
and there is one little variation that

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.229 
and there is one little variation that
he<00:00:33.800> does<00:00:33.980> on<00:00:34.160> that<00:00:34.310> when<00:00:34.640> it<00:00:34.670> comes<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.210> e

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
he does on that when it comes to the e

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.930 
he does on that when it comes to the e
sometimes<00:00:35.870> at<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.010> end<00:00:37.190> of<00:00:37.340> each<00:00:37.460> verse<00:00:37.670> which

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
sometimes at the end of each verse which

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.160 
sometimes at the end of each verse which
is<00:00:38.090> this

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.020 

so<00:00:41.710> it's<00:00:41.800> a<00:00:42.040> bass<00:00:42.940> note<00:00:42.970> loi<00:00:44.160> upstroke

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
so it's a bass note loi upstroke

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.610 
so it's a bass note loi upstroke
which<00:00:47.420> is<00:00:47.600> hitting<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.050> e-string

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
which is hitting the a e-string

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.979 
which is hitting the a e-string
hammering<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.460> second<00:00:49.820> finger<00:00:50.059> down<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.899> the

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
hammering the second finger down and the

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.130 
hammering the second finger down and the
upstroke<00:00:51.440> again<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:52.910> then<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:53.899> third

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
upstroke again and then that third

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.369 
upstroke again and then that third
finger<00:00:54.379> is<00:00:54.680> sliding<00:00:55.309> from<00:00:55.579> second<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:55.969> fourth

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:13.320 

so<00:01:00.070> big<00:01:00.550> slide<00:01:01.329> up<00:01:02.170> straight<00:01:02.879> back<00:01:03.879> down<00:01:04.150> again

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.740 

you

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.750 

Oh

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
Oh

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.830 
Oh
very

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.749 

and<00:01:29.649> that's<00:01:29.799> it<00:01:29.979> pretty<00:01:30.220> much<00:01:30.399> through<00:01:30.670> the

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
and that's it pretty much through the

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.429 
and that's it pretty much through the
whole<00:01:30.909> tune<00:01:31.119> you<00:01:31.299> have<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.600> have<00:01:31.899> a<00:01:31.930> listen<00:01:32.170> but

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
whole tune you have to have a listen but

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.139 
whole tune you have to have a listen but
that's<00:01:32.590> what<00:01:32.799> all<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:33.070> chords<00:01:33.909> and<00:01:34.060> the

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
that's what all the chords and the

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.969 
that's what all the chords and the
little<00:01:34.360> fancy<00:01:35.079> bits<00:01:35.259> are<00:01:35.409> that's<00:01:35.680> going<00:01:35.920> to

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
little fancy bits are that's going to

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.069 
little fancy bits are that's going to
have<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.100> look<00:01:36.220> at<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.399> pic<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:36.670> hand<00:01:37.079> okay

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
have a look at the pic and hand okay

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.569 
have a look at the pic and hand okay
before<00:01:38.259> we<00:01:38.470> go<00:01:38.590> through<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.920> whole<00:01:39.070> tune<00:01:39.280> and

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
before we go through the whole tune and

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.069 
before we go through the whole tune and
do<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:39.909> slowly<00:01:40.149> I'll<00:01:40.329> just<00:01:40.509> play<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.840> once

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
do it slowly I'll just play it once

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.690 
do it slowly I'll just play it once
through<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.649> can<00:01:41.710> have<00:01:41.920> a<00:01:41.950> look<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.280> get

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
through so you can have a look and get

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.700 
through so you can have a look and get
this<00:01:42.820> idea<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:44.020> strumming<00:01:44.439> hand<00:01:44.590> is

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
this idea that the strumming hand is

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.919 
this idea that the strumming hand is
kind<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.159> strumming<00:01:45.939> as<00:01:46.179> well<00:01:46.390> as<00:01:46.539> picking

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
kind of strumming as well as picking

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.480 
kind of strumming as well as picking
notes<00:01:47.110> out<00:01:47.289> at<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.470> same<00:01:47.649> time<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.009> here<00:01:48.310> we<00:01:48.399> go

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
notes out at the same time so here we go

00:01:48.490 --> 00:02:12.030 
notes out at the same time so here we go
just<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.850> intro

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:23.680 

invention<00:02:12.849> averse

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.710 

you

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.780 

so<00:02:28.500> what's<00:02:28.680> important<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.160> realize<00:02:29.310> here<00:02:29.550> is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
so what's important to realize here is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.580 
so what's important to realize here is
that<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.300> downstroke<00:02:30.840> each<00:02:31.020> time<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.440> going

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
that the downstroke each time is going

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.410 
that the downstroke each time is going
to<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.710> playing<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.190> bass<00:02:32.400> note<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
to be playing the bass note and the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.020 
to be playing the bass note and the
upstroke<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.370> either<00:02:35.580> playing

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
upstroke it's going to be either playing

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.940 
upstroke it's going to be either playing
an<00:02:36.240> upstroke<00:02:36.870> starting<00:02:37.350> at<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.560> thinnest

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
an upstroke starting at the thinnest

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.250 
an upstroke starting at the thinnest
string<00:02:38.090> or<00:02:39.090> starting<00:02:39.540> at<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.720> second<00:02:40.050> string

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
string or starting at the second string

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.770 
string or starting at the second string
and<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.940> hear<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.270> even<00:02:42.540> though<00:02:42.630> I'm

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and you can hear that even though I'm

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.910 
and you can hear that even though I'm
just<00:02:42.810> holding<00:02:43.170> your<00:02:43.260> D<00:02:43.380> chord<00:02:43.620> with<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.770> other

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
just holding your D chord with the other

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.500 
just holding your D chord with the other
hand<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.160> if<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.340> do<00:02:44.400> an<00:02:44.670> upstroke<00:02:45.060> starting

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
hand but if I do an upstroke starting

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.530 
hand but if I do an upstroke starting
from<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.720> thinnest<00:02:45.990> string<00:02:46.520> we<00:02:47.520> hear<00:02:47.790> this

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
from the thinnest string we hear this

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.270 
from the thinnest string we hear this
being<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.870> melody<00:02:49.230> if<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.710> do<00:02:49.770> an<00:02:49.920> upstroke

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
being the melody if I do an upstroke

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.660 
being the melody if I do an upstroke
same<00:02:50.550> from<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.760> second<00:02:51.060> string<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:53.280> hear<00:02:53.460> that

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
same from the second string we hear that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.870 
same from the second string we hear that
is<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> melody<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.410> very<00:02:55.650> intro<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.370> do<00:02:56.640> it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
is the melody so the very intro I do it

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.170 
is the melody so the very intro I do it
really<00:02:57.120> slow<00:02:57.330> now<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.900> be

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.610 

so<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.560> first<00:03:07.940> second<00:03:08.940> for<00:03:09.629> second

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
so for first second for second

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.339 
so for first second for second
did<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.459> move<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.940> C<00:03:12.150> chord<00:03:12.450> meeting<00:03:13.170> ago

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
did we move to the C chord meeting ago

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.750 
did we move to the C chord meeting ago
now<00:03:13.830> I'm<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.040> fifth<00:03:14.310> string<00:03:14.519> with<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
now I'm a fifth string with the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.890

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:05:10.629 

you

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.189 

and<00:05:11.639> for<00:05:11.849> the<00:05:11.939> verses<00:05:12.330> it's<00:05:12.509> pretty<00:05:12.779> much<00:05:12.960> the

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
and for the verses it's pretty much the

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.709 
and for the verses it's pretty much the
same<00:05:13.409> except<00:05:13.949> on<00:05:14.069> the<00:05:14.189> C<00:05:14.430> chord<00:05:14.759> and<00:05:14.879> the<00:05:15.569> F

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
same except on the C chord and the F

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:17.329 
same except on the C chord and the F
chord<00:05:16.050> it's<00:05:16.229> a<00:05:16.319> bit<00:05:16.499> more<00:05:16.649> strumming<00:05:17.159> so

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339 
chord it's a bit more strumming so

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.520 
chord it's a bit more strumming so
you're<00:05:17.759> still<00:05:18.029> doing<00:05:18.360> on<00:05:18.599> the<00:05:18.809> C<00:05:18.990> chord

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:30.520
