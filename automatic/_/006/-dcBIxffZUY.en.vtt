had corners snatch out routes and the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.950 
had corners snatch out routes and the
best<00:00:55.050> part<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:56.699> way<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.149> blitz<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.660> ran

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
best part is the way this blitz is ran

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.599 
best part is the way this blitz is ran
if<00:00:58.289> they<00:00:58.500> block<00:00:58.800> their<00:00:59.100> running<00:00:59.399> back

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
if they block their running back

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.270 
if they block their running back
sometimes<00:01:00.329> they<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:00.989> double<00:01:01.620> cover<00:01:01.980> one

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
sometimes they like to double cover one

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.390 
sometimes they like to double cover one
of<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.579> outside<00:01:03.359> receivers<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.530> most<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
of the outside receivers so most of the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000 
of the outside receivers so most of the
times<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> double<00:01:06.720> cover<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.619> far

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
times they like to double cover the far

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.609 
times they like to double cover the far
receiver<00:01:08.460> X<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> left<00:01:09.689> side<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.290> looking

coverage I was showcasing to you right
there<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.049> would<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.500> Manningham<00:01:41.250> can

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
there you would think Manningham can

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.569 
there you would think Manningham can
burn<00:01:41.850> Donte<00:01:42.540> Whitner<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> streak<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.430> would

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
burn Donte Whitner on a streak you would

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.240 
burn Donte Whitner on a streak you would
think<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:46.079> these<00:01:46.350> blitz<00:01:46.950> that's

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
think that not with these blitz that's

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
think that not with these blitz that's
what<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.460> trying<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.970> tell<00:01:48.270> people<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:49.110> you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
what I'm trying to tell people is you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.590 
what I'm trying to tell people is you
would<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.549> lob<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.360> over

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
would think you can just lob it up over

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.380 
would think you can just lob it up over
the<00:01:51.840> top<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.759> way<00:01:54.030> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the top but that is not the way this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.780 
the top but that is not the way this
blitz<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.530> main<00:01:55.829> coverage<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.579> just

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
blitz is the main coverage is just

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.480 
blitz is the main coverage is just
tremendous<00:01:57.570> I've<00:01:57.780> never<00:01:58.469> seen<00:01:58.920> anything<00:01:59.310> like

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.510 
it
now<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.140> play<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.189> run

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
now this is it a play that you can run

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.889 
now this is it a play that you can run
every<00:02:03.000> single<00:02:03.210> down<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.729> great<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.659> mix

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
every single down but it is great to mix

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.219 
every single down but it is great to mix
in<00:02:07.320> its<00:02:07.590> high<00:02:07.829> risk/high

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
in its high risk/high

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.380 
in its high risk/high
and<00:02:09.619> when<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.099> get<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.520> interception<00:02:11.120> that

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
and when you get that interception that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.180 
and when you get that interception that
you<00:02:11.510> really<00:02:11.900> need<00:02:12.200> as<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.530> see<00:02:12.890> right<00:02:13.160> there

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
you really need as you see right there

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.970 
you really need as you see right there
throwing<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:14.000> post<00:02:14.360> route<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:15.140> Leon<00:02:15.379> Hall<00:02:15.739> is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
throwing a post route but Leon Hall is

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.059 
throwing a post route but Leon Hall is
inside<00:02:16.610> for<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.120> easy<00:02:17.450> interception<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:18.530> see<00:02:19.040> a

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
inside for the easy interception I see a

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.190 
inside for the easy interception I see a
lot<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.370> my<00:02:19.550> opponents<00:02:20.209> they<00:02:20.540> run<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> lot<00:02:21.019> of

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
lot of my opponents they run a lot of

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.020 
lot of my opponents they run a lot of
crossing<00:02:21.680> routes<00:02:21.920> as<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.370> see<00:02:22.640> all<00:02:22.849> your

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
crossing routes as you see all your

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.140 
crossing routes as you see all your
slants<00:02:23.629> and<00:02:23.810> they<00:02:24.530> are<00:02:24.739> not<00:02:25.069> opening<00:02:25.700> at<00:02:25.819> all

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
slants and they are not opening at all

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.750 
slants and they are not opening at all
and<00:02:26.540> then<00:02:26.720> their<00:02:26.900> only<00:02:27.170> chance<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.370> go

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
and then their only chance is to go

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.420 
and then their only chance is to go
downfield<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.200> looks<00:02:30.470> open<00:02:30.950> but<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.280> is

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
downfield and it looks open but it is

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.210 
downfield and it looks open but it is
