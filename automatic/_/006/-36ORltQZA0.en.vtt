megapixels<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:35.640> suggestion<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.300> be

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
megapixels I my suggestion would be

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.060 
megapixels I my suggestion would be
probably<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.170> you're<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
probably that you're going to see the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.209 
probably that you're going to see the
nikon<00:00:38.510> d3x<00:00:39.510> 24<00:00:40.079> megapixel<00:00:40.649> sensor<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
nikon d3x 24 megapixel sensor in the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.910 
nikon d3x 24 megapixel sensor in the
nikon<00:00:41.730> d800<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> don't<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.469> know<00:00:43.739> why

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
nikon d800 so I don't really know why

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.970 
nikon d800 so I don't really know why
they<00:00:44.160> would<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> whole<00:00:45.059> new<00:00:45.239> sensor<00:00:45.980> when

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
they would do a whole new sensor when

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.279 
they would do a whole new sensor when
they<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> beautiful<00:00:47.579> nikon<00:00:48.360> d3x<00:00:48.870> sensor

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
they have the beautiful nikon d3x sensor

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
they have the beautiful nikon d3x sensor
now<00:00:50.280> maybe<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.760> they're<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
now maybe what they're going to do is

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.479 
now maybe what they're going to do is
make<00:00:51.600> an<00:00:51.750> improvement<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.860> sensor<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
make an improvement on that sensor and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.340 
make an improvement on that sensor and
that's<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.850> Tom's<00:00:54.059> getting<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.840> he

this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.949> news<00:01:05.159> because<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> d3x<00:01:06.240> doesn't

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
this is news because the d3x doesn't

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719 
this is news because the d3x doesn't
have<00:01:06.780> video<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.590> don't<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> super<00:01:08.610> high

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
have video we don't have a super high

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.280 
have video we don't have a super high
resolution<00:01:08.880> body<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.810> highest<00:01:10.110> resolution

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
resolution body the highest resolution

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
resolution body the highest resolution
Nikon<00:01:11.010> body<00:01:11.340> with<00:01:11.970> video<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.960> nikon<00:01:13.310> d7000

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
Nikon body with video is the nikon d7000

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.719 
Nikon body with video is the nikon d7000
so<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.180> d800<00:01:15.930> has<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.159> signal

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so if the d800 has it that will signal

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.780 
so if the d800 has it that will signal
that<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.330> d<00:01:18.659> 4<00:01:19.049> x<00:01:19.320> or<00:01:19.680> whatever<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.729> to

that the d 4 x or whatever is going to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.810 
that the d 4 x or whatever is going to
replace<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> d3x<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:22.470> also<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.130> video

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
replace the d3x will also have video

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.690 
replace the d3x will also have video
high<00:01:24.060> resolution<00:01:24.090> video<00:01:25.189> Tom<00:01:26.189> also<00:01:26.490> says<00:01:26.670> that

the<00:01:26.880> d800<00:01:27.479> will<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> hundred<00:01:28.110> percent

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the d800 will have a hundred percent

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.010 
the d800 will have a hundred percent
viewfinder<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.790> use<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> en<00:01:30.420> el<00:01:30.750> 15

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.429 
impulse Drive is the slow speed we want
engineering<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.630> warp<00:01:55.020> speed<00:01:55.290> which<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:57.439> kind

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
engineering at warp speed which is kind

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.420 
engineering at warp speed which is kind
of<00:01:58.500> humorous<00:01:59.450> but<00:02:00.450> basically<00:02:01.409> true<00:02:01.829> because

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
of humorous but basically true because

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.819 
of humorous but basically true because
it<00:02:03.360> seems<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.079> we've<00:02:04.229> been<00:02:04.380> waiting<00:02:04.649> for

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
it seems like we've been waiting for

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.190 
it seems like we've been waiting for
this<00:02:04.920> body<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> while<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.299> upgrade<00:02:06.899> or

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
this body for a while this upgrade or

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.340 
this body for a while this upgrade or
update<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> d700

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
update to the d700

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.220 
update to the d700
and<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:11.160> guess<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.460> begs<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.760> question<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.510> do

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
and I guess that begs a question to do

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.060 
and I guess that begs a question to do
we<00:02:13.440> see<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.910> d700<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.090> tandem<00:02:16.050> with<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.380> d800

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
we see the d700 in tandem with the d800

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.800 
we see the d700 in tandem with the d800
will<00:02:17.670> they<00:02:17.760> still<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.150> them<00:02:18.300> both<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
will they still have them both in the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.050 
will they still have them both in the
lineup<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.380> think<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.100> d700<00:02:20.700> certainly

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
lineup I think that the d700 certainly

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.300 
lineup I think that the d700 certainly
popular<00:02:21.540> enough<00:02:21.720> for<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.740> we'll<00:02:23.070> have

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
popular enough for that but we'll have

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.370 
popular enough for that but we'll have
to<00:02:23.370> wait<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.670> see<00:02:23.820> anyways<00:02:24.660> folks<00:02:24.900> there<00:02:25.260> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
have it that is Tom Hogan's nikon d800

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.220 
have it that is Tom Hogan's nikon d800
