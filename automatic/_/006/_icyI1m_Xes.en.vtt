00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
ridiculous and it really piques my

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.460 
ridiculous and it really piques my

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.690 
the archery championship at 65 billion
people<00:04:15.750> watched<00:04:15.959> then<00:04:16.380> obviously<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:17.489> would

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
people watched then obviously I would

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.780 
people watched then obviously I would
retract<00:04:18.090> what<00:04:18.780> I'm<00:04:18.900> about<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.200> say<00:04:19.440> if<00:04:20.070> game

retract what I'm about to say if game

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.730 
retract what I'm about to say if game
like<00:04:20.970> League<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.270> Legends<00:04:21.570> can<00:04:22.200> pull<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.590> that

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
like League of Legends can pull in that

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.969 
like League of Legends can pull in that
type<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.040> audience<00:04:23.540> why<00:04:24.540> shouldn't<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.260> be<00:04:25.530> in

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
type of audience why shouldn't it be in

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.500 
type of audience why shouldn't it be in
something<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.550> Olympics<00:04:26.970> when<00:04:27.150> II

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
something like the Olympics when II

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.910 
something like the Olympics when II
sports<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:27.930> when<00:04:28.020> competitive<00:04:28.470> gaming<00:04:28.680> is

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
sports and when competitive gaming is

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.010 
sports and when competitive gaming is
getting<00:04:29.340> more<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.670> more<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.150> more<00:04:30.390> backings

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
getting more and more and more backings

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.200 
getting more and more and more backings
and<00:04:31.260> more<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.130> more<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.400> more<00:04:32.490> support<00:04:33.030> and

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
and more and more and more support and

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.590 
and more and more and more support and
more<00:04:33.900> people<00:04:34.140> that<00:04:34.410> care<00:04:34.770> than<00:04:35.610> ever<00:04:35.850> before<00:04:36.360> I

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
more people that care than ever before I

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.050 
more people that care than ever before I
think<00:04:37.200> we<00:04:37.590> would<00:04:37.710> see<00:04:37.890> so<00:04:38.190> many<00:04:38.400> cool<00:04:38.550> things

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
think we would see so many cool things

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.010 
think we would see so many cool things
if<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.480> Olympic<00:04:39.900> Games<00:04:40.190> allowed<00:04:41.240> gaming<00:04:42.240> now

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
if the Olympic Games allowed gaming now

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.830 
if the Olympic Games allowed gaming now
obviously<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:44.190> main<00:04:44.610> drawback<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.690> this

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
obviously the main drawback to this

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.390 
obviously the main drawback to this
whole<00:04:46.050> argument<00:04:46.290> this<00:04:46.680> whole<00:04:46.830> theory<00:04:47.220> is

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
whole argument this whole theory is

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.300 
whole argument this whole theory is
there<00:04:48.330> are<00:04:48.480> a<00:04:48.510> lot<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.260> different<00:04:49.710> video<00:04:49.950> games

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
there are a lot of different video games

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.580 
there are a lot of different video games
there<00:04:50.520> are<00:04:50.640> a<00:04:50.670> lot<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.090> different<00:04:51.690> quote<00:04:51.930> games

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
there are a lot of different quote games

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.090 
there are a lot of different quote games
out<00:04:53.430> there<00:04:53.720> which<00:04:54.720> ones<00:04:55.050> would<00:04:55.290> qualify<00:04:55.590> and

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
out there which ones would qualify and

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.500 
out there which ones would qualify and
which<00:04:56.280> ones<00:04:56.580> are<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.210> ones<00:04:57.360> that<00:04:57.420> actually

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
which ones are the ones that actually

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.320 
which ones are the ones that actually
are<00:04:58.050> very<00:04:58.080> competitive<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:59.460> deserve<00:04:59.970> gold

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
are very competitive that deserve gold

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.170 
are very competitive that deserve gold
medals<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:00.900> that's<00:05:01.050> not<00:05:01.410> for<00:05:01.650> me<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.890> decide

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
medals and that's not for me to decide

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.640 
medals and that's not for me to decide
it's<00:05:03.180> just<00:05:03.510> something<00:05:03.810> I<00:05:03.930> was<00:05:04.110> throwing<00:05:04.530> on

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
it's just something I was throwing on

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.320 
it's just something I was throwing on
the<00:05:04.680> table<00:05:05.190> so<00:05:05.340> if<00:05:05.460> you're<00:05:05.610> like<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.910> video<00:05:06.270> game

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
the table so if you're like a video game

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.720 
the table so if you're like a video game
theory<00:05:07.080> physicist<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.400> can<00:05:08.520> come<00:05:08.640> up

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
theory physicist and you can come up

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.320 
theory physicist and you can come up
with<00:05:08.760> those<00:05:09.240> ideas<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:10.250> maybe<00:05:11.250> in<00:05:11.670> like<00:05:12.000> 5

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
with those ideas and maybe in like 5

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.060 
with those ideas and maybe in like 5
years<00:05:12.690> or<00:05:12.870> 10<00:05:13.050> years<00:05:13.290> or<00:05:13.350> 20<00:05:13.590> years<00:05:13.680> however

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
years or 10 years or 20 years however

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.040 
years or 10 years or 20 years however
long<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.340> takes<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:14.730> if<00:05:14.910> it<00:05:15.000> ever<00:05:15.120> happens<00:05:15.510> if

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
long it takes and if it ever happens if

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.230 
long it takes and if it ever happens if
it<00:05:16.200> never<00:05:16.470> happens<00:05:17.040> then<00:05:17.790> you<00:05:17.910> know<00:05:18.000> whatever

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
it never happens then you know whatever

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.910 
it never happens then you know whatever
but<00:05:18.480> it's<00:05:18.750> interesting<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.260> think<00:05:19.290> about<00:05:19.530> I

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
but it's interesting to think about I

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.110 
but it's interesting to think about I
want<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.310> know<00:05:20.400> what<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:20.610> guys<00:05:20.700> have<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:20.970> say

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
want to know what you guys have to say

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.910 
want to know what you guys have to say
