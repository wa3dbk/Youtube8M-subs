some<00:01:28.259> when<00:01:28.409> you're<00:01:28.500> fighting<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.860> little

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
some when you're fighting a little

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.610 
some when you're fighting a little
better

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
better

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.920 
better
more<00:01:29.980> than<00:01:30.130> five<00:01:30.310> levels<00:01:30.640> under<00:01:30.910> you<00:01:31.060> which

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
more than five levels under you which

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.020 
more than five levels under you which
makes<00:01:32.110> sense<00:01:32.320> because<00:01:32.650> this<00:01:33.010> game<00:01:33.610> is<00:01:33.670> already

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
makes sense because this game is already

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.390 
makes sense because this game is already
fairly<00:01:34.450> easy<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.560> with<00:01:35.710> mobs<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.160> are

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
fairly easy and with mobs that are

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.640 
fairly easy and with mobs that are
multiple<00:01:36.880> levels<00:01:37.210> under<00:01:37.570> image<00:01:37.990> makes<00:01:38.470> it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
multiple levels under image makes it

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.030 
multiple levels under image makes it
really<00:01:38.920> face<00:01:39.250> role<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.750> I'm<00:01:41.140> I'm<00:01:41.710> just

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
really face role here I'm I'm just

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.280 
really face role here I'm I'm just
grinding<00:01:42.640> these<00:01:42.850> npcs<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.660> sort<00:01:43.900> of<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.080> very

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
grinding these npcs and sort of a very

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.590 
grinding these npcs and sort of a very
