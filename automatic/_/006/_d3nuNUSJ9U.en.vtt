 and steel when it came to the substitute more 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.280
 I'm looking at my lists and no one is 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.799
 available nobody wants to come so 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.320
 occurred 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.420
 Bashir Lazhar I come for the post 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.680
 corner and a procedure to follow 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.950
 taught 19 years in a gel school 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.590
 I'm available right away 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.590
 we will put the desks and the lines 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.230
 let's see a small state for 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.210
 determine showing you will have to review 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.470
 the level of the gypsies from the skin of 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.470
 honor shoe 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.700
 I will take you to see the ill imaginary 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.540
 with the class 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.020
 this is a feminine grace there are doubts that 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.210
 is insinuating did not hint at anything from 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.210
 that you arrived we are a 50 more 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.170
 we are already in the 90s Algeria has 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.140
 returned to normal 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.070
 Algeria is never totally 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.810
 I can not care about children always 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.620
 I imagine them as adults who follow 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.620
 talking with children 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.180
 you are not from here and there are nuances that you 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.360
 they escape 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.780
 saying this we prefer that you limit yourself to 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.670
 teach not to educate our daughter 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.400
 you were acquired because of the 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.490
 terrorism would say yes 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.130
 a chrysalis is an insect between the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.500
 moon and the butterfly inside a cocoon 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.460
 fragile that will soon unfold its wings 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.460
 like you 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.630
 two 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.659
 i 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.259

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.789

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.789
