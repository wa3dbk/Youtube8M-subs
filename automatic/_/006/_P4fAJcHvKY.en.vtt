00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.990
 Let's start with the first three and one 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.000
 I have a fruit yoghurt for you 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.610
 Logically , he needs yogurt 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920
 oatmeal without me and any 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.780
 fruits or fruits of your choice first 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.320
 Study the bio well in a bowl at the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.090
 Best deep and cut fruit to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.430
 quite as they wanted to have her 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 can somehow to some no 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.379
 I know that cutting is easy 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.879
 small 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.980
 in the end I just give only a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.140
 tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.360
 oatmeal and stir 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.980
 all at the end again and then he is 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.900
 only who was actually already 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:11.670
 Now we come to the chocolate 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.290
 we need bananas again 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.150
 Oatmeal in the cellar and a banana 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.979
 First you crush your banana 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.659
 with a fork so it goes with the gift 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.040
 that's the best way to do it 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.170
 Of course you can do others as well 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.530
 work tools or home appliances 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.020
 then life is about 1 tablespoon 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 nutella so it would end 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.539
 actually enough if the more 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.000
 You can do some chocolate again 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.259
 take more and I try now 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.070
 easy with the bananas 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.380
 then you take one or two more 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.460
 tablespoons oatmeal and crazy it 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.460
 then together again 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.650
 then their place your mix easily 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.650
 in suzuki form on a tin, so to speak 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.990
 and there comes about at about trainer 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.990
 dry 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.900
 in the meantime I have myself then 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.050
 also any commitments back 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.090
 or we want to continue here with the sony 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.230
 You are welcome to drop by for a visit 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.319
 I write again in the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:40.510
 infobox are than me then after 20 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.400
 minutes were over they looked up 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.380
 Reason I have to say it really delicious 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.540
 and that was it again 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.160
 my teeny tale theory I hope so 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.900
 like now and if you have more 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.790
 You can see teams when you want to see them 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.830
 always like to write in the comments 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.630
