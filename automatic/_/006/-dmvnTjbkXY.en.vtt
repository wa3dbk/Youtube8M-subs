00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
try to step on the silver pipe and just

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.060 
try to step on the silver pipe and just
like<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.030> very<00:00:12.450> skeptical<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.320> our<00:00:13.500> talk

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
yeah this is actually a functional model

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.450 
yeah this is actually a functional model
so<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.859> what's<00:00:20.039> happening<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
so you can see what's happening the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.210 
so you can see what's happening the
tanks<00:00:20.760> reading<00:00:21.090> what<00:00:21.449> 5<00:00:22.430> i'm<00:00:24.529> bringing<00:00:25.529> 120

something<00:00:26.519> 322<00:00:27.300> degree<00:00:27.570> water<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.650> hit

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
something 322 degree water if we hit

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
something 322 degree water if we hit
this<00:00:28.920> pipe<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:30.650> 190<00:00:32.510> last<00:00:33.510> point<00:00:33.809> before

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
this pipe here is 190 last point before

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.600 
this pipe here is 190 last point before
it<00:00:34.170> goes<00:00:34.290> out<00:00:35.149> shootin<00:00:37.550> 82<00:00:38.550> 83<00:00:38.940> 85<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> what's

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it goes out shootin 82 83 85 so what's

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.030 
it goes out shootin 82 83 85 so what's
happening<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:43.500> down<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.920> the

the second tote we're adding 255 gallons
water<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> water<00:01:26.100> will<00:01:26.280> be

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
water and that's the water will be

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.569 
water and that's the water will be
heated<00:01:26.840> there'll<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.960> phone<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:29.159> connects

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
heated there'll be a phone that connects

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.210 
heated there'll be a phone that connects
to<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.970> fish<00:01:30.180> tank<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.409> fish<00:01:31.650> tank<00:01:31.860> drops

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to the fish tank with a fish tank drops

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.859 
to the fish tank with a fish tank drops
to<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> certain<00:01:32.790> temperature<00:01:32.939> than<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> other

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
to a certain temperature than that other

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
to a certain temperature than that other
people<00:01:34.259> come<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.950> hopefully<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.090> water

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
people come on and hopefully that water

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.830 
people come on and hopefully that water
in<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.869> 120<00:01:37.619> 130<00:01:38.189> degrees<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
in there is 120 130 degrees and then it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.600 
in there is 120 130 degrees and then it
will<00:01:39.930> it'll<00:01:40.140> mix<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.650> cycle<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.250> needs<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
will it'll mix and cycle is it needs to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.750 
will it'll mix and cycle is it needs to
as<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.299> cycle<00:01:42.750> through<00:01:42.930> here

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
as a cycle through here

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.540 
as a cycle through here
how<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.810> exhaust<00:01:46.140> from<00:01:46.500> from<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
how do you get the exhaust from from the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.300 
how do you get the exhaust from from the
wood<00:01:47.850> we're<00:01:48.420> burning<00:01:48.570> go<00:01:49.110> down<00:01:49.500> instead<00:01:49.800> of<00:01:50.010> up

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
wood we're burning go down instead of up

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310 
wood we're burning go down instead of up
it's<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.300> design<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.810> rocket<00:01:52.170> mass

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
it's just a design of a rocket mass

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.500 
it's just a design of a rocket mass
heater<00:01:52.400> because<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.910> up<00:01:54.030> into<00:01:54.270> here

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
heater because it is going up into here

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.720 
heater because it is going up into here
yeah<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.200> hits<00:01:55.350> their<00:01:55.560> emerging<00:01:56.160> and<00:01:56.400> draws

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
yeah it hits their emerging and draws

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.940 
yeah it hits their emerging and draws
back<00:01:56.970> out<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:57.660> what<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.440> did<00:01:58.650> because

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
back out here and what we did because

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.460 
back out here and what we did because
we're<00:01:59.340> we're<00:01:59.790> really<00:02:00.170> somewhere<00:02:01.170> right<00:02:01.410> in

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
we're we're really somewhere right in

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.280 
we're we're really somewhere right in
here<00:02:01.980> we're<00:02:02.760> at<00:02:02.790> our<00:02:02.940> maximum<00:02:03.420> capacity<00:02:03.690> of

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
here we're at our maximum capacity of

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.670 
here we're at our maximum capacity of
pipe<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.910> draw<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.480> it<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.500> working

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
pipe for the draw and it was working

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.190 
pipe for the draw and it was working
fine<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.670> 90<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.390> until<00:02:09.899> we

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
fine with just a 90 out there until we

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.470 
fine with just a 90 out there until we
started<00:02:10.470> getting<00:02:10.590> north<00:02:10.890> wind<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.330> they

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
started getting north wind and then they

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.790 
started getting north wind and then they
you<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.140> saw<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.350> other<00:02:13.500> day<00:02:13.560> they

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you know if you saw the other day they

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.920 
you know if you saw the other day they
had<00:02:13.950> extended<00:02:14.400> down<00:02:14.670> yeah<00:02:14.940> which<00:02:15.330> actually

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
had extended down yeah which actually

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.510 
had extended down yeah which actually
made<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.380> worse<00:02:16.590> instead<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.980> better<00:02:17.070> they're

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
made it worse instead of better they're

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.650 
made it worse instead of better they're
thinking<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.120> down<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> head<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.570> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
thinking to get it down the head of the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.090 
thinking to get it down the head of the
wind<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.990> would<00:02:19.080> help<00:02:19.230> but<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:19.770> made<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.070> that

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
wind it would help but just made it that

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.130 
wind it would help but just made it that
much<00:02:20.250> more<00:02:20.460> distance<00:02:21.030> for<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.300> go<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.720> what

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
much more distance for it to go so what

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.780 
much more distance for it to go so what
we<00:02:22.260> did<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.560> put<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.830> smaller<00:02:23.160> exhaust<00:02:23.520> fan

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
we did is we put a smaller exhaust fan

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.060 
we did is we put a smaller exhaust fan
on<00:02:24.000> there<00:02:24.210> see<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.930> forest<00:02:25.230> draw<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.770> we<00:02:25.920> can

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
on there see a forest draw so we can

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.950 
on there see a forest draw so we can
empower<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.210> breeze<00:02:27.390> that's<00:02:27.630> come<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.870> so

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
empower the the breeze that's come in so

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.530 
empower the the breeze that's come in so
it<00:02:28.050> doesn't<00:02:28.320> force<00:02:28.500> back<00:02:28.710> up<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.980> here

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
it doesn't force back up in here

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.580 
it doesn't force back up in here
michigan<00:02:30.540> they<00:02:30.660> see<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.930> got<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.140> go<00:02:31.200> two<00:02:31.410> feet

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
michigan they see you got to go two feet

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.630 
michigan they see you got to go two feet
higher<00:02:31.770> than<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.040> highest<00:02:32.310> point<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
higher than the highest point of the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.520 
higher than the highest point of the
building<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.120> then<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.750> got<00:02:33.870> no<00:02:34.020> problem<00:02:34.440> at

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
building and then you got no problem at

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.460 
building and then you got no problem at
all<00:02:34.590> ever<00:02:34.830> right<00:02:35.610> yeah<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:37.110> what<00:02:37.320> we're

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
all ever right yeah and what we're

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.030 
all ever right yeah and what we're
sending<00:02:37.860> out<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.640> mostly<00:02:39.209> co2<00:02:39.810> its<00:02:40.050> team<00:02:40.290> by

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
sending out is is mostly co2 its team by

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.440 
sending out is is mostly co2 its team by
the<00:02:41.100> time<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.459> reverbs<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.300> see

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the time it reverbs and you can see

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.670 
the time it reverbs and you can see
what's<00:02:42.660> happening<00:02:42.720> with<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.170> energy<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.620> we

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
what's happening with the energy and we

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.620 
what's happening with the energy and we
weren't<00:02:43.830> still<00:02:44.510> peeking<00:02:45.510> out<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:47.330> few<00:02:48.330> degrees

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
weren't still peeking out a few degrees

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.050 
weren't still peeking out a few degrees
there<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.500> even<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:50.459> we're<00:02:51.170> 190<00:02:52.880> at<00:02:53.880> this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
there and even here we're 190 at this

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.580 
there and even here we're 190 at this
point<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.690> what<00:02:54.810> will<00:02:54.900> happen<00:02:54.930> if<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.440> is

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
point so what will happen if this is

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.500 
point so what will happen if this is
started<00:02:55.920> early<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.310> morning<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:57.180> entire

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
started early in the morning this entire

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.449 
started early in the morning this entire
surface<00:02:57.870> all<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:58.560> concrete<00:02:58.800> will<00:02:59.220> absorb

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
surface all this concrete will absorb

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.030 
surface all this concrete will absorb
that<00:02:59.670> heat<00:03:00.050> hopefully<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.350> should<00:03:01.500> ready<00:03:01.739> bit

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
that heat hopefully it should ready bit

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.009 
that heat hopefully it should ready bit
hopefully<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.790> will<00:03:02.940> radiate<00:03:03.300> back<00:03:03.600> up<00:03:03.840> and

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
hopefully it will radiate back up and

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.530 
hopefully it will radiate back up and
help<00:03:04.170> keep<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.530> fish<00:03:05.400> tank<00:03:05.640> water<00:03:06.150> warm

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
help keep the fish tank water warm

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.780 
help keep the fish tank water warm
through<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.530> next<00:03:07.800> 12<00:03:08.010> hours<00:03:08.190> cycle<00:03:08.700> when

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
through the next 12 hours cycle when

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.979 
through the next 12 hours cycle when
we're<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:09.060> burning<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.209> really

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
we're not burning so it's just really

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.350 
we're not burning so it's just really
inefficient<00:03:13.230> use<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.950> wood<00:03:14.150> once<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.239> put

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
inefficient use of the wood once you put

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.979 
inefficient use of the wood once you put
the<00:03:15.450> sheetrock<00:03:15.660> up<00:03:15.930> yr<00:03:16.860> win<00:03:17.010> why<00:03:17.370> um<00:03:18.209> just<00:03:18.840> to

the sheetrock up yr win why um just to

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.570 
the sheetrock up yr win why um just to
give<00:03:19.110> us<00:03:19.200> an<00:03:19.290> airtight<00:03:19.620> seal<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:20.250> we're<00:03:20.459> going

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
give us an airtight seal now we're going

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.580 
give us an airtight seal now we're going

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
help you note or more of the heat become

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.550

give us some protection yeah I would
expect<00:03:30.620> that's<00:03:31.620> pretty<00:03:31.830> hot<00:03:32.100> there

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
expect that's pretty hot there
