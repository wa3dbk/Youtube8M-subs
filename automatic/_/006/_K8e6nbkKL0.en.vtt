 for sebastiÃ¡n it has been transformed into 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.260
 Calvary everything turns red all 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.269

 conversing with your family can be a 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.040

 he does not tolerate being with people his face 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.649
 begins to blush and if it blocks 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.739
 the 15 years to the 28 that I have now 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:57.350
 suffering this good disease cost me 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.870
 very much to finish school and I entered the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.940
 100-year-old university cost me a lot 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.580
 for the initiatives put me to public 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.369
 you have to insert to do many things 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.560
 I also take anxiety. 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.810
 anxiety they take a lot of smoking a lot 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.180
 what Sebastian did not know is that he suffers 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.399
 pathological facial blushing one 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.170
 disease that affects 5% of the 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.240
 population and that just started to 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.720
 treated as such 6 years ago in 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.850
 Latin America falls at a point that I thought 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.090
 I want an extreme depression I went to 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.859
 psychiatrists product to my coat like 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.259
 I thought at some point of suicide 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:43.990
 because one having this place in the 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.490
 face I started to read patients 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.810
 who have not consulted us and who 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.009
 has moderated the patients who have 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.659
 abandoned the family because neither 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.049
 are even able to expose themselves to the 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.759
 family have left work very many 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.039
 of which we operate are young people who have 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.200
 abandoned his study the symptoms 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.270
 appear at puberty due to problems in 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.009
 the sympathetic nerve a person with 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.049
 facial blush exposed to a situation 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.880
 tension before the sphincter closes 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.640
 hair post and his blood that was 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.650
 trapped in the face that causes it to 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.110
 put red if it is put under a pressure 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.510
 your blood flow will increase 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.670
 be completely and red to the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.370
 long can produce rosacea on the skin 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.930
 only when the valve is relaxed does it 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.379
 reopens and starts to circulate 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.700
 blood normally a condition 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.720
 disabling that over the years produces 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.430
 social phobia 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.650
 Dr. Enrique Jadresic lived it 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.110
 throughout his life he blushed with 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.090
 ease last week published the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.099
 book when the blush hurts that counts 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.620
 your personal experience and deepens 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.540
 about this biological disorder is 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.579
 awesome how these countries feel 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.519
 they do not dare to consult their doctors 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.409
 nor telling his problems to the 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.870
 spouses to the children to the sisters to 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.090
 the pololas all all arrive by 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.920
 internet and when I ask them good 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.530
 and someone in your families knows that 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.930
 you came in 90% of the cases they tell me 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.569
 that does not appreciate me that it's a disease 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.579
 little known has a solution when the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.459
 origin is psychological can be treated with 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.780
 drugs for the most serious cases what 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.819
 advisable is to operate 93 percent 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.010
 of the patients is totally healthy 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.310
 Doctor Suarez himself has intervened 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.299
 more than 200 currently operates 40 people 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.299
 a year with this ailment 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:37.400
 Today is the turn of Sebastian is what 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:43.130
 has waited five years ago and I 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:45.140
 many emotions cons but there are nine 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.990
 points and sebastian enters the pavilion 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.790
 to be intervened every day and every 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.920
 hardest day in a torture should 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.990
 to be trapped in a body he said 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.410
 I'm stuck in a body I can not be 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.870
 I the operation is to cut the 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.640
 sympathetic nerve and burn the tips 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.920
 so the blood that reaches the face 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.290
 you can not get stuck in the face 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.930
 a sympathectomy of this type has a 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.670
 45 minutes duration we hope that 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.550
 all new surgery was perfect not 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.070
 we had no problem 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.650
 now you must rest for 48 hours 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.270
 before seeing the results when it has 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.640
 exposed to the same occasions as 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.470
 exposed from love in nerves but 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.630
 you do not see something gc and with the passage of 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.400
 time is going to realize that it does not get 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.810
 red then as it does not get red it's going to 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.000
 start to face them with greater 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.580
 tranquility 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.250
 Today Sebastian walks without problems between 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.080
 the crowd does not escape either 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.710
 recid of looking for work his first 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.410
 target is 100% socially which has 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.810
 changed why I live I'm going to meet 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.450
 with my family go to places that did not 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.190
 could like for example the molt assume 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.560
 market everyday things 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.990
 for him his life is taking a course 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.090
 different but must overcome little by little 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.920
 his fears of the past I hope he's going to 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.550
 do many things and recovering the 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.960
 lost time the sense of work 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.849
 to be able to study if God wants the other 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.369
 year 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.400
 nothing in the couple aspect to be able 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:17.530
 have a partner 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:23.259
 and it is that so many things that before actually 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:26.560
 I could not realize the truth that I have 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.720
 28 years old and I feel like I'm starting 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.340
 from zero 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.500
 Sebastian was lucky he already managed to ask 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.570
 help another eight hundred thousand Chileans 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.220
 he continues to deal with that daily torture 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.220
 still not knowing what to do 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.190
 but the most interesting thing about everything 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.070
 considering that 5 out of 3 do not suffer 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.160
 pathological facial blush that is not little ' 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.300
 5% and you have to set aside all the 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.370
 people who were not so 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.919
 pathological and they can fix it with 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.330
 psychological therapy but 100 people at 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.830
 year are operating with this situation 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.450
 and you literally change life 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.340
 preferential untold story 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.550
