00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.589
 good afternoon again I want to go back to 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.230
 question about 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.480
 immigration of the people who won 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.210
 green card now just now been 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.549
 results of winning green to green 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.430
 card 2014 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.740
 and many already know they got this 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.880
 win or not win olivier or not 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 and I began to write people who won 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.680
 green card and don't know what to do with it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.840
 and at the bottom I look a lot of our comments 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 already viewers who really want to win 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.190
 but not won this year I certainly 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.540
 I am very sorry for these people who are 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.910
 this year did not win 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.710
 I wish them to win next year 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.379
 or try some more 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.440
 the options are legal too 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.059
 other immigration options by you 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 connections sits and by itself can be 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.030
 even some of the workers weighing over 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.550
 major good specialists but still have 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.710
 different options for legal immigration then 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.750
 there is it you can try but in any 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.480
 case playing maybe still lucky 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.570
 especially young families who have children 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.950
 so those are the people who won now 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.130
 green card and from 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.659
 and wondering what they can do 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.950
 say that this is actually a question 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.740
 complex really like this will be resolved 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.700
 decide to admit you have 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.969
 already you have an apartment probably 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.270
 put off your country grazed worked at 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.820
 you live well and of course 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.829
 part with it come and gives a very 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.590
 it's hard to agree with you a rumor about a hundred 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.899
 percent because really friend 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.259
 there is no doubt 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.890
 there are still some problems and reasons 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.789
 staying Sergey in our country 1100 to 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 decide and of course that's why here 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.880
 condemn of course well, something very, very 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.909
 rarely a year do you need it or not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.009
 and I think that if you for example in your 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.539
 the country is quite well settled it can 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.549
 they didn't explode because 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.560
 indeed not everyone can overcome 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.800
 This those difficulties which boat here 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.570
 expect need to have 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.920
 enough strength to go through this stage 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.410
 immigration migration then not so easy 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.180
 turn out to be really different 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.700
 country others sleep and a different mentality 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.490
 you just literally have to start from scratch 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.040
 here legs it certainly passes enough 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.330
 I quickly have a question 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.670
 adaptation for me has passed adaptation for 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.530
 I certainly is not very easy, I passed 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.620
 passed literally everything because I 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.600
 in fact i'm from scratch with 20 dollars 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.080
 came to america so of course i 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.000
 I went through the blog and I will say the first morning right away 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.880
 was very touched. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.180
 everything is like throwing me here and there 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.530
 a thousand thought that I asked be back well here 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.500
 but I have a completely different situation 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.660
 if you won the green card what awaits you 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.310
 here you principle is actually here 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.560
 not that especially not waiting for you only 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.140
 the right to work the right of residence in 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.390
 America no more than you here no one 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.460
 Provides help like you 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.380
 thinks of people that here and I will come here 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.750
 me some here some help 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.520
 the organization will help nothing 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.010
 like this in this case you can even 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.500
 don't count you must count 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.629
 your strength and have your material 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.329
 stock some day this chain should 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.489
 find money to take a life 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.010
 here housing some time to live and dance 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.480
 until you find a job that is this one any 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.849
 case you need to rely only on your 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.680
 flank forces of the state can 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.090
 count only families who have 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.090
 small children 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.329
 long 17 years old indeed they can 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.489
 file for medicine on foot shooting at 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.329
 some even on person but this is not 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.890
 so big 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.750
 mine you must bear in mind that this 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.180
 really only temporary until you 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.180
 do not start earning a little while 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.519
 they give you no more skills to get up 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.870
 apartment la will have to be removed anyway 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.239
 it's not so easy here 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.609
 so if you see what you can handle 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.310
 with this that you have some 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.379
 here is the support option you by no means 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.859
 Do not think that in America everything is so 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.450
 easy and simple i don't want anyone 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:17.350
 rosy just telling the whole thing 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.350
 not so simple 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.020
 and I do not want to scare if you climb 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.800
 confident families families know English 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.380
 or at least I intend to learn it quickly 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.970
 expansion is full of energy ready to take 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.470
 for any job because here 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.270
 especially the first time comes 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.150
 choose you have to take on any 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.160
 a job that only you turn up her 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.780
 you can not refuse even the very 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.090
 dirty work because in fact 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.700
 that's when you come here you are not 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.470
 want to take here as an emigrant wherever 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.020
 wherever you are even in the same shop 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.730
 not even the simplest job you 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.820
 They want to take it because you came here 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.980
 and this non-discrimination is just a fear 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.140
 new immigrants and what if they are some 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.050
 you don't need someone like that 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.000
 recommended maybe or more yours 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.340
 persistent behavior that's what i want 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.530
 work and seeks to this whether your 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.030
 professionalism 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.530
 so that professionals like you they 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.410
 will not find anywhere else you need to in this 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.910
 7 convince them and then you can for sure 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.530
 to take on work that is just like that 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.660
 quarreling is very difficult here 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.670
 one has only to get at least one 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.190
 job first job in america after 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.560
 this will be much easier but in any 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.170
 case from the start start learning 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.500
 english i wish you every success i 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.360
