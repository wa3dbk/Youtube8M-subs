00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.050 

there's<00:05:01.569> just<00:05:01.599> like<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.139> clip<00:05:02.349> the<00:05:03.060> connector

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
there's just like the clip the connector

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.459 
there's just like the clip the connector
just<00:05:04.090> goes<00:05:04.360> into<00:05:04.539> here<00:05:04.780> but<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.990> clip<00:05:05.229> is

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
just goes into here but the clip is

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.619 
just goes into here but the clip is
right<00:05:05.800> on<00:05:05.889> the<00:05:05.979> outside<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:06.580> kind<00:05:07.419> of<00:05:07.479> goes

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
right on the outside and kind of goes

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:09.420 
right on the outside and kind of goes
over<00:05:07.810> that<00:05:08.050> teeny<00:05:08.349> little<00:05:08.530> tab<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.069> all<00:05:09.129> I<00:05:09.250> had

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
over that teeny little tab so all I had

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.719 
over that teeny little tab so all I had
to<00:05:09.520> do<00:05:09.699> is<00:05:10.449> just<00:05:10.659> pull<00:05:11.080> that<00:05:11.110> up<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.740> pull<00:05:12.699> it

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
to do is just pull that up and pull it

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.439 
to do is just pull that up and pull it
out<00:05:12.939> so<00:05:13.719> that's<00:05:14.680> it's<00:05:15.250> hard<00:05:15.340> to<00:05:15.610> look<00:05:16.150> in<00:05:16.300> there

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
out so that's it's hard to look in there

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.879 
out so that's it's hard to look in there
and<00:05:16.479> show<00:05:16.780> you<00:05:16.840> that<00:05:17.110> so<00:05:17.349> I'm<00:05:17.409> going<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.620> just

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
and show you that so I'm going to just

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.830 
and show you that so I'm going to just
describe<00:05:18.310> it<00:05:18.400> like<00:05:18.550> that<00:05:18.699> we've<00:05:19.300> got<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:19.629> pipe

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
describe it like that we've got the pipe

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.809 
describe it like that we've got the pipe
that<00:05:19.960> goes<00:05:20.110> in<00:05:20.319> with<00:05:20.439> a<00:05:20.500> clip<00:05:20.830> on<00:05:20.979> top<00:05:21.159> just

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
that goes in with a clip on top just

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.540 
that goes in with a clip on top just
pull<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.300> clip<00:05:22.689> back<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.289> you<00:05:24.129> pull<00:05:24.340> it<00:05:24.370> out

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
pull the clip back and you pull it out

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.360 
pull the clip back and you pull it out
anyway<00:05:25.389> so<00:05:25.419> now<00:05:25.750> I've<00:05:25.930> got<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.349> brand<00:05:27.159> new

anyway so now I've got the brand new
ones<00:05:27.960> all<00:05:28.960> I'm<00:05:29.110> going<00:05:29.199> to<00:05:29.259> do<00:05:29.500> is<00:05:30.090> plug<00:05:31.090> it<00:05:31.270> back

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
ones all I'm going to do is plug it back

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.749 
ones all I'm going to do is plug it back
in<00:05:31.569> so<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:31.840> clip<00:05:32.080> just<00:05:32.319> goes<00:05:32.500> right<00:05:32.710> over<00:05:33.039> the

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
in so that clip just goes right over the

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.839 
in so that clip just goes right over the
little<00:05:33.909> tab<00:05:34.240> right<00:05:34.270> there<00:05:34.539> and<00:05:35.039> then<00:05:36.039> it's

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
little tab right there and then it's

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.390 
little tab right there and then it's
going<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.120> go<00:05:37.560> into<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.680> hole<00:05:38.889> in<00:05:39.099> the<00:05:39.190> back<00:05:39.370> of

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
going to go into the hole in the back of

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.149 
going to go into the hole in the back of
the<00:05:39.580> light<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.349> then<00:05:41.349> I'm<00:05:41.469> going<00:05:41.620> to<00:05:41.680> tighten

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
the light and then I'm going to tighten

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:48.030 
the light and then I'm going to tighten
it<00:05:42.280> like<00:05:42.900> that<00:05:43.960> so<00:05:44.620> clockwise

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
there and it's actually pretty easy once

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.120 
there and it's actually pretty easy once
you<00:05:53.950> get<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.300> bulb<00:05:55.300> coming<00:05:56.260> into<00:05:56.470> the<00:05:56.890> back<00:05:57.100> of

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.870 
you get the bulb coming into the back of
the<00:05:57.810> casing<00:05:59.160> you'll<00:06:00.160> be<00:06:00.310> able<00:06:00.370> to<00:06:00.520> feel<00:06:00.700> it

the casing you'll be able to feel it

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.140 
the casing you'll be able to feel it
kind<00:06:01.090> of<00:06:01.300> just<00:06:01.870> move<00:06:02.080> it<00:06:02.200> back<00:06:02.380> like

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
kind of just move it back like

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
counterclockwise and clockwise a little

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.130 
counterclockwise and clockwise a little
bit<00:06:05.350> until<00:06:05.860> you<00:06:05.890> feel<00:06:06.460> it<00:06:06.490> slide<00:06:06.910> in<00:06:07.150> then<00:06:07.900> you

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
bit until you feel it slide in then you

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.350 
bit until you feel it slide in then you
just<00:06:08.320> turn<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:08.770> like<00:06:09.670> a<00:06:09.730> quarter<00:06:10.180> turn

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
just turn it like a quarter turn

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.080 
just turn it like a quarter turn
clockwise<00:06:10.900> and<00:06:11.410> you'll<00:06:11.530> feel<00:06:11.800> it<00:06:11.860> snap<00:06:12.580> into

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
clockwise and you'll feel it snap into

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.930 
clockwise and you'll feel it snap into
place<00:06:13.420> and<00:06:13.690> kind<00:06:13.930> of<00:06:14.080> lock<00:06:14.320> and<00:06:14.650> it<00:06:15.430> just<00:06:15.640> feels

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
place and kind of lock and it just feels

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.940 
place and kind of lock and it just feels
right<00:06:16.300> that's<00:06:17.080> how<00:06:17.230> it<00:06:17.380> kind<00:06:17.500> of<00:06:17.650> feels<00:06:17.830> like

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
right that's how it kind of feels like

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.310 
right that's how it kind of feels like
it's<00:06:18.190> done<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:18.730> solid<00:06:19.210> so<00:06:19.840> now<00:06:19.990> I'm<00:06:20.110> going<00:06:20.260> to

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
it's done and solid so now I'm going to

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.090 
it's done and solid so now I'm going to
do<00:06:20.410> is<00:06:20.560> just<00:06:20.680> put<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.340> protective<00:06:21.900> rubber

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
backing back on there again and we'll

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.340 
backing back on there again and we'll
turn<00:06:27.370> on<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:27.820> electricity<00:06:28.690> and<00:06:28.750> make<00:06:29.080> sure<00:06:29.230> it

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.490 

and<00:06:45.310> so<00:06:46.440> that<00:06:47.440> one<00:06:47.680> is<00:06:47.830> now<00:06:48.090> on<00:06:49.110> and<00:06:50.110> that's<00:06:50.290> the

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
and so that one is now on and that's the

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.160 
and so that one is now on and that's the
same<00:06:50.740> as<00:06:51.150> this<00:06:52.150> one<00:06:52.360> over<00:06:52.510> here<00:06:52.660> both<00:06:52.900> are<00:06:53.080> on

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
same as this one over here both are on

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.610 
same as this one over here both are on
the<00:06:53.200> outside<00:06:53.830> those<00:06:54.130> are<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.430> low<00:06:55.090> beams<00:06:55.590> okay

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
the outside those are the low beams okay

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.390 
the outside those are the low beams okay
so<00:06:56.980> success<00:06:57.580> the
