00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.199
 ran 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.199
 me 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.090
 How about Ahora Hello nerd school 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:23.200
 This seems to be the topic of this issue Perfect Grade Unicorn Gundam 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.800
 I wrote in the video comment section but I completed 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:31.690
 And it is 4 days that this has arrived 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:37.630
 During I'd thought Na Do you slowly spider to your New Year arrived in 4 days 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.710
 Well slowly you a little that Tteyuu mood is changed this may create another the day after 15 days 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.220
 Though 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.220
 It sounds like I made it while watching the unicorn dvd 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.860
 Is it about a little while before you finish watching all ? 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:56.060
 So it is around approximately 6 hours 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.060
 So let's see the Perfect Grade Unicorn Gundam right away 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.900
 Please see the Perfect Grade Unicorn Gundam 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.080
 Take a look at this unicorn mode a little bit 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.090
 The corner is like this and it is one corner 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.280
 It is just a unicorn 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.610
 Very up is the part of the visor of the head is not made of clear parts of the green 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.260
 It is also fine modeling 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:27.650
 This Vulcan cannon is another part 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:32.750
 It is a little chunky mostly from Unicorn to the overall proportion is now 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.580
 This LED unit was released simultaneously when I purchased this unicorn Gundam 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 Also bought together 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.880
 It is surely included in this 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.600
 Like this 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.900
 I'm issue 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.530
 The battery box is mounted in this 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.240
 This would be this off and after the mode change-over switch 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.850
 It always will be amazing When pressed, 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.850
 When this back backpack is removed 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.810
 Please have a look, but there are electric lamps, but this is also this 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.600
 This and this part at the tip of this pedestal 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.179
 Connect here 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.019
 Connect the axis of the body and stand to this 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.019
 Connect this 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:27.040
 Like this, I will connect the backpack again 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:31.150
 Most wiring As you can see will be such a feeling attached to it does not seem pedestal 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.150
 Ah ah ah 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.159
 Kedomo lookout way that I'm here and say whether illuminate Te Here is a switch Bu' 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.050
 It is a power button 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:44.000
 Turn on the power and switch the mode here 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.630
 Hmm 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.210
 Hmm 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.930
 Yes Yes 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.930
 I can go 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.110
 Contact Wow over 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.280
 So Rhone 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.580
 Parentheses yeah 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.710
 Please see this tomb red light 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.710
 I wonder if this video is transmitted 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.140
 It is pretty beautiful 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.160
 This is the true point of this Perfect Grade Unicorn Gundam 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.180
 Light up gimmick 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.180
 This is great 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:38.340
 How does the light go like this? Not only the light but also the light is strong 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.340
 I'm weak and shine 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.980
 If you leave something leave open the Kopitto is to stand like this the best of the Unicorn Gundam 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:57.209
 It looks like it was handed over 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.209
 It is great that this glow only if this psycho-frame has not been deployed yet- 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.390
 Well there was a worth making hard work 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.569
 It is such a feeling in a bright place for the residents 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.920
 So how was this video? 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:19.810
 Though it is a little different from a review, it is a report that it has been assembled somehow 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.260
 A little towards the middle of the assembled people or now Well, not yet purchased 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:29.020
 I thought it would be nice if I could give advice 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:33.139
 I think any time is also about roughly 1000 yen This ne parts about Perfect grade 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:39.620
 I wonder if not it about this time maybe war is cut 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:40.999
 Relatively crisp compared to the perfect grade of until now in some of the quite large parts itself 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.800
 It was assembled 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:50.240
 However, this built-in LED unit was a little hard 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.320
 It feels a little different from the emperor who says to make that plastic model 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 This was pretty hard- 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:01.600
 Other than that, it is very smooth. What is the perfect grade of this time? 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.600
 The joints inside the invisible part of up to 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:09.280
 Hit Ayu cylinder and so on 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:13.340
 More than this expression of detail, this time we will completely transform 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:19.120
 Unicorn Gundam with 1/60 scale luminous gimmick 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.120
 I'm a little different is the perfect grade of up to feeling you I'm a little now 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:28.060
 It's quite hot but there are a few magazines 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:32.590
 It will be completed when you build the Yamakoshi 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:36.910
 I think you make a temporary set before after is to paint telling make a pretty plastic model 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:41.110
 Please check the key place where it is written Te this patch N'of this Perfect grade 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.910
 It will be corrupted and another to poor at do not come off in this simple 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.710
 It is also very difficult to remove 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:51.440
 Also Toka location comes out but I did you say okay Nde was no one to say fortunately so 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:56.120
 Probably very hard this 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.960
 This part separator is included this time and this is quite versatile and very helpful 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.990
 It was 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.820
 What Te say I would Do not anymore become a little make a mistake say and pretty quick acme 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.900
 Quick licks or something 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.740
 Also at the time of incorporation of the LED unit 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:11.610
 It is a great all-rounder to use this or this 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:15.509
 In the next movie, Destroy mode and then Unchained mode 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:21.630
 We thoroughly review how to make the transformation of two modes 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:23.920
 Come Look always off-board Once when in the raised also is moving in you to shine angry this the 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.330
