00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
figures were amongst those reduced so I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
figures were amongst those reduced so I
was<00:00:51.930> able<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> pick<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.620> few<00:00:52.800> clones<00:00:53.160> a

was able to pick up a few clones a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.840 
was able to pick up a few clones a
little<00:00:53.640> bit<00:00:53.760> cheaper<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.340> must<00:00:56.579> admit

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
little bit cheaper and I must admit

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.279 
little bit cheaper and I must admit
though<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> saga<00:00:57.300> legends<00:00:57.660> line<00:00:57.870> does<00:00:58.140> offer

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
though the saga legends line does offer

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
though the saga legends line does offer
up<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.710> wide<00:00:58.920> variety<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.789> army<00:01:00.329> builder

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
up a wide variety of army builder

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.000 
up a wide variety of army builder
figures<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.199> can't<00:01:01.440> complain<00:01:01.739> too<00:01:01.980> much

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
figures so I can't complain too much

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.910 
figures so I can't complain too much
about<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.049> as<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.140> said<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.350> managed<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.710> pick

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
about it and as I said I managed to pick

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.370 
about it and as I said I managed to pick
this<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.640> much<00:01:06.479> cheaper<00:01:06.510> price<00:01:06.930> than

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
this one up a much cheaper price than

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.240 
this one up a much cheaper price than
normal<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.909> can't<00:01:09.060> complain<00:01:10.250> before

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
normal so I really can't complain before

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.859 
normal so I really can't complain before
I<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.520> onto<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.000> figure<00:01:12.299> I'm<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.750> give

I get onto the figure I'm going to give

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.060 
I get onto the figure I'm going to give
you<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> look<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> packaging<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.979> he
