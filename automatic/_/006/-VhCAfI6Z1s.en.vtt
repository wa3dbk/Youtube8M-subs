00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:12.620
 This video contains the following ingredients 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.620
 Still only good people are slow 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:25.090
 Hi everyone's highway and Mosu who 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:29.550
 I play Micra this time 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.550
 I do a kind of tied play 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000
 cut 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.550
 That's why I 'm happy again 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:10.030
 I told you to tie it down this time 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.030
 You play tied with a Mod and the Mod is 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.550
 Thought 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.130
 There is a reputation for that de m play this time 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:30.079
 I have put Spelunker mod cut 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:35.240
 If you explain to a stranger about Asperan Car Mod 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.049
 The Spellanker game is the original material and the tools used for this game in this mod 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.280
 item 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:45.150
 Such as the rule will be added to this world of Minecraft 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:50.000
 This is another rule added to this mod as you can see from this 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.000
 It will die if it jumps from 2 blocks or more in real 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.800
 Well I do not understand it is not play 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.930
 I honest heart is broken over 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.319
 Oh, this time, instead of putting the Spelunker Mod into the various mods 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.249
 Put in 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:25.060
 I can not help it but I have to do it 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:30.129
 Because it is a sprint flag bing bin this time in the premise mod minecraft forge 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.310
 Petit Fine Lumberjack Mod 's has a reputation for reducing the weight of Minecraft 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:40.720
 Timber I put my craft to add various achievements 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:44.380
 I think it's even closer to forced games 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.540
 And the purpose of this live play this time is 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.540
 It is to defeat Ender Dragon 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:05.940
 But I will try to dry but I will not run 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.380
 Why when to stand is placed in the last minute like this and say or put Spelunker Mod 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.770
 Feeling ghunggehun 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:19.280
 There is a sense of accomplishment, and if you do something unusual like this, the number of views will increase. 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.280
 I thought that I would have someone to look at 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.540
 It has put the jungle biome woodcutter mod to Anna place Yeah go to cut the tree 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.540

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.170
 Ha ha ha ha 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.360
 Dancer in such a place 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.630
 Tano 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.630
 Follow 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.900
 Ha 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.790
 Bed people can use it as a separate material 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:07.200
 Damn Nigen Do not for a moment and pain is the moment arrow 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.200
 Wait 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.890
 You guys 4 a 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.660
 It's magma 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.130
 Let's not worry about something burning 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:40.970
 For the time being, it is temporarily making temporary housing 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:43.810
 That said, it's a simple pit-hole dwelling laughter, but I 'm going to try branch mining from now on 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.810
 I think 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.010
 Put the work table here 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:58.760
 I will make a platform to cut trees probably because I was dead 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.760
 I got used to the task of making wood 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.950
 First of all, burn wood and make charcoal 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.540
 Oh, it's for filling in here 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.940
 There at office 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.940
 Good 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:39.370
 2 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:42.910
 That's why it's branch mining and I usually work harder than usual 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:48.850
 Well, easy to say when the hen is smelled of high 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:50.260
 Now for the mods you are using this time to say that I Mod in mean that branch mining 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.660
 I will explain 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.050
 Add more achievements to this mod 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.790
 Tools and armor that use their achievements 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.790
 And emeralds 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:10.669
 I'm going to die 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.669
 If you don't make a hole, you'll forget something 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.099
 Minutes 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.150
 Ha 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.920
 Another Yada 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.920
 I 'm going to cry 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.560
 Yup 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:56.490
 What do tough flame and Honma 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.180

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:03.360
 Ha 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.360
 Such a useless me is buried in the hole 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:10.240
 First of all, I think it will end here because it is good
