00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
well we have a lot of new content so

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.020 
well we have a lot of new content so
there's<00:00:17.260> nine<00:00:17.650> new<00:00:17.890> civilizations<00:00:18.670> and<00:00:18.940> all

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030 
there's nine new civilizations and all

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.850 
there's nine new civilizations and all
sorts<00:00:19.300> of<00:00:19.330> new<00:00:19.450> buildings<00:00:19.720> and<00:00:20.020> units<00:00:20.050> but<00:00:20.650> we

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
sorts of new buildings and units but we

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.340 
sorts of new buildings and units but we
really<00:00:21.130> like<00:00:21.310> to<00:00:21.660> emphasize<00:00:22.660> the<00:00:22.930> new<00:00:23.050> game

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
really like to emphasize the new game

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.580 
really like to emphasize the new game
systems<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:23.890> have<00:00:23.980> gone<00:00:24.100> on<00:00:24.160> so<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:25.810> biggest

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
systems that have gone on so the biggest

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.410 
systems that have gone on so the biggest
one<00:00:26.710> of<00:00:26.800> those<00:00:26.890> is<00:00:27.070> probably<00:00:27.340> religion<00:00:27.790> right

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
one of those is probably religion right

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.510 
one of those is probably religion right
the<00:00:28.570> beginning<00:00:28.840> of<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:28.960> game<00:00:29.520> civilizations

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
the beginning of the game civilizations

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.900 
the beginning of the game civilizations
can<00:00:30.849> start<00:00:31.630> to<00:00:31.800> worship<00:00:32.800> a<00:00:32.980> pantheon<00:00:33.610> of<00:00:33.640> gods

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
can start to worship a pantheon of gods

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.400 
can start to worship a pantheon of gods
which<00:00:34.239> gives<00:00:34.450> them<00:00:34.570> one<00:00:34.780> new<00:00:34.960> gameplay

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
which gives them one new gameplay

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.440 
which gives them one new gameplay
benefit<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:36.040> it<00:00:36.670> just<00:00:36.820> kind<00:00:36.970> of<00:00:37.030> builds<00:00:37.300> from

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
benefit and it just kind of builds from

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.910 
benefit and it just kind of builds from
there<00:00:37.660> throughout<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.410> Medieval<00:00:38.800> and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
there throughout the Medieval and

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.740 
there throughout the Medieval and
Renaissance<00:00:39.030> periods<00:00:40.030> we<00:00:40.329> really<00:00:40.570> are

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
Renaissance periods we really are

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.240 
Renaissance periods we really are
excited<00:00:40.870> about<00:00:41.200> that<00:00:41.440> system<00:00:41.770> because<00:00:42.100> it

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
excited about that system because it

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.100 
excited about that system because it
allows<00:00:42.489> players<00:00:43.120> to<00:00:43.300> customize<00:00:43.870> their

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
allows players to customize their

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.990 
allows players to customize their
strategies<00:00:44.530> when<00:00:45.100> we<00:00:45.220> release<00:00:45.489> civilization

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
strategies when we release civilization

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.299 
strategies when we release civilization
5<00:00:46.210> we<00:00:46.720> had<00:00:46.899> completely<00:00:47.469> rewritten<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.980> combat

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
5 we had completely rewritten the combat

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.740 
5 we had completely rewritten the combat
system<00:00:48.519> we'd<00:00:48.850> completely<00:00:49.149> rewritten<00:00:49.600> the

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
system we'd completely rewritten the

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.810 
system we'd completely rewritten the
diplomatic<00:00:50.230> system<00:00:50.559> and<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:51.370> add<00:00:51.519> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
diplomatic system and to add the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.580 
diplomatic system and to add the
religion<00:00:52.210> system<00:00:52.570> at<00:00:52.660> least<00:00:52.809> as<00:00:52.929> it<00:00:53.050> was<00:00:53.230> or

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
religion system at least as it was or

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.799 
religion system at least as it was or
layered<00:00:54.160> on<00:00:54.280> top<00:00:54.309> of<00:00:54.640> that<00:00:54.760> we<00:00:55.449> felt<00:00:55.629> would<00:00:55.750> be

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
layered on top of that we felt would be

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.229 
layered on top of that we felt would be
a<00:00:55.929> little<00:00:56.170> bit<00:00:56.320> of<00:00:56.440> overkill<00:00:57.399> so<00:00:57.940> when<00:00:58.059> Ed

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
a little bit of overkill so when Ed

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.939 
a little bit of overkill so when Ed
really<00:00:58.480> attacked<00:00:58.780> us<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.350> he<00:00:59.469> really<00:00:59.739> want<00:00:59.890> to

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
really attacked us and he really want to

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.619 
really attacked us and he really want to
accomplish<00:01:00.070> something<00:01:00.399> that<00:01:00.579> fit<00:01:00.760> was<00:01:00.879> 25<00:01:01.300> he

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
accomplish something that fit was 25 he

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.450 
accomplish something that fit was 25 he
really<00:01:02.379> dug<00:01:02.559> down<00:01:02.739> deep<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.129> can't<00:01:03.339> with

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
really dug down deep and can't with

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.340 
really dug down deep and can't with
something<00:01:03.760> that<00:01:03.789> we<00:01:03.940> think<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.269> really<00:01:04.960> really

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
something that we think is really really

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.840 
something that we think is really really
cool<00:01:05.620> and<00:01:05.860> I<00:01:05.890> want<00:01:06.100> this<00:01:06.160> to<00:01:06.310> be<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.430> game<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:06.760> I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
cool and I want this to be a game that I

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.210 
cool and I want this to be a game that I
can<00:01:07.030> play<00:01:07.210> over<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.540> over<00:01:07.720> again<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:09.010> don't

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
can play over and over again and I don't

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.530 
can play over and over again and I don't
want<00:01:09.400> to<00:01:09.550> have<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.960> know<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.200> same<00:01:11.410> choices

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
want to have you know the same choices

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.060 
want to have you know the same choices
presented<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.960> me<00:01:13.990> without<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.860> lot<00:01:15.040> of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
presented to me without a lot of

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.680 
presented to me without a lot of
variation<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:15.940> I<00:01:15.970> like<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.420> kind<00:01:16.600> of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
variation so I like that kind of

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.590 
variation so I like that kind of
customization<00:01:17.470> it's<00:01:18.460> great<00:01:18.700> now<00:01:19.210> that<00:01:19.540> we

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
customization it's great now that we

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.000 
customization it's great now that we
have<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.810> expansion<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.350> have<00:01:20.440> 34<00:01:20.920> different

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
have the expansion we have 34 different

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.280 
have the expansion we have 34 different
civilizations<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:22.030> play<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:22.840> that's<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.110> lot<00:01:23.260> of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
civilizations to play so that's a lot of

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.200 
civilizations to play so that's a lot of
choice<00:01:23.590> right<00:01:23.860> there<00:01:24.130> when<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.670> start<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.090> new

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
choice right there when you start a new

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.090 
choice right there when you start a new
game<00:01:25.240> up<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.350> decide<00:01:26.650> you're<00:01:26.800> going<00:01:27.010> to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
game up and you decide you're going to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.890 
game up and you decide you're going to
go<00:01:27.190> down<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.400> religious<00:01:27.730> path<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.480> starts<00:01:28.840> in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
go down the religious path it starts in

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.420 
go down the religious path it starts in
a<00:01:28.990> couple<00:01:29.080> ways<00:01:29.350> first<00:01:29.770> off<00:01:29.950> there's<00:01:30.130> faith

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
a couple ways first off there's faith

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.070 
a couple ways first off there's faith
faith<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.210> yield<00:01:31.450> in<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.660> game<00:01:31.810> just<00:01:31.990> like

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
faith is a yield in the game just like

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.630 
faith is a yield in the game just like
culture<00:01:32.620> science<00:01:32.920> gold<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.340> get<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.550> from

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
culture science gold you get it from

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.790 
culture science gold you get it from
buildings<00:01:34.180> like<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.020> shrine<00:01:35.290> of<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.470> temple

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
buildings like the shrine of the temple

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.680 
buildings like the shrine of the temple
you<00:01:35.920> might<00:01:36.040> find<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.430> among<00:01:36.640> like<00:01:37.060> ancient

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
you might find it among like ancient

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.930 
you might find it among like ancient
ruins<00:01:38.140> things<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.620> find<00:01:38.650> once<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.760> just

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
ruins things that you find once you just

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.550 
ruins things that you find once you just
get<00:01:40.030> up<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:40.270> little<00:01:40.540> bit<00:01:40.660> of<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.780> mount<00:01:40.990> you

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
get up to that little bit of a mount you

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.840 
get up to that little bit of a mount you
get<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.800> found<00:01:41.980> a<00:01:42.070> pantheon<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.490> gods<00:01:42.550> it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
get to found a pantheon of the gods it

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.940 
get to found a pantheon of the gods it
just<00:01:43.000> happens<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.870> clock<00:01:44.110> starts<00:01:44.410> ticking

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
just happens the clock starts ticking

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.770 
just happens the clock starts ticking
away<00:01:45.190> towards<00:01:45.730> getting<00:01:45.910> a<00:01:46.000> religion<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.660> have

through<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.360> Espionage<00:03:52.810> system<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.320> that's

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
through the Espionage system so that's

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.530 
through the Espionage system so that's
really<00:03:53.710> what<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:53.890> love<00:03:54.130> we've<00:03:54.610> always<00:03:54.970> been<00:03:55.270> in

really what I love we've always been in
an<00:03:55.630> ongoing<00:03:55.780> fight<00:03:56.440> with<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.070> game<00:03:57.250> itself<00:03:57.580> to

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
an ongoing fight with the game itself to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.630 
an ongoing fight with the game itself to
make<00:03:58.210> naval<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.900> really<00:03:59.830> compelling<00:04:00.220> part<00:04:00.520> of

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
make naval a really compelling part of

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.220 
make naval a really compelling part of
the<00:04:00.700> game<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.630> we<00:04:01.780> wanted<00:04:01.990> to<00:04:02.050> make<00:04:02.140> it

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
the game so we wanted to make it

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.870 
the game so we wanted to make it
dangerous<00:04:02.500> we<00:04:02.980> wanted<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.220> have<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.430> reason<00:04:03.850> for

dangerous we wanted to have a reason for

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.670 
dangerous we wanted to have a reason for
you<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.150> build<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.390> fleet<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:04.960> ability<00:04:05.620> to

foothold<00:04:08.260> in<00:04:08.500> enemy<00:04:08.740> territory<00:04:08.800> so<00:04:09.490> you<00:04:09.550> can

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
foothold in enemy territory so you can

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.070 
foothold in enemy territory so you can
actually<00:04:09.880> start<00:04:10.270> out<00:04:10.360> an<00:04:10.480> invasion<00:04:10.720> like<00:04:10.930> that

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
actually start out an invasion like that

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.240 
actually start out an invasion like that
you'll<00:04:11.200> have<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.410> risk<00:04:11.560> all<00:04:11.680> your<00:04:11.830> unit<00:04:12.070> land

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
you'll have to risk all your unit land

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.100 
you'll have to risk all your unit land
units<00:04:12.400> first<00:04:12.760> now<00:04:13.450> you<00:04:13.510> have<00:04:13.750> your<00:04:13.780> naval

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
units first now you have your naval

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.200 
units first now you have your naval
units<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:14.560> take<00:04:14.830> that<00:04:14.980> enemy<00:04:15.280> city<00:04:15.550> you<00:04:16.090> now

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.210 
units you take that enemy city you now

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.640 
units you take that enemy city you now
have<00:04:16.270> a<00:04:16.330> foothold<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:17.020> land<00:04:17.200> all<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.530> your

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
have a foothold to land all of your

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.530 
have a foothold to land all of your
other<00:04:17.710> stuff<00:04:18.040> up<00:04:18.220> behind<00:04:18.460> it<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.850> move

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
other stuff up behind it and move

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.270 
other stuff up behind it and move
forward<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.109> one<00:04:20.260> area<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.739> definitely<00:04:21.130> found

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
forward and one area we definitely found

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.120 
forward and one area we definitely found
some<00:04:21.549> weaknesses<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.270> was<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:23.290> ai's<00:04:23.590> ability

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
some weaknesses it was the ai's ability

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.000 
some weaknesses it was the ai's ability
to<00:04:24.430> gather<00:04:25.120> up<00:04:25.360> an<00:04:25.480> army<00:04:25.690> get<00:04:26.440> that<00:04:26.560> army

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
to gather up an army get that army

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.400 
to gather up an army get that army
across<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.820> seas<00:04:28.060> so<00:04:28.570> we<00:04:28.690> made<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:29.200> that

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
across the seas so we made it so that

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.470 
across the seas so we made it so that
the<00:04:29.680> embarked<00:04:30.430> games<00:04:30.670> can<00:04:30.910> now<00:04:31.000> stack<00:04:31.300> with

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
the embarked games can now stack with

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.170 
the embarked games can now stack with
the<00:04:31.570> naval<00:04:31.900> units<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:32.560> now<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.520> naval<00:04:34.000> invasion

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
the naval units and now a naval invasion

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.670 
the naval units and now a naval invasion
just<00:04:34.510> doesn't<00:04:34.720> take<00:04:34.810> as<00:04:34.930> much<00:04:34.990> space<00:04:35.350> on<00:04:35.590> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
just doesn't take as much space on the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.770 
just doesn't take as much space on the
map<00:04:35.890> we've<00:04:36.610> also<00:04:36.820> tried<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.360> fill<00:04:37.510> in<00:04:37.660> some

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
map we've also tried to fill in some

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.100 
map we've also tried to fill in some
holes<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:38.230> turn

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
holes in turn

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.290 
holes in turn
of<00:04:39.260> nothing<00:04:40.040> between<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.460> trireme<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.240> the

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
of nothing between the trireme and the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.320 
of nothing between the trireme and the
Caravelle<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.170> we<00:04:42.260> added<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.620> galius<00:04:43.610> which

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
Caravelle so we added the galius which

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.500 
Caravelle so we added the galius which
is<00:04:44.600> arranged<00:04:45.440> renaissance-era<00:04:46.400> ship<00:04:47.330> and

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
is arranged renaissance-era ship and

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.790 
is arranged renaissance-era ship and
that's<00:04:47.630> actually<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.990> first<00:04:48.110> ship<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.620> gets

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
that's actually the first ship that gets

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.740 
that's actually the first ship that gets
a<00:04:49.070> ranged<00:04:49.430> attack<00:04:49.760> capability<00:04:50.420> is<00:04:50.510> kind<00:04:50.690> of

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
a ranged attack capability is kind of

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.240 
a ranged attack capability is kind of
really<00:04:50.930> nice<00:04:51.050> when<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.380> get<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.650> one<00:04:51.950> but

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
really nice when you get to that one but

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.120 
really nice when you get to that one but
a<00:04:52.280> lot<00:04:52.790> of<00:04:52.820> work<00:04:53.150> on<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:54.290> I<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:54.650> takes<00:04:54.890> to

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
a lot of work on the I it takes to

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.440 
a lot of work on the I it takes to
actually<00:04:55.190> gather<00:04:55.550> these<00:04:55.820> fleets<00:04:56.120> together

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
actually gather these fleets together

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.970 
actually gather these fleets together
how<00:04:56.750> they're<00:04:56.960> grouped<00:04:57.230> how<00:04:57.410> they're<00:04:57.590> sent<00:04:57.830> out

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
how they're grouped how they're sent out

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.670 
how they're grouped how they're sent out
and<00:04:58.300> he's<00:04:59.300> made<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.630> efficient<00:05:00.170> by<00:05:00.260> probably

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
and he's made it efficient by probably

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.050 
and he's made it efficient by probably
over<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.010> hundred<00:05:01.220> percent<00:05:01.400> so<00:05:01.850> they're<00:05:01.970> doing

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
over a hundred percent so they're doing

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.520 
over a hundred percent so they're doing
it<00:05:02.210> twice<00:05:02.480> as<00:05:02.660> fast<00:05:02.810> as<00:05:02.990> they<00:05:03.080> were<00:05:03.170> before<00:05:03.260> the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
it twice as fast as they were before the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.750 
it twice as fast as they were before the
way<00:05:03.770> that<00:05:03.950> they're<00:05:04.070> grouping<00:05:04.400> their<00:05:04.550> fleets

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
way that they're grouping their fleets

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.460 
way that they're grouping their fleets
together<00:05:05.090> is<00:05:05.270> working<00:05:05.570> much<00:05:05.960> better<00:05:05.990> than<00:05:06.290> has

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
together is working much better than has

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.950 
together is working much better than has
before<00:05:06.830> but<00:05:07.640> that<00:05:07.760> kind<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.030> AI<00:05:08.210> work<00:05:08.540> the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
before but that kind of AI work the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.270 
before but that kind of AI work the
stray<00:05:09.230> great<00:05:09.470> generals<00:05:09.860> that<00:05:09.980> everybody

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
stray great generals that everybody

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.560 
stray great generals that everybody
would<00:05:10.370> notice<00:05:10.640> that<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:10.850> I<00:05:10.880> had<00:05:11.180> one<00:05:11.330> on<00:05:11.420> the

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
would notice that the I had one on the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.330 
would notice that the I had one on the
open<00:05:11.810> easy<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.110> capture<00:05:12.290> a<00:05:12.620> lot<00:05:13.160> of<00:05:13.250> those

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
open easy to capture a lot of those

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.650 
open easy to capture a lot of those
things<00:05:13.550> were<00:05:13.640> really<00:05:13.760> trying<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.150> squash<00:05:14.420> to

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
things were really trying to squash to

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:32.530 
things were really trying to squash to
make<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.870> whole<00:05:14.960> experience<00:05:15.410> even<00:05:15.650> better
