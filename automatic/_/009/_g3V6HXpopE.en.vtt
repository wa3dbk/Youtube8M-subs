then<00:01:32.310> i<00:01:32.340> only<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.610> seed<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.939> focuses<00:01:33.420> really

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
then i only get seed that focuses really

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
then i only get seed that focuses really
well<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.259> gets<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> really<00:01:34.829> good<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.130> will
