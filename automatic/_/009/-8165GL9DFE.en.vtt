bikes and I really do that but we put
the<00:01:37.569> bikes<00:01:37.719> in<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:37.960> circle<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.850> my<00:01:40.119> spin<00:01:40.359> classes

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
the bikes in a circle so my spin classes

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.330 
the bikes in a circle so my spin classes
are<00:01:40.840> held<00:01:40.929> in<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.139> round<00:01:41.380> we<00:01:41.740> warm<00:01:42.009> up<00:01:42.130> for

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
and spin classes but it's fun and that's

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.410 
and spin classes but it's fun and that's
part<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> part<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.910> gig<00:02:38.110> but<00:02:40.420> like

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
we'll go up a hill for words don't go up

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.690 
we'll go up a hill for words don't go up
the<00:02:43.820> hill<00:02:43.850> backwards<00:02:44.890> increments<00:02:45.890> between<00:02:46.400> 1

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
the hill backwards increments between 1

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.960 
the hill backwards increments between 1
and<00:02:46.880> 10<00:02:46.940> 0<00:02:47.620> being<00:02:48.620> absolutely<00:02:49.280> no<00:02:49.460> resistance

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
and 10 0 being absolutely no resistance

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.440 
and 10 0 being absolutely no resistance
10<00:02:50.330> being<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.840> literally<00:02:51.200> cannot<00:02:51.770> move<00:02:52.450> the

other side and then roll down the hill
with<00:03:01.070> zero<00:03:01.250> resistance<00:03:01.580> then<00:03:02.000> we<00:03:02.090> go<00:03:02.210> up<00:03:02.240> at

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
with zero resistance then we go up at
