00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.299
 Hello, I continue 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.259
 his cut full-time table so to speak 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:17.930
 a circular circular in the process of creating 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:23.210
 there was a desire to add two 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:26.149
 additional options ie manual 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.360
 Manual jigsaw put on hospital with 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.579
 one side and the other hand 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:37.600
 frezer 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:40.550
 also make a milling table that's added 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.200
 your circulars like this one 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.960
 Here's a side arrive 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.520
 [music] 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.520
 that is, apparently the guide 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.340
 the corners of the two sides metal thursday here 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.659
 added a quad plate four by 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.690
 the whole length again here, too, foursome 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:15.190
 and here boil it turned out like this 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:19.020
 Here is the thing that is inserted here 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.530
 this is the extra part here 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:28.000
 I will place under the jigsaw manual 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.520
 bolts and brackets will be welded here 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.210
 who will press this one over here 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.200
 a platform 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.420
 Manual jigsaw is inserted one 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.420
 hand very uncomfortable therefore 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:47.670
 still not polished which is so 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:50.039
 tugovato here and so it is inserted and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.159
 it turns out this extra 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.140
 part 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.770
 and here is the same time I have a circular 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.170
 it turns out completely collapsible that is 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.049
 legs are removed 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:10.910
 in the process of creating I set myself 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:12.150
 multiple goals 1 it should be parsing 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:19.260
 the second 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:23.010
 she must have a decent weight that is in 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.400
 the cutting process the vibration should 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.519
 be minimized 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:34.880
 the accuracy increases accordingly 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:38.580
 material handling here and third 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.020
 the tool that is attached manual he 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.950
 should 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.110
 filming is possible in the future I 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.460
 I connect to it struzhkososos have 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.670
 me again homemade somehow 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:03:00.070
 I'll shoot a movie about him 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:03.250
 here he is this one she will be one 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.530
 for all, that is what for circulars 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.660
 for a jigsaw if necessary I will 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.840
 I will expose also for a manual frezer 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.770
 but practice showed here by the previous one 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.290
 my circular I know that 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:21.959
 the table should be as good as possible 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.709
 polished and on the table would be desirable 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.709
 make markup
