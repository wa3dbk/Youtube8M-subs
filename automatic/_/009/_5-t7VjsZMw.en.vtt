International Harvester muffler and

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.020 
International Harvester muffler and
check<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> bracket<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.000> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
check out the bracket on here and that I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.820 
check out the bracket on here and that I
did<00:01:42.270> there's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.570> custom<00:01:42.990> made<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.320> bracket

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
did there's a custom made this bracket

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.560 
did there's a custom made this bracket
and<00:01:43.920> pad<00:01:44.190> right<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:45.060> muffle<00:01:45.659> clamp<00:01:45.900> there

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
and pad right on to muffle clamp there

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.660 
and pad right on to muffle clamp there
and<00:01:48.570> tied<00:01:49.140> light<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> engine<00:01:50.130> there<00:01:50.370> so

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
and tied light to the engine there so

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.330 
and tied light to the engine there so
that<00:01:50.880> gives<00:01:51.240> me<00:01:51.510> some<00:01:52.350> additional<00:01:52.830> support

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that gives me some additional support

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.570 
that gives me some additional support
just<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.760> keep<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.150> thing<00:01:54.210> from<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:55.580> putting

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
just to keep this thing from not putting

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.950 
just to keep this thing from not putting
any<00:01:56.670> stress<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.540> engine<00:01:58.290> work<00:01:59.810> at<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
any stress on the engine work at the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.330 
any stress on the engine work at the
same<00:02:01.170> time<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.100> I've<00:02:02.280> added<00:02:04.310> some<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
same time you can see I've added some of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.200 
same time you can see I've added some of
these<00:02:05.520> clamps

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
these clamps

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.960 
these clamps
I<00:02:06.560> guess<00:02:07.560> there's<00:02:07.799> ring<00:02:08.010> bolts<00:02:08.399> I'm<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:08.700> sure

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
I guess there's ring bolts I'm not sure

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.600 
I guess there's ring bolts I'm not sure
what<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:09.269> call<00:02:09.540> them<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.709> put<00:02:11.340> four<00:02:11.580> on

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
what they call them but I put four on

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.340 
what they call them but I put four on
there<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.570> I've<00:02:12.660> got<00:02:12.870> them<00:02:12.930> all<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> way

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
there so I've got them all the way

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.070 
there so I've got them all the way
around<00:02:13.680> there<00:02:13.950> were<00:02:14.070> existing<00:02:14.549> holes<00:02:15.080> they

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
around there were existing holes they

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.620 
around there were existing holes they
don't<00:02:16.290> really<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.709> anything<00:02:17.480> hurt<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
don't really do anything hurt the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.380 
don't really do anything hurt the
structure<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.320> tractor<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.390> they're

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
structure of the tractor and they're

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.650 
structure of the tractor and they're
great<00:02:21.870> for<00:02:22.110> time

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
great for time

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.130 
great for time
on<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.170> trailer<00:02:24.800> gives<00:02:25.490> me<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> nice<00:02:25.880> easy<00:02:26.720> way<00:02:27.080> to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
on a trailer gives me a nice easy way to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.950 
on a trailer gives me a nice easy way to
tie<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.860> something<00:02:28.280> too<00:02:28.490> quick<00:02:28.760> too<00:02:29.030> you

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
tie it on something too quick too you

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.170 
tie it on something too quick too you
can<00:02:30.140> see<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:30.440> on<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.830> nine<00:02:31.100> or<00:02:31.130> parents<00:02:31.760> basis

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
can see it's on a nine or parents basis

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.670 
can see it's on a nine or parents basis
here<00:02:32.450> with<00:02:32.630> red<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.810> let<00:02:38.810> me<00:02:38.930> hold<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.470> for<00:02:39.650> now

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
here with red and let me hold it for now

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.940 
here with red and let me hold it for now
I'm<00:02:40.070> going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.310> see<00:02:41.210> if<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.480> can't<00:02:41.750> open<00:02:42.650> up<00:02:42.770> the

there this is a Sundstrand hydro and you

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.450 
there this is a Sundstrand hydro and you
can<00:02:56.060> see<00:02:56.330> I've<00:02:57.170> got<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.560> pretty<00:02:57.770> well<00:02:58.070> cleaned

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
can see I've got it pretty well cleaned

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
can see I've got it pretty well cleaned
up<00:02:59.020> and<00:03:00.020> I've<00:03:00.170> been<00:03:00.410> using<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.950> fairly<00:03:01.280> steady

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.070 

measures<00:03:05.480> watch<00:03:05.780> mechanism<00:03:06.530> right<00:03:06.710> there<00:03:08.080> and

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
measures watch mechanism right there and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.080 
measures watch mechanism right there and
you<00:03:09.350> engage<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:11.810> kind<00:03:12.020> of<00:03:12.640> it<00:03:13.640> slides

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
you engage that just kind of it slides

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.530 
you engage that just kind of it slides
in<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.930> out<00:03:15.400> that's<00:03:16.400> what<00:03:16.610> engages<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.210> just

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
in and out that's what engages it just

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.330 
in and out that's what engages it just
kind<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.780> watch<00:03:17.990> off<00:03:18.550> propagated<00:03:19.550> here

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
kind of watch off propagated here

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:30.210 
kind of watch off propagated here
see<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.880> moves<00:03:22.120> off<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:29.890> moves<00:03:30.100> it

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
see that moves off so it just moves it

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.850 
see that moves off so it just moves it
in<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.520> out<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:31.140> that's<00:03:32.140> what<00:03:32.350> engages<00:03:32.830> that

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
in and out and that's what engages that

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.360 
in and out and that's what engages that
this<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.340> sort<00:03:33.580> of<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.720> bevel<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:35.980> piece<00:03:36.190> is

this is sort of on a bevel this piece is

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.430 
this is sort of on a bevel this piece is
at<00:03:36.520> an<00:03:36.640> angle<00:03:36.790> fits<00:03:37.480> into<00:03:37.810> there<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.290> that's

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
at an angle fits into there and that's

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.449 
at an angle fits into there and that's
what<00:03:38.680> blocks<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:42.209> mower<00:03:43.209> deck<00:03:44.280> 42<00:03:45.280> inch
