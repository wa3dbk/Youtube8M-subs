00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello, I studied French and today I am 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.070
 here to make a tip for you guys a lot 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.089
 good by uncle how to remove enamel with 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.680
 to have you all, to make friends, not to 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:24.480
 It's because it leaves a beautiful risk. 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.320
 just that it is a hell to get these 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.420
 Especially here they do not go river. 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.540
 many of you already know more. 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.540
 finally it is to inoculate the method that seems 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.520
 awesome magic is super fast and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.000
 easy 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.410
 will all the nail public have no cost 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.399
 no today is cheap 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.129
 plus much beats show shown up 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.420
 I sang the passage of time all that I 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.699
 I promise it will be easy to solve 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.780
 good people here are these lindeiros of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.899
 O glitter everyone here gets along 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.450
 But I do not know if you 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.479
 The flu was 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 an ultimate glitter should be that name 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.560
 Why can not you go, it's never going to be 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.150
 more 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.100
 There is no way to get it out with ketone. 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.170
 try to do a test if you do not 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.119
 they will get it does not go out with the sector 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.700
 still have to always have a spatula and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.810
 shaving or bad and even then it is difficult 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.180
 to remove 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.640
 so I spent two layers of it and like 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.479
 I said it is the hardest thing to do. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.549
 remove will only need three with 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.920
 cotton acetone and small pieces of paper 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.430
 aluminum are people that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.829
 even if the market has an account 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.960
 and may be it is even there you will 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.939
 take a piece of cotton did not 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.230
 It needs to be very big. 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.400
 little piece 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.400
 and obeys fairly with acetone 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.690
 reasonably humid there we'll go 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.850
 put on the nail and let's go 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:20.460
 envelop our finger with the paper in the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:23.370
 movie only make pack that we 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.760
 change more pressed here and you will 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.860
 see that in seconds matter of seconds 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.060
 it will come out all glitter is in a way 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:39.600
 super fast and simple that b just pull 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.870
 here spin a little bit of pull and it 's 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.660
 more magic 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.810
 It's only clear that the red that was 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:54.500
 below it was still a little bit here 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.500

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:25.010
 I passed four layers of law 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.010
 They are very beautiful, but let's go. 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:43.579
 Press the button once again to 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.579
 a little to get the corners and pulls 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.489
