 Great is the one who stands and crown 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.360
 The dancers only learn 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.590
 individual figures and the combination of the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.199
 must make the coal 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.059
 that is different every time there is none 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.080
 choreography the same on two evenings 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.269
 is so to speak 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.940
 it is always exciting as in 68 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.460
 figures in the moment to mainstream 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.680
 program is learned and these eight and 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.479
 six figures how can I be beautiful 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.280
 So that means a lot here 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.280
 cowboys without whiskey 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.480
 put her on 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.970
 So you do not listen to the sound 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.840

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.250
 and you take care of that too 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.170
 little bit as the mother of square dance 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.330
 clubs because the clothes vote 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.820
 It is easy enough to do that 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.700
 nice at the big events that 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.030
 You really can swing that way 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.549
 Swimming is like dancing 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.330
 high flies in the moment yes but then sees 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.679

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:44.170

 Instructions are also available 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.350

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.530
 durchblick 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.660
 then it starts already 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.060
 So that's my dance partner who knows 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.070
 how to hold a woman's hand 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.960

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.540
 beginner with the left right weakness 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:47.740

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:49.450
 already herbert on my side are the 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.750
 just go into the cold water 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.750

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:08.640
 the first figure fresh freelancer you 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.910
 the newspaper 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.790
 I call that the zero number because you 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.660
 ends up exactly like two now 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.930
 Steps to the left you can dance with 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:28.490
 two forward two to the right two 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.490
 back 2 1 but by a 2 3 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.770
 learn next figure is parallel running 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:42.560
 for that we need a left front wheel 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:46.260
 you turn 180 degrees just colbert yes 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.500
 julia next regular so-called wide 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.590
 web trend issued partner rights 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.290
 hand right hand done yes and then 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.660
 move in front of Bali and the next dancers 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.480
 The move and joints pass by 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.709
 left right and right again and good 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.709
 just do not get faster 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:31.419
 works great bowl exchange the recovery 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.430
 Of course, that would be the swing of arm 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.220
 office practically a reward for yours 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.320
 partner the legs hand go around once 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.320
 s 12 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.210
 so now i have nothing left to do 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.210
 see 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.849
 heldt 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:08.370
 So slowly it starts to be really fun 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.370
 It's not hard to do that 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:26.759
 one uses the lift window left julia 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.789
 Now you have learned a lot, normally 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:33.240
 Let's wait weeks like before to start 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:36.780
 We are doing this with female exchange today 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.810
 neither do they come at the end of each round 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.979
 your beloved norbert there yes me 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.979
 So without women exchange 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.910
 I have 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.410
 and how often did not step on the feet 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:16.970
 not even he is there 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.500
 he was definitely fun 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.990
 but now I want to know 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.850
 at all suitable so I think 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.590
 you are very well suited for this 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.310
 It could start immediately next week 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.340
 So you have to do that with us 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.500
 learn seven months then you have all 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.419
 figures and that has everything wonderful 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.460
 I did not work with figures either 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.800
 I explained you did well 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.470

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.470
