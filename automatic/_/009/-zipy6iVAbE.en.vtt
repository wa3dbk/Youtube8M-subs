00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.740
 hello everyone today we are with xavi from 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.660
 lounge 44 in Madrid and comment on how 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.790
 make a visa as perfect as this 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.040
 is going to give us some tricks so that 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.770
 let's have such spectacular hair 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:31.919
 like the model on a xavi or the same 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:34.890
 that you tell us here working with the 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.570
 ceramic plates and varnish 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 particular dramatizations is from 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.460
 titanium what we get is all the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.320
 hair that totally polished and shines 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.539
 unlike the ceramic ones of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.519
 titanium what differences there are also 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.890
 also the difference is the varnishes 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.199
 that takes the iron like this to all the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.579
 ceramic plates tax goods that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.010
 reinforces it so that it does not break 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.250
 city ​​is worth and this leads to different 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.250
 treatments 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.710
 directly commenting 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.860
 the cuticle if we want to see a hair 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.630
 totally alone with one or two passes you 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.009
 I would recommend is a titanium plate 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.009
 for keratin treatments 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.420
 to finish so that the tip by 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.850
 example if we have a broken tip 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.600
 so that it is not so obvious that everyone 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.600
 we have to do 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.850
 inward plate if this 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.369
 how you see when going past the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.709
 iron if it is totally polished and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.909
 hair villa what we do is that 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:52.619
 the tip goes in clear and does not 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.750
 see that it points that it can be 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.810
 then it is punished 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.790
 totally public totally clear and what 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:11.479
 we passed or vice versa 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:11.479
 up the brands 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.460
 this area here is more than the tip 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:24.240
 the important thing was always triggered 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:26.630
 it is very important also not to press the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.630
 griddle 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.730
 that I was going to tell you to smooth and that you 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.860
 everything is perfect that we are going to do 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.560
 sections I do not know who we do 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.180
 sections and we started from bottom to top in 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.430
 a job above we can start 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.269
 first front and back and upside down 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.269
 advice 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:03:01.150
 zones and we have another three at home like 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.430
 have the hair if we had 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.590
 used that they were faults curses and 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.340
 a little more space is hair 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.340
 that is already smooth 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.560
 3 partitions like this will be done from 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.560
 the side on this side 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.620
 d 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.640
 two 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.959
 and this forward 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.959
 and down 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.840
 just like the truth is that for 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.840
 Many 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.730
 and after three or four years with that is 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.620
 enough to get a smoothing 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.620
 perfect and that is totally polished
