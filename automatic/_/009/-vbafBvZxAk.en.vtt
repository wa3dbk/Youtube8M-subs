00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.460 
can't show you a lot of quantum break
because<00:00:23.880> most<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.510> behind<00:00:24.840> closed

you play as the power to manipulate time

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.910 
you play as the power to manipulate time
time<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.360> power<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.619> things

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
time is your power you can do things

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.640 
time is your power you can do things
with<00:01:17.070> time<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.939> that's<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:18.869> strength<00:01:19.320> but

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
with time and that's your strength but

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.910 
with time and that's your strength but
at<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> same<00:01:20.159> time<00:01:20.430> time<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.119> breaking<00:01:21.750> down

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
at the same time time is breaking down

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.140 
at the same time time is breaking down
and<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.270> an<00:01:25.049> obstacle<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.400> has<00:01:26.580> art<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
and it is an obstacle and it has art and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.230 
and it is an obstacle and it has art and
a<00:01:27.240> danger<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:29.040> world<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.210> is

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
a danger in the world so so there is

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.840 
a danger in the world so so there is
this<00:01:30.570> shifting<00:01:31.079> balance<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.579> take

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this shifting balance that you take

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.510 
this shifting balance that you take
advantage<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.869> time<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.159> all

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
advantage of time and you can do all

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.730 
advantage of time and you can do all
kinds<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:36.060> things<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.810> at<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.530> same

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
kinds of things with that at the same

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.999 
kinds of things with that at the same
time<00:01:38.570> we<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.810> these<00:01:39.990> localized<00:01:40.619> time

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
time we have these localized time

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.310 
time we have these localized time
anomalies<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.060> game<00:01:42.390> where<00:01:42.720> time<00:01:42.990> breaks

backward<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.540> shown<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
backward and you know we shown the

ship crashes into the bridge so the ship

will make Xbox a lot of money I don't

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.320 
will make Xbox a lot of money I don't
know<00:04:28.350> but<00:04:28.830> we'll<00:04:28.949> find<00:04:29.010> out<00:04:29.430> in<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.820> year<00:04:30.300> so

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
know but we'll find out in a year so

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.469 
know but we'll find out in a year so
when<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.840> actually<00:04:30.990> gets<00:04:31.260> made<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:33.270> real

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
when it actually gets made the real

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.770 
when it actually gets made the real
challenge<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:34.139> think<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> studio<00:04:34.919> faces<00:04:35.490> is

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
challenge I think the studio faces is

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.930 
challenge I think the studio faces is
creating<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:37.080> piece<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.740> content<00:04:38.160> that<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.639> on

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
what happens it feels like a real play

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.710
