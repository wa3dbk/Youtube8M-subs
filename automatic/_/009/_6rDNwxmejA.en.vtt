00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:05.589
 This video shows a procedure to calibrate the tech and metro model 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.809
 Tyson visits 20 to carry out 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:14.599
 the calibration is required of this service in stamp before ph 7x4 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.279
 the pichi metro is turned on 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.729
 and the plastic cover that protects the electrode is removed 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.710
 then if the bullet electrode with distilled water 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 and dries with papers 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.210
 to start has calibrated 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.420
 the bottle button is pressed 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.660
 and the screen indicates I would like to introduce the electrode and the dissidence buffer dt 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.310
 h 7 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.320
 the athletic electrode is introduced, buffer is licensed 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.060
 and the button is ejected again 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.390
 on the screen it is observed how the bottle flashes until it stabilizes 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.390
 20 h 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.610
 then the screen indicates that the second distribution has to be entered 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.670
 tampon 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.670
 what will be the dph 4 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.720
 the electorate is again washed 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 and if that character 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.680
 and the electrode of the buffer solution dt h 4 is introduced 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.650
 and the button was pressed 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.879
 on the screen the bottle starts flashing again until it 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.879
 stabilize reading 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.959
 at this moment the equipment is calibrated 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.379
 indicating some calibration parameters and their validity during 24 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.099
 to end 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.449
 is washed and if the stand is silent 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.729
 and you're ready to correctly take the measurements you think
