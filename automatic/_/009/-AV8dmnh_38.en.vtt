that means a lot of organization because

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.060 
that means a lot of organization because
each<00:00:30.330> tip<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.900> separate<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.410> they<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.980> go

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
in a certain order and some need to come

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.150 
in a certain order and some need to come
before<00:00:33.630> others<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:35.730> originally<00:00:36.360> started

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
before others and I originally started

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.440 
before others and I originally started
organizing<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> spreadsheet<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.329> got

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
organizing it on a spreadsheet and I got

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.880 
organizing it on a spreadsheet and I got
about<00:00:39.600> halfway<00:00:39.930> through<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.680> book<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
about halfway through the book and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.920 
about halfway through the book and
realized<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:42.149> wasn't<00:00:42.450> working<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.809> was

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
realized that just wasn't working I was

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.470 
realized that just wasn't working I was
spending<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:44.010> time<00:00:44.120> cutting<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> pasting

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
spending all my time cutting and pasting

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.660 
spending all my time cutting and pasting
and<00:00:45.899> scrolling<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.590> searching<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and scrolling and searching and and I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.060 
and scrolling and searching and and I
couldn't<00:00:47.910> see<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.090> big<00:00:48.600> picture<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.860> book

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
couldn't see the big picture of the book

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.240 
couldn't see the big picture of the book

constantly<00:03:51.380> looking<00:03:51.680> for<00:03:51.920> where<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.070> wanted<00:03:52.459> to

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
constantly looking for where I wanted to

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.870 
constantly looking for where I wanted to
put<00:03:52.790> things<00:03:53.140> then<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.440> had<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.650> list<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.310> topics

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
put things then I had a list of topics

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.810 
put things then I had a list of topics
that<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.420> had<00:03:56.690> left<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.290> write<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:58.459> was<00:03:58.640> about

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
that I had left to write this was about

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.640 
that I had left to write this was about
halfway<00:03:59.000> through<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.390> book<00:03:59.570> and<00:04:00.049> I<00:04:00.320> could<00:04:00.470> see

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
halfway through the book and I could see

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.710 
halfway through the book and I could see
where<00:04:00.830> all<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.220> holes<00:04:01.430> were<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.150> then<00:04:02.660> I

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
where all the holes were and then I

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.900 
where all the holes were and then I
could<00:04:02.900> look<00:04:03.110> at<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:03.920> could<00:04:04.459> look<00:04:04.670> at<00:04:04.820> the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
could look at the I could look at the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.870 
could look at the I could look at the
grid<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.600> see<00:04:05.870> what<00:04:06.530> topics<00:04:06.799> that<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.310> had<00:04:07.519> left

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
grid and see what topics that I had left

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.390 
grid and see what topics that I had left
would<00:04:08.600> fit<00:04:08.840> well<00:04:08.989> in<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.620> holes<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:10.280> were

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
would fit well in the holes that were

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.940 
would fit well in the holes that were
left<00:04:10.610> so<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.600> just<00:04:11.840> became<00:04:12.080> so<00:04:12.140> much<00:04:12.500> easier<00:04:12.830> to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
left so it just became so much easier to

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.130 
left so it just became so much easier to
organize<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.519> book<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.810> quick<00:04:14.989> and

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
organize the book and so the quick and

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.080 
organize the book and so the quick and
dirty<00:04:15.170> tip<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.890> if<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.190> have<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.640> big<00:04:16.880> project

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
dirty tip is if you have a big project

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.670 
dirty tip is if you have a big project
too<00:04:17.359> argument<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.140> book

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
too argument is like a book

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.729 
too argument is like a book
consider<00:04:19.340> using<00:04:19.609> paper<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.479> really<00:04:20.810> for<00:04:21.380> me<00:04:21.530> it

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
consider using paper it really for me it

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.240 
consider using paper it really for me it
worked<00:04:21.890> much<00:04:22.250> better<00:04:22.280> than<00:04:22.789> a<00:04:22.849> spreadsheet

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250
