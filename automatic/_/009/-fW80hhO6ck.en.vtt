00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
so this is how we're going to start with

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.299 
so this is how we're going to start with
putting<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.850> tent<00:00:09.150> out<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.530> bag<00:00:10.770> it's

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
putting the tent out of the bag it's

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.850 
putting the tent out of the bag it's
really<00:00:11.490> packed<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.629> hopefully<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.320> can<00:00:13.559> get<00:00:13.709> it

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
really packed so hopefully we can get it

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.570 
really packed so hopefully we can get it
back<00:00:14.180> to<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:15.360> format<00:00:15.840> that<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.379> there<00:00:16.890> as<00:00:17.190> you

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
back to the format that is there as you

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.060 
back to the format that is there as you
can<00:00:17.760> see<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.270> pretty<00:00:18.480> tight<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.230> it's

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
can see it's pretty tight and it's

00:00:20.070 --> 00:01:18.390 
can see it's pretty tight and it's
really<00:00:20.339> good

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.990

tent what you want it oh it's huge

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.520 
tent what you want it oh it's huge
that's<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.170> big<00:01:56.350> tent<00:01:56.710> Jim

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.910 

so<00:02:02.530> yeah<00:02:03.009> where<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.150> front<00:02:07.530> which<00:02:08.530> one<00:02:08.770> is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
so yeah where is the front which one is

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.400 
so yeah where is the front which one is
the<00:02:09.009> front<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.610> think<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.390> one<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.260> you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
the front I think is the one that you

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.820 
the front I think is the one that you
pulled<00:02:11.650> out<00:02:11.830> there<00:02:12.810> well<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.840> think<00:02:14.140> we<00:02:14.560> should

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
pulled out there well I think we should

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.870 
pulled out there well I think we should
put<00:02:15.099> it<00:02:15.250> with<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.610> front<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.390> way<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:18.580> way

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
put it with the front that way this way

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.520 
put it with the front that way this way
I<00:02:19.090> think<00:02:19.360> we<00:02:19.720> should<00:02:19.930> turn<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.319> around<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:22.530> this

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
I think we should turn it around so this

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.220 
I think we should turn it around so this
is<00:02:23.800> how<00:02:24.400> big<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.600> can<00:02:25.810> see<00:02:26.050> it's

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
is how big it is and you can see it's

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.430 
is how big it is and you can see it's
humongous<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:28.140> Jim<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:30.150> not<00:02:31.150> reading<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
humongous and Jim is not reading the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.000 
humongous and Jim is not reading the
instructions<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:35.580> yeah<00:02:37.260> okay<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.800> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
instructions and yeah okay this is the
