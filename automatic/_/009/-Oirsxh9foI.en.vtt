people call it other things and I squirt

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.630 
people call it other things and I squirt
wrap<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.760> because<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.270> contains<00:00:42.899> everything

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
wrap up because it contains everything

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.160 
wrap up because it contains everything
and<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> does<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.300> centers<00:00:45.960> the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
our HTML but really if I doubt you'll be

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.240 
our HTML but really if I doubt you'll be
doing<00:04:04.200> exactly<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.800> same<00:04:04.830> as<00:04:05.100> me<00:04:05.220> just

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
doing exactly the same as me just

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.350 
doing exactly the same as me just
putting<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:05.910> an<00:04:06.090> image<00:04:06.600> on<00:04:06.780> your<00:04:06.840> webpage<00:04:07.160> so

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
putting in an image on your webpage so

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.140 
putting in an image on your webpage so
you<00:04:09.360> obviously<00:04:09.540> add<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.960> lot<00:04:10.230> more<00:04:10.790> ok<00:04:11.790> but

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
you obviously add a lot more ok but

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.240 
you obviously add a lot more ok but
remember<00:04:12.180> when<00:04:12.960> you're<00:04:13.110> using<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.530> rapid<00:04:14.070> if

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
remember when you're using the rapid if

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.690 
remember when you're using the rapid if
you<00:04:15.210> have<00:04:15.420> everything<00:04:16.250> inside<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.489> wrapper

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
you have everything inside the wrapper

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.570 
you have everything inside the wrapper
not<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.840> body<00:04:19.049> because<00:04:19.920> you<00:04:20.040> need<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> diff

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
not the body because you need the diff

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.660 
not the body because you need the diff
on<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.000> body<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:23.150> this<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.420> your<00:04:24.510> main<00:04:25.370> div<00:04:26.370> and

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
on the body so this is your main div and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.450 
on the body so this is your main div and
it<00:04:27.150> has<00:04:27.360> everything<00:04:27.870> in<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.290> except<00:04:28.800> body<00:04:29.040> and

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
it has everything in it except body and

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.290 
it has everything in it except body and
the<00:04:29.610> rest<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:32.520> always<00:04:32.760> remember<00:04:33.000> that

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300
