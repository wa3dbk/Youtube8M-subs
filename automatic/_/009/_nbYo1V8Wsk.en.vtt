their guitars just recently the s5 now I

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.959 
their guitars just recently the s5 now I
was<00:00:48.409> lucky<00:00:48.620> enough<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:49.010> be<00:00:49.159> part<00:00:49.430> of<00:00:49.520> it<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:49.820> I

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
was lucky enough to be part of it and I

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.049 
was lucky enough to be part of it and I
got<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.770> be<00:00:51.770> there<00:00:52.129> at<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.340> motor<00:00:52.520> show<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:52.760> so

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
got to be there at the motor show and so

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.060 
got to be there at the motor show and so
on<00:00:53.239> what<00:00:54.079> was<00:00:54.230> interesting<00:00:54.469> is<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:56.469> umpc<00:00:57.469> was

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
on what was interesting is that umpc was

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.360 
on what was interesting is that umpc was
showcased<00:00:58.699> as<00:00:59.570> the<00:01:00.140> preferred<00:01:00.440> digitized

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
showcased as the preferred digitized

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.169 
showcased as the preferred digitized

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
input method for at aldi's leads

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:08.200 
input method for at aldi's leads
captured<00:01:06.110> at<00:01:06.289> the<00:01:06.350> motion<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.880> what<00:01:08.030> does<00:01:08.119> that

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
captured at the motion so what does that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.330 
captured at the motion so what does that
mean<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:08.929> means<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.410> traditionally<00:01:09.950> pen<00:01:10.220> and

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
mean it means that traditionally pen and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.219 
mean it means that traditionally pen and
paper<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.820> used<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.300> capture<00:01:11.509> people's<00:01:11.990> names

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229

if you like and was it was designed

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.779 
if you like and was it was designed
using<00:02:05.390> expression<00:02:06.229> blend<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.710> new<00:02:07.310> Microsoft

using expression blend a new Microsoft

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.479 
using expression blend a new Microsoft
Application<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:09.350> it's<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.590> good<00:02:09.799> example<00:02:10.399> of

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
Application now it's a good example of

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.400 
Application now it's a good example of
how<00:02:10.700> zemel<00:02:11.390> is<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.780> glue<00:02:12.019> that<00:02:12.049> brings

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
how zemel is the glue that brings

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.500 
how zemel is the glue that brings
together<00:02:12.790> software<00:02:13.790> developers<00:02:14.299> and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
together software developers and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.430 
together software developers and
designers<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.299> great<00:02:17.600> opportunity

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
designers so this is a great opportunity

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.000

keyboard solution why because keyboards
are<00:02:30.830> actually<00:02:31.400> quite<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.670> root<00:02:32.180> level<00:02:32.390> access

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
are actually quite a root level access

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.150 
are actually quite a root level access
command<00:02:34.220> or<00:02:34.550> keystrokes<00:02:35.330> out<00:02:35.570> if<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.870> like

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
command or keystrokes out if you like

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.620 
command or keystrokes out if you like
sending<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.220> keystrokes<00:02:37.730> replication<00:02:38.420> is

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
sending the keystrokes replication is

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.780 
sending the keystrokes replication is
really<00:02:39.590> taking<00:02:39.800> charge<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.460> operating

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
really taking charge of the operating

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.200 
really taking charge of the operating
system<00:02:41.150> isn't<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:42.670> developing<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.760> keyboard

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
system isn't it so developing a keyboard

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.360 
system isn't it so developing a keyboard
using<00:02:44.420> anything<00:02:44.720> other<00:02:44.930> than<00:02:45.200> WPF<00:02:45.860> was

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
using anything other than WPF was

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.010 
using anything other than WPF was
actually<00:02:46.670> turning<00:02:46.880> into<00:02:47.120> quite<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.360> challenge

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
actually turning into quite a challenge

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.750 
actually turning into quite a challenge
in<00:02:48.640> C++<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.270> seemed<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.540> be<00:02:50.810> quite<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.110> lag

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
in C++ this seemed to be quite a lag

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.160 
in C++ this seemed to be quite a lag
happening<00:02:52.760> where<00:02:52.970> anyone<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.780> was<00:02:53.870> getting

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
happening where anyone that was getting

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.930 
happening where anyone that was getting
a<00:02:54.230> bit<00:02:54.380> confident<00:02:54.800> with<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.040> keyboard<00:02:55.250> would

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
a bit confident with the keyboard would

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.400 
a bit confident with the keyboard would
actually<00:02:56.300> drop<00:02:56.510> keystrokes<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.320> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
actually drop keystrokes in the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.680 
actually drop keystrokes in the
application<00:02:58.010> they<00:02:58.370> weren't<00:02:58.670> being<00:02:58.910> sent<00:02:59.330> fast

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
application they weren't being sent fast

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.490 
application they weren't being sent fast
enough<00:03:00.080> in<00:03:00.860> WPF<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.570> application<00:03:03.110> was<00:03:03.260> able

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
enough in WPF the application was able

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.590 
enough in WPF the application was able
to<00:03:03.590> take<00:03:03.860> advantage<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.610> some<00:03:04.670> caching<00:03:05.390> and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
to take advantage of some caching and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.330 
to take advantage of some caching and
there<00:03:06.110> was<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> little<00:03:06.500> tip<00:03:06.710> that<00:03:06.890> dr.<00:03:07.190> Neil

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
there was a little tip that dr. Neil

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.390 
there was a little tip that dr. Neil
Rudin<00:03:07.700> actually<00:03:08.030> was<00:03:08.750> able<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.200> define<00:03:10.070> by<00:03:10.340> an

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
Rudin actually was able to define by an

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.970 
Rudin actually was able to define by an
intelligent<00:03:11.000> put<00:03:11.150> panel<00:03:11.450> team<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:12.380> redmond<00:03:12.860> so

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
intelligent put panel team in redmond so

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.910 
intelligent put panel team in redmond so
thanks<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.460> microsoft<00:03:13.910> for<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:14.620> but<00:03:15.620> k<00:03:15.860> she

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
thanks to microsoft for that but k she

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.130 
thanks to microsoft for that but k she
was<00:03:16.280> able<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.640> be<00:03:16.760> used<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.360> actually<00:03:17.660> function

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
was able to be used to actually function

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.970 
was able to be used to actually function
this<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:20.120> these<00:03:20.480> key<00:03:20.870> strokes<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.710> more

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
this in these key strokes in a more

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.770 
this in these key strokes in a more
timely<00:03:22.010> manner<00:03:22.700> because<00:03:23.570> obviously

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
timely manner because obviously

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.070 
timely manner because obviously
capturing<00:03:24.590> leagues<00:03:24.860> is<00:03:25.130> is<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.580> is<00:03:26.120> costly<00:03:26.930> in

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
capturing leagues is is is is costly in

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.890 
capturing leagues is is is is costly in
that<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:27.380> chews<00:03:27.650> up<00:03:27.680> people's<00:03:28.250> time<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:29.239> using

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
that in chews up people's time so using

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.729 
that in chews up people's time so using
this<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:31.250> audi<00:03:31.520> keyboard<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.600> WPF<00:03:33.380> we<00:03:33.680> were

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
this this audi keyboard and WPF we were

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.860 
this this audi keyboard and WPF we were
able<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:34.070> establish<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.940> more<00:03:35.180> timely<00:03:35.510> manner

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
able to establish a more timely manner

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.770 
able to establish a more timely manner
to<00:03:36.050> send<00:03:36.290> keystrokes<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:38.180> let's<00:03:38.360> open<00:03:38.420> up<00:03:38.660> the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
to send keystrokes so let's open up the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.110 
to send keystrokes so let's open up the
keyboard<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.170> have<00:03:39.350> a<00:03:39.380> closer<00:03:39.620> look<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.970> key

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
keyboard and have a closer look the key

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.550 
keyboard and have a closer look the key
would<00:03:41.300> actually<00:03:41.630> cleverly<00:03:42.050> splits<00:03:42.380> the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
would actually cleverly splits the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.890 
would actually cleverly splits the
screen<00:03:42.830> into<00:03:43.130> two<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:44.060> what<00:03:44.239> I've<00:03:44.330> taken<00:03:44.570> is<00:03:44.780> a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
screen into two so what I've taken is a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.780 
screen into two so what I've taken is a
just<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.230> blank<00:03:45.440> text<00:03:45.860> document<00:03:46.280> page<00:03:46.459> and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
just a blank text document page and

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.509 
just a blank text document page and
you'll<00:03:47.360> see<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.860> actual<00:03:49.100> keyboard

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
you'll see that the the actual keyboard

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.790 
you'll see that the the actual keyboard
itself<00:03:50.120> sits<00:03:50.780> happily<00:03:51.170> at<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.350> bottom<00:03:51.650> and

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
itself sits happily at the bottom and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.300 
itself sits happily at the bottom and
the<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:53.209> application<00:03:53.870> takes<00:03:54.380> up<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.860> balance

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
the the application takes up the balance

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.720 
the the application takes up the balance
of<00:03:55.610> screen<00:03:56.209> now<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.080> reason<00:03:57.350> that<00:03:57.590> LD<00:03:58.489> chose

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
of screen now the reason that LD chose

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.600 
of screen now the reason that LD chose
to<00:03:58.970> use<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.450> internet<00:03:59.920> explorer<00:04:00.920> for<00:04:01.430> their

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
to use the internet explorer for their

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.360 
to use the internet explorer for their
application<00:04:02.330> was<00:04:02.810> two<00:04:03.019> reasons<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:04.250> I'm

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
application was two reasons and I'm

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.580 
application was two reasons and I'm
going<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:04.550> demonstrate<00:04:04.700> on<00:04:05.590> wordpad

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
going to demonstrate on wordpad

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.790 
going to demonstrate on wordpad
obviously<00:04:06.980> notepad<00:04:07.910> using<00:04:08.650> just<00:04:09.650> to

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
obviously notepad using just to

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.040 
obviously notepad using just to
demonstrate<00:04:09.950> how<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.519> works<00:04:10.900> but<00:04:11.900> they

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
demonstrate how it works but they

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.080 
demonstrate how it works but they
actually<00:04:12.110> LD<00:04:12.680> actually<00:04:12.950> link<00:04:13.880> towards

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
actually LD actually link towards

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.039 
actually LD actually link towards
internet<00:04:14.870> explorer<00:04:15.290> 7.0<00:04:16.480> and<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.690> reason<00:04:18.019> for

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
internet explorer 7.0 and the reason for

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.220 
internet explorer 7.0 and the reason for
that<00:04:18.290> is<00:04:18.470> 21<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.669> that

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
that is 21 is that

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.530 
that is 21 is that
lated<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:21.190> tabs<00:04:21.460> that<00:04:21.610> appear<00:04:22.330> at<00:04:22.420> the<00:04:22.510> top

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
lated the tabs that appear at the top

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.480 
lated the tabs that appear at the top
because<00:04:22.870> they<00:04:23.110> were<00:04:23.170> flipping<00:04:23.890> between<00:04:24.010> two

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
because they were flipping between two

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.550 
because they were flipping between two
screens<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.150> those<00:04:25.690> perhaps<00:04:26.020> have<00:04:26.260> quite<00:04:26.530> a

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
screens and those perhaps have quite a

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.590 
screens and those perhaps have quite a
nice<00:04:26.800> surface<00:04:27.130> area<00:04:27.520> for<00:04:27.700> people<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:28.120> to

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
nice surface area for people that to

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.940 
nice surface area for people that to
navigate<00:04:29.020> with<00:04:29.170> their<00:04:29.320> finger<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.740> flip

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
navigate with their finger to flip

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.790 
navigate with their finger to flip
between<00:04:30.070> tabs<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.930> secondly<00:04:31.930> was<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.590> zoom

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
between tabs and secondly was the zoom

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.430 
between tabs and secondly was the zoom
feature<00:04:33.100> so<00:04:34.000> then<00:04:34.270> they<00:04:34.510> found<00:04:34.810> that<00:04:34.930> zooming

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
feature so then they found that zooming

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.320 
feature so then they found that zooming
into<00:04:35.560> one<00:04:35.740> hundred<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:35.980> fifty<00:04:36.310> percent<00:04:36.670> meant

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
into one hundred and fifty percent meant

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.750 
into one hundred and fifty percent meant
that<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.630> key<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.220> form<00:04:39.220> they<00:04:39.430> were<00:04:39.520> using

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
that the key the form they were using

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.060 
that the key the form they were using
which<00:04:40.030> was<00:04:40.180> based<00:04:40.390> on<00:04:40.570> an<00:04:40.720> on<00:04:41.170> on<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.530> web-based

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
which was based on an on on a web-based

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.910 
which was based on an on on a web-based
form<00:04:42.550> could<00:04:43.360> actually<00:04:43.510> zoom<00:04:43.870> quite<00:04:44.230> nicely<00:04:44.500> so

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
form could actually zoom quite nicely so

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.890 
form could actually zoom quite nicely so
that<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.490> girls<00:04:45.730> using<00:04:46.180> this<00:04:46.390> device<00:04:46.570> in
