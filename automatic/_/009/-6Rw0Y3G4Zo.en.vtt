softness<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.760> knees<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.330> at<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> same

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
softness in the knees but at the same

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.990 
softness in the knees but at the same
time<00:00:28.019> great<00:00:28.410> strength<00:00:28.830> how<00:00:29.130> do<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.369> train<00:00:29.760> for

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
time great strength how do you train for

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.700 
time great strength how do you train for
that<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:30.990> acquired<00:00:31.349> over<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that I think we have acquired over a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.889 
that I think we have acquired over a
certain<00:00:32.070> period<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.520> time<00:00:32.600> the<00:00:33.600> basic

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
certain period of time the basic

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.630 
certain period of time the basic
training<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.590> every<00:00:34.829> other<00:00:34.950> skater

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
training is like every other skater

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
training is like every other skater
except<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.540> before<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.079> go<00:00:37.170> into<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.440> ice<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
except that before we go into the ice to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.380 
except that before we go into the ice to
do<00:00:37.800> lots<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.100> pop<00:00:38.309> flies<00:00:38.550> training<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.149> far<00:00:39.300> as

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
do lots of pop flies training as far as

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
do lots of pop flies training as far as
unison<00:00:39.840> bending<00:00:40.260> knees<00:00:40.440> side<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> side<00:00:41.129> lean

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
unison bending knees side to side lean

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
unison bending knees side to side lean
and<00:00:41.940> that's<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.450> comes<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.780> handy<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.079> we

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and that's what comes in handy when we

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
and that's what comes in handy when we
stay<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> wall<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> knee<00:00:44.610> are<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
stay at the wall is the knee are the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.209 
stay at the wall is the knee are the
knees<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.539> take<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> pounding<00:00:46.190> yes<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
knees what take the pounding yes a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.770 
knees what take the pounding yes a
certain<00:00:47.520> degree<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.239> try<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> make<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
certain degree but we try to make it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.610 
certain degree but we try to make it
much<00:00:49.200> much<00:00:49.440> softer<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.100> there's<00:00:50.280> no<00:00:50.550> jolt<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
much much softer so there's no jolt and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
much much softer so there's no jolt and
that's<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> needs<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.340> therefore<00:00:54.059> well

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that's what the needs are therefore well

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
that's what the needs are therefore well
it<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.719> very<00:00:54.750> soft<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.530> 17<00:00:56.190> years<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.670> age

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it was very soft you are 17 years of age

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.389 
it was very soft you are 17 years of age
how<00:00:57.270> did<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> chemistry<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.370> first

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
how did you get this chemistry the first

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.670 
how did you get this chemistry the first
day<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.059> clicked<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.750> since<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.410> was<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
day it really clicked and since I was in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.280 
day it really clicked and since I was in
a<00:01:01.770> few<00:01:01.980> years<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.430> built<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.510> good<00:01:03.870> relation

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
a few years we built this good relation

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.530 
a few years we built this good relation
good<00:01:05.070> relationships<00:01:05.670> between<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.119> two<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.390> us

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
good relationships between the two of us

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.330 
good relationships between the two of us
off<00:01:06.990> days<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.619> ice<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.070> really

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
off days and on the ice that's really

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.660 
off days and on the ice that's really
helped

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
helped

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
helped
so<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> off<00:01:09.210> ice<00:01:09.450> relationships<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
so the off ice relationships that

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.780 
so the off ice relationships that
contributes<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.040> strong<00:01:11.250> performance<00:01:11.610> here

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
contributes to a strong performance here

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.969 
contributes to a strong performance here
yeah<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> good<00:01:13.830> relationship

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
yeah I think we have a good relationship

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.100 
yeah I think we have a good relationship
when<00:01:14.640> you're<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> ice<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.420> off<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> ice

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
when you're on the ice and off the ice

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.130 
when you're on the ice and off the ice
it<00:01:16.530> makes<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.549> helps<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.810> connect

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
it makes it really helps like we connect

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.499 
it makes it really helps like we connect
