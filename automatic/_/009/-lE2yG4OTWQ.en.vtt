00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.140 
the painting project I've been getting a
lot<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.540> requests<00:00:09.540> asking<00:00:10.110> how<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> make<00:00:11.910> the

lot of requests asking how to make the
video<00:00:12.450> longer<00:00:12.900> before<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.799> turns<00:00:14.009> into<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
video longer before it turns into a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.640 
video longer before it turns into a
painting<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:15.509> actually<00:00:15.870> quite<00:00:16.049> simple<00:00:16.320> and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650

I'll show you how to do that so here we
are<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.619> scene<00:00:20.039> 4<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:21.650> there<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.550> couple<00:00:24.240> of

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
are in scene 4 and there are a couple of

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.570 
are in scene 4 and there are a couple of
things<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.199> work<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.769> when<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.039> comes<00:00:26.070> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
things at work here when it comes to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.320 
things at work here when it comes to
freezing<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.869> video<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:29.519> couple<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
freezing the video in a couple of

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.209 
freezing the video in a couple of
different<00:00:30.480> comps<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.890> freeze<00:00:32.189> frame

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
different comps we have a freeze frame

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.780 
different comps we have a freeze frame
applied<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.290> time<00:00:34.530> remapping<00:00:34.890> effect<00:00:35.370> so

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
applied and a time remapping effect so

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.000 
applied and a time remapping effect so
let's<00:00:36.000> scroll<00:00:36.210> down<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.110> bottom<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.860> the

let's scroll down to the bottom of the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.090 
let's scroll down to the bottom of the
timeline<00:00:39.110> you'll<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> layer<00:00:40.559> replaced

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
timeline you'll see the layer replaced

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.310 
timeline you'll see the layer replaced
video<00:00:41.520> oh<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.629> keep<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.930> mind<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.230> this

video oh for and keep in mind that this
can<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.590> repeated<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.160> any<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> scenes

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
can be repeated on any of the scenes

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
can be repeated on any of the scenes
we're<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:46.200> scene<00:00:46.500> 4<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.219> this

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
we're just going to do scene 4 for this

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.240 
we're just going to do scene 4 for this
example<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.350> hit<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.100> your

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
example so if you hit you on your

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.760 
example so if you hit you on your
keyboard<00:00:50.430> it'll<00:00:51.420> bring<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.809> your<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
keyboard it'll bring up your the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.319 
keyboard it'll bring up your the
keyframes<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.550> applied<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.090> layer

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
keyframes that are applied to this layer

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.840 
keyframes that are applied to this layer
as<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:55.920> there's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> time<00:00:56.460> remap

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
as you can see there's a time remap

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
as you can see there's a time remap
effect<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:58.199> our<00:00:58.469> keyframes<00:00:59.010> start<00:01:00.050> from<00:01:01.050> 0

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
effect and our keyframes start from 0

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.990 
effect and our keyframes start from 0
and<00:01:01.940> go<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> 2<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.199> stop<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.159> that's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and go to 2 and then stop and that's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.770 
and go to 2 and then stop and that's
where<00:01:06.270> our<00:01:06.299> painting<00:01:06.990> effect<00:01:07.320> comes<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:09.689> if

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
where our painting effect comes in so if

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.039 
where our painting effect comes in so if
we<00:01:09.869> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> make<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.350> longer<00:01:10.650> let's<00:01:11.070> say<00:01:12.049> 4

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
we want to make this longer let's say 4

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.969 
we want to make this longer let's say 4
seconds<00:01:13.939> let's<00:01:16.490> go<00:01:17.490> over<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> our<00:01:18.000> time

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
seconds let's go over here to our time

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.359 
seconds let's go over here to our time
and<00:01:19.979> let's<00:01:20.159> type<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.610> 4<00:01:21.150> 0<00:01:21.600> 0<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> 4

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and let's type in 4 0 0 to go to 4

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.050 
and let's type in 4 0 0 to go to 4
seconds<00:01:24.530> let's<00:01:25.530> extend<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.130> timeline<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
seconds let's extend this timeline I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.929 
seconds let's extend this timeline I
mean<00:01:27.299> sorry<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.780> layer<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.549> moved<00:01:29.790> our

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
mean sorry this layer so we moved our

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.830 
mean sorry this layer so we moved our
keyframe<00:01:30.360> over<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> 4<00:01:32.250> second<00:01:32.670> mark<00:01:32.880> then

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
keyframe over to the 4 second mark then

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.050 
keyframe over to the 4 second mark then
we<00:01:33.930> want<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> double<00:01:34.530> click<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.040> type<00:01:35.850> in

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
we want to double click and type in

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.020 
we want to double click and type in
again<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.689> 0<00:01:37.079> 0<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.520> give<00:01:38.670> us<00:01:38.790> 4

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
again for 0 0 and that will give us 4

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.980 
again for 0 0 and that will give us 4
seconds<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.890> Solo<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.640> layer

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
seconds so now if we Solo this layer

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.710 
seconds so now if we Solo this layer
nope<00:01:43.020> let's<00:01:43.710> move<00:01:43.920> our<00:01:44.280> opacity<00:01:44.970> keyframes

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
nope let's move our opacity keyframes

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.230 
nope let's move our opacity keyframes
down<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.170> well

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240

going<00:02:30.459> on<00:02:30.580> here<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.390> video<00:02:31.840> outline<00:02:32.580> needs<00:02:33.580> to

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
going on here the video outline needs to

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.750 
going on here the video outline needs to
be<00:02:34.830> changed<00:02:35.830> as<00:02:35.950> well<00:02:36.099> so<00:02:36.370> let's<00:02:36.549> right<00:02:36.730> click

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
be changed as well so let's right click

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.410 
be changed as well so let's right click
and<00:02:37.209> open<00:02:37.450> composition<00:02:39.180> select<00:02:40.180> your<00:02:40.299> layer

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
and open composition select your layer

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.830 
and open composition select your layer
and<00:02:41.010> hit<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.480> because<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.690> a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
and hit you because this is a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.199 
and hit you because this is a
freeze-frame<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:45.400> don't<00:02:45.580> really<00:02:45.730> need<00:02:46.000> to

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
freeze-frame you don't really need to

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.460 
freeze-frame you don't really need to
move<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> keyframe<00:02:46.690> around<00:02:47.170> we're<00:02:47.319> just

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
move the keyframe around we're just

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.259 
move the keyframe around we're just
going<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.680> double<00:02:48.250> click<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.640> type<00:02:48.849> in

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
going to double click it and type in

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.680 
going to double click it and type in
four<00:02:49.510> zero<00:02:49.780> zero<00:02:50.110> four<00:02:50.799> four<00:02:50.950> seconds<00:02:51.489> so<00:02:52.390> it's

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
four zero zero four four seconds so it's

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.729 
four zero zero four four seconds so it's
going<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.840> freeze<00:02:53.140> frame<00:02:53.470> at<00:02:53.709> four<00:02:54.489> seconds

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
going to freeze frame at four seconds

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.810 
going to freeze frame at four seconds
let's<00:02:56.739> go<00:02:56.890> back<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.160> scene<00:02:57.370> four<00:02:59.190> and<00:03:00.190> go<00:03:00.760> to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
let's go back to scene four and go to

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.720 
let's go back to scene four and go to
the<00:03:01.750> layer<00:03:01.930> called<00:03:02.260> video<00:03:02.650> splatter<00:03:03.190> reveal

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
the layer called video splatter reveal

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.720 
the layer called video splatter reveal
oh<00:03:03.970> for<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.510> I'm<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:08.079> one<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.709> want<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.489> select

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
oh for so I'm this one I want to select

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.680 
oh for so I'm this one I want to select
the<00:03:09.910> replace<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.450> video<00:03:10.690> layer<00:03:10.989> hit<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:12.690> and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
the replace the video layer hit you and

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.569 
the replace the video layer hit you and
as<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.989> can<00:03:14.109> see<00:03:14.170> it's<00:03:14.799> pretty<00:03:14.950> much<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.220> freeze

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
as you can see it's pretty much a freeze

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.500 
as you can see it's pretty much a freeze
frame<00:03:16.319> so<00:03:17.319> if<00:03:17.380> we<00:03:17.470> go<00:03:17.560> down<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:18.180> about<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.299> four

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
frame so if we go down to about the four

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.059 
frame so if we go down to about the four
second<00:03:19.870> mark<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.260> move<00:03:20.319> your<00:03:20.440> keyframe<00:03:20.829> over

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
second mark and move your keyframe over

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.190 
second mark and move your keyframe over
double<00:03:24.069> click<00:03:24.310> type<00:03:25.000> four<00:03:25.420> zero<00:03:25.870> zero<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:29.049> so

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
double click type four zero zero and so

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.720 
double click type four zero zero and so
now<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.410> should<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:29.590> at<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.920> four<00:03:30.130> second<00:03:30.519> mark

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
now it should be at the four second mark

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.539 
now it should be at the four second mark
it'll<00:03:31.889> this<00:03:32.889> is<00:03:33.040> where<00:03:33.220> our<00:03:33.370> still<00:03:33.700> frame<00:03:33.970> is

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
it'll this is where our still frame is

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.110 
it'll this is where our still frame is
let's<00:03:36.549> go<00:03:36.670> back<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.970> scene<00:03:37.180> four

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.550 

and<00:03:41.120> let's<00:03:41.299> select<00:03:41.450> their<00:03:41.780> video<00:03:42.140> outline

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
and let's select their video outline

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.059 
and let's select their video outline
layer<00:03:42.829> then<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:43.879> want<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.030> hit<00:03:44.209> shift<00:03:44.569> and

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
layer then you want to hit shift and

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.220 
layer then you want to hit shift and
select<00:03:46.069> all<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.969> way<00:03:47.060> up<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.390> layer<00:03:47.569> six<00:03:47.989> which

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
select all the way up to layer six which

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.670 
select all the way up to layer six which
is<00:03:48.379> an<00:03:48.560> image<00:03:48.859> ink<00:03:49.099> reveal<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:51.019> movie<00:03:51.379> scars

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
is an image ink reveal the movie scars

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.949 
is an image ink reveal the movie scars
down<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.069> little<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:55.069> that<00:03:55.099> way<00:03:55.629> your<00:03:56.629> videos

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
down a little so that way your videos

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.020 
down a little so that way your videos
playing<00:03:57.290> its<00:03:57.650> playing<00:03:57.920> its<00:03:58.280> playing<00:03:58.549> and

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
playing its playing its playing and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.179 
playing its playing its playing and
these<00:03:59.750> might<00:04:00.049> need<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.349> come<00:04:00.709> in<00:04:00.829> a<00:04:00.859> little<00:04:01.010> bit

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
these might need to come in a little bit

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:07.899 
these might need to come in a little bit
sooner<00:04:01.459> there<00:04:02.090> we<00:04:02.180> go<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.459> just<00:04:07.670> got<00:04:07.819> to

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
sooner there we go so you just got to

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.410 
sooner there we go so you just got to
move<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.180> group<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.659> key<00:04:08.870> layers<00:04:09.620> around<00:04:10.420> so

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
move this group of key layers around so

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.860 
move this group of key layers around so
that<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:13.549> kind<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.819> matches<00:04:14.030> up<00:04:14.209> with<00:04:14.569> this

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
that it kind of matches up with this

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.069 
that it kind of matches up with this
image<00:04:15.620> ink<00:04:16.130> reveal<00:04:17.229> which<00:04:18.229> is<00:04:18.530> sort<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.519> an

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
image ink reveal which is sort of an

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.610 
image ink reveal which is sort of an
alpha<00:04:21.079> mat<00:04:21.320> for<00:04:21.859> the<00:04:22.220> video<00:04:22.910> layer<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:24.500> it's

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
alpha mat for the video layer so it's

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.770 
alpha mat for the video layer so it's
kind<00:04:24.800> of<00:04:24.860> cutting<00:04:25.280> it<00:04:25.400> out<00:04:25.520> so<00:04:26.330> when<00:04:26.449> it<00:04:26.539> cuts

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
kind of cutting it out so when it cuts

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.450 
kind of cutting it out so when it cuts
out<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:28.340> want<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.669> see<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:30.460> outline

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
out you want to see the outline

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.170 
out you want to see the outline
underneath<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:33.710> give<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:34.009> that<00:04:34.039> effect<00:04:34.280> so

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
underneath it to give it that effect so

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.450 
underneath it to give it that effect so
I<00:04:35.599> hope<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:36.199> makes<00:04:36.349> sense<00:04:36.650> if<00:04:37.009> that<00:04:37.190> doesn't

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
I hope that makes sense if that doesn't

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.920 
I hope that makes sense if that doesn't
make<00:04:37.520> sense<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.910> can<00:04:38.090> email<00:04:38.240> me<00:04:38.389> and<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.750> will

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
make sense you can email me and I will

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.760 
make sense you can email me and I will
try<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.110> explain<00:04:39.470> better<00:04:41.289> so<00:04:42.289> I<00:04:42.349> think<00:04:42.440> that's

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
try to explain better so I think that's

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.330 
try to explain better so I think that's
it<00:04:44.020> just<00:04:45.020> carving<00:04:45.409> through<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:46.000> there<00:04:47.000> it<00:04:47.120> is

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
it just carving through and there it is

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.180 
it just carving through and there it is
awesome<00:04:49.419> all<00:04:50.419> right<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:51.889> go<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.070> your

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
awesome all right so you go to your

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.010 
awesome all right so you go to your
final<00:04:53.030> composition<00:04:54.250> you<00:04:55.250> may<00:04:55.430> need<00:04:55.699> to<00:04:56.020> make

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
final composition you may need to make

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.689 
final composition you may need to make
these<00:04:57.349> a<00:04:58.900> little<00:04:59.900> bit<00:05:00.050> longer<00:05:00.289> and<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:01.610> way

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
these a little bit longer and the way

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.000 
these a little bit longer and the way
you<00:05:01.760> can<00:05:01.970> do<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.539> see<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:03.590> layer<00:05:03.740> called

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
you can do that is see this layer called

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.629 
you can do that is see this layer called
drawing<00:05:04.430> ink<00:05:05.210> reveal<00:05:05.919> hang<00:05:06.919> on<00:05:07.070> let<00:05:07.520> me<00:05:07.550> see

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
drawing ink reveal hang on let me see

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.560 
drawing ink reveal hang on let me see
okay<00:05:08.240> that<00:05:09.130> is<00:05:10.130> sort<00:05:10.400> of<00:05:10.460> like<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.729> transition

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
okay that is sort of like a transition

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.670 
okay that is sort of like a transition
that's<00:05:12.260> happening<00:05:12.800> so<00:05:14.110> as<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.199> can<00:05:15.289> see<00:05:15.349> right

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
that's happening so as you can see right

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.589 
that's happening so as you can see right
now<00:05:15.710> we're<00:05:16.010> on<00:05:16.539> four<00:05:17.800> in<00:05:18.849> the<00:05:19.849> final<00:05:20.150> comp

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
now we're on four in the final comp

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.430 
now we're on four in the final comp
and<00:05:21.310> then<00:05:22.310> our<00:05:22.460> con<00:05:22.669> oh<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:24.050> have<00:05:24.169> a<00:05:24.199> missing

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
and then our con oh I have a missing

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.020 
and then our con oh I have a missing
layer<00:05:24.710> there<00:05:24.979> so<00:05:25.190> just<00:05:25.430> kind<00:05:25.669> of<00:05:25.699> ignore<00:05:26.000> that

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
layer there so just kind of ignore that

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.360 
layer there so just kind of ignore that
if<00:05:26.300> you<00:05:26.330> can<00:05:26.570> that<00:05:26.780> are<00:05:26.810> drawing<00:05:27.800> ink<00:05:27.979> reveal

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
if you can that are drawing ink reveal

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.760 
if you can that are drawing ink reveal
our<00:05:28.820> transition<00:05:29.539> comes<00:05:29.810> up<00:05:30.020> so<00:05:30.260> you<00:05:30.349> may<00:05:30.470> want

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
our transition comes up so you may want

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.850 
our transition comes up so you may want
to<00:05:30.860> move<00:05:31.099> that<00:05:31.280> down<00:05:32.169> and<00:05:33.169> move<00:05:33.380> all<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.590> other

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
to move that down and move all the other

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.790 
to move that down and move all the other
layers<00:05:34.159> underneath<00:05:34.729> it<00:05:35.090> down<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.659> so<00:05:36.259> seen

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
layers underneath it down to so seen

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.279 
layers underneath it down to so seen
five<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:37.370> it's<00:05:37.669> reveal<00:05:38.210> transitionally<00:05:39.199> you

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
five and it's reveal transitionally you

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.830 
five and it's reveal transitionally you
might<00:05:39.440> want<00:05:39.620> to<00:05:39.650> move<00:05:39.770> it<00:05:39.919> down<00:05:40.479> so<00:05:41.479> it<00:05:41.570> plays<00:05:41.810> a

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
might want to move it down so it plays a

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.280 
might want to move it down so it plays a
little<00:05:42.050> bit<00:05:42.259> longer

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
little bit longer

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.100 
little bit longer
and<00:05:44.270> hit<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:47.550> move<00:05:47.820> these<00:05:48.270> last<00:05:48.810> group<00:05:49.050> of

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
and hit you and move these last group of

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.720 
and hit you and move these last group of
keyframes<00:05:49.560> down<00:05:49.860> as<00:05:50.070> well<00:05:51.050> because<00:05:52.050> that<00:05:52.730> is

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
keyframes down as well because that is

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.840 
keyframes down as well because that is
kind<00:05:53.970> of<00:05:54.150> their<00:05:54.330> how<00:05:54.990> they<00:05:55.020> animate<00:05:55.640> and<00:05:56.640> they

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
kind of their how they animate and they

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.410 
kind of their how they animate and they
also<00:05:57.270> fade<00:05:58.200> out<00:05:58.410> so<00:05:59.160> if<00:06:00.000> you<00:06:00.120> want<00:06:00.270> this<00:06:00.360> to

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
also fade out so if you want this to

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:07.070 
also fade out so if you want this to
play<00:06:00.690> longer<00:06:04.400> there<00:06:05.400> it<00:06:05.580> goes<00:06:05.790> and<00:06:06.780> there<00:06:06.960> it

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
play longer there it goes and there it

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.370 
play longer there it goes and there it
is<00:06:08.120> so<00:06:09.120> you<00:06:09.150> would<00:06:09.360> repeat<00:06:09.660> that<00:06:09.720> process<00:06:10.050> with

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
is so you would repeat that process with

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.920 
is so you would repeat that process with
in<00:06:10.920> the<00:06:11.070> final<00:06:11.370> competition<00:06:11.580> with<00:06:12.150> each<00:06:12.480> scene

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
in the final competition with each scene

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.150 
in the final competition with each scene
and<00:06:14.450> the<00:06:15.450> layer<00:06:15.780> called<00:06:16.110> drawing<00:06:16.440> ink<00:06:16.800> reveal

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
and the layer called drawing ink reveal

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.460 
and the layer called drawing ink reveal
which<00:06:17.430> is<00:06:17.670> its<00:06:18.150> transition<00:06:18.690> so<00:06:19.230> you<00:06:19.260> would

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
which is its transition so you would

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.020 
which is its transition so you would
just<00:06:19.680> hit<00:06:19.860> you<00:06:20.280> on<00:06:20.970> your<00:06:21.030> keyboard

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
just hit you on your keyboard

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.370 
just hit you on your keyboard
grab<00:06:24.030> these<00:06:24.210> last<00:06:24.420> bit<00:06:24.660> of<00:06:24.690> keyframes<00:06:25.170> move

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
grab these last bit of keyframes move

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.160 
grab these last bit of keyframes move
them<00:06:25.560> down<00:06:25.590> in<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.010> timeline<00:06:26.990> extend<00:06:27.990> your

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
them down in the timeline extend your

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.790 
them down in the timeline extend your
layer<00:06:28.380> move<00:06:29.340> this<00:06:29.490> guy<00:06:29.670> down<00:06:30.470> then<00:06:31.470> you<00:06:31.680> would

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
layer move this guy down then you would

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.170 
layer move this guy down then you would
move<00:06:31.950> the<00:06:32.220> rest<00:06:32.460> of<00:06:32.760> these<00:06:32.910> over<00:06:33.840> as<00:06:34.020> well<00:06:35.180> if

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
move the rest of these over as well if

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.790 
move the rest of these over as well if
you<00:06:36.360> want<00:06:36.510> your<00:06:36.630> video<00:06:36.870> to<00:06:36.900> be<00:06:37.110> longer<00:06:37.560> and

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
you want your video to be longer and

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.250 
you want your video to be longer and
that's<00:06:38.490> it<00:06:38.760> I<00:06:38.790> think<00:06:38.940> hopefully<00:06:39.900> that<00:06:40.080> made

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
that's it I think hopefully that made

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.220 
that's it I think hopefully that made
sense<00:06:40.760> like<00:06:41.760> I<00:06:41.850> said<00:06:42.060> before<00:06:42.210> if<00:06:42.690> you<00:06:42.900> get<00:06:43.020> lost

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
sense like I said before if you get lost

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.300 
sense like I said before if you get lost
or<00:06:43.440> confused

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310
