that means it's going to take a little

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.550 
that means it's going to take a little

going<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:48.979> be<00:01:49.070> really<00:01:49.250> slow<00:01:50.470> just<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.680> it's

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
going to be really slow just and it's

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.550 
going to be really slow just and it's
entirely<00:01:52.640> because<00:01:53.000> I'm<00:01:53.330> making<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.290> choice

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
that I don't want to force myself I

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.359 
that I don't want to force myself I
guess<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.810> grind<00:02:00.080> out<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.409> tank<00:02:00.649> I'd<00:02:01.100> much

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
guess to grind out the tank I'd much

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.940 
guess to grind out the tank I'd much
rather<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:02.000> mean<00:02:02.810> now<00:02:02.930> that<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.409> know<00:02:03.440> I<00:02:03.560> work

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.410 
rather I mean now that you know I work
you<00:02:04.759> know<00:02:04.880> 925<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:06.159> have<00:02:07.159> less<00:02:07.490> time<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.880> just

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
you know 925 I have less time to just

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.310 
you know 925 I have less time to just
kind<00:02:08.989> of<00:02:09.050> do<00:02:09.489> play<00:02:10.489> games<00:02:10.819> and<00:02:11.060> stuff<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:11.660> it's

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
kind of do play games and stuff so it's

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.460 
kind of do play games and stuff so it's
almost<00:02:12.739> like<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.160> play<00:02:13.480> more<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
almost like I play more so I it's the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.250 
almost like I play more so I it's the
more<00:02:15.650> different<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:17.300> guess<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.900> point<00:02:18.140> is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
more different and I guess the point is

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.949 
more different and I guess the point is
it's<00:02:18.500> more<00:02:18.650> difficult<00:02:18.800> for<00:02:19.070> me<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.840> take<00:02:20.840> us

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
it's more difficult for me to take us

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.259 
it's more difficult for me to take us
force<00:02:21.260> myself<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.890> grind<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.400> have<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.120> really

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
force myself to grind I have to really

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.160 
force myself to grind I have to really
want<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.640> yes<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.000> coming<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:27.050> is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
want to so yes it is coming and it is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.580 
want to so yes it is coming and it is
coming<00:02:27.500> eventually<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:29.360> fully<00:02:29.840> intend<00:02:30.350> to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
coming eventually I do fully intend to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.180 
coming eventually I do fully intend to
do<00:02:31.310> my<00:02:31.459> best<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.060> who<00:02:32.180> knows<00:02:32.330> maybe<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
do my best and who knows maybe in the

do my best and who knows maybe in the
coming<00:02:34.640> weeks<00:02:35.600> I'll<00:02:35.900> feel<00:02:36.470> better<00:02:36.500> about

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
coming weeks I'll feel better about

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.140 
coming weeks I'll feel better about
playing<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.340> point<00:02:37.580> out<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:37.850> just<00:02:37.970> at<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
playing you point out but just at the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.090 
playing you point out but just at the
moment<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.450> don't<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.170> don't<00:02:39.590> play<00:02:39.709> very<00:02:39.890> much

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
moment I don't so I don't play very much

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.539 
moment I don't so I don't play very much
but<00:02:40.760> we'll<00:02:41.239> see<00:02:41.450> maybe<00:02:42.140> I'll<00:02:42.350> find<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.400> urge

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
but we'll see maybe I'll find the urge

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.300 
but we'll see maybe I'll find the urge
to<00:02:43.940> reup<00:02:44.810> my<00:02:44.959> premium<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.560> maybe<00:02:46.040> that'll

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
to reup my premium and maybe that'll

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.020 
to reup my premium and maybe that'll
help<00:02:46.340> alleviate<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.810> weight<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:49.730> yes<00:02:49.880> I'm

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.520 
help alleviate the weight but yes I'm
gonna<00:02:50.209> do<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.570> I'm<00:02:50.630> really<00:02:50.810> excited<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.380> do

take in this area and are now holding it

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.660 
take in this area and are now holding it
against<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.130> enemy<00:03:05.950> bagged<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.130> couple<00:03:07.430> kills

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
against the enemy bagged a couple kills

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.140 
against the enemy bagged a couple kills
and<00:03:08.000> now<00:03:08.959> we<00:03:09.019> have<00:03:09.320> these<00:03:09.500> German<00:03:10.130> tanks<00:03:10.489> pans

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
and now we have these German tanks pans

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.630 
and now we have these German tanks pans
or<00:03:11.329> three<00:03:11.570> type<00:03:11.959> things<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.769> is<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:12.980> three<00:03:13.250> f<00:03:13.430> I

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
or three type things this is a three f I

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.870 
or three type things this is a three f I
believe<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.140> are<00:03:15.140> making<00:03:15.799> it<00:03:16.070> attempts<00:03:16.850> to

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
believe that are making it attempts to

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.940 
believe that are making it attempts to
dislodge<00:03:17.630> us<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.079> flank<00:03:18.350> us<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:18.709> i've<00:03:18.799> been

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
dislodge us and flank us but i've been

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.740 
dislodge us and flank us but i've been
using<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.370> little<00:03:19.640> Ridge<00:03:19.880> them<00:03:20.269> when<00:03:20.660> i'm

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
using that little Ridge them when i'm

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.000 
using that little Ridge them when i'm
sitting<00:03:20.989> on<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:22.130> cover<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:22.670> flank<00:03:23.000> while<00:03:23.269> I

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
sitting on to cover this flank while I

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.729 
sitting on to cover this flank while I
shall<00:03:25.010> targets<00:03:25.609> down<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.390> other<00:03:26.570> way<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:27.590> my

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
shall targets down the other way to my

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.069 
shall targets down the other way to my
left

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
left

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.069 
left
these<00:03:30.079> shaam<00:03:30.319> gonna<00:03:30.500> run<00:03:30.650> into<00:03:30.829> is<00:03:31.159> that<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.870> is

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
these shaam gonna run into is that it is

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.170 
these shaam gonna run into is that it is
difficult<00:03:33.379> to<00:03:33.920> maintain<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.939> current

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
difficult to maintain the current

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.509 
difficult to maintain the current
position<00:03:35.719> we're<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:35.900> because<00:03:36.379> there<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:36.799> a

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
position we're in because there is a

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.539 
position we're in because there is a
decent<00:03:37.969> crossfire<00:03:38.719> were<00:03:38.959> under<00:03:39.370> see<00:03:40.370> that

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
decent crossfire were under see that

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.970 
decent crossfire were under see that
she'll<00:03:40.849> come<00:03:41.120> in<00:03:41.269> from<00:03:41.810> almost<00:03:42.349> perpendicular

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
she'll come in from almost perpendicular

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.240 
she'll come in from almost perpendicular
to<00:03:43.250> me<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.439> issue<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:45.739> have<00:03:45.920> is<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:46.069> the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
to me so the issue I have is that the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.699 
to me so the issue I have is that the
position<00:03:46.430> i'm<00:03:46.730> currently<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.599> really<00:03:48.439> not

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
position i'm currently in is really not

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.670 
position i'm currently in is really not
defensible<00:03:49.220> if<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.810> enemy<00:03:51.109> had<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> mind<00:03:51.560> to

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
defensible if the enemy had a mind to

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.470 
defensible if the enemy had a mind to
they<00:03:51.950> could<00:03:52.220> just<00:03:52.250> come<00:03:52.819> over<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.239> Ridge

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
they could just come over that Ridge

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.710 
they could just come over that Ridge
there<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.930> probably<00:03:54.079> knocking<00:03:54.950> out<00:03:55.129> and<00:03:55.720> they

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
there and probably knocking out and they

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.300 
there and probably knocking out and they
just<00:03:56.900> keep<00:03:56.989> dropping<00:03:57.470> artillery<00:03:58.010> after

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
just keep dropping artillery after

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.839 
just keep dropping artillery after
artillery<00:03:59.739> so<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:01.099> need<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.700> do<00:04:01.819> something

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
artillery so I need to do something

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.470 
artillery so I need to do something
about<00:04:02.299> that<00:04:03.549> so<00:04:04.549> my<00:04:04.670> plan<00:04:04.909> here<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.269> I'm<00:04:05.389> going

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
about that so my plan here is I'm going

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.080 
about that so my plan here is I'm going
to<00:04:05.540> push<00:04:05.750> over<00:04:06.139> I'm<00:04:06.379> going<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.560> find<00:04:06.799> this

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
to push over I'm going to find this

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.250

see those sometimes the types of things
you<00:04:40.550> need<00:04:40.669> to<00:04:40.729> be<00:04:40.849> thinking<00:04:40.880> about<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.389> need

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
you need to be thinking about you need

you need to be thinking about you need
to<00:04:41.720> think<00:04:41.900> with<00:04:42.680> my<00:04:42.860> crews<00:04:43.130> stop<00:04:43.510> operating

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
to think with my crews stop operating

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.760 
to think with my crews stop operating
the<00:04:44.720> tank<00:04:44.990> for<00:04:45.289> however<00:04:46.159> long<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.669> takes

the tank for however long it takes
what's<00:04:48.770> what<00:04:49.010> will<00:04:49.099> be<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.310> result<00:04:49.460> now

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
what's what will be the result now

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.080 
what's what will be the result now
notice<00:04:50.570> how<00:04:51.010> immediately<00:04:52.010> after<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.340> fired<00:04:52.760> I

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
notice how immediately after I fired I

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.120 
notice how immediately after I fired I
used<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.110> fire<00:04:54.289> extinguisher<00:04:54.800> because<00:04:55.010> at

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
used the fire extinguisher because at

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.529 
used the fire extinguisher because at
that<00:04:55.220> point<00:04:55.490> there's<00:04:55.789> nothing<00:04:55.909> I<00:04:56.150> can<00:04:56.210> do

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
that point there's nothing I can do

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.210 
that point there's nothing I can do
right<00:04:57.080> either<00:04:57.199> my<00:04:57.380> shell<00:04:57.620> kills<00:04:57.889> them<00:04:58.099> or

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
right either my shell kills them or

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.420 
right either my shell kills them or
disables<00:04:58.669> in<00:04:58.789> or<00:04:59.229> I'm<00:05:00.229> dead<00:05:00.560> yeah<00:05:01.310> there's<00:05:01.520> no

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
disables in or I'm dead yeah there's no

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.060 
disables in or I'm dead yeah there's no
there's<00:05:04.430> no<00:05:04.520> other<00:05:05.060> outcome<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.409> my<00:05:06.830> I<00:05:06.860> was

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070

I<00:05:18.979> used<00:05:19.190> a<00:05:19.340> little<00:05:19.580> trick<00:05:19.849> I<00:05:19.970> use<00:05:20.000> my

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
I used a little trick I use my

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.469 
I used a little trick I use my
binoculars<00:05:20.599> to<00:05:21.080> line<00:05:21.349> up<00:05:21.500> my<00:05:21.620> gun<00:05:21.889> and<00:05:22.449> then<00:05:23.449> I

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
binoculars to line up my gun and then I

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.379 
binoculars to line up my gun and then I
just<00:05:23.930> kind<00:05:24.229> of<00:05:24.320> did<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.250> ranging<00:05:25.820> with<00:05:26.060> the

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
just kind of did the ranging with the

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.870 
just kind of did the ranging with the
gun<00:05:26.599> sight<00:05:26.870> with<00:05:27.440> with<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.490> knowledge<00:05:28.669> that

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
gun sight with with the knowledge that

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.330 
gun sight with with the knowledge that
it<00:05:29.150> was<00:05:29.240> pointing<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.720> right<00:05:29.870> way<00:05:30.340> something

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
it was pointing the right way something

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.189 
it was pointing the right way something
you<00:05:31.430> can<00:05:31.610> do<00:05:31.759> to<00:05:31.789> kind<00:05:32.060> of<00:05:32.180> see<00:05:32.419> over<00:05:32.810> bushes

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
you can do to kind of see over bushes

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.890 
you can do to kind of see over bushes
and<00:05:33.380> things<00:05:33.409> like<00:05:33.740> that<00:05:33.800> it's<00:05:34.130> a<00:05:34.220> useful<00:05:34.400> tool

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
and things like that it's a useful tool

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.480 
and things like that it's a useful tool
takes<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:36.050> little<00:05:36.199> practice<00:05:36.380> practice<00:05:37.219> to<00:05:37.370> get

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
takes a little practice practice to get

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.370 
takes a little practice practice to get
used<00:05:37.550> to<00:05:37.909> and<00:05:38.060> it's<00:05:38.150> really<00:05:38.389> not<00:05:38.719> very<00:05:39.050> useful

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
used to and it's really not very useful

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.800 
used to and it's really not very useful
on<00:05:39.860> moving<00:05:40.789> targets<00:05:41.150> obviously

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
on moving targets obviously

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.379 
on moving targets obviously
but<00:05:42.650> I<00:05:42.889> really<00:05:43.190> should<00:05:43.460> take<00:05:43.790> in<00:05:43.940> that<00:05:44.090> shot

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
but I really should take in that shot

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.520 
but I really should take in that shot
but<00:05:45.380> he<00:05:45.770> dips<00:05:46.070> down<00:05:46.810> I'm<00:05:47.810> waiting<00:05:48.169> for<00:05:48.200> him<00:05:48.500> to

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
but he dips down I'm waiting for him to

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.230 
but he dips down I'm waiting for him to
sort<00:05:48.770> of<00:05:48.860> come<00:05:49.070> around<00:05:49.340> so<00:05:49.610> I<00:05:49.669> can<00:05:49.760> get<00:05:49.910> a<00:05:49.970> good

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
sort of come around so I can get a good

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.320 
sort of come around so I can get a good
shot<00:05:50.300> on<00:05:50.660> him<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.169> I<00:05:51.230> take<00:05:51.530> that<00:05:51.560> shot<00:05:52.240> but<00:05:53.240> it

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
shot on him and I take that shot but it

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.040 
shot on him and I take that shot but it
doesn't<00:05:53.630> destroy<00:05:54.020> him<00:05:55.630> which<00:05:56.630> could<00:05:56.660> have

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
doesn't destroy him which could have

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.159 
doesn't destroy him which could have
been<00:05:57.110> an<00:05:57.169> issue<00:05:57.350> for<00:05:57.530> me<00:05:58.630> because<00:05:59.630> my<00:05:59.660> rate<00:06:00.050> of

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
been an issue for me because my rate of

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.980 
been an issue for me because my rate of
fire<00:06:00.350> is<00:06:00.380> heavily<00:06:01.340> diminished<00:06:01.820> now<00:06:02.000> or<00:06:02.750> merely

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
fire is heavily diminished now or merely

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.720 
fire is heavily diminished now or merely
because<00:06:03.200> I've<00:06:03.410> lost<00:06:03.560> some<00:06:03.800> crew<00:06:04.010> members<00:06:04.040> and

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
because I've lost some crew members and

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.120 
because I've lost some crew members and
what<00:06:04.850> have<00:06:05.000> you<00:06:05.030> but<00:06:05.470> there<00:06:06.470> we<00:06:06.560> go<00:06:06.710> that<00:06:06.889> shot

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
what have you but there we go that shot

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.050 
what have you but there we go that shot
goes<00:06:07.340> in<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:07.730> knocks<00:06:07.910> it<00:06:08.030> down<00:06:08.090> a<00:06:08.570> panzer<00:06:09.530> f2

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
goes in and knocks it down a panzer f2

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.120 
goes in and knocks it down a panzer f2
shows<00:06:11.060> up<00:06:11.360> and<00:06:11.780> we're<00:06:11.900> able<00:06:12.050> to<00:06:12.320> either<00:06:12.770> bounce

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
shows up and we're able to either bounce

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.890 
shows up and we're able to either bounce
or<00:06:13.370> not<00:06:13.550> take<00:06:13.760> any<00:06:13.940> serious<00:06:14.360> damage<00:06:14.510> from<00:06:14.840> that

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
or not take any serious damage from that

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.580 
or not take any serious damage from that
shell<00:06:15.290> and<00:06:16.450> the<00:06:17.450> reason<00:06:17.810> I<00:06:17.900> rushed<00:06:18.200> forward

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
shell and the reason I rushed forward

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.020 
shell and the reason I rushed forward
some<00:06:18.950> people<00:06:19.190> would<00:06:19.250> have<00:06:19.370> backed<00:06:19.550> up<00:06:19.820> you

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
some people would have backed up you

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.820 
some people would have backed up you
rush<00:06:20.240> forward<00:06:20.570> here<00:06:20.840> because<00:06:21.200> you<00:06:21.560> want<00:06:21.740> to

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
rush forward here because you want to

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.379 
rush forward here because you want to
get<00:06:21.979> under<00:06:22.220> his<00:06:22.370> gun<00:06:22.610> and<00:06:22.790> they<00:06:22.940> can<00:06:23.120> come<00:06:23.360> up

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
get under his gun and they can come up

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.690 
get under his gun and they can come up
and<00:06:23.660> over<00:06:23.750> which<00:06:24.680> gives<00:06:24.919> me<00:06:25.250> more<00:06:25.400> time<00:06:25.460> to

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
and over which gives me more time to

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.200 
and over which gives me more time to
reload<00:06:26.150> but<00:06:27.139> now<00:06:27.290> I<00:06:27.320> can<00:06:27.500> also<00:06:27.740> go<00:06:28.550> around<00:06:28.910> him

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
reload but now I can also go around him

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.409 
reload but now I can also go around him
and<00:06:29.710> there's<00:06:30.710> really<00:06:31.460> nowhere<00:06:31.790> he<00:06:32.060> can<00:06:32.270> go

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
and there's really nowhere he can go

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.350 
and there's really nowhere he can go
he's<00:06:32.690> on<00:06:32.870> he's<00:06:33.169> in<00:06:33.200> like<00:06:33.410> a<00:06:33.440> little<00:06:33.620> horseshoe

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
he's on he's in like a little horseshoe

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.240 
he's on he's in like a little horseshoe
where<00:06:35.360> he's<00:06:36.080> being<00:06:36.290> fired<00:06:36.680> out<00:06:36.919> from<00:06:37.100> all

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
where he's being fired out from all

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.940 
where he's being fired out from all
sides<00:06:37.520> so<00:06:38.060> inevitable<00:06:38.870> outcome<00:06:38.990> there<00:06:40.150> and

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
sides so inevitable outcome there and

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.680 
sides so inevitable outcome there and
now<00:06:42.950> we're<00:06:43.250> just<00:06:43.280> basically<00:06:43.850> breaking<00:06:44.389> out<00:06:44.660> of

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
now we're just basically breaking out of

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.219 
now we're just basically breaking out of
that<00:06:44.840> containment<00:06:45.940> see<00:06:46.940> when<00:06:47.780> you<00:06:47.930> find

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
that containment see when you find

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:49.690 
that containment see when you find
yourself<00:06:48.350> in<00:06:48.740> a<00:06:48.830> position<00:06:48.979> that's<00:06:49.460> not

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
yourself in a position that's not

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.779 
yourself in a position that's not
defensively<00:06:50.270> like<00:06:50.720> I<00:06:50.810> did<00:06:50.990> earlier<00:06:51.789> you

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
defensively like I did earlier you

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.570 
defensively like I did earlier you
really<00:06:53.240> need<00:06:53.390> to<00:06:53.450> break<00:06:53.840> out<00:06:54.050> of<00:06:54.080> it<00:06:54.380> you<00:06:55.310> don't

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
really need to break out of it you don't

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.730 
really need to break out of it you don't
want<00:06:55.640> to<00:06:55.850> just<00:06:55.970> sit<00:06:56.240> there<00:06:56.570> and<00:06:56.810> take<00:06:57.530> the

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
want to just sit there and take the

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.860 
want to just sit there and take the
punishment<00:06:57.950> because<00:06:58.460> you<00:06:59.000> won't<00:06:59.210> you<00:06:59.720> won't

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
punishment because you won't you won't

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.260 
punishment because you won't you won't
win<00:07:00.140> that<00:07:00.169> way<00:07:00.530> the<00:07:01.490> way<00:07:01.640> you<00:07:01.700> win<00:07:02.030> those

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
win that way the way you win those

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.680 
win that way the way you win those
engagements<00:07:02.690> is<00:07:03.169> as<00:07:03.740> a<00:07:03.800> group<00:07:04.490> you<00:07:05.120> push<00:07:05.419> out

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
engagements is as a group you push out

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.040 
engagements is as a group you push out
and<00:07:06.020> you<00:07:06.500> basically<00:07:07.090> hammer<00:07:08.090> their<00:07:08.450> positions

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
and you basically hammer their positions

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.800 
and you basically hammer their positions
because<00:07:09.320> if<00:07:09.950> they're<00:07:10.250> if<00:07:11.180> they're<00:07:11.360> attacking

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
because if they're if they're attacking

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.750 
because if they're if they're attacking
your<00:07:12.200> defensive<00:07:12.680> position<00:07:13.160> and<00:07:13.280> making<00:07:13.700> it

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:13.760 
your defensive position and making it

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.540 
your defensive position and making it
unde<00:07:13.970> offensive<00:07:14.740> then<00:07:15.740> you<00:07:16.039> can<00:07:16.220> just<00:07:16.370> count

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
unde offensive then you can just count

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.730 
unde offensive then you can just count
you<00:07:16.789> should<00:07:17.030> counter<00:07:17.360> attack<00:07:17.630> and<00:07:17.900> by

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
you should counter attack and by

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.400 
you should counter attack and by
counter-attacking<00:07:19.460> and<00:07:19.970> taking<00:07:20.750> away<00:07:20.870> the

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410 
counter-attacking and taking away the

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.830 
counter-attacking and taking away the
initiative<00:07:21.950> you<00:07:22.550> can<00:07:22.760> then<00:07:22.789> steamroll<00:07:23.600> and

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 
initiative you can then steamroll and

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.700 
initiative you can then steamroll and
wreck<00:07:24.680> them<00:07:24.860> real<00:07:25.039> good<00:07:25.510> so<00:07:26.510> I<00:07:26.930> guess<00:07:27.320> a<00:07:27.410> little

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710 
wreck them real good so I guess a little

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.029 
wreck them real good so I guess a little
bit<00:07:27.889> of<00:07:27.979> tactical<00:07:28.630> idea<00:07:29.630> there<00:07:29.960> that<00:07:30.410> if<00:07:30.830> your

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 
bit of tactical idea there that if your

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.430 
bit of tactical idea there that if your
position<00:07:31.220> isn't<00:07:31.700> defensible<00:07:32.360> either<00:07:33.020> fall

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 
position isn't defensible either fall

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.070 
position isn't defensible either fall
back<00:07:33.650> or<00:07:33.979> counter-attack<00:07:34.550> and<00:07:34.970> in<00:07:35.720> that<00:07:35.840> case

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 
back or counter-attack and in that case

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.409 
back or counter-attack and in that case
the<00:07:36.470> only<00:07:37.370> option<00:07:37.760> was<00:07:37.880> to<00:07:37.940> counter-attack

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:38.419 
the only option was to counter-attack

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.210 
the only option was to counter-attack
and<00:07:38.870> that's<00:07:39.110> exactly<00:07:39.260> what<00:07:39.620> we<00:07:39.680> did<00:07:39.800> and<00:07:40.070> we

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220 
and that's exactly what we did and we

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.650 
and that's exactly what we did and we
end<00:07:40.490> up<00:07:40.639> winning<00:07:40.910> and<00:07:41.210> getting<00:07:41.240> out<00:07:41.510> of<00:07:41.539> the

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:41.660 
end up winning and getting out of the

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.050 
end up winning and getting out of the
