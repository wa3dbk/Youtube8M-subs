you another one of these ice based
solar-powered<00:00:04.560> air<00:00:04.680> coolers<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.220> set<00:00:05.460> up

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050

real simple to make I'll show you how to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:54.850 
real simple to make I'll show you how to
do<00:00:32.969> it

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:56.059 

all<00:00:55.460> right<00:00:55.580> now<00:00:55.670> we<00:00:55.760> just<00:00:55.790> got<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:56.120> cut<00:00:56.270> them

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:25.760 

perfect

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.560 

all<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.490> got<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> fired<00:02:26.940> up<00:02:27.090> now<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.360> can

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
all right I got a fired up now you can

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.690 
all right I got a fired up now you can
see<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> airflow<00:02:28.140> right<00:02:28.350> there<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.400> fans

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
see the airflow right there so fans

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.940 
see the airflow right there so fans
running<00:02:29.910> off<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.270> solar<00:02:30.510> panel<00:02:30.990> right

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
running off the solar panel right

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.550 
running off the solar panel right
outside<00:02:32.310> here

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
outside here

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:42.680 
outside here
it's<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> 15<00:02:34.980> water

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.420 

and<00:02:42.870> here<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.740> small<00:02:44.010> 12-volt

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and here it is to a small 12-volt

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.020 
and here it is to a small 12-volt
battery<00:02:46.040> bypassing<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.100> solar<00:02:47.340> panel<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.820> now

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.070 

you<00:02:51.030> want<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.210> switch<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.420> over<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.870> solar

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
you want to switch it over to the solar

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.650 
you want to switch it over to the solar
panel<00:02:52.440> from<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.070> battery<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:54.450> hook<00:02:54.570> it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
panel from the battery just hook it

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.500 
panel from the battery just hook it
straight<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.200> solar<00:02:55.380> panel<00:02:55.770> like<00:02:55.920> this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.990 

now<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:00.690> on<00:03:00.810> solar<00:03:01.550> let's<00:03:02.550> crank<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:02.880> thing

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
now it's on solar let's crank this thing

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.220 
now it's on solar let's crank this thing
on

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.930 

awesome<00:03:13.069> airflow<00:03:14.019> quiet<00:03:15.019> fan<00:03:15.610> even<00:03:16.610> got<00:03:16.819> the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
awesome airflow quiet fan even got the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.130 
awesome airflow quiet fan even got the
switch<00:03:17.150> hooked<00:03:17.390> up<00:03:17.510> here<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:17.930> course

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
switch hooked up here and of course

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.399 
switch hooked up here and of course
that's<00:03:18.260> optional<00:03:18.799> but<00:03:19.870> use<00:03:20.870> something<00:03:21.260> like

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
that's optional but use something like

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.130 
that's optional but use something like
that<00:03:21.620> for<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.860> best<00:03:22.099> cooling<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.900> just<00:03:23.900> freeze

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
that for the best cooling I just freeze

00:03:24.140 --> 00:04:06.620 
that for the best cooling I just freeze
it<00:03:24.170> in<00:03:24.409> a<00:03:24.470> big<00:03:24.680> plastic<00:03:25.040> pail

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.180 

it<00:04:07.020> does<00:04:07.260> work<00:04:07.440> better<00:04:07.650> if<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.010> ice<00:04:08.160> is

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
it does work better if the ice is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.280 
it does work better if the ice is
unenclosed<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.270> course<00:04:09.450> it's<00:04:09.630> easier<00:04:09.960> if

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
unenclosed but of course it's easier if

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.630 
unenclosed but of course it's easier if
you<00:04:10.860> use<00:04:11.100> on<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.370> plastic<00:04:11.790> bottles<00:04:16.459> just<00:04:17.459> the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
you use on the plastic bottles just the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:49.700 
you use on the plastic bottles just the
frozen<00:04:17.970> gallon<00:04:18.270> jugs

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.140 

okay<00:04:50.710> that's<00:04:50.920> what's<00:04:51.100> left<00:04:51.280> after<00:04:51.520> about<00:04:51.850> five

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
okay that's what's left after about five

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
okay that's what's left after about five
hours<00:04:52.740> not<00:04:53.740> too<00:04:53.950> much
