00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.660
 when it was in my techno name 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.570
 fanatic dotcom and good here we are 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.139
 with a pencil let's say a stylus like 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.910
 he tells him capacitive to do the ipad 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.290
 or any tablet that has it with 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.550
 what comes to be capacitive screen as well 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.550
 that we are going to the opening 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.300
 to 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:31.940
 15 what is this pencil the model 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.430
 it's the cosmonaut 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.430
 and the interesting thing is that it is very thick 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.880
 more or less there are some companies that I 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.320
 is sending there are others that I had to 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.580
 buy because deep down what I 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.860
 I want to do at the end of all this 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.430
 reviews is to teach you which of 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.630
 all of these is really the best for 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.580
 what do they have to do capacitive screens 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.489
 so be here as you can see 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.670
 is not the cosmonaut and the presentation is 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.559
 is 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.769
 have the malpensados ​​the malpensados 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.790
 On the other hand I am here has a way 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:10.290
 of rocket like an essence carlos and this 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 it would be the pencil 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.470
 let's say how much the design tends to be 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:24.030
 of wrapping here we have our 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.030
 tablet we are going to put others in shape 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.460
 in this way from here we go to what 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.440
 come to do some 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.280
 an application of what is 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.110
 and drawing 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.850
 and we are going to teach you more or less in 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.250
 what are there are some that are of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 aluminum and I bought an aluminum for 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.900
 that you can see this 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.460
 difference itself but then it was proved 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.420
 review but I finish in this case this 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.860
 it is also aluminum only that is 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.190
 coated so you do not make a rubber 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.710
 not of good quality and therefore allows 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.000
 this way not to damage the tablet but the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.229
 idea is that you do not fall on top of the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.899
 tablet not because it's a bit heavy 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.580
 now as soon as they want to do it how 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.580
 answer the tablet you can see there 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.130
 respond well let's do it well do the 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.290
 draft 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.450
 and let's do what I always 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.430
 I make 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.450
 to my daughter 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.690
 what 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.410
 let's do a dora what do you think 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.410
 we'll see 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.430
 this 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.560
 and half Swedish but good 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.520
 to this duty that responds well 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.769
 well better than this I can not do 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.500
 gentlemen are going to excuse me artists not 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.150
 I'm not that talented and well this is 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.480
 what you can do is very responsive 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.920
 well it is accurate we are going to give them a 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.710
 treatment not for you to see my 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.940
 I work my art of dora but what 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.940
 let's erase this 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.000
 finally interesting this application 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.409
 let's lower this here you can 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.760
 close it or open and close this and we're going 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.269
 here then you can write 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.269
 but 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.870
 when it does not work like the park that 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.560
 they think that 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.220
 logically that more functions is in 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.000
 draft now yes but that's how it works 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.000
 perfect 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.819
 so if one really decides 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.160
 buy this type of pencils can 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.310
 be better for the good to do drawings 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.890
 now here I am using this 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.960
 format the one uses the pencil then 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.590
 it's going to be much better 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.590
 sorry 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.600
 you can see much thinner than 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.290
 let's close this is going to be a sheet 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.730
 new bring another new story not see 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.129
 here for example 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.220
 it's about doing what I'm doing 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.430
 doing to move the screen if 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.430
 you are going to see 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.180
 you can sing change color 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.270
 it responds very well you can see 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.610
 that the tip 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.419
 he does not usually throw is a little while 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.419
 that focus well 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.100
 then you can feel there is a 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.560
 space between what comes to be the metal 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.500
 with a small bubble 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.000
 but if you can see that they respond 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.780
 very good pencil 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.850
 we are not going back 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.710
 prefers to write let's say in this case 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.480
 with this here that much better not but 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.639
 How can I comment again on what I am going to 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.350
 to do is to do a review is not that 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.860
 have all the pencils 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.110
 let's say with the ability to paint 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.130
 on capacitive screens because I'm going to 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.419
 make a review of all of them and 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.620
 tell them what it is in the background is better 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.660
 because I have one that is very interesting 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.940
 that you are going to see also the 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.470
 next week and I recommend that you 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.470
 see the video because it is very rare not 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:25.130
 background is not like these here that is 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.320
 rubber or silicone but is another kind of 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.230
 material and that is interesting when the 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.340
 background is apparently the best there is 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.490
 with respect to what you should do 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.840
 write on capacitive screens like this 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.460
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.490
 this video as you have seen no 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.990
 I have the talent to paint 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.060
 especially college cross the 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.560
 Dora wearing more went very well but 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.450
 well that's all I wish to car them 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.740
 farewell not only subscribe to the channel 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.330
 they did not click on the dollar above 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.350
 which are very possible providing you 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.420
 more information regarding 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.770
 cellular technologies accessories and 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.750
 many other things more name jose 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.560
