flat 285 I know if you had your way this
would<00:02:40.610> be<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.819> same<00:02:41.000> circuit<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.630> was<00:02:41.780> in

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
would be the same circuit that it was in

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.110 
would be the same circuit that it was in
1951<00:02:42.680> four<00:02:42.980> wheelers<00:02:43.370> born<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:43.910> very

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
1951 four wheelers born in this very

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.940 
1951 four wheelers born in this very
place<00:02:44.299> here<00:02:44.840> but<00:02:45.230> it's<00:02:45.349> important<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.799> make

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
place here but it's important to make

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.170 
place here but it's important to make
changes<00:02:46.190> do<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.849> think<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.060> they've

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
changes do you think that they've

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.610 
changes do you think that they've
managed<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.480> keep<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.930> integrity<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
managed to keep the integrity of the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.620 
managed to keep the integrity of the
syllabus<00:02:48.860> turn<00:02:49.129> as<00:02:49.489> what<00:02:49.910> is<00:02:50.000> bringing<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.450> up

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
syllabus turn as what is bringing it up

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.479 
syllabus turn as what is bringing it up
into<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.200> new<00:02:51.349> era<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.799> think<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.400> think

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
into the new era I think so I think

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.160 
into the new era I think so I think
you'll<00:02:52.819> find<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:53.150> modern<00:02:53.450> drivers<00:02:53.810> will<00:02:53.959> like

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
you'll find the modern drivers will like

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.930 
you'll find the modern drivers will like
it<00:02:54.349> unless<00:02:54.650> it's<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.069> good<00:02:55.250> thing<00:02:55.430> already<00:02:55.760> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
it unless it's a good thing already the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.479 
it unless it's a good thing already the
motorcycles<00:02:56.630> like<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:57.019> which<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.530> really<00:02:57.799> good

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
motorcycles like it which is really good

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.759 
motorcycles like it which is really good
and<00:02:58.700> now<00:02:59.239> if<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.660> car<00:02:59.900> drivers<00:03:00.319> like<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.650> as

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
and now if the car drivers like it as

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.039 
and now if the car drivers like it as
well<00:03:00.799> that'll<00:03:01.190> be<00:03:01.220> wonderful<00:03:01.489> well<00:03:02.480> standing

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
well that'll be wonderful well standing

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.470 
well that'll be wonderful well standing
