00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.200
 hello that such a youtube here draco happy 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.879
 gamer in a new gameplay the live in 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.430
 this case is not minecraft this game 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.140
 has little square we would be 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.420
 talking about the black light revolution 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.650
 according to my criteria the best shooter 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:21.789
 multiplayer this year of the year 2006 in 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.489
 the year of 2014 I think we are in 2014 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.340
 if not and the truth that I am very happy 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.470
 with this game is super entertaining 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.970
 is to forgive for my absurd comments 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.439
 since I'm commenting on the life and not 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.730
 I am used to it 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.130
 Well I'll give the reasons 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.190
 what do I think is the best game that is the 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.850
 best game to play in multiplayer 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.710
 of gps is the first reason are your 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.809
 graphics I'm playing in ultra like 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.180
 you can see it looks amazing in a game 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.340
 between 70 and 140 fps is with my computer 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.920
 of dance as he calls a friend of mine 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.330
 that I have in Madrid that is called david and 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.670
 I'm probably seeing this one right now 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.910
 video if you see it right now as a 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.100
 I salute to him also tell you that 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.220
 It has very very fast loading periods 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.369
 brief from around that say more or 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.330
 minus 510 seconds between game and 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.640
 departure 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.560
 and another point in favor is that there is 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.630
 but look how you look for 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.250
 there are hackers, people are not bad 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.150
 It depends on who you play against 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.380
 all kinds of video games 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.970
 the truth is that I have entertained me 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.770
 very much one thing that I really like about 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.240
 this game one aspect is that with the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.550
 letter what we can activate this viewer 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.070
 that you just saw where we can 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.600
 perform any type of player and if 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.520
 are you watching this please 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.470
 I would beg to have you download it and David and 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.970
 anyone who wants to play 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.050
 with me the truth that I would be 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.300
 charmed 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.280
 -We are 517 people please do not you 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.140
 download all the game because I do not know 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.330
 what power you can play with 517 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.220
 people but good 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.750
 in case that is so we would stay and 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.450
 some days because we could not 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.670
 play you can download it by steam in 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.610
 the link that you have the description for 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.070
 favor 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.540
 this video understand me because it's going to be 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.850
 Pretty short there's not much to say 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.100
 regarding my game although this one in 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.630
 concrete yes it has enough to tell you 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.570
 I'm playing with the main weapon 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.200
 that would be do not forget what it's called 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.430
 because I am a damn cloud in this game 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.379
 maybe we'll see each other until the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.030
 enemies there is one is worth perfect as been 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.030
 for him there he is dead 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.360
 the main one starts to be a garbage and 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.190
 it is quite difficult to control the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.120
 principle but once you put it is 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.040
 dislike it escapes once I uncle 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.210
 of still once you put the look that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.980
 I have you currently 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.320
 that would be an equivalent to the sight of 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.370
 red dot of other games like the 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.709
 battery call of duty 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.959
 this weapon is going very well is very malleable it 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.780
 can move very malleable fast it would not be 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.519
 the word would be very easy to move 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.150
 but I do not know how to say very manageable 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.860
 exactly to see and I think there's a guy 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.930
 yes yes you are going to see if I can kill him 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.040
 it's a country there are few stonemasons the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.200
 true in this game because it 's a game 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.450
 of a lot of action a lot of movement and I do not know 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.040
 where it has gotten but I think it is 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.079
 has gone from there 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.040
 and well the truth is that I do not have much 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.750
 more to say about this game 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.930
 simply what is the download is that 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.989
 weighs 12 gigabytes divided into 9 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.349
 gigabytes of the game and 2 and a half of a 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.349
 patch 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.760
 that more than more knowing that I have more 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.760
 what to say 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.570
 so it's also a game with a lot 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.220
 customization we can choose between 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.930
 different as flashes of weapons and 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.970
 there are also these robots here that 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.010
 let's see how they kill us now 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.750
 could this be from here that as 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.550
 you can see it is very small we are going to 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.690
 approaching even though enemy is 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.980
 pretty handsome if you start shooting 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.600
 is going to try to turn that will try 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.490
 kill me I think he's going to get 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 some day of these the truth that the 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.400
 lad who is up and up is 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.380
 not quite as you can see what I'm 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.880
 and moving as good as I want and 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.140
 I say I advise you to download this 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.320
 game to see what I've always loaded already 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.060
 step would be pretty good or a little 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.550
 fool the kid that I'm here mounted 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.230
 yes it is but good it seems that a 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.550
 someone has saved his life 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.710
