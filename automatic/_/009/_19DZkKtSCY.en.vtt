00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
because she's part of this process of a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.349 
because she's part of this process of a
bunch<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.769> people<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:24.340> determine<00:03:25.299> the

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
bunch of people to determine the

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.229 
bunch of people to determine the
criteria<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.199> all<00:03:27.159> it<00:03:27.430> will<00:03:27.519> have<00:03:27.669> to<00:03:27.790> be<00:03:27.819> is<00:03:28.209> a

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
criteria and all it will have to be is a

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.289 
criteria and all it will have to be is a
psychiatric<00:03:29.229> evaluation<00:03:29.409> by<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.639> gender

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
psychiatric evaluation by a gender

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.030 
psychiatric evaluation by a gender

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
specialist and shut up Sabine and so

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.619 
specialist and shut up Sabine and so
she's<00:03:36.280> going<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.489> schedule<00:03:36.879> me<00:03:36.970> for<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.269> like

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
in the next coming weeks so I can get

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.069 
in the next coming weeks so I can get
that<00:03:40.060> done<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.689> then<00:03:42.090> basically<00:03:43.090> that's

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
that done and then basically that's

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.999 
that done and then basically that's
that's<00:03:44.409> going<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> be<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:46.470> possibly<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.709> can

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:48.009 
that's going to be it so possibly I can

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.039 
that's going to be it so possibly I can
be<00:03:48.129> getting<00:03:48.370> surgery<00:03:48.669> this<00:03:49.120> summer<00:03:49.180> before<00:03:49.780> I
