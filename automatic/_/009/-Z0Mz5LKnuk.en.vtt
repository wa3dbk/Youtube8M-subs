struts<00:02:17.850> also<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.140> easily<00:02:19.320> have

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
struts also you so you can easily have

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.920 
struts also you so you can easily have
your<00:02:19.860> let's<00:02:20.070> say<00:02:20.130> your<00:02:20.310> pet<00:02:20.520> roll<00:02:20.780> on<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
your let's say your pet roll on the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.290 
your let's say your pet roll on the
bottom<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:23.010> there's<00:02:23.280> also<00:02:23.460> two<00:02:23.640> training

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
bottom and there's also two training

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.110 
bottom and there's also two training
holes<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.140> even<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.860> material<00:02:26.490> itself<00:02:26.820> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
holes so even the material itself is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.430 
holes so even the material itself is
watertight<00:02:28.220> these<00:02:29.220> little<00:02:29.970> holes<00:02:30.210> will<00:02:31.080> make

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
watertight these little holes will make

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.710 
watertight these little holes will make
sure<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.280> backpack<00:02:32.760> itself<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.540> not

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
sure that the backpack itself is not

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.250 
sure that the backpack itself is not
100%<00:02:34.850> watertight<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.630> leave<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.050> in

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
100% watertight so if you leave this in

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.210 
100% watertight so if you leave this in
a<00:02:37.320> puddle<00:02:37.709> at<00:02:38.580> least<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.360> lower<00:02:39.510> part<00:02:40.220> might

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
a puddle at least the lower part might

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:50.960 
a puddle at least the lower part might
be<00:02:41.250> flooded<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:47.820> go<00:02:48.690> through<00:02:49.430> let's<00:02:50.430> say<00:02:50.550> your

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
be flooded to go through let's say your

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.380 
be flooded to go through let's say your
hydration<00:02:51.510> pack<00:02:51.930> or<00:02:52.260> antenna<00:02:53.160> all<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.970> say<00:02:54.270> if

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
hydration pack or antenna all I say if

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.860 
hydration pack or antenna all I say if
you<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> headset<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.790> they<00:02:56.790> are<00:02:56.910> also<00:02:57.120> on

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you have a headset and they are also on

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.540 
you have a headset and they are also on
the<00:02:58.230> inside<00:02:59.150> here<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.690> no<00:03:01.290> worry<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:04.370> we<00:03:05.370> have

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
the inside here so no worry so we have

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.310 
the inside here so no worry so we have
two<00:03:05.790> tightenings<00:03:06.570> on<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.930> top<00:03:07.250> which<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.489> nice

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
two tightenings on the top which is nice

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.800 
two tightenings on the top which is nice
in<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.470> inside<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.790> compartment<00:03:12.300> for

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
in the inside there is a compartment for

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.880 
in the inside there is a compartment for
the<00:03:13.440> backplate<00:03:13.980> there<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.700> backplate<00:03:15.890> but

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the backplate there is a backplate but

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.780 
the backplate there is a backplate but
of<00:03:17.160> course<00:03:17.459> it's<00:03:17.730> not<00:03:17.910> anatomically<00:03:18.750> designed

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
of course it's not anatomically designed

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.220 
of course it's not anatomically designed
so<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> basically<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.750> military

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
so this is a basically a military

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.449 
so this is a basically a military
backpack<00:03:22.760> but<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:24.060> does<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.570> trick

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
backpack but it does the trick

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.400 
backpack but it does the trick
so<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.820> course<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.330> can<00:03:27.510> pull<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.930> out<00:03:27.989> and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
so of course you can pull that out and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.690 
so of course you can pull that out and
have<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.580> inside<00:03:30.060> compartment<00:03:31.370> for<00:03:32.370> let's

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
have the inside compartment for let's

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.060 
have the inside compartment for let's
say<00:03:32.910> your<00:03:33.060> hydration<00:03:33.540> pack<00:03:33.900> if<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.260> have<00:03:34.500> any

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.420 

at<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.220> back<00:03:38.430> there<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.330> handle<00:03:40.280> made<00:03:41.280> out

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
at the back there is a handle made out

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.539 
at the back there is a handle made out
of<00:03:41.690> solid<00:03:42.690> green<00:03:43.170> strap<00:03:43.530> here's<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
of solid green strap here's the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.170 
of solid green strap here's the
see-through<00:03:45.330> window<00:03:45.540> for<00:03:46.080> your<00:03:46.170> nametag<00:03:46.739> and

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
see-through window for your nametag and

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.759 
see-through window for your nametag and
then<00:03:48.180> we<00:03:48.390> have<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.810> harness<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.560> waist

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
then we have the harness and a waist

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.960 
then we have the harness and a waist
belt<00:03:50.660> another<00:03:51.660> waist<00:03:51.959> belt<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.560> course<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.220> as

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
belt another waist belt of course is as

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.580 
belt another waist belt of course is as
you<00:03:54.180> can<00:03:54.269> see<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.720> quite<00:03:54.870> basic

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
you can see it's quite basic

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.770 
you can see it's quite basic
it's<00:03:55.769> basically<00:03:56.310> five<00:03:56.519> centimetres<00:03:57.299> wide

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
it's basically five centimetres wide

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.509 
it's basically five centimetres wide
strap<00:03:58.320> with<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> plastic<00:04:00.030> buckle<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:01.019> both<00:04:01.519> it

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
strap with a plastic buckle of both it

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.170 
strap with a plastic buckle of both it
does<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.970> trick<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.570> it's<00:04:04.049> quite<00:04:04.320> light<00:04:04.650> so

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
does the trick and it's quite light so

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.400 
does the trick and it's quite light so
it's<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.269> military<00:04:06.690> design<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:10.080> soldier

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
it's a military design the soldier

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.090 
it's a military design the soldier
harness<00:04:10.890> isn't<00:04:11.760> really<00:04:12.209> padded<00:04:12.600> at<00:04:12.989> all<00:04:13.380> as

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
harness isn't really padded at all as

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.670 
harness isn't really padded at all as
you<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:14.519> see<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:14.910> quite<00:04:15.090> thin<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:15.870> it's

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
you can see it's quite thin but it's

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.440 
you can see it's quite thin but it's
something<00:04:16.889> like<00:04:17.130> six<00:04:17.400> centimeters

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
something like six centimeters

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.470 
something like six centimeters
so<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.650> distributes<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.610> weight<00:04:20.760> quite

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
so it distributes the weight quite

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.560 
so it distributes the weight quite
evenly<00:04:22.020> on<00:04:22.410> your<00:04:22.740> shoulders<00:04:23.280> which<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.360> nice

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
evenly on your shoulders which is nice

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.690 
evenly on your shoulders which is nice
and<00:04:26.330> then<00:04:27.330> we<00:04:27.540> have<00:04:27.870> this<00:04:28.110> little<00:04:28.430> just<00:04:29.430> drop

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
and then we have this little just drop

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.280 
and then we have this little just drop
of<00:04:30.060> course<00:04:30.870> which<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.200> nice<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.730> then<00:04:33.050> here<00:04:34.050> we

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
of course which is nice and then here we

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.020 
of course which is nice and then here we
have<00:04:34.320> some<00:04:34.800> more<00:04:34.980> less<00:04:35.190> or<00:04:35.400> let's<00:04:35.610> say<00:04:35.760> if<00:04:35.910> you

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
have some more less or let's say if you

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.350 
have some more less or let's say if you
would<00:04:36.240> have<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.510> knife<00:04:36.780> or<00:04:37.730> maybe<00:04:38.730> some<00:04:39.060> little

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
would have a knife or maybe some little

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.900 
would have a knife or maybe some little
utility<00:04:39.660> pouch<00:04:40.140> maybe<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.160> tourniquet<00:04:41.550> pouch

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
utility pouch maybe a tourniquet pouch

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.160 
utility pouch maybe a tourniquet pouch
you<00:04:42.210> can<00:04:42.270> have<00:04:42.600> them<00:04:42.870> here<00:04:43.140> and<00:04:44.630> extra<00:04:45.630> feature

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
you can have them here and extra feature

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.070 
you can have them here and extra feature
is<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.710> these<00:04:47.670> buckles<00:04:48.150> here<00:04:48.480> are<00:04:48.690> made<00:04:48.930> of

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
is that these buckles here are made of

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.410 
is that these buckles here are made of
metal<00:04:49.260> so<00:04:49.500> they<00:04:50.160> don't<00:04:50.370> accidentally<00:04:51.030> break

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
metal so they don't accidentally break

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.190 
metal so they don't accidentally break
and<00:04:51.690> I'll<00:04:52.410> probably<00:04:53.270> replace<00:04:54.270> these<00:04:54.570> plastic

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
and I'll probably replace these plastic

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.550 
and I'll probably replace these plastic
buckles<00:04:55.620> here<00:04:55.950> with<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.310> metal<00:04:56.610> ones<00:04:57.470> just<00:04:58.470> to

buckles here with the metal ones just to

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.910 
buckles here with the metal ones just to
be<00:04:58.710> sure<00:05:00.950> if<00:05:01.950> I<00:05:02.130> have<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.550> summarize<00:05:03.920> this

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
be sure if I have to summarize this

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.990 
be sure if I have to summarize this
backpack<00:05:05.490> it's<00:05:06.170> quite<00:05:07.170> basic<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.830> simple<00:05:08.010> but

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
backpack it's quite basic and simple but

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.720 
backpack it's quite basic and simple but
it<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.360> surprisingly<00:05:10.110> comfortable<00:05:10.890> to<00:05:11.490> carry

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
it is surprisingly comfortable to carry

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.860 
it is surprisingly comfortable to carry
a<00:05:13.010> little<00:05:14.010> bit<00:05:14.190> expensive<00:05:14.640> but<00:05:15.060> it's<00:05:15.510> made<00:05:15.750> in

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
a little bit expensive but it's made in

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.410 
a little bit expensive but it's made in
Finland<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:16.980> it's<00:05:17.160> really<00:05:17.370> high-quality<00:05:17.670> and
