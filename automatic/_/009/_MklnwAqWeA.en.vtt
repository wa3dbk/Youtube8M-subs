00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.650
 we are sitting here with wolfgang russ and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.129
 Frank Bushman and two commentators 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.110
 legend in the year does not age 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.480
 but because of the familiarity 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.680
 in any case yes we have one 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 new man at his side 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.080
 how did that feel to you? 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:33.140
 the new partner of the fifa 16 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:33.140
 very well felt that 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 totally liked to do now it is just as 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.570
 that i know that many football fans 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.340
 have long said it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.020
 Just like to know how it is 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.630
 if wolf and bushy together 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.410
 the comment it is in real life 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.690
 in tv not possible to we are too 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.030
 dominant on the microphone respectively and now 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.530
 gamer got the fifa 16gb 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.570
 get what is what the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 TV watching does not get and almost 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.650
 just because we did that now 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 already said 150 times out of fact so 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.470
 good because we understand each other well there too 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.470
 no competitive situation 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.650
 since we both sport and experience and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.020
 so I hope that we succeeded 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.140
 really live near this situation also 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.190
 soccer game too 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.450
 porting 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.770
 that was fun but is 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.770
 of course , bad with someone 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.470
 Of course it is exhausting because of us 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.470
 45,000 ex sequences were spoken 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.230
 Names of players and so on 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.000
 is already work that one must 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.470
 accept 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.690
 but if you can someone make me 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.630
 by get along well and privately 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.610
 then if it's easier in the studio 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.420
 to come and just six common 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.740
 hours with 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.409
 to bring the 1 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.390
 four and six hours but in 20 days 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.390
 yes yes, exactly on the 20th 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.140
 question and there is already 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.170
 Until then, 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.170
