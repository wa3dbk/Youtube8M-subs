00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.660
 if you plan 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.110
 form a new strawberry bed then 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.389
 it's time to take care of boarding 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.849
 the material 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:19.650
 look at your garden 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.550
 with strawberries and if you see that on

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.640
 glossy 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.770
 take the twine mark this bush and with 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.829
 this bush we will take a landing 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:03.439

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:35.210
 thin we just need to remove them 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:39.509

 Now some water is absorbed 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.720
 let's wait a little earth can 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.570
 move the cup so that it does not exist 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.660
 voids 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:41.810
