00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to see variety and also it was nice to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.370 
to see variety and also it was nice to
see<00:01:51.329> where<00:01:52.189> you<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.939> armor<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
see where you have the armor on but it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.990 
see where you have the armor on but it
still<00:01:55.710> doesn't<00:01:56.070> change<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.430> look<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.969> your

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
still doesn't change the look of your

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.620 
still doesn't change the look of your
character<00:01:57.570> which<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.990> actually<00:01:59.119> see<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> lot<00:02:00.360> in

about this game were more than anything
below<00:02:27.150> times<00:02:27.690> they<00:02:28.230> are<00:02:28.260> awful<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.940> load

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
below times they are awful you load

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
experience and it just gets me

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.180 
experience and it just gets me
frustrated<00:02:43.950> with<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:44.670> game<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:46.070> some<00:02:47.070> of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
frustrated with this game and some of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.030 
frustrated with this game and some of
the<00:02:47.280> load<00:02:47.910> times<00:02:48.210> got<00:02:48.600> me<00:02:48.990> even<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:49.830> bit

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
the load times got me even a little bit

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.620 
the load times got me even a little bit
more<00:02:50.160> frustrated<00:02:50.880> than<00:02:50.910> some<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> boss

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
more frustrated than some of the boss

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.350 
more frustrated than some of the boss
battles<00:02:52.170> did<00:02:52.640> another<00:02:53.640> down<00:02:53.910> point<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.300> this

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
battles did another down point of this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.780 
battles did another down point of this
game<00:02:54.600> which<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.380> not<00:02:55.650> really<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.950> big<00:02:56.520> down

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
game which it's not really a big down

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.000 
game which it's not really a big down
point<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.270> it's<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.540> small<00:02:57.810> gripe<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.410> that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
point but it's a small gripe is that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.740 
point but it's a small gripe is that
when<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.460> die<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.790> have<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.240> start<00:03:00.600> at<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
when you die you have to start at the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.490 
when you die you have to start at the
very<00:03:00.920> beginning<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.160> level<00:03:02.550> which<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.930> can

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
very beginning of the level which I can

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
very beginning of the level which I can
understand<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.700> also<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.180> kind<00:03:06.390> of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
understand but it also is kind of

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.960 
understand but it also is kind of
annoying<00:03:06.840> when<00:03:07.220> you're<00:03:08.220> fighting<00:03:08.550> through

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
annoying when you're fighting through

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.330 
annoying when you're fighting through
and<00:03:09.240> you<00:03:09.360> get<00:03:09.960> far<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.590> do<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.710> dungeon<00:03:11.160> and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
and you get far and do a dungeon and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.590 
and you get far and do a dungeon and
then<00:03:11.430> die<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.880> have<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.090> start<00:03:12.360> all<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.570> way

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
then die and have to start all the way

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.730 
then die and have to start all the way
over<00:03:12.690> which<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.490> understand<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:15.510> then<00:03:16.500> when

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
over which I understand but then when

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.560 
over which I understand but then when
you<00:03:16.860> start<00:03:17.160> over<00:03:17.460> sometimes<00:03:17.910> daren't<00:03:18.270> enemy

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
you start over sometimes daren't enemy

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.780 
you start over sometimes daren't enemy
any<00:03:18.840> enemies<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.650> fight<00:03:19.860> anyway<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.580> just

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
any enemies to fight anyway so you just

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.979 
any enemies to fight anyway so you just
would<00:03:20.910> have<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.270> walk<00:03:21.510> all<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.750> way<00:03:21.900> back

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
would have to walk all the way back

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.140 
would have to walk all the way back
there<00:03:22.410> which<00:03:22.560> really<00:03:22.830> makes<00:03:23.040> no<00:03:23.130> sense<00:03:23.520> and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
there which really makes no sense and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.990 
there which really makes no sense and
defeats<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.840> purpose<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.770> I'm<00:03:26.489> not<00:03:26.640> saying

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
defeats the purpose and I'm not saying

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.150 
defeats the purpose and I'm not saying
that<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.750> whole<00:03:27.959> level<00:03:28.320> should<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:28.860> start

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
that the whole level should just start

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.800 
that the whole level should just start
over<00:03:29.459> when<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:29.730> die<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:29.970> I'm<00:03:30.330> just<00:03:30.480> saying

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
over when you die but I'm just saying

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.560 
over when you die but I'm just saying
have<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.800> little<00:03:32.130> more<00:03:32.250> variety<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
have a little more variety with the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.370 
have a little more variety with the
deaths<00:03:33.810> or<00:03:34.290> at<00:03:34.560> least<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:35.900> spawn<00:03:36.900> at<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
deaths or at least just spawn at the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.050 
deaths or at least just spawn at the
nearest<00:03:37.730> checkpoint<00:03:38.730> or<00:03:38.970> nearest<00:03:39.540> new<00:03:39.900> area

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
nearest checkpoint or nearest new area

nearest checkpoint or nearest new area
that<00:03:42.060> just<00:03:42.230> something<00:03:43.230> like<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.739> mix<00:03:44.010> up

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
that just something like that to mix up

that just something like that to mix up
mix<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.300> up<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.930> don't<00:03:46.080> die<00:03:46.440> and

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
mix it up so that you don't die and

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.380 
mix it up so that you don't die and
either<00:03:47.070> have<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.400> fight<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.760> same<00:03:47.970> enemies

walk all the way back this isn't a big

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.160 
walk all the way back this isn't a big
problem<00:03:53.610> but<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> small<00:03:54.630> gripe<00:03:54.930> which

kind of annoy me throughout the game a
third<00:03:57.450> down<00:03:57.690> point<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.260> latest<00:03:58.530> game<00:03:58.830> is

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
third down point to the latest game is

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.080 
third down point to the latest game is
its<00:03:59.430> story<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:01.670> really<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:02.880> not<00:04:02.970> really

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
its story and really it's not really

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.390 
its story and really it's not really
down<00:04:03.450> important<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.900> didn't<00:04:04.200> think<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:05.280> was

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
down important I didn't think it was

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.940 
down important I didn't think it was
much<00:04:05.640> of<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:05.880> problem<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:07.050> it's<00:04:07.200> just<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.709> lack

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
much of a problem but it's just the lack

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.040 
much of a problem but it's just the lack
of<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.430> story<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:09.120> doesn't<00:04:09.390> decrease<00:04:09.810> from

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
of a story so it doesn't decrease from

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.670 
of a story so it doesn't decrease from
the<00:04:10.200> overall<00:04:11.750> point<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.110> game<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.620> just

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
the overall point of the game it just

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.370 
the overall point of the game it just
would<00:04:14.160> be<00:04:14.269> better<00:04:15.269> if<00:04:15.480> there<00:04:15.600> was<00:04:15.750> some<00:04:16.019> story

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
would be better if there was some story

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.229 
would be better if there was some story
there<00:04:16.560> are<00:04:16.590> cutscenes<00:04:17.310> at<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.669> beginning<00:04:17.940> of

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
there are cutscenes at the beginning of

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.640 
there are cutscenes at the beginning of
each<00:04:18.480> act<00:04:19.669> but<00:04:20.669> really<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.660> didn't<00:04:22.350> even<00:04:22.470> pay

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
each act but really I didn't even pay

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.740 
each act but really I didn't even pay
attention<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:23.160> them<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.370> really<00:04:24.360> didn't<00:04:24.600> care

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
attention to them I really didn't care

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.600 
attention to them I really didn't care
for<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:25.050> story<00:04:25.350> whatsoever<00:04:25.919> even<00:04:26.250> if<00:04:26.430> there

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
for this story whatsoever even if there

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.590 
for this story whatsoever even if there
is<00:04:26.760> one

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
is one

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.120 
is one
really<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:27.840> just<00:04:27.930> found<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.770> was<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:28.920> bunch

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
really I just found that it was a bunch

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.360 
really I just found that it was a bunch
of<00:04:29.450> quests<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:31.320> I'm<00:04:31.470> just<00:04:31.740> walking

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
around doing stuff and this might turn

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.060 
around doing stuff and this might turn
out<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.450> be<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.690> quick<00:04:36.990> review<00:04:37.410> but<00:04:37.770> there's
