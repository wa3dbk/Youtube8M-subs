00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 my first contact with the cello 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.720
 his date of age three 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.630
 and the violin ii has not left me since 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.140
 so I give since concerts since 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.689
 I'm in touch with the scene with 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.359
 with classical music with the 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.789
 music in a very broad sense and with 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.060
 all all the emotions that encompasses 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:33.860
 this music and so with the sharing of 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.660
 this music with people I had 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.940
 often in the hands and I believe that 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.739
 right now I remember that all of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.620
 In any case I have been 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.050
 taken and I wanted to do my job 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.270
 so in the in the head of a small 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.770
 three-year-old know what these 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.300
 four violinists I think I 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.340
 did not have to doubt I do not want 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.699
 know all the facets 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.890
 and all the strings all the aspects 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.359
 of this job but I can say in 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.559
 all the cases that I had a good instinct 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.559
 because I do not regret it 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.860
 it's hours at home at 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.790
 work also try to find out 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.880
 how we feel things like 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.490
 that the composer wanted them so we 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.780
 is there a job at the same time 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.570
 technique which is at the same time a 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.640
 very interesting artistic work to 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.350
 realize since it is in this moment 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.600
 in those moments often we dig 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.900
 very deeply yourself and that we come to 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.100
 find the way we would like 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.410
 see emerge we should hear 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.410
 emerge in the during the concert 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.750
 m 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.810
 first chair this is the first long 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:03.820
 super soloist with ma with cap mas because 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:07.180
 that it really makes a superhero and 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.550
 then there is the solo violin that is 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.890
 next to me I can be surrounded by two 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.030
 solo violins and soloist local view 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.310
 also and were all east in the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.950
 regions in their men all his 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.290
 violins in the row we move very 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.120
 flexible in the desk so change 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.420
 a lot of me it's true that if I'm at 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.340
 a place is always the same I am 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.430
 there somehow in this role there for 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.510
 collect the intentions of the chief 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.420
 orchestra and I'm here also for 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.300
 to establish some symbiosis in 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.030
 my desk 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.130
 sometimes also a kind of point 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.130
 anchor for their class 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.950
 and that role is not necessarily 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.950
 always 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.209
 asked in the east in other roles 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.030
 that is to say the role of soloist is 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.910
 really a very very exposed role and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.950
 always it's really the nose in the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.910
 light all the time we have a part 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.980
 soloist 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.500
 so we have a very different part of 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.019
 others from the other parties the others 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.569
 instrumentalists of other ways and 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.160
 goes off it's really a role of 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.300
 light in some sort it's also a 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.300
 world I like costs a lot 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.609
 last holmes I know that I gave a 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.950
 year festival in denmark where with ivry 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:39.709
 gitlis with for me that I say that which 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.900
 is completely legendary who who has 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.480
 who has more than twice my age and 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.590
 who has like one as a young man and 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.519
 it was a 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.379
 at the same time a very very very strong 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:57.209
 emotionally and then I was very 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:59.659
 struck to hear him hear of such 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.659
 artist 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.950
 the violin it's I always tend to 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.400
 to say someone else I 'm not saying 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.329
 something but it's always with 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.709
 him I'm looking for 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.079
 somehow I can search 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.150
 only in his mines limited to him 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.620
 launched a magnificent instrument this is a 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.660
 stradivarius 2682 and I know he has a 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.600
 very strong personality I can not 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.509
 ask everything he tell me at one point 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.490
 given that I do not agree I would say 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.220
 not with you with it so it's always 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.720
 in in this 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.820
 it's with him you have to actually negotiate 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:46.740
 that it is negotiated in the in the sweetness 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:52.120
 and and in in the in the constancy 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:58.510
 but it's a lot of enormously 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.520
 of love I obviously think the archi and 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.910
 do not go without the violent because a 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.970
 violin alone will not sound or if 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.970
 little 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.060
 Yes 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.250
 m 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.500
 m 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:42.530
 some eggs are so stops 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.860
 always too early it's his voice is the 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.810
 mine 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.080
 or rather it's my voice through the 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.080
 his
