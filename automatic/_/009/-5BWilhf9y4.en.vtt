00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.890 
upgraded battery right here and as you
can<00:02:25.180> see<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:27.340> one<00:02:27.610> will<00:02:27.849> give<00:02:28.030> me<00:02:28.239> about<00:02:28.569> four

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
can see that one will give me about four

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.830 
can see that one will give me about four
hours<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.319> battery<00:02:29.470> compared<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:31.390> stock

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
hours of battery compared to the stock

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.500 
hours of battery compared to the stock
one<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.410> gives<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.860> I'd<00:02:33.819> say<00:02:34.060> about<00:02:34.180> an<00:02:34.390> hour

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
one that gives you I'd say about an hour

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.890 
one that gives you I'd say about an hour
or<00:02:34.750> less<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:36.220> there<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:40.480> gonna<00:02:40.720> be

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
or less and there it is that's gonna be

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.300 
or less and there it is that's gonna be
the<00:02:40.930> camera<00:02:41.590> right<00:02:41.799> there<00:02:41.829> so<00:02:44.099> looking<00:02:45.099> pretty

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the camera right there so looking pretty

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.330 
the camera right there so looking pretty
good<00:02:46.049> there<00:02:47.049> are<00:02:47.260> some<00:02:47.620> other<00:02:47.799> things<00:02:48.099> that<00:02:48.190> I

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
good there are some other things that I

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.830 
good there are some other things that I
can<00:02:48.489> add<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.819> maybe<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.209> video<00:02:49.420> light<00:02:51.660> if<00:02:52.660> I

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
can add to it maybe a video light if I

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.789 
can add to it maybe a video light if I
really<00:02:53.109> wanted<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:54.329> some<00:02:55.329> some<00:02:55.870> wireless<00:02:56.410> mics

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
really wanted to some some wireless mics

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.819 
really wanted to some some wireless mics
but<00:02:57.250> it's<00:02:57.970> hard<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.599> without<00:02:58.930> an<00:02:59.049> XLR<00:02:59.530> there

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
but it's hard to do without an XLR there

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.559 
but it's hard to do without an XLR there
is<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.069> thing<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.310> could<00:03:00.489> buy<00:03:00.640> which<00:03:01.150> would<00:03:01.420> be

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
is this thing I could buy which would be

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.839 
is this thing I could buy which would be
a<00:03:01.599> stereo<00:03:02.109> two<00:03:02.379> XLR<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.190> can<00:03:03.400> have<00:03:03.519> multiple

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
a stereo two XLR so I can have multiple

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.089 
a stereo two XLR so I can have multiple
mics<00:03:04.209> if<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.540> wanted<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.049> that's<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.859> a<00:03:05.980> little

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
mics if I wanted to that's just a little

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.490 
mics if I wanted to that's just a little
more<00:03:06.310> expensive<00:03:06.640> but<00:03:06.879> this<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.959> going<00:03:08.109> to<00:03:08.200> be

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
more expensive but this is going to be

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.440 
more expensive but this is going to be
