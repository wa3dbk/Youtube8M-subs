00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.130
 hello everyone i'm giuseppe scarpato 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.560
 guitarist but it's been almost 15 years since 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.110
 side of edoardo bennato 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.040
 here I show you mine 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.620
 first we talk about instrumentation 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.080
 especially good for reference cables 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.960
 use for the complete wiring of everything 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.520
 my audio system in iii we start 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.050
 first of all therefore from the cable that 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.390
 carries the signal from the guitar the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.309
 pedal I entropy then after a cable 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.710
 long enough per os with the cav e 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.850
 quality also the length does not 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.680
 does not make it lose its stamp 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.629
 practically a fault that some cables 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.629
 they all actually have cheap 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.539
 then the guitar signal entered 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.009
 immediately enters a volume pedal for 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.770
 which precisely I manage who does not know about 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.259
 guitar without raising the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.789
 guitar from there always with everything and with 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.549
 all the cables reference i va jo lin 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.909
 pedal one and from there also in a 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.340
 pedal tuner then exit and enter 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.649
 the effect signal in three e 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 distortions and an over thrive with tubes 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.220
 screamer of the Lebanese a classic 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.790
 it's an overdrive of the hbo being here 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.440
 signal comes out and with a cable coming into 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.720
 this whip evidently 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.590
 amplifier rauso was 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.590
 socket 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.659
 if we see that on the back panel 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.310
 car 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.189
 instead then another two cables always of the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.700
 same then reference and recine mario 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.890
 that send me the look signal 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.980
 perfect I'm delaying so I am 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.799
 starts from here and enters instead of pedals 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.209
 modulation me tonight here in 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:25.660
 pendant lira or an analog ranger a 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.660
 train and a pinch of her a violation 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.200
 from tripoli the signal again succeeds and 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.739
 enter the delay entry of the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.400
 header 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:44.280
 this is all my sedated and therefore from 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.280
 clean sounds by raising the effects 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.630
 instead it assumes a little more distorted 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.270
 no 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.900
 the importance of having excellent i 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.310
 cables that transmit their own signal 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.870
 nor especially in an instrument like the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.430
 guitar the inter is fundamental because 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.739
 gives you the chance to keep 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.440
 faithfully the stamp and all the truths 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.720
 timbre characteristics of the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.040
 tool therefore without losing 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.230
 dynamic then retaining the attack 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.970
 typical of both the bucking pick up then 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.170
 as in this case it is in the case of 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.170
 single core pick up 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.530
 therefore caster from both frequencies more 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.020
 low or towards moving instead on 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.760
 acute the sound remains true to 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.930
 the one as the guitar was 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.660
 designed 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.390
 I advise everyone to use gods 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.550
 professional reference cables that 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.260
 with a minimum of spending in the true fold 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.239
 can really very little more 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.239
 compared to a common cable that is found 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.640
 in all stores however really stamp and 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.440
 the final sound the final result ne 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.440
 really buys so much in quality 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.600
 invalidated 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.600
 thank you 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.490
 Yes No
