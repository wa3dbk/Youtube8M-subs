00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
finished I don't know if it's showing up

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.950 
finished I don't know if it's showing up
in<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.299> light<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:11.000> there's<00:01:12.000> my<00:01:12.150> first<00:01:12.479> start

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
in this light but there's my first start

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.210 
in this light but there's my first start
to<00:01:13.140> finish<00:01:16.790> know<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> grain

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
to finish know if you can see the grain

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.740 
to finish know if you can see the grain
on<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.530> grain<00:01:22.740> turned<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.220> pretty<00:01:23.400> nice

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
on this the grain turned out pretty nice

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.450 
on this the grain turned out pretty nice
what<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> did<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.439> went<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.070> free<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
what I did is I went in with the free I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
what I did is I went in with the free I
think<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.060> free<00:01:27.330> rings<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> leather

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
think it's free rings like the leather

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.510 
think it's free rings like the leather
die<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.710> think<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.430> light<00:01:30.000> brown<00:01:31.520> comes

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
die I think this is light brown comes

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.179 
die I think this is light brown comes
out<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> nice<00:01:33.060> red<00:01:33.360> tone<00:01:33.920> but<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.100> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
out with a nice red tone but then I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.109 
out with a nice red tone but then I
stained<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> whole<00:01:35.790> thing<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:37.850> think<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.939> gave

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
stained the whole thing I think I gave

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.370 
stained the whole thing I think I gave
it<00:01:39.299> three<00:01:40.110> coats<00:01:41.180> lighting<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.299> after<00:01:43.259> each

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it three coats lighting it after each

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.929 
it three coats lighting it after each
one<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.390> then<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> sanded<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.259> down<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:47.310> 1500

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
one and then I sanded it down with 1500

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.020 
one and then I sanded it down with 1500
grit<00:01:48.030> sandpaper<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.460> way<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.729> gives<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
grit sandpaper so that way it gives a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.639 
grit sandpaper so that way it gives a
little<00:01:51.149> more<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.540> exposed<00:01:52.020> grain<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.500> there

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
little more that exposed grain in there

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.370 
little more that exposed grain in there
the<00:01:53.490> bowl<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.850> pretty<00:01:54.119> big<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.689> you

the bowl is pretty big on this one you
can<00:01:55.409> see<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:57.140> almost<00:01:58.140> an<00:01:58.290> inch<00:01:59.329> not

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
style I mean to me the bold looks a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.740 
style I mean to me the bold looks a
little<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> Dublin<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:35.820> I'm<00:02:36.209> not<00:02:36.450> sure

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
little like a Dublin but I'm not sure

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.930 
little like a Dublin but I'm not sure
but<00:02:37.530> then<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.740> got<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.310> long<00:02:38.490> stem

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
but then you got that really long stem

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.150 
but then you got that really long stem
on<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:41.370> that's<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.290> see<00:02:43.290> I'm<00:02:43.980> working

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
on it but that's it and see I'm working

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.970 
on it but that's it and see I'm working
on<00:02:44.490> my<00:02:45.090> second<00:02:45.600> kind<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.080> from<00:02:46.290> scratch<00:02:46.620> from<00:02:46.830> a

on my second kind of from scratch from a

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.370 
on my second kind of from scratch from a
block<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:48.440> got<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.890> top<00:02:50.100> turned<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.580> lathe

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
block I got the top turned on lathe

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.800 
block I got the top turned on lathe
of<00:02:52.650> course<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.010> know<00:02:53.130> drilled<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.209> tobacco

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
of course you know drilled the tobacco

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.740 
of course you know drilled the tobacco
chamber<00:02:55.380> got<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> air<00:02:56.430> hole<00:02:56.670> drilled<00:02:57.420> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
chamber got the air hole drilled and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.070 
chamber got the air hole drilled and
drilled<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> mortise<00:02:58.920> for<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.370> stem<00:03:00.080> so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
drilled in the mortise for the stem so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.160 
drilled in the mortise for the stem so
this<00:03:01.320> one's<00:03:01.620> still<00:03:01.830> real<00:03:02.190> work<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.490> progress

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170

another<00:03:04.170> one<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.100> got<00:03:05.550> touched<00:03:05.760> up

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
another one that I just got touched up

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.030 
another one that I just got touched up
was<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.810> was<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.050> poker<00:03:07.320> setter<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.739> did<00:03:08.010> a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
was this was a poker setter I did a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.520 
was this was a poker setter I did a
while<00:03:08.340> back<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.360> didn't<00:03:09.720> like<00:03:09.840> my<00:03:09.959> texture

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
while back but I didn't like my texture

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.070 
while back but I didn't like my texture
the<00:03:10.680> texture<00:03:10.980> was<00:03:11.220> more<00:03:11.459> just<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:12.090> took<00:03:12.870> a

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
the texture was more just I took a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.630 
the texture was more just I took a
dremel<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.709> was<00:03:13.800> more<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.160> holes<00:03:14.370> I

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
dremel and it was more just holes I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.770 
dremel and it was more just holes I
don't<00:03:14.790> want<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.970> give<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> little<00:03:15.300> more<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
don't want to give a little more of a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.850 
don't want to give a little more of a
texture<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:17.060> that's<00:03:18.060> coming<00:03:18.390> up<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.860> don't

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
texture so that's coming up I don't

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.830 
texture so that's coming up I don't
think<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.310> colors<00:03:21.000> really<00:03:21.180> showing<00:03:21.450> well<00:03:21.690> in

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
think the colors really showing well in

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.440 
think the colors really showing well in
this<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.580> that's<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.239> nice

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
this but that's that and it's it's nice

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.140 
this but that's that and it's it's nice
on<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.780> table<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.350> really<00:03:26.220> like<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.519> size<00:03:26.760> or

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
on the table I really like the size or

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.900 
on the table I really like the size or
the<00:03:27.209> style<00:03:27.600> here<00:03:27.900> oh<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:30.060> quick<00:03:30.480> tip<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:31.019> a

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
the style here oh and a quick tip on a

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.000 
the style here oh and a quick tip on a
real<00:03:32.910> low<00:03:33.060> budget<00:03:33.750> way<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.550> size<00:03:35.550> your<00:03:35.790> Tenon's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
real low budget way to size your Tenon's

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.509 
real low budget way to size your Tenon's
what<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.040> did<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:39.709> just<00:03:40.709> put<00:03:40.860> my<00:03:40.980> tenon<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:43.519> a

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
what I did I just put my tenon on a

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.789 
what I did I just put my tenon on a
dremel<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.959> actually<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.470> don't<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
dremel and actually I don't have the

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.190 
dremel and actually I don't have the
power<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.519> just<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:48.000> kind<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.600> drilled<00:03:49.019> it

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
power on but I just I kind of drilled it

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.340 
power on but I just I kind of drilled it
in<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.620> was<00:03:49.769> really<00:03:50.070> snug<00:03:50.780> then<00:03:51.780> at<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.080> lower

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
in so it was really snug then at a lower

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.440 
in so it was really snug then at a lower
setting<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:53.040> think<00:03:53.070> at<00:03:53.519> about<00:03:53.549> ten<00:03:54.120> thousand

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
setting I think at about ten thousand

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.050 
setting I think at about ten thousand
rpms<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.989> got<00:03:55.140> it<00:03:55.260> spinning<00:03:55.650> push<00:03:56.549> this<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.910> my

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
rpms I got it spinning push this on my

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.560 
rpms I got it spinning push this on my
leg<00:03:57.299> then<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.930> took<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.140> file<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.970> just<00:04:00.030> took<00:04:00.330> the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
leg then I took a file and just took the

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.300 
leg then I took a file and just took the
file<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.200> kept<00:04:01.410> filing<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:01.950> down<00:04:02.100> because

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
file and I kept filing it down because

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.280 
file and I kept filing it down because
these<00:04:02.580> don't<00:04:02.880> come<00:04:03.150> precise<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.110> to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
these don't come precise you have to

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.590 
these don't come precise you have to
size<00:04:04.830> these<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:07.019> then<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.350> just<00:04:08.239> kept<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.330> file

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
size these so then I just kept the file

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.089 
size these so then I just kept the file
keeping<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.290> 90-degree<00:04:11.160> edge

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
keeping that 90-degree edge

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.160 
keeping that 90-degree edge
right<00:04:12.819> here<00:04:13.000> where<00:04:13.150> it<00:04:13.239> butts<00:04:13.450> up<00:04:13.629> against<00:04:14.079> the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
right here where it butts up against the

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.909 
right here where it butts up against the
the<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:15.610> Brier<00:04:16.259> and<00:04:17.259> I<00:04:17.350> just<00:04:17.590> kept<00:04:17.799> grinding

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
the the Brier and I just kept grinding

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.770 
the the Brier and I just kept grinding
it<00:04:18.160> down<00:04:18.190> with<00:04:18.519> a<00:04:18.549> file<00:04:19.060> then<00:04:19.449> I<00:04:19.479> took<00:04:19.600> some

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
it down with a file then I took some

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.050 
it down with a file then I took some
1500<00:04:20.530> grit<00:04:20.620> sandpaper<00:04:20.889> when<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.489> was<00:04:21.639> really

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
1500 grit sandpaper when it was really

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.590 
1500 grit sandpaper when it was really
close

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
close

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.810 
close
wrap<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.259> 59<00:04:23.680> grit<00:04:23.830> sandpaper<00:04:24.070> around<00:04:24.729> the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
wrap the 59 grit sandpaper around the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.510 
wrap the 59 grit sandpaper around the
file<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.530> then<00:04:26.530> polish<00:04:26.949> it<00:04:27.100> off<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:30.370> can

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
file and then polish it off and you can

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.050 
file and then polish it off and you can
see<00:04:30.550> now<00:04:30.970> that<00:04:31.889> it's<00:04:32.889> a<00:04:33.039> really<00:04:33.550> nice<00:04:33.729> tight
