gameplay<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.530> jumped<00:01:13.799> online<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.250> collect

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.920 
gameplay but I jumped online to collect
some<00:01:14.640> clips<00:01:14.939> yesterday<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.840> was

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
some clips yesterday and I was

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.899 
some clips yesterday and I was
immediately<00:01:16.439> reminded<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
immediately reminded about all the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.120 
immediately reminded about all the
things<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.270> hated<00:01:18.450> about<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.930> game<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> we're

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
things I hated about that game and we're

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
things I hated about that game and we're
not<00:01:20.250> talking<00:01:20.549> about<00:01:20.729> ghosts<00:01:21.000> or<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> second

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
not talking about ghosts or a second

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.719 
not talking about ghosts or a second
chance<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.619> whole<00:01:22.799> lag<00:01:23.100> issue<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
chance this is the whole lag issue that

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.570 
chance this is the whole lag issue that
played<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.509> game<00:01:24.770> after<00:01:25.770> three<00:01:25.950> games<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
played that game after three games in I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.280 
played that game after three games in I
was<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.450> had<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> turn<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.170> off

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
was just I just had to turn it off

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.980 
was just I just had to turn it off
because<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.280> virtually<00:01:29.700> unplayable

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
because it was virtually unplayable

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.390 
because it was virtually unplayable
almost<00:01:30.990> every<00:01:31.350> time<00:01:31.590> someone<00:01:31.979> run<00:01:32.159> through<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
almost every time someone run through a

I'd be insta killed when trying to open
fire<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.600> killcam<00:01:36.960> would<00:01:37.110> show

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
fire and then the killcam would show

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.569 
fire and then the killcam would show

infinity games infinity war games even

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.290 
infinity games infinity war games even
so<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.980> shame<00:02:15.160> really<00:02:15.370> because<00:02:15.520> modern

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
so it's a shame really because modern

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.060 
so it's a shame really because modern
warfare<00:02:16.540> 2<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:16.900> modern<00:02:17.290> warfare<00:02:17.380> 3<00:02:17.620> play

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
warfare 2 and modern warfare 3 play

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.400 
warfare 2 and modern warfare 3 play
better<00:02:18.340> where<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.240> shot<00:02:19.450> such<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.690> lund<00:02:20.080> hits

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
better where you shot such a lund hits

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.100 
better where you shot such a lund hits
but<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.250> those<00:02:21.430> games<00:02:21.760> by<00:02:22.420> Infinity<00:02:22.930> Ward

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
but it's those games by Infinity Ward

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.450 
but it's those games by Infinity Ward
these<00:02:23.320> modern<00:02:23.620> warfare<00:02:23.770> games<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.400> are

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
these modern warfare games that are

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.310 
these modern warfare games that are
always<00:02:24.640> full<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:24.850> bullcrap<00:02:25.300> whereas<00:02:26.170> black

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
always full of bullcrap whereas black

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.740 
always full of bullcrap whereas black
ops<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> well-designed<00:02:27.310> game<00:02:27.850> but<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.570> just

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
ops is a well-designed game but it just

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.270 
ops is a well-designed game but it just
doesn't<00:02:28.930> play<00:02:29.200> as<00:02:29.350> well<00:02:29.590> because<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.070> all<00:02:30.160> this

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
doesn't play as well because of all this

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.300 
doesn't play as well because of all this
certain<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.880> /<00:02:31.300> hit<00:02:31.540> detection<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.830> this

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
certain like / hit detection so this

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.770 
certain like / hit detection so this
kind<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.580> put<00:02:33.730> her<00:02:33.790> down<00:02:33.940> around<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.360> series

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
kind of put her down around this series

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.750 
kind of put her down around this series
idea<00:02:35.140> because<00:02:35.410> even<00:02:35.650> if<00:02:35.770> black<00:02:35.980> ops<00:02:36.160> 2<00:02:36.370> has<00:02:36.610> all

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
idea because even if black ops 2 has all

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.610 
idea because even if black ops 2 has all
these<00:02:36.850> great<00:02:37.090> features<00:02:37.330> it's<00:02:38.230> still<00:02:38.470> gonna

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
these great features it's still gonna

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.950 
these great features it's still gonna
end<00:02:38.710> up<00:02:38.920> playing<00:02:39.190> like<00:02:39.520> black<00:02:39.850> ops<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.840> not

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
end up playing like black ops it's not

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.450 
end up playing like black ops it's not
gonna<00:02:41.080> have<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.230> fine<00:02:41.590> tuning<00:02:41.980> that

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
gonna have that fine tuning that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.560 
gonna have that fine tuning that
Infinity<00:02:43.270> Ward<00:02:43.480> games<00:02:43.750> seem<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:46.240> that

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
Infinity Ward games seem to have so that

Infinity Ward games seem to have so that
kind<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.840> got<00:02:46.930> me<00:02:47.020> think<00:02:47.230> thinking<00:02:47.800> about<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
kind of got me think thinking about the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.170 
kind of got me think thinking about the
future<00:02:48.550> of<00:02:48.760> call<00:02:49.090> duty<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:50.310> because<00:02:51.310> no

future of call duty and because no

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.090 
future of call duty and because no
future<00:02:52.600> title<00:02:53.020> is<00:02:53.110> ever<00:02:53.260> gonna<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.650> like<00:02:53.800> Call
