00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
but huh this is the different crafting

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.439 
but huh this is the different crafting
tables<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> original<00:01:03.120> one

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
tables as you can see the original one

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.260 
tables as you can see the original one
is<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.400> maple<00:01:05.400> one<00:01:05.549> looks<00:01:05.760> sort<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
is here and the maple one looks sort of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.149 
is here and the maple one looks sort of
similar<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.409> little<00:01:07.799> bit<00:01:07.890> different

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
similar to it but a little bit different

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
similar to it but a little bit different
and<00:01:08.250> also<00:01:08.520> he<00:01:08.790> cleaned<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> work<00:01:10.020> benches

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and also he cleaned up the work benches

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.410 
and also he cleaned up the work benches
so<00:01:10.560> they<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.740> look<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:11.790> nicer<00:01:12.060> than

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
so they do look a little bit nicer than

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.630 
so they do look a little bit nicer than
they<00:01:12.570> originally<00:01:12.900> did<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.430> noticed

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
they originally did which I noticed

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.590 
they originally did which I noticed
right<00:01:14.880> away<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:16.220> but<00:01:17.220> anyways<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.420> you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
right away and but anyways I I know you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.969 
right away and but anyways I I know you
guys<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> check<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> silver

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
guys want to check out what the silver

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.260 
guys want to check out what the silver
Belle<00:01:20.159> tree<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> maple<00:01:20.790> tree<00:01:20.820> looks<00:01:21.119> like

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
Belle tree and the maple tree looks like

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.749 
Belle tree and the maple tree looks like
so<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.140> silver<00:01:22.409> Belle<00:01:22.590> tree<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.159> sort<00:01:23.610> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
so the silver Belle tree is a sort of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.730 
so the silver Belle tree is a sort of
rare<00:01:24.060> tree<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.450> believe<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.110> he<00:01:25.229> fixed<00:01:25.650> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
rare tree I believe I think he fixed it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.859 
rare tree I believe I think he fixed it
so<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:27.479> world<00:01:27.720> was

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so there is a lot more this world was

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.450 
so there is a lot more this world was
generated<00:01:28.350> before<00:01:28.619> there's<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.860> fix<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.400> that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
generated before there's a fix for that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.800 
generated before there's a fix for that
but<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.790> sure<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.299> there's<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> lot<00:01:30.780> more

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
but I'm sure that there's a lot more

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.420 
but I'm sure that there's a lot more
generated<00:01:31.409> because<00:01:31.470> he<00:01:31.680> said<00:01:31.860> he<00:01:31.979> did<00:01:32.159> fix

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
generated because he said he did fix

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.640 
generated because he said he did fix
that<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.720> got<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.869> maple<00:01:34.259> trees<00:01:34.470> here

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that and we got the maple trees here

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.020 
that and we got the maple trees here
which<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.920> generating<00:01:35.430> all<00:01:35.579> over<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> place

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
which are generating all over the place

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.310 
which are generating all over the place
as<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.659> they're<00:01:36.900> pretty<00:01:37.259> much

not<00:02:01.740> sure<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:01.920> they're<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.280> changed

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
not sure if they're going to be changed

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.700

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.059 
because i believe he just did change the
leaf<00:02:05.009> texture<00:02:06.049> but<00:02:07.049> yeah<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.039> I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
leaf texture but yeah and then we have I

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.650 
leaf texture but yeah and then we have I
just<00:02:08.520> put<00:02:08.879> another<00:02:09.119> pretty<00:02:09.479> much

wood<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.190> that<00:04:28.220> since<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.910> is<00:04:29.060> fairly<00:04:29.510> rare

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
wood on that since it is fairly rare

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.940 
wood on that since it is fairly rare
spawning<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:31.480> pretty<00:04:32.480> awesome<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.500> as<00:04:33.890> you

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
spawning and pretty awesome so as you

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.830 
spawning and pretty awesome so as you
can<00:04:34.070> see<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.400> does<00:04:34.700> go<00:04:34.880> really<00:04:35.150> fast<00:04:35.450> and

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
can see it does go really fast and

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.100 
can see it does go really fast and
really<00:04:36.110> good<00:04:36.620> for<00:04:37.060> for<00:04:38.060> that<00:04:38.540> kind<00:04:38.780> of<00:04:38.810> acts

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
really good for for that kind of acts

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.840 
really good for for that kind of acts
that<00:04:39.290> can<00:04:39.560> be<00:04:39.680> found<00:04:39.830> by<00:04:40.040> a<00:04:40.160> tree<00:04:40.460> which<00:04:40.700> is

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
that can be found by a tree which is

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.420 
that can be found by a tree which is
sort<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.120> rare<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.480> also<00:04:42.380> what<00:04:42.710> what's<00:04:43.220> go

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
sort of rare and also what what's go

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.060 
sort of rare and also what what's go
keep<00:04:43.610> did<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:44.180> make<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.510> perfectly<00:04:45.440> balanced

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
keep did to make it perfectly balanced

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.250 
keep did to make it perfectly balanced
is<00:04:46.280> uh<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:47.090> you<00:04:47.150> don't<00:04:47.300> just<00:04:47.480> keep<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:48.080> can

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
is uh so you don't just keep you can

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.130 
is uh so you don't just keep you can
getting<00:04:48.530> trees<00:04:48.800> is<00:04:49.010> like<00:04:49.820> I'm<00:04:50.600> not<00:04:50.780> sure<00:04:50.990> the

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
getting trees is like I'm not sure the

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.140 
getting trees is like I'm not sure the
exact<00:04:51.440> ratio<00:04:51.740> now<00:04:52.070> I<00:04:52.100> believe<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.640> changed<00:04:53.000> it

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
exact ratio now I believe you changed it

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.390 
exact ratio now I believe you changed it
but<00:04:53.300> in<00:04:53.570> most<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.500> time<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.890> tree<00:04:55.250> will

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
but in most of the time the tree will

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.570 
but in most of the time the tree will
explode<00:04:56.150> when<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.750> try<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.310> when<00:04:58.310> you<00:04:58.400> try

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
explode when you try and when you try

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.830 
explode when you try and when you try
and<00:04:58.640> grow<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:58.910> as<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.210> can<00:04:59.300> see<00:04:59.450> it<00:04:59.540> grew<00:04:59.690> there

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
and grow it as you can see it grew there

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.300 
and grow it as you can see it grew there
and<00:05:00.050> yeah<00:05:00.170> it<00:05:00.350> is<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.500> little<00:05:00.710> bit<00:05:00.890> glitch<00:05:01.100> the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
and yeah it is a little bit glitch the

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.830 
and yeah it is a little bit glitch the
leaves<00:05:01.520> just<00:05:01.820> because<00:05:02.090> it's<00:05:02.270> touching<00:05:02.570> the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
leaves just because it's touching the

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.930 
leaves just because it's touching the
blocks<00:05:03.110> here<00:05:03.380> so<00:05:04.010> I'm<00:05:04.070> sure<00:05:04.250> that'll<00:05:04.430> be<00:05:04.520> fixed

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
blocks here so I'm sure that'll be fixed

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.340 
blocks here so I'm sure that'll be fixed
but<00:05:05.600> yeah<00:05:05.750> it's<00:05:05.930> just<00:05:06.080> because<00:05:06.230> they're

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
but yeah it's just because they're

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.080 
but yeah it's just because they're
touching<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.920> blocks<00:05:07.190> if<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.820> wasn't

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
touching the blocks if it wasn't

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.250 
touching the blocks if it wasn't
touching<00:05:08.240> then<00:05:08.450> you<00:05:08.540> won't<00:05:08.720> be<00:05:08.810> able<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:09.110> see

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
touching then you won't be able to see

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.820 
touching then you won't be able to see
through<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.560> ground<00:05:09.830> but<00:05:10.610> yeah<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:11.830> yeah

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
through the ground but yeah and yeah

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.740 
through the ground but yeah and yeah
it's<00:05:12.950> actually<00:05:13.280> really<00:05:13.460> really<00:05:14.180> hard<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.450> grow

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
it's actually really really hard to grow

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.590 
it's actually really really hard to grow
the<00:05:15.380> trees<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:16.460> that's<00:05:16.910> that's<00:05:17.270> something

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
the trees so that's that's something

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.870 
the trees so that's that's something
nice<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.020> that<00:05:18.140> you<00:05:18.200> don't<00:05:18.350> just<00:05:18.700> pretty<00:05:19.700> much

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
nice so that you don't just pretty much

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.210 
nice so that you don't just pretty much
just<00:05:20.750> spam<00:05:21.110> them<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:21.530> keep<00:05:21.740> getting<00:05:22.010> tools

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
just spam them and keep getting tools

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.560 
just spam them and keep getting tools
like<00:05:22.520> that<00:05:22.700> you<00:05:22.880> don't<00:05:22.910> even<00:05:23.090> have<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.300> mine

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
like that you don't even have to mine

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.060 
like that you don't even have to mine
and<00:05:23.870> stuff<00:05:24.080> like<00:05:24.140> that<00:05:24.200> so<00:05:24.440> that's<00:05:24.560> really

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
and stuff like that so that's really

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.490 
and stuff like that so that's really
cool<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.570> last<00:05:26.570> thing<00:05:26.690> i<00:05:26.780> want<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:26.990> say<00:05:27.080> was

cool and last thing i want to say was
there's<00:05:28.370> also<00:05:29.120> some<00:05:29.570> unobtainable<00:05:30.080> items<00:05:30.620> at

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
there's also some unobtainable items at

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.020 
there's also some unobtainable items at
the<00:05:30.860> moment<00:05:31.250> which<00:05:31.400> you<00:05:31.490> can<00:05:31.610> get<00:05:31.730> through<00:05:31.880> too

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
the moment which you can get through too

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.520 
the moment which you can get through too
many<00:05:32.120> items<00:05:32.420> i<00:05:32.840> just<00:05:33.140> thought<00:05:33.290> i<00:05:33.320> would

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
many items i just thought i would

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.990 
many items i just thought i would
mention<00:05:33.560> that<00:05:33.920> in<00:05:34.040> case<00:05:34.220> you<00:05:34.340> guys<00:05:34.460> wanted<00:05:34.880> it

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
mention that in case you guys wanted it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.610 
mention that in case you guys wanted it
for<00:05:35.180> those<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.480> you<00:05:35.600> who<00:05:35.750> use<00:05:36.080> to<00:05:36.260> me<00:05:36.350> items

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
for those of you who use to me items

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.420 
for those of you who use to me items
it's<00:05:37.550> pretty<00:05:37.730> basically<00:05:38.270> half<00:05:38.540> doors<00:05:38.870> and

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
it's pretty basically half doors and

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.190 
it's pretty basically half doors and
yeah<00:05:40.430> so<00:05:41.360> there's<00:05:41.600> half<00:05:41.810> doors<00:05:42.050> for

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
yeah so there's half doors for

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.480 
yeah so there's half doors for
everything<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.650> cannot<00:05:42.860> be<00:05:42.920> placed<00:05:43.280> beside

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
everything that cannot be placed beside

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.760 
everything that cannot be placed beside
each<00:05:43.700> other<00:05:43.910> forgot<00:05:44.330> about<00:05:44.510> that<00:05:44.570> and<00:05:45.050> they

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
each other forgot about that and they

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.140 
each other forgot about that and they
turn<00:05:46.010> it<00:05:46.160> to<00:05:46.250> full<00:05:46.430> doors<00:05:46.670> once<00:05:46.970> they're

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
turn it to full doors once they're

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.580 
turn it to full doors once they're
broken<00:05:47.390> so<00:05:47.870> something<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.980> keep<00:05:49.940> in<00:05:50.090> mind<00:05:50.590> so

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
broken so something to keep in mind so

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.530 
broken so something to keep in mind so
really<00:05:51.800> really<00:05:52.220> cool<00:05:52.520> actually<00:05:52.700> would<00:05:53.450> be

really really cool actually would be
nice<00:05:53.690> some<00:05:54.200> gates<00:05:54.440> would<00:05:54.800> be<00:05:54.950> really<00:05:55.190> cool<00:05:55.430> I

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670
