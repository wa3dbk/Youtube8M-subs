 sertanejo รณ alec fan looks at these 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.429
 dates prove that he was not a fan of sertanejo 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.090
 and gospel funk and there is not only this song 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:05.270
 My mother passed sugar on me. 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.800
 first funk observes normal date 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:17.420
 Mom passed sugar on me and now it's the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:20.239
 back countryman and then what do you think? 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.820
 I tried harder to have raul and it's serious 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.930
 This marriage I will not do this I 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.200
 refusal 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.110
 So you want women and money to 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.420
 more and more, nothing, let's go now, just let's go 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.269
 have to think a lot because nowadays 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.030
 Copy the funk is difficult on that pantip 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.950
 radio singing there already know now has 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.790
 that funk reduction can copy 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.310
 There is only mc biel at that funk. 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.200
 seduction was the one who invented it and 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.790
 he got used to gaining fame but it gives 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.340
 To try because you have that song of 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.980
 Pepper there's something you can 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.260
 trust her to know that she is kind of mean 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.920
 who unlike mother passed sugar 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.829
 on me then it was already know that 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.680
 even spicy in now is that I will 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.690
 be rich have women and yes i 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.120
 I always believe that it will worsen 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.299
 songs such as Brazil worse 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.840
 music more people like opa will 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.060
 that we were first and then silvio 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.709

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.900
 Do you think I love you from Brazil? 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.660
 live are never never much season 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.430
 though it was pulled by Greek music on the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.210
 I start to give a charm, because everything 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.310
 world knows 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.070
 also have to leave because it was copied 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:42.050
 gringa do not blame the funk is there and there 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:53.500

00:03:42.050 --> 00:04:04.180
