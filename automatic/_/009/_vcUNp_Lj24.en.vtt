all kinds of different attacks any each
one<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> those<00:00:34.110> attacks<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:35.149> modeled<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.329> its

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
one of those attacks is modeled with its

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.049

own damage modifiers like sort of that
power<00:00:39.780> swing<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.410> she<00:00:40.559> does<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:40.920> there

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
power swing that she does right there

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.280 
power swing that she does right there
will<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.059> more<00:00:42.270> damage<00:00:42.480> than<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.870> simple

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
will do more damage than that simple

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.860 
will do more damage than that simple
four<00:00:43.469> hand<00:00:43.649> strike<00:00:44.239> all<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.480> different

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
four hand strike all the different

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.380

abilities have different cooldowns and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.520 
abilities have different cooldowns and
so<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.230> flexible<00:00:49.850> cool<00:00:50.850> system

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
so it's a really flexible cool system

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
so it's a really flexible cool system
that'll<00:00:52.530> let<00:00:52.680> us<00:00:52.800> model<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.520> lot<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.969> different

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
