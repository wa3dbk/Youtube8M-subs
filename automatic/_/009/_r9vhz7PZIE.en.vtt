00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay so at this point we have a game

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.340 
okay so at this point we have a game
that<00:00:03.510> works<00:00:03.720> we're<00:00:04.589> able<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:05.660> put<00:00:06.660> X's<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.200> O's

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
that works we're able to put X's and O's

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.990 
that works we're able to put X's and O's
we're<00:00:07.740> able<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.099> determine<00:00:08.519> when<00:00:08.639> somebody

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
we're able to determine when somebody

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.299 
we're able to determine when somebody
wins<00:00:09.240> but<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.380> still<00:00:10.620> move<00:00:10.800> after<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
wins but we can still move after the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.799 
wins but we can still move after the
game<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.670> over<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:12.059> know<00:00:12.269> if<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.480> go<00:00:12.599> ahead<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
game is over you know if I go ahead and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.519 
game is over you know if I go ahead and
make<00:00:12.929> X<00:00:13.590> win<00:00:13.920> here<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:15.000> still<00:00:15.240> move<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.960> you

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
make X win here I can still move and you

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.140 
make X win here I can still move and you
know<00:00:16.560> there's<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.949> couple<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.369> other<00:00:17.520> issues<00:00:17.760> to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
know there's a couple of other issues to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.929 
know there's a couple of other issues to
it<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.470> doesn't<00:00:19.770> seem<00:00:19.920> fair<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.160> X<00:00:20.520> gets<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
it it doesn't seem fair that X gets to

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.490 
it it doesn't seem fair that X gets to
go<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.270> all<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> time<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.230> should<00:00:22.260> do

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
go first all the time so we should do

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.429 
go first all the time so we should do
something<00:00:22.890> about<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.160> as<00:00:23.519> well<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.630> let's

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
something about that as well so let's

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.400 
something about that as well so let's
start<00:00:25.980> off<00:00:26.130> by<00:00:26.210> preventing<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.410> preventing

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
start off by preventing the preventing

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.849 
start off by preventing the preventing
the<00:00:29.420> moves<00:00:30.420> after<00:00:30.960> somebody<00:00:31.320> has<00:00:31.410> already<00:00:31.529> won

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the moves after somebody has already won

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.240 
the moves after somebody has already won
the<00:00:32.070> game<00:00:32.719> we'll<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:33.840> ahead<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.440> create

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the game we'll go ahead and create

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.860 
the game we'll go ahead and create
another<00:00:35.460> variable<00:00:35.940> let's<00:00:36.540> call<00:00:36.600> this

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
another variable let's call this

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.100 
another variable let's call this
variable<00:00:38.570> document<00:00:40.399> top<00:00:41.399> laner<00:00:41.809> well<00:00:42.809> set<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
variable document top laner well set it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.639 
variable document top laner well set it
equal<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.469> null<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.989> document<00:00:45.989> dot<00:00:46.140> winner<00:00:46.350> is

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
equal to null and document dot winner is

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.170 
equal to null and document dot winner is
going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> variable<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.910> we're<00:00:48.059> going

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to be a variable that we're going

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.700 
going to be a variable that we're going
to<00:00:48.360> use<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.690> determine<00:00:48.840> who's<00:00:49.260> won<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> game

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to use to determine who's won the game

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.580 
to use to determine who's won the game
null<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.210> value<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.750> means<00:00:51.930> there's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
null is just a value that means there's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
null is just a value that means there's
nothing<00:00:53.100> nothing<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> there<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.660> an

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
nothing nothing is there it's not an

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.470 
nothing nothing is there it's not an
empty<00:00:55.260> value<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.250> nothing<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.210> never

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
empty value it's just nothing it's never

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.920 
empty value it's just nothing it's never
been<00:00:57.690> defined<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:59.100> we'll<00:00:59.940> use<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.210> variable

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
been defined and we'll use that variable

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.689 
been defined and we'll use that variable
we<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> true/false

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
we can use that just like a true/false

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.609 
we can use that just like a true/false
down<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:04.040> we<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.640> our<00:01:06.150> next<00:01:06.450> move<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
down here we can in our next move you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.530 
down here we can in our next move you
know<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.130> check<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.670> square<00:01:09.180> entered

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
know we can check if square entered

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.420 
know we can check if square entered
before<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.320> even<00:01:10.500> check<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> squares

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
before we even check if the squares

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.320 
before we even check if the squares
inner<00:01:11.760> text<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.299> empty<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.320> say<00:01:13.710> if

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
inner text is empty we can say if

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.020 
inner text is empty we can say if
document<00:01:15.330> dot<00:01:15.780> winner<00:01:16.880> equals<00:01:17.880> null<00:01:20.030> let's

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
document dot winner equals null let's

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.390 
document dot winner equals null let's
set<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> message<00:01:22.640> we'll<00:01:23.640> say<00:01:23.909> document<00:01:24.540> winner

to see you know who's the winner so when
we<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> winner<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:08.039> our<00:02:08.220> switch<00:02:08.459> turn

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
we have a winner in our switch turn

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.660 
we have a winner in our switch turn
we'll<00:02:10.259> go<00:02:10.379> ahead<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.679> set<00:02:10.950> document<00:02:11.489> dot

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
we'll go ahead and set document dot

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.840 
we'll go ahead and set document dot
winner

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
winner

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.800 
winner
mentuk<00:02:13.300> turn<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.760> now<00:02:15.970> we<00:02:16.030> can<00:02:16.450> say<00:02:16.630> alright

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
mentuk turn so now we can say alright

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.500 
mentuk turn so now we can say alright
we're<00:02:17.680> gonna<00:02:17.770> tell<00:02:18.340> whoever<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:19.000> whoever

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
we're gonna tell whoever this whoever

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.060 
we're gonna tell whoever this whoever
just<00:02:19.720> won<00:02:19.780> we're<00:02:20.260> gonna<00:02:20.380> set<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.770> as<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
just won we're gonna set that as the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.810 
just won we're gonna set that as the
winner<00:02:21.250> if<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.060> hit<00:02:22.240> refresh<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:24.250> get<00:02:24.400> X<00:02:24.640> to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
winner if I hit refresh and I get X to

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.470 
winner if I hit refresh and I get X to
win<00:02:24.970> here<00:02:25.680> then<00:02:26.680> X<00:02:27.490> already<00:02:27.730> won<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> game<00:02:28.240> we

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
win here then X already won the game we

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.080 
win here then X already won the game we
can't<00:02:28.720> make<00:02:28.900> any<00:02:29.080> more<00:02:29.350> moves<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.700> that's<00:02:30.850> good

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
can't make any more moves so that's good

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.990 
can't make any more moves so that's good
that<00:02:31.330> seems<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.930> lot<00:02:32.110> more<00:02:32.140> reasonable<00:02:32.620> but<00:02:33.610> you

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
that seems a lot more reasonable but you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.280 
that seems a lot more reasonable but you
know<00:02:34.090> we<00:02:34.180> still<00:02:34.300> have<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.570> problem<00:02:34.960> that<00:02:35.080> X

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
know we still have this problem that X

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.720 
know we still have this problem that X
always<00:02:35.650> gets<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.980> go<00:02:36.100> first

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
always gets to go first

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.820 
always gets to go first
so<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.390> our<00:02:37.600> start<00:02:38.020> game<00:02:38.230> we're<00:02:38.500> gonna<00:02:38.590> do

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
so in our start game we're gonna do

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.260 
so in our start game we're gonna do
something<00:02:39.100> here<00:02:39.670> we're<00:02:39.820> gonna<00:02:39.910> introduce

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
something here we're gonna introduce

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.740 
something here we're gonna introduce
some<00:02:40.690> randomness<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:42.520> let's<00:02:43.000> go<00:02:43.150> ahead<00:02:43.450> and

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
some randomness so let's go ahead and

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.770 
some randomness so let's go ahead and
say<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.620> we're<00:02:45.580> going<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.850> call<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> function

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
say if we're going to call a function

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.780 
say if we're going to call a function
here<00:02:46.960> that's<00:02:47.200> built<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:47.710> and<00:02:48.130> it's<00:02:48.580> called

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
here that's built in and it's called

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.080 
here that's built in and it's called
math<00:02:49.060> dot<00:02:49.390> random<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:50.220> math<00:02:51.220> dot<00:02:51.520> random<00:02:51.550> will

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
math dot random and math dot random will

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.720 
math dot random and math dot random will
give<00:02:52.240> me<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.630> number<00:02:52.960> that<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.590> between<00:02:53.920> 0<00:02:54.370> &amp;<00:02:54.700> 1

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
give me a number that is between 0 &amp; 1

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.670 
give me a number that is between 0 &amp; 1
you<00:02:55.240> know<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.720> could<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:55.870> zero<00:02:56.140> point<00:02:56.410> one

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
you know so it could be zero point one

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.410 
you know so it could be zero point one
could<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.370> zero<00:02:57.580> point<00:02:57.790> two<00:02:57.970> three<00:02:58.150> five<00:02:58.390> six

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
could be zero point two three five six

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.480 
could be zero point two three five six
seven<00:02:58.960> eight<00:02:59.080> four<00:02:59.290> one<00:02:59.530> two<00:02:59.770> it<00:03:00.250> could<00:03:00.340> be<00:03:00.460> a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
seven eight four one two it could be a

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.550 
seven eight four one two it could be a
lot<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.790> different<00:03:01.180> numbers<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:01.570> between<00:03:01.810> 0<00:03:02.350> &amp;

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
lot of different numbers in between 0 &amp;

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.950 
lot of different numbers in between 0 &amp;
1<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:03.010> if<00:03:03.640> we<00:03:03.700> want<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.090> make<00:03:04.210> sure<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.720> Oh

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
1 and if we want to make sure that Oh

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.960 
1 and if we want to make sure that Oh
gets<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.710> go<00:03:05.830> half<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:06.250> its<00:03:06.370> up<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:06.610> go<00:03:06.670> first

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
gets to go half of its up and go first

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.940 
gets to go half of its up and go first
half<00:03:07.240> of<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.420> time<00:03:07.660> I'm<00:03:08.200> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.710> go<00:03:08.830> ahead

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
half of the time I'm going to go ahead

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.340 
half of the time I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:09.370> say<00:03:09.610> if<00:03:09.910> nap<00:03:10.180> thought<00:03:10.450> random<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.080> less

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
and say if nap thought random is less

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.310 
and say if nap thought random is less
than<00:03:11.590> 0.5<00:03:12.220> because<00:03:12.760> half<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.990> random

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
than 0.5 because half of the random

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.710 
than 0.5 because half of the random
numbers<00:03:14.620> between<00:03:14.650> 0<00:03:15.220> &amp;<00:03:15.370> 1<00:03:15.430> are<00:03:15.550> gonna<00:03:15.730> be<00:03:15.970> less

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
numbers between 0 &amp; 1 are gonna be less

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.660 
numbers between 0 &amp; 1 are gonna be less
than<00:03:16.960> half<00:03:17.140> of<00:03:17.290> 0.5<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:18.130> half<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.430> them<00:03:18.580> are

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
than half of 0.5 and half of them are

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.970 
than half of 0.5 and half of them are
gonna<00:03:18.760> be<00:03:18.910> greater<00:03:19.120> than<00:03:19.330> 0.5<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.620> we're<00:03:20.800> going

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
gonna be greater than 0.5 so we're going

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.910 
gonna be greater than 0.5 so we're going
to<00:03:21.100> go<00:03:21.280> ahead<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.820> set<00:03:22.120> document<00:03:22.690> turn<00:03:23.230> equal

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
to go ahead and set document turn equal

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.860 
to go ahead and set document turn equal
to<00:03:24.130> oh<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.470> now<00:03:27.040> we<00:03:27.100> if<00:03:27.880> we<00:03:28.150> refresh<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.690> page

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
to oh so now we if we refresh the page

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:39.870 
to oh so now we if we refresh the page
we<00:03:29.050> see<00:03:29.350> Ogas<00:03:29.710> to<00:03:29.890> start<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:39.010> can<00:03:39.160> see<00:03:39.340> X<00:03:39.610> gets

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
we see Ogas to start you can see X gets

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.410 
we see Ogas to start you can see X gets
to<00:03:40.060> start<00:03:41.250> if<00:03:42.250> we<00:03:42.310> keep<00:03:42.580> refreshing<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.210> page

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.850 

it's<00:03:49.420> not<00:03:49.510> gonna<00:03:49.660> always<00:03:49.990> be<00:03:50.200> one<00:03:50.590> or<00:03:50.740> the

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
it's not gonna always be one or the

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.350 
it's not gonna always be one or the
other<00:03:50.890> it's<00:03:51.280> not<00:03:51.430> gonna<00:03:51.550> go<00:03:51.730> back<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.120> forth

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
other it's not gonna go back and forth

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.900 
other it's not gonna go back and forth
you<00:03:53.320> know<00:03:53.440> if<00:03:53.560> we<00:03:53.710> refresh<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.220> page<00:03:54.370> 100

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
you know if we refresh the page 100

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.520 
you know if we refresh the page 100
times<00:03:55.120> it's<00:03:55.450> probably<00:03:55.720> gonna<00:03:55.810> be<00:03:55.900> about<00:03:56.140> 50

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
times it's probably gonna be about 50

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.830 
times it's probably gonna be about 50
times<00:03:56.710> X<00:03:57.040> goes<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.310> or<00:03:57.820> X<00:03:58.210> gets<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.540> go<00:03:58.660> first

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
times X goes to or X gets to go first

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.650 
times X goes to or X gets to go first
and<00:03:59.080> 50<00:03:59.680> times<00:03:59.890> o<00:04:00.130> gets<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.490> go<00:04:00.610> first<00:04:00.820> so

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
and 50 times o gets to go first so

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.110 
and 50 times o gets to go first so
there'd<00:04:02.500> be<00:04:02.560> one<00:04:02.920> more<00:04:03.160> nice<00:04:03.430> thing<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:03.970> that

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
there'd be one more nice thing and that

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.640 
there'd be one more nice thing and that
would<00:04:04.210> be<00:04:04.420> what<00:04:04.810> if<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.050> could<00:04:05.230> just<00:04:05.410> keep

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
would be what if I could just keep

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.230 
would be what if I could just keep
playing<00:04:06.010> without<00:04:06.580> having<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:06.940> hit<00:04:07.090> that

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
playing without having to hit that

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.150 
playing without having to hit that
refresh<00:04:07.630> button<00:04:08.080> over<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.650> over<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.070> over

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
refresh button over and over and over

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.300 
refresh button over and over and over
again<00:04:09.400> be<00:04:09.970> kind<00:04:10.210> of<00:04:10.300> nice<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.920> let's<00:04:12.100> go<00:04:12.220> ahead

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
again be kind of nice so let's go ahead

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.160

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
to do in order to to refresh the game is

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.640 
to do in order to to refresh the game is
we're<00:04:19.570> gonna<00:04:19.690> have<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:19.989> clear<00:04:20.200> out<00:04:20.350> all<00:04:20.380> the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.530 
we're gonna have to clear out all the
boxes<00:04:21.070> because<00:04:21.489> if<00:04:21.820> we<00:04:21.970> already<00:04:22.210> have<00:04:22.360> all

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
boxes because if we already have all

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.750 
boxes because if we already have all
these<00:04:22.660> boxes<00:04:22.870> filled<00:04:23.320> in<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.950> know<00:04:24.070> we<00:04:24.220> can't

these boxes filled in you know we can't

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.040 
these boxes filled in you know we can't
really<00:04:24.910> play<00:04:25.180> anymore<00:04:25.390> so

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
really play anymore so

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.540 
really play anymore so
we're<00:04:26.229> gonna<00:04:26.349> create<00:04:26.650> a<00:04:26.710> new<00:04:26.800> function<00:04:27.370> and

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
we're gonna create a new function and

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.809 
we're gonna create a new function and
we're<00:04:28.419> going<00:04:28.449> to<00:04:28.720> call<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.110> function<00:04:29.819> clear

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
we're going to call this function clear

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.430 
we're going to call this function clear
box<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:34.270> gonna<00:04:34.389> look<00:04:34.599> a<00:04:34.720> lot<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:35.080> our<00:04:35.229> get

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
box it's gonna look a lot like our get

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.529 
box it's gonna look a lot like our get
box<00:04:35.680> function<00:04:36.129> we're<00:04:36.280> gonna<00:04:36.400> say<00:04:36.699> document

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
box function we're gonna say document

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.999 
box function we're gonna say document
give<00:04:37.780> me<00:04:37.900> element<00:04:38.520> called<00:04:40.199> S<00:04:41.199> Plus<00:04:41.800> that

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
give me element called S Plus that

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.790 
give me element called S Plus that
number<00:04:42.870> we're<00:04:43.870> going<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.050> set<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:44.349> inner<00:04:44.530> text

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
number we're going to set the inner text

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.680 
number we're going to set the inner text
equal<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:47.310> an<00:04:48.310> empty<00:04:48.819> string<00:04:49.120> here<00:04:49.449> an<00:04:49.569> empty

bit of text so clear box will clear that

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.960 
bit of text so clear box will clear that
value<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:54.129> you<00:04:54.250> know<00:04:54.370> what<00:04:54.490> we're<00:04:54.610> gonna<00:04:54.699> do

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
value and you know what we're gonna do

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.520 
value and you know what we're gonna do
is<00:04:56.190> right<00:04:57.190> up<00:04:57.400> here<00:04:59.099> in<00:05:00.099> our<00:05:00.849> start<00:05:01.210> game<00:05:01.530> we

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
is right up here in our start game we

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.439 
is right up here in our start game we
could<00:05:02.680> actually<00:05:03.009> reuse<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:03.759> function<00:05:04.240> so

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
could actually reuse this function so

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.240 
could actually reuse this function so
that<00:05:04.479> every<00:05:04.930> time<00:05:05.139> we<00:05:05.289> want<00:05:05.469> to<00:05:05.560> restart<00:05:05.979> we

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
that every time we want to restart we

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.980 
that every time we want to restart we
could<00:05:06.430> just<00:05:06.669> clear<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.389> whole<00:05:07.539> game<00:05:07.750> board

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
could just clear the whole game board

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.100 
could just clear the whole game board
it's<00:05:08.919> already<00:05:09.340> setting<00:05:09.759> the<00:05:10.150> user's<00:05:10.840> turn

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
it's already setting the user's turn

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.129 
it's already setting the user's turn
it's<00:05:12.099> already<00:05:12.490> check<00:05:13.360> kind<00:05:13.569> of<00:05:13.719> fairly

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
it's already check kind of fairly

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.439 
it's already check kind of fairly
determining<00:05:14.680> who<00:05:14.770> gets<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:15.099> go<00:05:15.129> it's<00:05:15.909> clearing

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
determining who gets to go it's clearing

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.670 
determining who gets to go it's clearing
my<00:05:16.599> winner<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.020> it's<00:05:17.110> telling<00:05:17.349> me<00:05:17.379> who<00:05:17.500> gets

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
my winner and it's telling me who gets

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.890 
my winner and it's telling me who gets
the<00:05:17.800> start<00:05:18.009> so<00:05:18.639> all<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:19.210> have<00:05:19.419> to<00:05:19.539> do<00:05:19.659> now<00:05:19.840> to

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
the start so all I have to do now to

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.170 
the start so all I have to do now to
reuse<00:05:20.409> this<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.800> clear<00:05:20.979> out<00:05:21.129> to<00:05:21.430> start<00:05:21.909> over

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
reuse this to clear out to start over

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.700 
reuse this to clear out to start over
completely<00:05:22.270> is<00:05:22.780> clear<00:05:23.050> out<00:05:23.169> the<00:05:23.289> game<00:05:23.469> board

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
completely is clear out the game board

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.450 
completely is clear out the game board
now<00:05:24.039> I<00:05:24.250> could<00:05:24.580> do<00:05:24.879> something<00:05:25.360> like<00:05:25.389> clear<00:05:25.870> box

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
now I could do something like clear box

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.800 
now I could do something like clear box
one<00:05:27.990> clear<00:05:28.990> box<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:30.330> hello<00:05:31.330> but<00:05:31.509> that<00:05:31.630> would<00:05:31.719> be

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
one clear box to hello but that would be

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.059 
one clear box to hello but that would be
really<00:05:32.050> tedious<00:05:32.289> now<00:05:32.650> fortunately

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
really tedious now fortunately

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.920 
really tedious now fortunately
JavaScript<00:05:33.759> has<00:05:33.880> a<00:05:33.940> way<00:05:34.150> for<00:05:34.389> us<00:05:34.419> to<00:05:34.509> avoid

JavaScript has a way for us to avoid

JavaScript has a way for us to avoid
that<00:05:35.169> kind<00:05:35.349> of<00:05:35.500> tedious<00:05:35.710> writing<00:05:36.340> so<00:05:36.580> it's

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
that kind of tedious writing so it's

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.370 
that kind of tedious writing so it's
something<00:05:37.120> called<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.509> for<00:05:37.779> loop<00:05:37.990> and<00:05:38.199> what<00:05:38.349> a

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
something called a for loop and what a

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.769 
something called a for loop and what a
for<00:05:38.680> loop<00:05:38.830> allows<00:05:39.159> us<00:05:39.340> to<00:05:39.460> do<00:05:39.610> is<00:05:39.849> repeat

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
for loop allows us to do is repeat

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.600 
for loop allows us to do is repeat
something<00:05:41.020> over<00:05:41.289> and<00:05:41.500> over<00:05:41.590> again<00:05:41.800> so<00:05:42.490> I'm

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
something over and over again so I'm

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.730 
something over and over again so I'm
going<00:05:42.880> to<00:05:43.029> say<00:05:43.240> for<00:05:43.690> ver-very

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
going to say for ver-very

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.779 
going to say for ver-very
I<00:05:45.330> equals<00:05:46.330> one<00:05:46.659> as<00:05:47.469> long<00:05:47.710> as<00:05:47.919> it's<00:05:48.130> less<00:05:48.430> than

one<00:05:52.509> to<00:05:52.719> it<00:05:52.750> each<00:05:53.020> time<00:05:55.560> we're<00:05:56.560> going<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.830> clear

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
one to it each time we're going to clear

one to it each time we're going to clear
box<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.940> so<00:05:58.599> what<00:05:58.750> this<00:05:58.870> is<00:05:59.050> going<00:05:59.110> to<00:05:59.319> do<00:05:59.529> is

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
box I so what this is going to do is

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.649 
box I so what this is going to do is
it's<00:05:59.860> gonna<00:05:59.979> start<00:06:00.340> off<00:06:00.520> with<00:06:00.550> I<00:06:01.000> equal<00:06:01.389> to<00:06:01.479> 1

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
it's gonna start off with I equal to 1

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.890 
it's gonna start off with I equal to 1
and<00:06:01.990> as<00:06:02.949> long<00:06:03.610> as<00:06:03.639> I<00:06:03.909> is<00:06:03.969> less<00:06:04.150> than<00:06:04.509> or<00:06:04.569> equal

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
and as long as I is less than or equal

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.320 
and as long as I is less than or equal
to<00:06:04.960> 9<00:06:05.169> we're<00:06:06.009> going<00:06:06.219> to<00:06:06.340> clear<00:06:06.550> this<00:06:06.699> box<00:06:07.000> and

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
to 9 we're going to clear this box and

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.540 
to 9 we're going to clear this box and
every<00:06:08.050> time<00:06:08.259> we<00:06:08.409> finish<00:06:08.590> we're<00:06:09.099> going<00:06:09.310> to<00:06:09.400> add

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
every time we finish we're going to add

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.450 
every time we finish we're going to add
1<00:06:09.879> to<00:06:09.909> I<00:06:10.379> so<00:06:11.379> if<00:06:11.440> we<00:06:11.529> come<00:06:11.710> back<00:06:11.860> over<00:06:12.039> here<00:06:12.370> and

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
1 to I so if we come back over here and

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.990 
1 to I so if we come back over here and
hit<00:06:12.550> refresh

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
hit refresh

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.570 
hit refresh
it<00:06:13.840> looks<00:06:14.050> pretty<00:06:14.139> much<00:06:14.409> the<00:06:14.529> same<00:06:14.740> right<00:06:15.039> we

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
it looks pretty much the same right we

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.100 
it looks pretty much the same right we
don't<00:06:15.759> have<00:06:15.849> a<00:06:15.909> way<00:06:16.090> to<00:06:16.150> call<00:06:16.449> back<00:06:16.659> to<00:06:16.870> start

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
don't have a way to call back to start

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.379 
don't have a way to call back to start
game<00:06:18.150> so<00:06:19.150> let's<00:06:19.870> create<00:06:20.080> a<00:06:20.169> new<00:06:20.340> new<00:06:21.340> tag<00:06:22.090> down

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
game so let's create a new new tag down

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.360 
game so let's create a new new tag down
here<00:06:22.449> right<00:06:22.900> after<00:06:23.080> our<00:06:23.349> table<00:06:23.710> we'll<00:06:24.190> call

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
here right after our table we'll call

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.100 
here right after our table we'll call
this<00:06:24.550> a<00:06:24.729> which<00:06:25.180> gives<00:06:25.389> us<00:06:25.539> the<00:06:25.690> ability<00:06:25.870> to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
this a which gives us the ability to

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.719 
this a which gives us the ability to
create<00:06:26.409> a<00:06:26.440> link<00:06:26.680> and<00:06:26.949> we'll<00:06:27.129> go<00:06:27.250> ahead<00:06:27.520> and

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
create a link and we'll go ahead and

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.149 
create a link and we'll go ahead and
have<00:06:28.150> this<00:06:28.449> call<00:06:29.199> a<00:06:29.229> JavaScript<00:06:29.979> function

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 
have this call a JavaScript function

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:36.120 
have this call a JavaScript function
start<00:06:31.090> game<00:06:33.570> and<00:06:34.570> we'll<00:06:34.810> call<00:06:34.990> it<00:06:35.050> start<00:06:35.529> over

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
start game and we'll call it start over

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.160 
start game and we'll call it start over
and<00:06:37.060> now<00:06:37.560> we<00:06:38.560> refresh<00:06:38.979> the<00:06:39.130> page<00:06:39.310> again

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
and now we refresh the page again

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.480 
and now we refresh the page again
I'll<00:06:41.170> have<00:06:41.290> a<00:06:41.350> link<00:06:41.530> down<00:06:41.710> here<00:06:41.770> and<00:06:42.220> that'll

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
I'll have a link down here and that'll

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.410 
I'll have a link down here and that'll
let<00:06:42.700> us<00:06:42.820> start<00:06:43.060> over

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420

functioning<00:06:58.540> game<00:06:58.780> X<00:06:59.260> I<00:06:59.470> know<00:06:59.620> can<00:06:59.830> both<00:07:00.040> play

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
functioning game X I know can both play

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.180 
functioning game X I know can both play
and<00:07:01.420> they<00:07:01.630> can<00:07:01.870> start<00:07:02.200> over<00:07:02.320> over<00:07:02.950> and<00:07:03.040> over

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 
try to make the the computer play one of

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.230 
try to make the the computer play one of
the<00:07:35.170> moves<00:07:35.410> and<00:07:35.650> just<00:07:35.830> put<00:07:36.220> a<00:07:36.250> put<00:07:36.850> something

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 
the moves and just put a put something

the moves and just put a put something
into<00:07:37.390> a<00:07:37.510> box<00:07:37.810> you<00:07:38.320> know<00:07:38.350> 1<00:07:38.650> through<00:07:38.860> 9<00:07:39.040> so<00:07:40.000> there

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.420 
into a box you know 1 through 9 so there

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.270 
into a box you know 1 through 9 so there
is<00:07:40.600> a<00:07:40.630> lot<00:07:40.900> of<00:07:41.020> room<00:07:41.170> to<00:07:41.410> kind<00:07:41.650> of<00:07:41.770> customize

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 
is a lot of room to kind of customize

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.640 
is a lot of room to kind of customize
this<00:07:42.490> and<00:07:42.670> do<00:07:42.790> additional<00:07:43.210> things<00:07:43.270> to<00:07:43.630> it<00:07:43.720> but
