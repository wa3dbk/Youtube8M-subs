00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.650
 wood 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.699
 I'm looking for the edges of the brain in 2005 the prize 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.449
 then add that the details 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.890
 the human being has some those huge the most part is composed of the bark 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.850
 cerebral 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.430
 that is part of the outer crust and that folds over itself to give 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430
 fit more neurons vélez I will 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.610
 it's like writing something on a sheet of paper and ink and then lucas said sheet 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.340
 the information is still Canaries squeeze so that it occupies less already 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.600
 the brain is divided on each side into four lobes each of which 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.580
 they fulfill a specific function 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.820
 what we have finished in success you are about to see the brain of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000
 trevor in all its splendor 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.170
 here we have the different lobes is the law this is the frontal lobe where 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.040
 resides the personality the emotions and those things in 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.010
 eight years the parietal lobe is one side of the head reynés and 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.440
 is where the brain receives the sensations of the body this package 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.460
 just in the back is the occipital lobe related to the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.240
 eyesight receives the signals from the eyes and this is the related temporal lobe 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.140
 with the ear and the smell and in its interior also with the memory 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.460
 I said even if I come to the laboratory to discover something else about his skull efe 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.240
 pensions are here we have the brain of a horse is quite smaller 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.860
 than the man but has the same components the only difference is that 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.640
 does not have so much cerebral cortex so horses are not so kogelo states 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.560
 so you can feel it 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.970
 It has a strange texture 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.009
 it's like placid yes 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.629
 that's why a bag of turabi candies but definitely has a creamy texture 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.099
 when they are fresh like this one if you look at the upper part of the brain 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.769
 you only see the crust you have to turn it around so you can see something else 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.109
 this is actually part of the optic nerve that comes from the back 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:27.999
 Of the eye 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.379
 and transmits the information from the eyes to the brain 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.980
 by cutting the brain minus two different layers the gray matter in the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.980
 exterior and the substance plant inside 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.639
 Suarez that differentiated between pilgrims and white substance 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.730
 they are different parts of the neurons basically 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.730
 on the outside we have the small bodies of the neurons with their nuclei 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.789
 seated on the bark 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.069
 sends a white substance are the protuberances that 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.779
 they make up a kind of brain wiring 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:01.659
 You are seeing many billions of neurons and billions of 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.659
 connections between them 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.499
 has not given 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.669
 in the back of the brain there is a structure with the shape of a tree 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.939
 cerebellum the kings of sacrament the cerebellum 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.139
 i is very important with regard to the control of postures without 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.200
 Balance 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.550
 It also coordinates the muscles, which is very important for you 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.790
 to run through the field or tackles and all that 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.090
 we have analyzed and a horse's coffin and now I want to analyze a habit the 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:44.089
 my own 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.519
 I'm going to get an MRI 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.259
 in just 10 minutes it captures images of almost three fifths of the brain 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:05.509
 in short that is incredibly I am seeing pictures of my own brain 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:06.260
 rahim 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.580
 you can see all the amazing interior structures 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.360
 jordan this is the hippocampus where much of the memory resides and it looks very 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.630
 well the cerebellum this little structure in the form of tree at the base 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.320
 of the brain is done is strange to think that somewhere in the lobe 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.289
 frontal by 5 this is my personality and my emotions and ningunea 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.110
 It's reassuring to say that you have cancer
