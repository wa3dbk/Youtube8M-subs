train minus velocity of slow train if we

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.429 
train minus velocity of slow train if we
assume<00:01:08.369> because<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.880> know<00:01:09.090> B<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.840> moving<00:01:10.079> with

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.550 
VA is equal to 36 into 5 by 18 in
earlier<00:01:30.299> slides<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.840> told<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.259> how<00:01:31.499> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
earlier slides I told you how to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.789 
earlier slides I told you how to
determine<00:01:32.630> how<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> convert<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> speed<00:01:34.649> in

determine how to convert a speed in
meter<00:01:35.280> per<00:01:35.609> second<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.359> got<00:01:36.840> 10<00:01:37.439> meter<00:01:37.740> per

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
meter per second so we got 10 meter per

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.709 
meter per second so we got 10 meter per
second<00:01:38.520> speed<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.359> train<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:40.009> 10<00:01:41.009> meter<00:01:41.280> per

equal<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.079> 54<00:01:46.710> kilometers<00:01:47.249> per<00:01:47.399> hour<00:01:47.429> is<00:01:47.850> equal

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
equal to 54 kilometers per hour is equal

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.679 
equal to 54 kilometers per hour is equal
to<00:01:48.509> 54<00:01:49.049> into<00:01:49.350> 5<00:01:49.590> divided<00:01:49.890> by<00:01:49.920> 18<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:51.090> equal<00:01:51.509> to

to 54 into 5 divided by 18 is equal to
15<00:01:52.109> meter<00:01:52.549> per<00:01:53.549> second<00:01:54.090> now<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:55.679> have<00:01:55.920> to

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
15 meter per second now we have to

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.349 
15 meter per second now we have to
determine<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:57.740> time<00:01:58.740> required<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.759> how<00:02:00.179> much

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
determine the time required in how much

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.859 
determine the time required in how much
time<00:02:00.420> B<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.530> overtake<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.069> in<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.819> if<00:02:03.270> length

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
time B will overtake that in a if length

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.219 
time B will overtake that in a if length
of<00:02:04.109> the<00:02:04.289> a<00:02:04.499> and<00:02:04.740> B<00:02:05.039> is<00:02:05.369> 200<00:02:06.149> meter<00:02:06.359> and<00:02:06.630> 150

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
of the a and B is 200 meter and 150

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.300 
of the a and B is 200 meter and 150
meter<00:02:07.439> respectively

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
meter respectively

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.690 
meter respectively
so<00:02:08.879> time<00:02:09.179> required<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> overtake<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.769> equal<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so time required to overtake is equal to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.830 
so time required to overtake is equal to
sum<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.060> trains

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
sum of trains

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.580 
sum of trains
length<00:02:12.989> /<00:02:13.769> relative<00:02:14.250> speed<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:14.970> VB<00:02:15.390> minus

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
length / relative speed that is VB minus

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.420 
length / relative speed that is VB minus
VA<00:02:16.590> now<00:02:17.280> sum<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.730> train<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.120> 200<00:02:18.690> +<00:02:18.989> 150<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.769> 150

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
VA now sum of train is 200 + 150 is 150

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.869 
VA now sum of train is 200 + 150 is 150
and<00:02:20.610> relative<00:02:21.390> speed<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.980> 15<00:02:22.980> minus<00:02:23.370> 10<00:02:23.610> is

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
and relative speed is 15 minus 10 is

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.190 
and relative speed is 15 minus 10 is
equal<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.360> 5<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.709> 350<00:02:26.640> divided<00:02:27.180> by<00:02:27.360> 5<00:02:27.660> is

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
equal to 5 so it is 350 divided by 5 is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.660 
equal to 5 so it is 350 divided by 5 is
equal<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:29.000> 70<00:02:30.000> second<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.349> friends<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:31.920> 70

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
equal to 70 second so friends in 70

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.170 
equal to 70 second so friends in 70
second<00:02:33.180> train<00:02:33.780> B<00:02:34.370> will<00:02:35.370> overtake<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.090> train<00:02:36.660> a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
second train B will overtake the train a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.910 
second train B will overtake the train a
