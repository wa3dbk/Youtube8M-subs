00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.300
 Matsunaga looks like yes today is it 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.360
 Here 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:13.090
 Recently made 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.719
 Abante 12 and Yale Large Space made a little while ago with Myon Falcon Red Special 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.670
 Sha 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:21.780
 Both are peach protect state than running It is this two 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 I would like to do each 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.320
 I think that you will understand when you see the introduction video 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:34.980
 It is here here ma chassis 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:38.720
 vs Chassis There is a big difference in common as it's a big diameter tire 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:44.980
 The type is completely different, but it is also full system low height type 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:49.040
 It is a barrel tire of a lightweight weight wheel that is trapezoidal here 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.310
 Dejiahi if the same 4-body 14-to-1 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.010
 I So motor sound Koc piece axis vs Just 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.300
 Koch both axes I 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:03.760
 At od you are a pet 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.790
 It is a pony with a normal brain that climbs the clear pet of Kuripet 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:13.660
 It feels like it's heavy 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:17.690
 Weight is going up overwhelmingly here is a heavy little here 96 Gran 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.560
 So what about 68 grams here 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.909
 30g there is a difference 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:29.970
 What does this difference mean ? 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.970
 I would like to try to run at the same time 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.810
 [musics] 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.880
 Heights 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.880
 I will try to replace the battery 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.740
 [musics] 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.259
 [musics] 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.370
 [musics] 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.000
 That's it 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.000
 [musics] 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:51.460
 I'm such reason was run here relay by Tteyuu Yes, but it is here. 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.480
 It was a result that name 22 was early 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.650
 The reason for this is the Nee 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.190
 Well machine reason is not good 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:08.239
 There are about two things that come to mind 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:12.980
 One can see in the appearance, but it is also the width of the roller right and left and the width of the left roller 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.470
 There is a wide area, but this one is narrow. 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.280
 corner 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:25.280
 I'm drawing a big circle at a certain time , but I'm sleeping here and I'm small . 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:29.120
 The fact that the staff is running in numbers since it is small 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:34.480
 Another one after that is that space-time system, isn't it? 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.529
 Here is it is more of ma in the eyelet bearings while the old days 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.040
 Low friction plastic 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:42.660
 I am interested in hearing 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.160
 This side is big 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.160
 I think it is clearly the better of here is kana and I thought start Mr. have influenced 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.050
 After all it is light 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:59.820
 I here of you apparently fast by say different about 20g 30g 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.590
 Koch's was there that they have to maintain the speed and laps 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.780
 [musics] 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.849
 I noticed it now but I also know the roller 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.300
 A little 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.630
 I wonder if this one is stronger 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.680
 Cotton is 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:19.220
 It may be thrust and it may bite thin 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.370
 Yes I saw some of those differences 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:28.160
 Try Well running the differences say 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:31.620
 I'll come to see what's going to come in another one 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:36.150
 I say interesting place kana of Eunhyuk normal Well 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:40.260
 Running a new thought to Fu that Do was reaffirmed Well 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.600
 I No Tteyuu that I noticed it one Deato 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.920
 What 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.840
 [musics] 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:50.030
 I mean I did not have a course 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:56.370
 In this case, limited two new here this time 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:06:20.299
 It was a video that I tried to run in normal condition See you again 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:20.299
