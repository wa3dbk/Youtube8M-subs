00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.480
 today we are going to discuss a topic that generates 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.809
 many doubts to the users of the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.809
 office 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.530
 although I already work for our 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.480
 community of about one year we are going to 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.789
 try to explain all the data that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.499
 appear in an electronic recipe 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.810
 whenever we go to the pharmacy 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.579
 we have to carry our card 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 sanitary 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.199
 and our recent electronics now 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 let's go to details all the 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.980
 points we have is a recipe 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 electronics 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.570
 This is the electronic recipe model 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.390
 of the autonomous community of the Canary Islands 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.780
 in the upper right corner appears 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.789
 a number with your barcode 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.160
 this is the treatment plan that 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.500
 associated with the identification number of the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.930
 Patient lets know in the pharmacy 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.690
 what medicines are available 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.759
 person at that time in the part 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.430
 On the left, a box with the 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.680
 patient data your name your date of 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 birth and the percentage of contribution 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.350
 that will pay for the medication that is 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.659
 take the box on the right side 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.030
 gives us the doctor's information 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.909
 now we begin to describe the part that 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.100
 corresponds to the medication in the margin 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.109
 upper left appears a date of 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.060
 issue of the recipe is the day on which 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.680
 we go to the doctor and prescribe us the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.860
 treatment 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.960
 on the right side it appears until when 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.450
 the recipe is valid from that 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.130
 date the recipe is invalidated and we must 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.750
 return to the doctor so that we 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.420
 prescribe a new treatment plan 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.940
 in the violet box are described 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.800
 the medications on your left there is a 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.930
 registration number that corresponds to 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.840
 each one in the next column 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.070
 instructions to the patient the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.890
 way we have to take the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.260
 medication is very important to check 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.360
 this column as the recipe program 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.020
 electronics calculates the number of containers 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.420
 depending on the posology 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.790
 Detailed below is the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.400
 duration of treatment in the last 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.519
 column appears the approximate price of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.470
 the medicines on this price the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.030
 patient will only pay the percentage of 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.030
 contribution that corresponds 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.890
 If you have any suggestions
