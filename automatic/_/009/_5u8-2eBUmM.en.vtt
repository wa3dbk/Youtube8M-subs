over my entire face and what this is
going<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.950> do<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.430> lock<00:02:20.180> everything<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.230> place

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.680 
going to do is lock everything in place
so<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:21.860> nothing<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.580> moving<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.269> everything

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.339 

this<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.189> elf<00:02:34.340> blush<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.999> bronzer<00:02:35.599> duo<00:02:35.930> I

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
this is the elf blush and bronzer duo I

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.459 
this is the elf blush and bronzer duo I
am<00:02:36.650> using<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.670> brush<00:02:37.999> here<00:02:38.780> see<00:02:39.170> if<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.319> have

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.199 
am using this brush here see if I have
the<00:02:39.560> name<00:02:39.709> on<00:02:39.889> it<00:02:39.980> nope<00:02:40.159> it<00:02:40.340> completely<00:02:40.909> wiped

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
the name on it nope it completely wiped

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.569 
the name on it nope it completely wiped
off<00:02:41.389> I<00:02:41.599> think<00:02:42.049> this<00:02:42.290> could<00:02:42.499> be<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.799> Mac<00:02:43.010> 109

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
off I think this could be the Mac 109

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.640 
off I think this could be the Mac 109
brush<00:02:43.849> this<00:02:43.999> is<00:02:44.150> great<00:02:44.569> for<00:02:44.599> applying<00:02:45.379> bronzer

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
brush this is great for applying bronzer

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.000 
brush this is great for applying bronzer
in<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.700> cheek<00:02:47.269> area<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.989> really<00:02:48.230> contour<00:02:48.859> it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
in the cheek area to really contour it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.789 
in the cheek area to really contour it
out<00:02:49.189> but<00:02:49.519> i<00:02:49.549> will<00:02:49.939> say<00:02:50.299> applying<00:02:51.139> this<00:02:51.349> to<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
out but i will say applying this to the

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.309 
out but i will say applying this to the
nose<00:02:52.129> area<00:02:52.489> is<00:02:52.790> not<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.209> good<00:02:53.480> idea<00:02:53.510> because<00:02:53.959> the

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
nose area is not a good idea because the

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.550 
nose area is not a good idea because the
bristles<00:02:54.709> are<00:02:54.859> so<00:02:55.280> densely<00:02:56.239> compacted<00:02:57.200> that

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
bristles are so densely compacted that

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.440 
bristles are so densely compacted that
it<00:02:57.769> actually<00:02:57.980> applies<00:02:58.639> like<00:02:58.879> way<00:02:59.209> too<00:02:59.269> much

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
it actually applies like way too much

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.209 
it actually applies like way too much
it's<00:02:59.840> really<00:03:00.230> really<00:03:00.409> hard<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.739> blend<00:03:00.919> it<00:03:01.099> out

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.219 
it's really really hard to blend it out

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.190 
it's really really hard to blend it out
so<00:03:01.459> i<00:03:01.489> would<00:03:01.700> recommend<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.269> different<00:03:02.989> brush

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
so i would recommend a different brush

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.050 
so i would recommend a different brush
for<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.739> nose<00:03:03.889> area<00:03:04.129> i<00:03:04.310> went<00:03:04.609> back<00:03:04.760> through

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
for the nose area i went back through

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.699 
for the nose area i went back through
and<00:03:05.209> had<00:03:05.329> to<00:03:05.419> blend<00:03:05.659> that<00:03:05.810> out<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.200> crazy<00:03:06.409> i

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
and had to blend that out like crazy i

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.709 
and had to blend that out like crazy i
usually<00:03:07.099> use<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.519> different<00:03:08.000> brush<00:03:08.150> but<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.569> was
