00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.830
 I had a national of former soldiers conscripts of the army of Chile and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.129

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.049
 to claim the rights of former soldiers 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.519
 in these days when the national leadership of mobilizations in addition to 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:17.659
 young Chileans 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.470

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.860
 years later gave rise to the lengthy legal proceedings 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.480
 It should be noted that the conflicts of that period stood out as a consequence 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.510
 that many of them did not receive any financial compensation 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.360

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.829
 tell us the people and hundreds 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.259
 they did military service between 73 and 90 as it can be where 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.699
 you can direct where you put information 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.859
 in the idea is

 attend the meeting and that these radio announcers because we do not have 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.709
 physical place where they point 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.709
 then the only way is to attend meeting 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.769

 we met ledo and the document fill it 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.209
 and in the first meeting 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.459
 it does not deliver 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.309
 the national group of ex-soldiers conscripts army of chile 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:45.430
 is already developing several activities to claim 2 rights of 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:47.299
 two the former soldiers 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.669
 Among his actions are the letters sent to the Ministry of Defense and 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.389
 President of the Republic Michelle Bachelet 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.059
 stating that your claim is based on the fact and that everyone being under 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:03.169
 age and without legal responsibility were recruited to enlist them in the ranks 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:08.670
 of the army by law and I life by and age also noted the letters we 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.560
 they put their hands on a weapon and with it they will attack another because they are human 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.419
 family and friends

 as well as soldiers conscripted in 95% or more we never meet 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.949
 for social conscience by umán principles and tasks first of all 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.449
 civilians 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.610

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.930
 get closer because then not to him nothing else to do 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.490
