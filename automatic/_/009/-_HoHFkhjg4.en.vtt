00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.820 

all<00:00:01.589> righty<00:00:01.879> so<00:00:03.049> now<00:00:04.049> as<00:00:04.200> promised<00:00:04.650> this

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
all righty so now as promised this

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.860 
all righty so now as promised this
involves<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.759> parity<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.540> can<00:00:06.690> get

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
involves the parity that you can get

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.259 
involves the parity that you can get
wall<00:00:07.049> pairing<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.470> edges<00:00:07.830> now<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
wall pairing of edges now this is the

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.870 
wall pairing of edges now this is the
first<00:00:09.510> type<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.719> parity<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.920> very<00:00:11.250> very

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
first type of parity this is very very

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.759 
first type of parity this is very very
similar<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.900> another<00:00:12.960> kind<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.410> parity<00:00:13.679> that

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
similar to another kind of parity that

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.189 
similar to another kind of parity that
you<00:00:13.860> might<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.160> already<00:00:14.309> seen

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
you might have already seen

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.080 
you might have already seen
yeah<00:00:16.199> let's<00:00:17.010> look<00:00:17.160> at<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> little<00:00:17.520> mini<00:00:17.640> quiz

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
yeah let's look at a little mini quiz

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.340 
yeah let's look at a little mini quiz
what<00:00:18.270> kind<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.480> parity<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.900> think<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.170> is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
what kind of parity do you think this is

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.359 
what kind of parity do you think this is
all<00:00:20.960> right<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.800> parity<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
all right this is the parity that you

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.670 
all right this is the parity that you
can<00:00:23.490> get<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> 4x4<00:00:24.119> where<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> now<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.590> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
can get in a 4x4 where the now if you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.259 
can get in a 4x4 where the now if you
look<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.250> imagine<00:00:26.609> without<00:00:26.970> these

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
look at this just imagine without these

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.800 
look at this just imagine without these
things

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
things

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.029 
things
does<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.380> look<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> little<00:00:28.680> more<00:00:28.890> familiar

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
does this look a little more familiar

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.730 
does this look a little more familiar
just<00:00:29.910> having<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.179> flipped<00:00:30.510> well<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.529> this

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
just having this flipped well in this

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
just having this flipped well in this
case<00:00:32.009> you're<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.880> put<00:00:33.600> both<00:00:33.899> of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
case you're not going to put both of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.990 
case you're not going to put both of
these<00:00:34.200> rows<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.739> your<00:00:34.770> algorithm<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.489> this

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
these rows in your algorithm in this

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.920 
these rows in your algorithm in this
case<00:00:36.210> you're<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> flip<00:00:36.840> these

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
case you're actually going to flip these

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.500 
case you're actually going to flip these
outer<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.469> not<00:00:37.710> these<00:00:37.890> inner<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.420> now

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
outer two not these inner two so now

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.209 
outer two not these inner two so now
what<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> same<00:00:40.620> algorithm

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
what we have to do is the same algorithm

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.280 
what we have to do is the same algorithm
just<00:00:41.640> instead<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.030> using<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.510> whole<00:00:42.809> two<00:00:43.079> rows

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
just instead of using a whole two rows

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
just instead of using a whole two rows
just<00:00:43.500> use<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> outside<00:00:43.829> two<00:00:44.219> rows<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.210> I'll

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
just use the outside two rows so I'll

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.549 
just use the outside two rows so I'll
put<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> video<00:00:45.840> description<00:00:46.110> or<00:00:46.469> you

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
put this in the video description or you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.750 
put this in the video description or you
can<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.770> watch<00:00:46.860> pogo<00:00:47.190> bats<00:00:47.340> video<00:00:47.610> or

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
move this piece over make this pair so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
move this piece over make this pair so
what<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.850> possibly<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.570> well

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
what can you possibly do about that well

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
what can you possibly do about that well
there's<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.490> way<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> convert<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
there's a way to convert this into the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
there's a way to convert this into the
parity<00:01:33.780> case<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.259> showed<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.520> move

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
parity case I just showed you if I move

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.359 
parity case I just showed you if I move
this<00:01:36.000> over<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.500> now<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this over here now have it so this is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.740 
this over here now have it so this is
opposite<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.829> this

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
opposite from this what I can do is this

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.929 
opposite from this what I can do is this
okay<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:43.470> remember<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.310> algorithm<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.759> showed

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
okay now remember the algorithm I showed

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.359 
okay now remember the algorithm I showed
you<00:01:45.060> before<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.689> pair<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:45.990> edges<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.530> well

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you before to pair up edges right well

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.050 
you before to pair up edges right well
in<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.790> case<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.329> move<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.869> over<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
in this case if I move this over as the

in this case if I move this over as the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
of them and the other one we just got

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.429 
of them and the other one we just got
the<00:02:04.409> same<00:02:04.560> parity<00:02:04.799> case<00:02:05.009> again<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.719> that's<00:02:07.140> one

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the same parity case again so that's one

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.809 
the same parity case again so that's one
way<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.770> around<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.280> I'm<00:02:08.429> sure<00:02:08.580> there's<00:02:08.759> an

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
way to get around it I'm sure there's an

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.949 
way to get around it I'm sure there's an
algorithm<00:02:09.090> somewhere<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.869> use

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
algorithm somewhere that you can use

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.570 
algorithm somewhere that you can use
just<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> finish<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.530> off<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:11.069> there's<00:02:11.430> one

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
just to finish it off but there's one

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.920 
just to finish it off but there's one
out<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.150> way<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.300> get<00:02:12.420> around<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
out this is a way to get around it so

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.130 
out this is a way to get around it so
just

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
just

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.770 
just
another<00:02:13.440> 30<00:02:13.710> case<00:02:13.980> r2d2<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.930> -<00:02:16.200> L<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:18.000> too<00:02:18.300> ri

another 30 case r2d2 you - L you too ri

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:29.660 
another 30 case r2d2 you - L you too ri

you - are you - f - R f2 Li b2 r2 there

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.110 
you - are you - f - R f2 Li b2 r2 there
you<00:02:29.760> go

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
you go

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.550 
you go
see<00:02:30.690> now<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.990> look<00:02:31.140> around<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.500> whole

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
see now if you look around the whole

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.800 
see now if you look around the whole
queue<00:02:31.860> all<00:02:32.400> your<00:02:32.730> edges<00:02:33.030> should<00:02:33.210> probably<00:02:33.510> be

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
queue all your edges should probably be

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.240 
queue all your edges should probably be
solved<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.670> now<00:02:35.960> we<00:02:36.960> are<00:02:37.320> going<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.010> go<00:02:38.130> ahead

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
solved so now we are going to go ahead

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.490 
solved so now we are going to go ahead
and<00:02:38.610> try<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> finish<00:02:39.660> with<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.959> whole<00:02:40.080> v-cube

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
and try to finish with the whole v-cube

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.900 
and try to finish with the whole v-cube
and<00:02:40.680> you'll<00:02:41.100> be<00:02:41.190> older<00:02:41.340> probably<00:02:41.490> say<00:02:41.790> that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
and you'll be older probably say that

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.050 
and you'll be older probably say that
you'll<00:02:42.030> solve<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.510> whole<00:02:42.600> VQ<00:02:42.990> so<00:02:43.770> now<00:02:44.060> there's

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
you'll solve the whole VQ so now there's

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.970 
you'll solve the whole VQ so now there's
two<00:02:45.330> kinds<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.810> parody<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.709> get

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
two kinds of parody that you can get

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.920 
two kinds of parody that you can get
while<00:02:47.730> solving<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.540> going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.870> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
while solving this it's going to be the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.120 
while solving this it's going to be the
same<00:02:49.080> kind<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.320> parodies<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> four-by-four

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
same kind of parodies a four-by-four

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.910 
same kind of parodies a four-by-four
except<00:02:50.640> actually<00:02:51.090> like<00:02:51.330> -<00:02:51.720> two<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.020> them<00:02:52.170> so

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
except actually like - two of them so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.190 
except actually like - two of them so
well<00:02:53.790> not<00:02:54.209> actually<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.660> can<00:02:54.810> get<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.110> of

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
well not actually you can get all of

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.270 
well not actually you can get all of
them<00:02:55.320> but<00:02:55.440> let's<00:02:55.590> see<00:02:55.680> what<00:02:55.739> happens<00:02:55.830> alright

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
them but let's see what happens alright

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.640 
them but let's see what happens alright
so<00:02:57.090> now<00:02:57.209> I'm<00:02:57.480> going<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.810> solve<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.080> black<00:02:58.350> side

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
so now I'm going to solve the black side

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.260 
so now I'm going to solve the black side
because<00:02:59.070> decide<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.850> probably<00:03:00.090> haven't

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
because decide that you probably haven't

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.580 
because decide that you probably haven't
seen<00:03:00.390> very<00:03:00.690> much<00:03:00.810> then<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.200> looks<00:03:01.380> kind<00:03:01.530> of

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
seen very much then it looks kind of

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.970 
seen very much then it looks kind of
cool

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
cool

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.260 
cool
so<00:03:02.520> we're<00:03:02.640> going<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.790> solve<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.090> are<00:03:03.180> going

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
so we're going to solve this are going

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.670 
so we're going to solve this are going
to<00:03:03.330> up<00:03:03.510> here<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.810> day<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:06.530> want<00:03:07.530> something

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
to up here that day I want something

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.900 
to up here that day I want something
with<00:03:07.800> this<00:03:07.920> thing<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.610> turns<00:03:08.820> a

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
with this thing is is that it turns a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.220 
with this thing is is that it turns a
little<00:03:08.970> slower<00:03:09.450> than<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> normal<00:03:09.989> three<00:03:10.110> by

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
little slower than a normal three by

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.260 
little slower than a normal three by
three<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:11.070> it's<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.340> bit<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.670> pain<00:03:11.880> that's<00:03:12.150> all

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
three so it's a bit of a pain that's all

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.449 
three so it's a bit of a pain that's all
like<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.660> but<00:03:12.840> hey<00:03:12.959> whatever<00:03:13.280> because<00:03:14.280> until

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
like it but hey whatever because until

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.190 
like it but hey whatever because until
you<00:03:14.550> solve<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.820> 6x6<00:03:15.180> Rubik's<00:03:15.660> Cube<00:03:15.840> um<00:03:18.080> okay<00:03:19.080> so

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you solve a 6x6 Rubik's Cube um okay so

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.780 
you solve a 6x6 Rubik's Cube um okay so
there's<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> cross<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.400> teaching<00:03:20.700> of

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
there's the cross and the teaching of

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.130 
there's the cross and the teaching of
solvent<00:03:21.180> hands<00:03:21.330> going<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.690> discuss<00:03:21.989> those

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
solvent hands going to discuss those

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.920 
solvent hands going to discuss those
across<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.880> now<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.269> finding<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.720> black

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
across so now it's finding the black

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.140 
across so now it's finding the black
here<00:03:25.230> we<00:03:25.320> go<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.400> already<00:03:26.610> paired<00:03:26.700> up<00:03:26.910> so

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
here we go this is already paired up so

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.610 
here we go this is already paired up so
we're<00:03:27.239> going<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.420> move<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.570> over<00:03:27.690> here<00:03:27.840> he's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
we're going to move this over here he's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.050 
we're going to move this over here he's
done<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:28.799> use<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.040> frigate<00:03:29.430> just<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:29.730> case<00:03:29.970> you

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
done I use a frigate just in case you

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.289 
done I use a frigate just in case you
can't<00:03:30.360> oh<00:03:33.500> let's<00:03:34.500> use<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:34.980> one<00:03:35.220> here<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
can't oh let's use this one here so the

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:43.040 
can't oh let's use this one here so the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.740 

and<00:03:43.710> I<00:03:43.890> did<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.130> wrong<00:03:44.250> algorithm<00:03:44.820> jeez<00:03:45.240> mr.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
and I did the wrong algorithm jeez mr.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.040 
and I did the wrong algorithm jeez mr.
Maris<00:03:46.580> anyway<00:03:47.780> it's<00:03:48.780> not<00:03:48.840> really<00:03:49.020> that

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
Maris anyway it's not really that

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.600 
Maris anyway it's not really that

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
difficult to do I guess with the idea

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.370 
difficult to do I guess with the idea
it's<00:03:51.030> not<00:03:51.060> really<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.420> hard<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.840> solve<00:03:52.140> the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
it's not really that hard to solve the

it's not really that hard to solve the
6x6<00:03:52.770> I<00:03:53.340> mean<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.420> search<00:03:54.660> bicycle<00:03:55.110> looks<00:03:55.260> really

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
6x6 I mean a search bicycle looks really

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.220 
6x6 I mean a search bicycle looks really
really<00:03:55.860> intimidating<00:03:56.430> but<00:03:57.330> once<00:03:57.990> you<00:03:58.110> go<00:03:58.200> to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
really intimidating but once you go to

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.850 
really intimidating but once you go to
solve<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:59.180> so<00:04:00.180> not<00:04:00.360> all<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.600> bad<00:04:00.780> as<00:04:01.560> you

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
solve it so not all that bad as you

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.380 
solve it so not all that bad as you
might<00:04:02.010> have<00:04:02.100> noticed<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.610> mean<00:04:02.760> if<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.210> go<00:04:03.300> to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
might have noticed I mean if you go to

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.590 
might have noticed I mean if you go to
solve<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.730> guarantee<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.120> time<00:04:06.270> you'll<00:04:06.480> be

we're<00:04:34.200> going<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.350> do<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.530> here<00:04:34.650> now<00:04:34.680> except<00:04:35.220> now

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
we're going to do it here now except now

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.180 
we're going to do it here now except now
we're<00:04:35.610> going<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:35.760> turn<00:04:35.970> all<00:04:36.210> three<00:04:36.570> rows<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:37.590> R

this<00:04:54.990> on<00:04:55.290> top<00:04:55.500> now<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.400> can<00:04:56.640> go<00:04:56.760> ahead<00:04:56.820> and

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
this on top now you can go ahead and

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.760 
this on top now you can go ahead and
solving<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.360> however<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:57.720> like<00:04:57.750> I'm<00:04:58.440> going<00:04:58.740> to

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
solving it however you like I'm going to

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:06.350 
solving it however you like I'm going to
solve<00:04:58.980> it<00:04:59.190> using<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.550> oil<00:04:59.940> in<00:05:00.060> PLO<00:05:00.480> so<00:05:05.270> here<00:05:06.270> we

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
solve it using the oil in PLO so here we

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.930 
solve it using the oil in PLO so here we
go<00:05:06.480> there's<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.410> yellow<00:05:08.090> now<00:05:09.260> here<00:05:10.790> with<00:05:11.790> your

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
go there's the yellow now here with your

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:22.829 
go there's the yellow now here with your
pillow<00:05:12.150> that<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.480> have

not<00:05:23.839> solve<00:05:24.619> EQ<00:05:25.069> however<00:05:25.969> there's<00:05:26.360> one<00:05:26.569> kind<00:05:26.689> of

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:26.809 
not solve EQ however there's one kind of

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:27.939 
not solve EQ however there's one kind of
parity<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.199> we<00:05:27.259> actually<00:05:27.409> didn't<00:05:27.769> encounter

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
parity that we actually didn't encounter

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.529 
parity that we actually didn't encounter
that<00:05:28.249> I'll<00:05:28.339> show<00:05:28.519> you<00:05:28.610> what<00:05:28.729> it<00:05:28.789> looks<00:05:28.969> like

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.729 

this<00:05:32.539> one<00:05:32.719> you<00:05:32.809> can<00:05:32.839> actually<00:05:32.959> also<00:05:33.349> encounter

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:33.739 
this one you can actually also encounter

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:37.659 
this one you can actually also encounter
on<00:05:33.800> a<00:05:33.860> 4x4<00:05:34.869> this<00:05:35.869> is<00:05:35.989> a<00:05:36.019> little<00:05:36.229> bit<00:05:36.439> quick<00:05:36.669> if

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
on a 4x4 this is a little bit quick if

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.509 
on a 4x4 this is a little bit quick if
the<00:05:37.909> whole<00:05:38.119> top<00:05:38.389> solve<00:05:38.749> however<00:05:39.649> if<00:05:39.889> these<00:05:40.219> two

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:40.519 
the whole top solve however if these two

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:46.329 
the whole top solve however if these two
here<00:05:43.389> there<00:05:44.389> are<00:05:44.539> not<00:05:44.719> solved<00:05:45.259> in<00:05:46.249> the

a comment and I'll try to make a video
that<00:07:26.449> as<00:07:26.749> soon<00:07:26.869> as<00:07:26.959> possible<00:07:27.729> you<00:07:28.729> know<00:07:28.819> this

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:29.539 
that as soon as possible you know this

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:30.909 
that as soon as possible you know this
isn't<00:07:29.719> as<00:07:29.899> far<00:07:30.050> as<00:07:30.139> it<00:07:30.259> looks<00:07:30.439> it<00:07:30.709> really

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 
isn't as far as it looks it really

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:32.230 
isn't as far as it looks it really
really<00:07:31.399> isn't

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 
really isn't

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.260 
really isn't
I<00:07:32.270> mean<00:07:32.990> it's<00:07:33.889> just<00:07:34.100> an<00:07:34.580> over<00:07:34.819> glorified

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
I mean it's just an over glorified

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.850 
I mean it's just an over glorified
version<00:07:35.600> of<00:07:35.690> this<00:07:37.150> so<00:07:38.199> now<00:07:39.199> you<00:07:39.259> can<00:07:39.500> solve<00:07:39.710> the

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:39.860 
version of this so now you can solve the

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:47.279 
version of this so now you can solve the
D<00:07:39.979> cube<00:07:40.250> six<00:07:41.289> maybe<00:07:42.289> next<00:07:42.560> time<00:07:44.620> q7

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:47.289 
D cube six maybe next time q7

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:50.159 
D cube six maybe next time q7
I'm<00:07:48.289> sorry<00:07:48.620> loud<00:07:48.889> or<00:07:49.130> lower<00:07:49.370> school<00:07:49.550> fourteen
