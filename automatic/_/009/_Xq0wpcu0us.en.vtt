 then it is already partially heated 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.520
 initially placing butter on the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.979
 then we will revoke the onion here 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.160
 waiting until she loses all her 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.050

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.200
 time leading to the preparation of laughter 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.730

 mixing and to continue the preparation 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.670
 we will expect the absorption of this 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.850
 rice is essential. 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.640
 this time you have a hot broth to 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.510
 its good side with shake that broth can 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.890
 to be normally caused is chicken 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.459
 It has received another shell so is 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.830
 very important this absorbs was more 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.390

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.200
