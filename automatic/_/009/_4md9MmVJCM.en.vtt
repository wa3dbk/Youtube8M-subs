00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello dear and welcome to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.490
 a new video of me 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.560
 Today is friday that means I show 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.139
 you a new hairstyle for hairstyles 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.269
 friday and you know each other here like 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.920
 always seen from the front and here 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.540
 can you see her from behind? 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 This hairstyle was with me too 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.680
 on facebook and I find it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.750
 just wonderful for the coming 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.250
 springlike and summertime can you 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.810
 of course also in winter wear 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.789
 in the hairstyles it is actually quite 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.630
 no matter but she has me a bit 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.890
 a bohemian style within 1 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.260
 Spring feelings and a nice one 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 Anyway, airy dress 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.250
 Im immediately in the hairstyle 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.430
 in love and she must of course 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.430
 imitate 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.410
 yes I would say if you are interested 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.840
 you just have a little off on it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.850
 such an updo in one 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.110
 then to see a bit loose style 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.120
 remains off in any case and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.289
 check out the tutorial and im 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.210
 connection I explain to you as always 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.329
 Step by step how do I get to this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.039
 Result is therefore the first thing 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'll do my hair 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.930
 a bit of passage and then to 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.090
 that will just help me copy that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.430
 to have a voluminous back of the head 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.990
 and all that a little bit yes 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 not so flat but just another 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.880
 a bit more bohemian and retro 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.020
 to look like 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.430
 I'll just become single for that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.430
 subdivide lots 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.920
 just as you are used to copying 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.950
 Of course, there is the right thing to do 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 but this style came to me like me 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.630
 I've learned in the last video 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.640
 from a spectator many thanks i 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.799
 So take this style and see if yours 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.540
 here strand by strand once on 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.780
 behind the head and then again to the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.549
 pages 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.649
 when I'm done with it and enough 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.100
 I'll have volume in my hair 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.890
 once the entire upper head cut off 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.939
 and make them up 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.780
 the next step will be to 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.189
 weave 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.860
 I take it from here as you do 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.290
 the page once sees the hair that i have 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.210
 did not disconnect and catch with the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.280
 areas of 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.869
 I will weave a French 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.119
 but you can also do one 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.869
 Make your fishbone braid that's yours 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.729
 leave 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.530
 I can easily find that way 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.420
 a little more in connection 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.459
 Forms and pull out single strands 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.930
 so that the volume gets bigger but what 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.209
 I mean that you will now 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.209
 course in the course of the right see 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.220
 So now comes the part where I mean 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.420
 finished surfaces and individual 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.880
 pull out strands 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.010
 to lighten up the whole bit now 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.450
 in the state where your area still around 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.640
 it will hang on the side 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.040
 the simplest case if you have this whole 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.990
 just do something together here 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.490
 and then it could start to crumble 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.080
 it is that he breaks the hairstyle 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.900
 So just try it in this one 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.640
 condition a little bit to loosen up 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.440
 if you think your way out enough 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.590
 then you can already have pulled 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.320
 the upper paterson and begin 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.300
 continue 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.310
 I will now be the first of the hair 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.260
 the left side and take them 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.970
 so to speak, to the end of my lichens 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.400
 do the right side 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.170
 and that's where the whole thing just comes with 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.640
 hair clips fastened and then I start 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.140
 dumpling at this pressure and that's exactly what 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.400
 same thing on one side 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.960
 I'm doing now on the 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.420
 other I will now, so to speak 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.760
 to take hair from the right side 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.480
 and just turn it into the hair clip 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.710
 from the left side to do so 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.990
 So we just take the 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.840
 streak and become wild here 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.370
 fix on the picture you can see that there 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.230
 that's a lot of volume 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.240
 probably hairpieces or a pillow 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.190
 but underneath but that the 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.140
 surfaces is already very beautiful 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.270
 i would just say take we take 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.030
 one so that h but that is natural 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.710
 left free as you want to do that 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.990
 if you want to have a lot of volume 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.620
 then you can of course also a hair 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.390
 take part or just this bush pillow 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.700
 So when I'm done with mine 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.950
 side to fix you see with me sees 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.140
 That's not very neat, though 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.880
 That's the way I like to air 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.440
 if you like the neat 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.940
 then you just have to look that he is 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.390
 the whole a bit more accurate 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.750
 together , the individuals together 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.300
 and they to yours 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.920
 in the hairline attached or you do 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.560
 just a normal one 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.090
 I really like it when I have the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.240
 Hairstyle see then I remember 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.970

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.920

 me also very nice to a wedding 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.540
 imagine with a backless dress 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.400
 and yes thats how my style is too 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.380
