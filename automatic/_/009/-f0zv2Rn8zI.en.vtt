00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
but here's my auger setup for ice

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.019 
but here's my auger setup for ice
fishing<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.200> year<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.790> did<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.819> few

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
fishing this year I did a few

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.350 
fishing this year I did a few
modifications<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:08.150> originally<00:00:09.150> got<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
modifications to it I originally got the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.580 
modifications to it I originally got the
ice<00:00:09.599> auger<00:00:09.870> about<00:00:10.530> two<00:00:10.769> years<00:00:10.950> ago<00:00:12.080> have<00:00:13.080> all

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
ice auger about two years ago have all

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.200 
ice auger about two years ago have all
places<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.130> got<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.670> Great<00:00:14.910> Eastern

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
places I got it at the Great Eastern

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.980 
places I got it at the Great Eastern
whiteout<00:00:15.630> which<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> snowmobile<00:00:16.890> show<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
whiteout which is a snowmobile show and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.900 
whiteout which is a snowmobile show and
picked<00:00:18.990> her<00:00:19.080> up<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.350> 25<00:00:19.740> bucks<00:00:20.039> didn't<00:00:20.820> know

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
picked her up for 25 bucks didn't know

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.810 
picked her up for 25 bucks didn't know
if<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> ran<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:21.510> not<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.470> I'd<00:00:23.100> been<00:00:23.430> needing<00:00:23.730> an

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
if it ran or not but I'd been needing an

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.689 
if it ran or not but I'd been needing an
ice<00:00:23.970> auger<00:00:24.210> for<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.630> while<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.099> gave<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
ice auger for a while so I gave it a

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.170 
ice auger for a while so I gave it a
shot

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
shot

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.420 
shot
turned<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.140> ran<00:00:28.289> pretty<00:00:28.560> good<00:00:31.219> it's<00:00:32.219> an

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
turned out it ran pretty good it's an

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.319 
turned out it ran pretty good it's an
ice<00:00:32.669> king

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
ice king

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.620 
ice king
I'm<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.290> sure<00:00:34.500> how<00:00:34.739> old<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.360> calls

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
I'm not sure how old it is but it calls

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.350 
I'm not sure how old it is but it calls
for<00:00:36.719> regular<00:00:37.200> leaded<00:00:37.649> gas<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.329> be

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
for regular leaded gas so it's got to be

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.440 
for regular leaded gas so it's got to be
from<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> 70s<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.320> guessing<00:00:41.180> it's<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
from the 70s I'm guessing it's got a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.260 
from the 70s I'm guessing it's got a
regular<00:00:42.840> old<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.649> comes<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.100> three<00:00:44.969> horsepower

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
regular old to comes a three horsepower

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.020 
regular old to comes a three horsepower
two-stroke<00:00:46.140> engine<00:00:49.370> first<00:00:50.370> thing<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.640> did<00:00:50.700> was

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
two-stroke engine first thing I did was

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.119 
two-stroke engine first thing I did was
tear<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> engine<00:00:52.110> completely<00:00:52.350> check

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
tear down the engine completely check

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.439 
tear down the engine completely check
over<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.550> sure<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> bearings<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
over to make sure all the bearings and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.510 
over to make sure all the bearings and
the<00:00:54.660> stuff<00:00:55.050> was<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.230> good<00:00:55.469> shape<00:00:55.770> everything

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the stuff was in good shape everything

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.869 
the stuff was in good shape everything
was<00:00:57.199> piston<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.289> still<00:00:58.469> pretty<00:00:59.070> darn<00:00:59.250> good

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
was piston was still pretty darn good

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.170 
was piston was still pretty darn good
she<00:01:00.480> had<00:01:00.629> around<00:01:00.870> 90<00:01:01.500> psi<00:01:01.980> first<00:01:02.699> compression

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
she had around 90 psi first compression

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.179 
she had around 90 psi first compression
test<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.570> did<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.479> when<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> had<00:01:06.810> her<00:01:07.020> part<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.560> did

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
test I did so when I had her part I did

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.399 
test I did so when I had her part I did
some<00:01:08.460> port<00:01:08.970> work<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.810> cylinder<00:01:10.229> there

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
some port work and the cylinder there

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.760 
some port work and the cylinder there
opened<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> exhaust<00:01:12.290> better<00:01:13.290> than<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.590> was

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
opened up the exhaust better than it was

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
opened up the exhaust better than it was
it's<00:01:14.640> got<00:01:14.790> kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.060> an<00:01:15.180> odd<00:01:15.299> design<00:01:15.659> they

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's got kind of an odd design they

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
it's got kind of an odd design they
basically<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.439> drilled<00:01:16.770> all<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> ports<00:01:17.369> in

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
basically just drilled all the ports in

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.149 
basically just drilled all the ports in
there<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> little<00:01:19.350> caps<00:01:19.619> where

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
there you can see the little caps where

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.570 
there you can see the little caps where
they<00:01:20.250> plugged<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.790> transfers<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.979> didn't

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
they plugged the transfers so I didn't

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.100 
they plugged the transfers so I didn't
get<00:01:23.670> too<00:01:23.850> crazy<00:01:24.119> there's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> lot<00:01:24.720> more<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.049> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
get too crazy there's a lot more that I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.830 
get too crazy there's a lot more that I
can<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.439> later<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.790> she<00:01:27.060> ain't<00:01:27.119> fast<00:01:27.450> enough

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
can do later on if she ain't fast enough

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.289 
can do later on if she ain't fast enough
I<00:01:28.490> opened<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.790> Reed<00:01:30.000> cage<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:32.299> we

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I opened up the Reed cage there and we

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.609 
I opened up the Reed cage there and we
also<00:01:33.450> used<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> high<00:01:33.990> compression<00:01:34.350> head

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
also used the high compression head

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.090 
also used the high compression head
gasket<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:37.320> biggest<00:01:37.619> thing<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.890> think

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
gasket on it the biggest thing I think

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.440 
gasket on it the biggest thing I think
holding<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> back<00:01:38.549> right<00:01:38.729> now<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> stock

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
holding it back right now is the stock

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
holding it back right now is the stock
carburetor<00:01:40.079> I'm<00:01:41.009> gonna<00:01:41.220> try<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.520> find<00:01:41.790> one

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
carburetor I'm gonna try and find one

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.569 
carburetor I'm gonna try and find one
that's<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.750> bigger<00:01:42.990> than<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.320> stock<00:01:43.590> but

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that's a bit bigger than the stock but

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.730 
that's a bit bigger than the stock but
has<00:01:45.180> an<00:01:45.390> auto<00:01:45.509> setup<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> governor<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
has an auto setup with the governor and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.050 
has an auto setup with the governor and
all<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.250> got<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> find<00:01:47.700> something<00:01:47.909> that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
all that so I got to find something that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.080 
all that so I got to find something that
will<00:01:48.149> fit

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.300 

got<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.120> high-flow<00:01:56.050> air<00:01:56.080> filter<00:01:56.680> on<00:01:56.860> there

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.280 

and<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> biggest<00:02:03.360> job<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:03.840> making<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
and the biggest job was making the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.600 
and the biggest job was making the
expansion<00:02:04.860> chamber<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.810> now<00:02:06.810> stock<00:02:07.610> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
expansion chamber for it now stock the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.090 
expansion chamber for it now stock the
way<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.880> ran<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.209> topped<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.929> at<00:02:09.959> 5,000<00:02:10.709> rpm

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
way it ran it topped out at 5,000 rpm

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.180 
way it ran it topped out at 5,000 rpm
with<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.490> governor<00:02:12.319> bumped<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.410> up<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> around
