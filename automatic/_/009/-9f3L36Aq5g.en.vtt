00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.510
 on June 24 the aircraft of the three armies 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.210
 came together on the basis 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.980
 179 châteaudun for a 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.020
 first rehearsal for the parade 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.119
 air july 14 in Paris 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.130
 this year will be the occasion for the party 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.730
 to commemorate 100 years of 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.949
 the great war 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.510
 and if all the devices were 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.480
 not present in training for 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.220
 Reasons for optimizing means 75% 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.290
 all the same furrowed the sky of noah 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.390
 whose almost exact conditions of the day 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.880
 j general jean jacques borel 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.239
 air show director explains us 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.980
 Why 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.360
 the goal here is to benefit from a 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.329
 aeronautical environment looks like 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.289
 much to that the Paris region 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.610
 why because the kz2 the track of 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.760
 châteaudun corresponds globally to 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.719
 the focused fields elysées so we can 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.860
 position the expectations circuits that 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.600
 are used by the planes the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.210
 helicopters exactly the same 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.800
 way that in the tail in the region 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.220
 Parisian and so people train 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.990
 on circuits that are exactly this 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.340
 that they will find the day of 14 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.409
 July so a very workout 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.810
 coherent in an airspace that 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.549
 really looks like the day I know 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.750
 that there is a slight difference with 14 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.890
 July beyond the fact that we are not 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.659
 in Paris is that there is no 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.790
 commentary while the 14th of July there 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.210
 will have a comment to explain the 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.470
 symbology and the message corresponding to 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.420
 each of the paintings 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.369
 you know that this year's theme 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.170
 it's the anniversary of the great war 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.240
 finally the commemoration more exactly 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.670
 of the great war so we built 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.729
 a scenario that allows you to make the link 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.490
 with the great war is so both 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.500
 to symbolize this passage of witness between 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.689
 our a great old and the pilots 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.430
 current and then also to symbolize 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.600
 the witness passage of a number 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.149
 of aircraft in the air force 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.189
 the arrival of the a400m that comes all 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.890
 gently replace the transall and 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.220
 hercules the disappearance of the mirage f1 which 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.830
 will be pulled from the forces 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.500
 very very soon and who gives in if you 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.000
 want his missions to burst so all 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.470
 these passages of witnesses are symbolized 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.060
 and all that will be very well explained when 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.890
 from the commentary of 14 July a 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.270
 first repetition before the 9th 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.740
 July on the fields elysées 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.380
 allowing patrol work at 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.850
 trajectory timing and cohesion for the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.710
 captain of frigate marc moreau 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.660
 commander of the flotilla 11f of the 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.770
 national navy everything would seem to be 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.610
 unfolded as planned 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.820
 there this first repetition c 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.220
 I think well past seen from my place the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.360
 more difficult is to go on time 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.530
 at the right speed on the stand 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.000
 where in any case what was nice what 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.620
 symbolized the platform today for 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.810
 the general borel a few small 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.610
 details are still to be tweaked even though 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.860
 the set of chili ideas remains very 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.090
 largely satisfactory on the quality of 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.730
 training today I am 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.080
 particularly satisfied then there is 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.610
 always a few small adjustments the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.780
 holding of places of the team members 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.120
 teams and that are a bit too much in 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.900
 back a little too far apart 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.209
 the spacing between the different 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.280
 tables so between different 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.720
 formations since it is important 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.970
 to have an air show that is fluid 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.950
 which is both long enough 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.590
 so we have time to appreciate it 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.330
 but that are short enough for 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.550
 that there is no idle parade 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.350
 aerial rendezvous appointment that has 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.060
 place each year for which the states 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.500
 majors worked a long time at the advanced 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.360
 the different tables that must 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.489
 then perform the crews 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.230
 you have to dissociate if you prepare 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.260
 technical parade the preparation of the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.910
 scenario in fact I tend to say a 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.950
 little bit to caricature that parade 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.080
 is getting ready from the 16th of july it's 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.150
 to say that two days later 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.260
 we will march on the 14th of July on the 15th 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.070
 July we will do what we 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.380
 call a hot debriefing 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.920
 that is to say, say a little bit how 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.959
 it happened 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.950
 and as of July 16th I 'm exaggerating a 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.400
 little but in fact it's from the month of 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.810
 September 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.040
 we will already start to ask ourselves 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.950
 questions about the fashion shows of the week 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.230
 of the year after knowing that the theme 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.209
 is given to us by the authorities 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.709
 policies of course and then then we 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.750
 gradually builds a salon 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.459
 scenario it's not about the army 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.320
 of air obviously since the army 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.000
 from the air goes the air parade then 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.239
 secretly fits into a parade 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.970
 global with the other armies and so 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.680
 all this works very much upstream at the 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.090
 times in the development of the scenario 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.620
 since you know that there is not only 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.590
 the military parade part ago 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.519
 also the civil part with 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.160
 an animation service 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.930
 the goal being to illustrate a theme and 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.010
 then the technical preparation she gets 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.600
 done all year long because 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.040
 what the crews demonstrate 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.820
 today it's the results of their 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.530
 daily workouts 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.610
 if you want a parade finally 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.710
 it's like an air operation 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.160
 the air operation you must be good 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.310
 in law 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.750
 at the right time at the right altitude of 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.820
 way to be able to deliver an armament 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.440
 the parade is exactly the same 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.960
 except that you did not deliver a 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.940
 armament obviously but you deliver to 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.100
 know how to make an image if possible of a 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.170
 image that is aesthetically beautiful for 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.000
 show and well the qualities of 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.890
 training and capacities of 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.780
 had every July 14 the states 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.610
 majors renews the crews of 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.650
 the order of two-thirds for the captain 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.780
 frigate marc moreau so this will be the 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.490
 first but also the last time 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.070
 it will fly over the fields elysées day of 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.940
 the national holiday 1 not want everything to 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.200
 do like the others 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.690
 currently I order the flotilla 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.910
 11f but i leave i leave my 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.700
 command and well two days after 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.449
 so this parade of July 14th this will be my 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.099
 last flight 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.169
 aboard a sea gust as 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.360
 commander of the flotilla 11f but I 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.259
 did I actually have nets 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.610
 for July 14th so this is the 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:29.540
 first time and in addition I will be in 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:31.580
 head of the marine box so I'll have 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.750
 this is my responsibility for the parade 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.980
 for the national navy 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.350
 it's not a pressure anymore because 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.360
 to be at the head of a flight is what we 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.409
 do that's what we do 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.650
 every day a chef project of 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:47.159
 patrol by against nets parade 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.139
 July 14th yes it's a must 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.990
 little tension since we are very 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.210
 concentrated the device is complex there 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.569
 are a lot of aircraft that evolve in 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.270
 a very constrained space and so it takes 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.969
 that everyone plays 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.099
 the partition 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.079
 assigned to him so that the melody 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.939
 be beautiful the parade is nothing of the 14 

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:09.009
 july a few minutes imprint of a 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.869
 intensity of an important symbolic 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.999
 for the crews that this year 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:15.189
 will also see the last flight of the mirage 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:17.769
 f1 the fighter plane will definitely be 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:20.139
 his farewells to the French sky the emotion 

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:23.099
 imagine it will be once again beautiful and 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.099
 well at the rendezvous
