I'm putting him at seven billion five
hundred<00:00:31.019> million<00:00:31.790> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> power<00:00:33.149> level<00:00:33.540> I

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
hundred million of the power level I

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.470 
hundred million of the power level I
know<00:00:33.899> power<00:00:34.320> levels<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:35.090> designed<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.300> show

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
know power levels are designed to show

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
know power levels are designed to show
useless<00:00:37.140> they<00:00:37.290> were<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.620> everything<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.640> as

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
useless they were in everything but as

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.380 
useless they were in everything but as
going<00:00:39.239> from<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:41.010> freezer<00:00:41.309> saga<00:00:41.670> power<00:00:41.969> levels

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
going from the freezer saga power levels

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
going from the freezer saga power levels
and<00:00:42.540> using<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> multipliers<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.579> it's

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and using the multipliers I think it's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.380 
and using the multipliers I think it's
it's<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.829> kind<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.100> useful<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it's it's kind of useful to use it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.350 
it's it's kind of useful to use it
because<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.840> does<00:00:49.079> show<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:49.789> much<00:00:50.789> different

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
because it does show how much different

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.610 
because it does show how much different
the<00:00:51.449> characters<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:52.020> strong<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.379> does

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the characters are strong it does

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.189 
the characters are strong it does
provide<00:00:52.890> perspective<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:54.690> much<00:00:54.899> stronger

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
provide perspective of how much stronger

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.170 
provide perspective of how much stronger

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
evident in on go tanks go to entrance

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.040 
evident in on go tanks go to entrance
and<00:06:21.650> Goku<00:06:21.949> and<00:06:22.009> Vegeta<00:06:22.569> how<00:06:23.569> to<00:06:23.630> have<00:06:23.870> the

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
and Goku and Vegeta how to have the

outcome is gonna be wake up but in my

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.200 
outcome is gonna be wake up but in my
opinion<00:06:27.860> go<00:06:28.009> G<00:06:28.159> doesn't<00:06:28.460> even<00:06:28.580> more<00:06:28.849> badass

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210
