00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.480
 Matthew chapter 6 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.490
 see that you do not do your alms in front of men to be seen 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.689
 from them 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:13.249
 otherwise you will not have and salary about your father who is in the 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:14.539
 Heavens 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.579
 when then we decided nothing 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.679
 Do not sound the trumpet in front of you as the hypocrites do in the 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.869
 synagogues and in the squares 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.150
 to have glory of men 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.570
 deserts alive 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.169
 that already have their reward 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.119
 more when you give alms 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.450
 Do not know your left what your right does 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.840
 so that your alms may be secret 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.430
 and your father who sees secretly 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.810
 which will pay in public 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.770
 and when it's not be like the hypocrites 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.590
 because they love to pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.060
 standing streets 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.500
 to be seen from men 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 I tell you that they already have their salary 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.379
 It was enough when you pray 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.170
 enter your camera and close your door 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.640
 for your father who is secret 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.930
 and your father who sees secretly 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.200
 who will pay in public 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.590
 crying do not be neat 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.120
 like the mundanes 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.120
 who think that by their verbiage they will be moved 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.480
 make us similar to them 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.170
 because your father knows what things we need 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.900
 before you ask him 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.590
 you can spare and isasi 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.260
 Our father who art in Heaven 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.890
 Hallowed be thy name 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 come your kingdom 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.820
 it has been done to your will as in heaven as well on earth 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.200
 give us today our daily bread 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.500
 and loose our debts 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 as we also let go of our debtors 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.640
 and do not put us in temptation 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.710
 mase liberate us from evil 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.940
 because yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.160
 for all ages 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.980
 because if you let men raise their offenses 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.980
 or release to you also your heavenly father 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.089
 more and do not let go of that men their offenses 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.329
 neither your father husband the face our conferences 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.729
 and when I became not six like the austere hypocrites 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.599
 because they move their faces to appear to men who help 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.679
 I tell you that they already have their payment 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:29.069
 more had when yúnes humberto head and wash your face 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.339
 so as not to show men that fasting 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.919
 yes no to your father who is secret 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.079
 and your father who sees secretly 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.279
 will pay you in public 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.549
 give us treasures on earth 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.129
 where the moth and the rust corrupt and where thieves or nancy steal 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.219
 if he does it or treasures in heaven 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.909
 where neither miorin moth corrupt 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.909
 and where thieves niurka payroll 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.180
 because where it was of not because protesorero 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.329
 there will be 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.479
 Your heart 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:03.969
 the leather lamp put the eye 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.479
 so if your eye is without being or 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.079
 your whole body will be luminous 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.089
 more if your eye is bad 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.869
 your whole body will be spooky 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:17.479
 so if the fire in you is darkness 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.449
 how many were the same darkness 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.509
 neither can serve both gentlemen 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.789
 because there was hate the 1 and love the other 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.789
 Posse to reach 1 and despise the other 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.219
 You can not serve God 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:34.109
 and the riches 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.529
 portal 2 vigo nos distgoja iss for your life that you have to eat because 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:40.909
 you have to drink 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.909
 and for your body that you have to wear 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.549
 I do not know life more than the food and the body that the dress 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.349
 look at the birds of heaven 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.489
 that they do not sow 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.579
 and recommended the police 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.949
 and your heavenly father the Spanish mint 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.949
 Are not you much better than them 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.679
 who of you may be summoned to add an elbow to his stature 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.129
 and for the dress 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.079
 because we grieve 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.539
 they learn from the lilies of the field how they grow 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:16.859
 they do not work min 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.279
 more I tell you that not even Solomon with all his glory 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.099
 He was dressed like one of them 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.619
 and if the grass of the field that today esteem añana is to throw in the oven God is the 

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:28.879
 you saw like this 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.810
 they were not much more to you 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.809
 men of little faith 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.550
 we grieve after saying 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.939
 what will we eat 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.460
 or what shall we 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.039
 or with what we will cover 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.090
 because sentires seek all these things 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.469
 but your heavenly father knows 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.389
 that see all these things 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.360
 you have need 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.360
 most sought after first the kingdom of God and his justice 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.020
 and all these things 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.919
 or will be added 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.839
 so it distresses us and it's because of tomorrow 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.409
 that tomorrow will bring its grief 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:05.089
 enough to the day 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.669
 your affliction
