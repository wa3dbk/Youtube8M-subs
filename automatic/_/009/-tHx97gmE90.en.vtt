be too you know bottom nd I I was just
you<00:03:46.990> know<00:03:47.110> doing<00:03:47.290> an<00:03:47.410> interview<00:03:47.710> about<00:03:47.770> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
you know doing an interview about the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.220 
you know doing an interview about the
guitar<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.460> I<00:03:48.900> happened<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.930> look<00:03:50.020> at<00:03:50.200> a

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
guitar and I happened to look at a

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.510 
guitar and I happened to look at a
setting<00:03:50.590> on<00:03:50.650> an<00:03:50.770> amplifier<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.370> was

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
setting on an amplifier that was

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.699 
setting on an amplifier that was
plugging<00:03:51.880> into<00:03:52.150> for<00:03:52.420> demonstration<00:03:52.990> and<00:03:53.410> they

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
plugging into for demonstration and they

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.760 
plugging into for demonstration and they
have<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:53.950> top<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.850> base<00:03:55.500> rolled<00:03:56.500> all<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
have the top and the base rolled all the

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.220 
have the top and the base rolled all the
way<00:03:57.070> on<00:03:57.250> in<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.850> mid-range<00:03:58.230> completely

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
way on in the mid-range completely

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.530 
way on in the mid-range completely
rolled<00:03:59.380> off<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.890> it's<00:04:00.700> like<00:04:00.880> I<00:04:01.000> look<00:04:01.209> at<00:04:01.330> those

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
rolled off and it's like I look at those

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.330 
rolled off and it's like I look at those
settings<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:01.990> go<00:04:02.140> that's<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.010> kind<00:04:03.280> of

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
settings and I go that's the kind of

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.160 
settings and I go that's the kind of
thing<00:04:03.550> you<00:04:03.820> know<00:04:03.940> like<00:04:04.120> it's<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.690> frequencies

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
thing you know like it's the frequencies

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.230 
thing you know like it's the frequencies
that<00:04:05.320> like<00:04:05.500> whales<00:04:05.770> and<00:04:06.040> birds<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:07.120> know

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
that like whales and birds you know

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.360 
that like whales and birds you know
communicate<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.040> sounds<00:04:09.340> like

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
communicate in and it and it sounds like

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.070 
communicate in and it and it sounds like
a<00:04:09.459> vacuum<00:04:09.730> cleaner<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.240> me<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:11.050> whole

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
a vacuum cleaner to me and the whole

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.960 
a vacuum cleaner to me and the whole
thing<00:04:11.410> with<00:04:11.530> about<00:04:11.680> guitar<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.220> it's<00:04:12.520> all<00:04:12.940> in

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
thing with about guitar is it's all in

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.690 
thing with about guitar is it's all in
the<00:04:13.209> mids<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:13.740> ie<00:04:14.740> you<00:04:15.730> know<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:17.700> showcases

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
the mids and ie you know it showcases

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.780 
the mids and ie you know it showcases
the<00:04:18.880> mistakes<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.600> lot<00:04:19.630> more<00:04:19.989> but<00:04:20.799> in<00:04:21.100> reality

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
the mistakes a lot more but in reality

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.240 
the mistakes a lot more but in reality
if<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.810> can<00:04:22.960> learn<00:04:23.140> to<00:04:23.200> play<00:04:23.470> cleaner<00:04:23.919> with

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
if you can learn to play cleaner with

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.040 
if you can learn to play cleaner with
more<00:04:24.460> mid-range<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:25.210> think<00:04:25.660> people<00:04:25.900> will

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
more mid-range I think people will

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.420 
more mid-range I think people will
notice<00:04:26.380> you're<00:04:26.530> playing<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.890> little<00:04:27.010> bit<00:04:27.160> more

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
notice you're playing a little bit more

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.130 
notice you're playing a little bit more
there's<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:27.970> many<00:04:28.060> tonal<00:04:28.450> variations<00:04:28.990> and

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
there's so many tonal variations and

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.900 
there's so many tonal variations and
there's<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:29.380> many<00:04:29.470> things<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.400> we<00:04:30.790> could

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
there's so many things that we could

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.810 
there's so many things that we could
talk<00:04:31.030> about<00:04:31.180> but<00:04:31.480> on<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.110> guitar<00:04:32.410> itself<00:04:32.820> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
talk about but on the guitar itself the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.310 
talk about but on the guitar itself the
volume<00:04:34.150> in<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.690> tone<00:04:35.140> are<00:04:36.130> critical<00:04:36.940> for<00:04:37.320> the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
volume in the tone are critical for the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.659 
volume in the tone are critical for the
sound<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.919> know<00:04:39.010> it's<00:04:39.160> like<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.460> don't<00:04:39.550> have

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
sound you know it's like you don't have

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.830 
sound you know it's like you don't have
to<00:04:39.790> write<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.120> volume<00:04:40.360> does<00:04:40.479> have<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.690> be<00:04:40.720> on

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
to write the volume does have to be on

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.200 
to write the volume does have to be on
10<00:04:41.140> you<00:04:41.620> know<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.520> tone<00:04:42.760> doesn't<00:04:43.030> have<00:04:43.150> to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
10 you know and the tone doesn't have to

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.790 
10 you know and the tone doesn't have to
be<00:04:43.300> on<00:04:43.419> 10<00:04:43.660> if<00:04:43.840> there's<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.500> know<00:04:44.530> there's

be on 10 if there's you know there's

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.830 
be on 10 if there's you know there's
there's<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:45.520> many<00:04:45.610> variations<00:04:45.910> in<00:04:46.300> between<00:04:46.570> 0

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
there's so many variations in between 0

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:54.070 
there's so many variations in between 0

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
thing and there's a reason and I started

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.640 
thing and there's a reason and I started
experimenting<00:05:44.030> with<00:05:44.450> them<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:44.870> what<00:05:45.470> it<00:05:45.560> is

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
experimenting with them and what it is

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.760 
experimenting with them and what it is
it's<00:05:46.040> a<00:05:46.100> very<00:05:46.220> warm<00:05:47.170> human<00:05:48.170> voice<00:05:48.320> quality<00:05:48.650> and

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
it's a very warm human voice quality and

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.550 
it's a very warm human voice quality and
it<00:05:48.830> also<00:05:48.980> tapers<00:05:49.720> it<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:51.020> difference<00:05:51.410> between

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
it also tapers it the difference between

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.500 
it also tapers it the difference between
the<00:05:51.890> lows<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.400> low<00:05:52.550> wound<00:05:52.850> strings<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.360> that

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
the lows the low wound strings and that

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.180 
the lows the low wound strings and that
and<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.810> high<00:05:53.960> unwound<00:05:54.470> strings<00:05:54.560> is<00:05:54.890> very

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
and the high unwound strings is very

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.980 
and the high unwound strings is very
minimal<00:05:55.640> so<00:05:55.670> you<00:05:56.180> want<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.390> Les<00:05:56.540> Paul<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.900> be
