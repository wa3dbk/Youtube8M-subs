00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
six I believe and I wrapped them up with

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.399 
six I believe and I wrapped them up with
the<00:01:16.530> rubber<00:01:16.740> band<00:01:17.240> each<00:01:18.240> packed<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.080> then<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the rubber band each packed and then I

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.969 
the rubber band each packed and then I
repped<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.119> put<00:01:21.119> six<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> six<00:01:22.140> by<00:01:22.530> each<00:01:22.710> other

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
repped I put six and six by each other

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.690 
repped I put six and six by each other
and<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.729> wrap<00:01:24.030> them<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.390> together<00:01:24.689> again<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
and I wrap them up together again and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.179 
and I wrap them up together again and
then<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> did<00:01:27.150> another<00:01:27.180> extra<00:01:28.140> wrote<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.530> top<00:01:28.829> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
then I did another extra wrote on top I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.450 
then I did another extra wrote on top I
think<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.640> was<00:01:29.700> six<00:01:29.970> or<00:01:30.119> eight<00:01:30.299> each<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.460> I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
think it was six or eight each and I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.770 
think it was six or eight each and I
wrapped<00:01:32.790> them<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> same<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
wrapped them up the same way with the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.420 
wrapped them up the same way with the
rubberband<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.470> put<00:01:34.740> them<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.040> top<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
rubberband I put them one on top of the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.350 
rubberband I put them one on top of the
other<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.000> made<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.420> height<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:39.210> I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
other and I made this height and then I

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
other and I made this height and then I
just<00:01:39.540> decided<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.140> use<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.530> receiving

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
first um let me turn this you think I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.910 
first um let me turn this you think I
folded<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.780> pin<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.110> there<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.500> going<00:02:52.830> to

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
folded it and I pin it there is going to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.370 
folded it and I pin it there is going to
be<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.130> bottom<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.540> around<00:02:54.810> pin<00:02:55.170> this

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
be the bottom go this around pin this

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.650 
be the bottom go this around pin this
but<00:02:55.710> very<00:02:55.920> soft<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.550> as<00:02:56.730> tight<00:02:57.000> as<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.180> want

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
but very soft not as tight as you want

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.170 
but very soft not as tight as you want
it<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.320> then<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.650> could<00:02:58.830> do<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.580> handle<00:03:00.060> right

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
it so then you could do the handle right

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.480 
it so then you could do the handle right
here<00:03:00.240> what<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.810> do<00:03:00.900> with<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> handle<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.830> folded

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
here what I do with the handle I folded

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.540 
here what I do with the handle I folded
it<00:03:02.610> like<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.120> do<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:03.960> with<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.200> tri<00:03:05.100> cycle

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
it like I do you know with the tri cycle

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.720 
it like I do you know with the tri cycle
cake<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.510> know<00:03:06.540> whatever<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.580> folded<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.670> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
cake you know whatever I folded it and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.680 
cake you know whatever I folded it and
