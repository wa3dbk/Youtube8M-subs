00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.740
 hello everyone in a previous video 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.990
 I showed how to make a hole in a 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.390
 threaded rod or a screw well in 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.599
 this case is a piece of 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.330
 of rod or in this case an s but it is 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.220
 smooth therefore I can not catch the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.169
 nut to be able to tighten it in the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.460
 screw I have to engineer me another 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.000
 system and several I'm going to show you 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.120
 one 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 I have a square 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.699
 iron door 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.829
 you can use perfectly and then 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.829
 hook in the vise 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:54.110
 from the first make a hole 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.480
 centered for 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.480
 the passage of the rod 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:08.280
 as always we refrigerate the drill 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.280
 well a little oil as always 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.090
 and little by little 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.359
 with the drug was first 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 Now what I'm going to do is with a 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.170
 same section that has 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:34.060
 the s can make a hole so 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.060
 that can pass through the woman 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.880
 royo is terrestrial 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.050
 let's check to see if this is the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.050
 diameter 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.570
 you have to make it a little bit bigger 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.410
 is too tight, well 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.410
 know him 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.760
 and there it is 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.750
 with tight sections of course going to 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.750
 go much better 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.690
 Well, it 's ready, we 're going to do the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.690
 first test 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.340
 and Well here we go with the first 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.860
 and it is already 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:35.490
 Well then ready another and I have done 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.490
 a few that with
