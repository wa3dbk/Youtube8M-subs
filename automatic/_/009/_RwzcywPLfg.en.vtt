if<00:00:05.850> you<00:00:06.779> are<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> health-conscious<00:00:07.649> person

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
if you are a health-conscious person

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.370 
if you are a health-conscious person
always<00:00:08.519> looking<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.420> whole-grain<00:00:09.780> products

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
always looking for whole-grain products

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.900 
always looking for whole-grain products
you<00:00:11.040> need<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.190> know<00:00:11.400> what<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> whole-grain

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
you need to know what a whole-grain

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.509 
you need to know what a whole-grain
actually<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.960> because<00:00:13.889> if<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.130> don't<00:00:14.309> it

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
actually is because if you don't it

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.490 
actually is because if you don't it
becomes<00:00:14.820> easier<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.809> manipulated

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
becomes easier for you to be manipulated

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.920 
becomes easier for you to be manipulated
by<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> food<00:00:16.980> industry<00:00:17.270> so<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.300> begin<00:00:18.720> let's

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
by the food industry so to begin let's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.920 
by the food industry so to begin let's
quickly<00:00:19.230> cover<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.220> anatomy<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.939> grain<00:00:21.210> so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
quickly cover the anatomy of a grain so

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.439 
quickly cover the anatomy of a grain so
that<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:22.529> we're<00:00:22.650> talking<00:00:22.680> about<00:00:23.070> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
added man-made chemicals that go into

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.820

difference<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.500> by<00:02:16.740> looking<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.220> these

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
difference just by looking at these

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.760 
difference just by looking at these
pictures<00:02:17.720> one<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.840> these<00:02:19.020> provides<00:02:19.470> us<00:02:19.620> with

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
pictures one of these provides us with

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.950 
pictures one of these provides us with
great<00:02:20.010> nutrition<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.700> energy<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.810> other

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
great nutrition and energy and the other

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.930 
great nutrition and energy and the other
one<00:02:22.200> our<00:02:22.380> body<00:02:22.680> doesn't<00:02:23.010> even<00:02:23.220> recognize<00:02:23.490> as

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
one our body doesn't even recognize as

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.810 
one our body doesn't even recognize as
food<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:25.350> how<00:02:25.530> are<00:02:25.800> all<00:02:26.130> these<00:02:26.340> supposed

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
food so how are all these supposed

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.520 
food so how are all these supposed
whole-grain<00:02:27.390> cereals<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.080> breads<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.410> you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
whole-grain cereals and breads that you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.280 
whole-grain cereals and breads that you
buy<00:02:28.680> made<00:02:28.980> well<00:02:29.910> they<00:02:30.060> processed<00:02:30.570> they're

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
buy made well they processed they're

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.380 
buy made well they processed they're
broken<00:02:31.650> down<00:02:31.770> into<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.370> call<00:02:32.640> flour<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
broken down into what we call flour and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.540 
broken down into what we call flour and
at<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.140> point<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.620> brand<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> germ<00:02:35.520> is

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
at this point the brand in the germ is

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.910 
at this point the brand in the germ is
removed<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:37.200> helps<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> extend<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
removed and this helps to extend the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.220 
removed and this helps to extend the
shelf<00:02:38.160> life<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.550> product<00:02:38.850> but<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> result

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
shelf life of the product but the result

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.410 
shelf life of the product but the result
is<00:02:40.470> almost<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.980> complete<00:02:41.430> loss<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.940> nutrients

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
is almost a complete loss of nutrients

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.080 
is almost a complete loss of nutrients
including<00:02:42.930> fiber<00:02:43.430> phytonutrients<00:02:44.430> minerals

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
including fiber phytonutrients minerals

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.450 
including fiber phytonutrients minerals
and<00:02:45.270> vitamins<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.810> after<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.890> nutrition<00:02:47.340> is

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
and vitamins and after the nutrition is

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.940 
and vitamins and after the nutrition is
sucked<00:02:47.850> out<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.450> grain<00:02:48.690> some<00:02:49.530> portions<00:02:49.920> of

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
sucked out of the grain some portions of

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.010 
sucked out of the grain some portions of
the<00:02:50.040> brand<00:02:50.310> are<00:02:50.460> reintroduced<00:02:51.120> along<00:02:51.870> with

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
the brand are reintroduced along with

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.960 
the brand are reintroduced along with
some<00:02:52.170> binders<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.920> corn<00:02:53.220> or<00:02:53.430> wheat<00:02:53.640> starch

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
some binders like corn or wheat starch

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.870 
some binders like corn or wheat starch
and<00:02:54.240> some<00:02:54.990> form<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.290> sugar<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.680> added<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.190> they

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
and some form of sugar is added and they

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.720 
and some form of sugar is added and they
usually<00:02:57.030> add<00:02:57.420> yeast<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:58.380> make<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.530> puff<00:02:58.830> up<00:02:59.040> so

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
usually add yeast to make it puff up so

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.190 
usually add yeast to make it puff up so
the<00:02:59.880> final<00:03:00.180> product<00:03:00.540> looks<00:03:00.570> bigger<00:03:00.930> than<00:03:00.990> it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the final product looks bigger than it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.199 
the final product looks bigger than it
really<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.800> that's<00:03:02.490> good<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:02.760> business

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
really is and that's good for business

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.870 
really is and that's good for business
but<00:03:04.140> yeast<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.590> sugar<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:05.130> mean<00:03:05.610> that's<00:03:05.760> a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
but yeast and sugar I mean that's a

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.790 
but yeast and sugar I mean that's a
lethal<00:03:06.270> combination<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.080> ever<00:03:07.410> seen<00:03:07.770> one

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
lethal combination if I ever seen one

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.980 
lethal combination if I ever seen one
and<00:03:08.100> then<00:03:09.060> they<00:03:09.180> cook<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.630> at<00:03:09.750> high

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
and then they cook it at high

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.170 
and then they cook it at high
temperatures<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:11.400> final<00:03:11.700> product<00:03:12.090> is

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
temperatures and the final product is

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.030 
temperatures and the final product is
sprayed<00:03:12.630> with<00:03:12.840> synthetic<00:03:13.320> chemicals<00:03:13.770> that

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
sprayed with synthetic chemicals that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.830 
sprayed with synthetic chemicals that
are<00:03:14.160> supposed<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.790> replace<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.240> naturally

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
are supposed to replace a naturally

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.330 
are supposed to replace a naturally
occurring<00:03:16.140> nutrients<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.740> were<00:03:16.890> once<00:03:17.100> in

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
occurring nutrients that were once in

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.040 
occurring nutrients that were once in
the<00:03:17.430> grain<00:03:17.670> but<00:03:18.420> then<00:03:18.540> lost<00:03:18.750> through<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
the grain but then lost through the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.040 
the grain but then lost through the
processing<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.610> in<00:03:20.700> short<00:03:21.030> they<00:03:21.510> remove<00:03:21.840> all

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
processing so in short they remove all

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.259 
processing so in short they remove all
the<00:03:22.200> natural<00:03:22.410> nutrients<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.400> they<00:03:23.850> introduce

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
the natural nutrients and they introduce

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.420 
the natural nutrients and they introduce
man-made<00:03:24.780> vitamins<00:03:25.320> that<00:03:25.769> are<00:03:25.920> perceived<00:03:26.220> as

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
man-made vitamins that are perceived as

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.300 
man-made vitamins that are perceived as
toxins<00:03:26.880> by<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.090> human<00:03:27.420> body

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
toxins by the human body

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.400 
toxins by the human body
and<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:30.239> then<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> go<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.870> local<00:03:31.080> health

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
and so then you go to the local health

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.050 
and so then you go to the local health
store<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.010> pick<00:03:32.250> up<00:03:32.280> some<00:03:32.580> bread<00:03:32.610> or<00:03:33.000> a

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
store and you pick up some bread or a

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.210 
store and you pick up some bread or a
cereal<00:03:33.450> box<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.319> flip<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.620> over<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:35.069> read

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
cereal box and you flip it over to read

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.710 
cereal box and you flip it over to read
the<00:03:35.340> ingredients<00:03:35.880> because<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.540> are<00:03:36.690> a

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
the ingredients because you are a

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.300 
the ingredients because you are a
mindful<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.319> health-conscious<00:03:37.709> consumer

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
mindful and health-conscious consumer

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.580 
mindful and health-conscious consumer
and<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:39.000> see<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.420> says<00:03:39.599> 100%<00:03:40.110> whole

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
and you see that it says 100% whole
