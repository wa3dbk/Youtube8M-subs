00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.160
 if something new technologies bring to work in the field this especially 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.690
 quality of life 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.580
 one of the best examples is the milking robots that are becoming more 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.679
 frequent in the farms of our country 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.130
 this week we visited a farm and we were able to see up close how 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130
 do they work 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.669
 when josé manuel de la sota exploitation in the morning 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.919
 almost all the battles are ordered the miracle achieves this robot that 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.609
 work day and night 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.749
 the animals come in when they feel like doing their own will 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.980
 without human presence the robot two milk thanks to a mechanical arm 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.200
 with laser that is built-in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.900
 not one of the ppm 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.330
 then we look for movies harry place person by person can be 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.040
 deny 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.090
 and as for the group of the ldc as it goes loosing basic a foothold until 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.160
 diego rivers 4 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.760
 the sixth one vote decides so much of pedestrians 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.970
 Labaka opens the door to you. 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.899
 at first, more expensive than cows in three hours 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.260
 overcome this obstacle hardly appear setbacks the robot will monitor 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.780
 operation 24 hours a day and when there is an incidence like that san josé manuel 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.780
 through the mobile 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.440
 but no 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.600
 are usually small problems that will be resolved in minutes as 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.000
 usual is that a cow friesian bomans of luck whatever a 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.300
 sudden blackout but surveillance goes beyond 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.490
 In addition to this machine it allows to take a very detailed file of each animal 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.020
 register number of ormeño the liters of milk terán 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.230
 and even warns of diseases that may suffer 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.320
 that's why you must provide at the time of moscow for 0 11 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.830
 the plan foresees no lie if one is to know at every moment 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.080
 the support of the cow 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.640
 will be in the day to day the robot takes about four hours of work per 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.390
 working day 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.230
 the exploitation of Ricardo has three machines and in his case the saving of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.840
 time is superior 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.330
 with the previous system 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.670
 we were milking only eight or nine hours a day 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.240
 when now good as you dedicate it let's say that four hours a day in 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.569
 total with the forewords 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.869
 to serve you well 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.969
 jacket you could save about five hours of work 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.949
 economically it is a very important investment 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.189
 around 130 thousand euros for robots 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.689
 even so its presence is increasingly common in livestock farms 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.189
 quality of life is profitable from the first day in purely 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.139
 costs takes longer to pay off 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.749
 really if you look at it like that you could say that you pay only not 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.809
 with the improvements that you have lamented of production better quality of milk almost 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.009
 you only pay 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.959
 then another thing is the time that you spend economically in amortizing it 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.869
 pagen packages euros to amortize a canada 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.939
 but the truth is I think that in the security council 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.099
 in two years only with the time they take is local time 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.120
 and is that new technologies bring about all that 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.329
 quality of life 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.709
 The presence of the robot does not exempt them from continuing to go 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.099
 exploitation that yes now they do it in a more flexible way and it shows in the 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.859
 daily work 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.960
 how is distributed throughout the day the 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.300
 at work no more flexibility plus having time for you and being able 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.500
 devote to other tasks not that at other times maybe with milking or 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.339
 conventional 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:19.289
 you have to put them aside 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.199
 This is just one example of what new technologies can do 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:27.209
 applied to livestock that a job that has always been hard is a little 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:27.329
 less
