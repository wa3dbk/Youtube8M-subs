set up the touch ID on the iPhone 5s at

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.709 
set up the touch ID on the iPhone 5s at
the<00:00:10.980> fingerprint<00:00:11.519> scanner<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:12.300> make<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.630> as

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the fingerprint scanner to make it as

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.959 
the fingerprint scanner to make it as
accurate<00:00:12.929> as<00:00:13.320> possible

get rid of all the current fingerprints

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.110 
get rid of all the current fingerprints
we<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.840> click<00:00:39.840> add<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.250> fingerprint<00:00:41.250> okay

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
we have and click add a fingerprint okay

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.560 
we have and click add a fingerprint okay
now<00:00:42.270> comes<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.780> fun<00:00:42.930> part<00:00:43.250> actually<00:00:44.570> scanning

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
is just kind of put stead Center on the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
is just kind of put stead Center on the
button<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.719> make<00:00:54.930> sure<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> cover<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.829> entire

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
button but make sure to cover the entire

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.450 
button but make sure to cover the entire
button<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.149> your<00:00:57.329> finger<00:00:57.980> once<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> scans

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
button with your finger once it scans

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.459 
button with your finger once it scans
you'll<00:00:59.789> feel<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> vibration<00:01:00.230> then<00:01:01.230> we're<00:01:01.379> gonna

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you'll feel a vibration then we're gonna

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
you'll feel a vibration then we're gonna
think<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> our<00:01:01.800> thumb<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.489> quadrants

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
think of our thumb in like quadrants

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.660 
think of our thumb in like quadrants
basically<00:01:03.870> we're<00:01:04.110> gonna<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> top<00:01:04.739> left<00:01:05.280> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
basically we're gonna do the top left so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.719 
basically we're gonna do the top left so
just<00:01:05.820> move<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.060> over<00:01:06.119> slightly<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.840> down<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
just move it over slightly and down and

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.010 
just move it over slightly and down and
again<00:01:08.729> cover<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> entire<00:01:09.510> button<00:01:09.840> when<00:01:09.930> you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
again cover the entire button when you

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.179 
again cover the entire button when you
push<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.200> down<00:01:11.420> then<00:01:12.420> lift<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.530> now<00:01:13.920> get

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
push it down then lift up and now get

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
push it down then lift up and now get
the<00:01:14.310> bottom<00:01:14.700> left<00:01:14.909> quadrant<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.659> moving<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the bottom left quadrant so moving the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.100 
the bottom left quadrant so moving the
thumb<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> same

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
thumb up a little bit and I do the same

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.740 
thumb up a little bit and I do the same
thing<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:20.100> side<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.820> move<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> over

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
thing for the right side so move it over

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.260 
thing for the right side so move it over
down<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.200> top<00:01:25.759> up<00:01:26.759> slightly

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
down that was the right top up slightly

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.170 
down that was the right top up slightly
right<00:01:28.200> bottom<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.670> we're<00:01:29.850> gonna<00:01:29.939> just

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
right bottom and now we're gonna just

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.950 
right bottom and now we're gonna just
get<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:31.049> top<00:01:31.520> again<00:01:32.520> always<00:01:32.850> try<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> cover

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
get the top again always try to cover

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.240 
get the top again always try to cover
the<00:01:34.140> entire<00:01:34.229> home<00:01:34.770> button<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.130> finger

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the entire home button with your finger

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090 
the entire home button with your finger
if<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:37.079> slightly<00:01:37.770> less<00:01:38.070> than

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
if you can and then slightly less than

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.590 
if you can and then slightly less than
what<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.460> did<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.700> beginning<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
what we did in the beginning to get the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.210 
what we did in the beginning to get the
bottom<00:01:40.759> slightly<00:01:41.759> higher<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:43.140> again

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bottom slightly higher and then again

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.350 
bottom slightly higher and then again
dead<00:01:44.670> center<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:46.280> then<00:01:47.280> keep<00:01:47.880> doing<00:01:48.210> dead

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
dead center and then keep doing dead

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.340 
dead center and then keep doing dead
center<00:01:49.640> until<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.729> eventually<00:01:51.200> goes<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
center until it eventually goes to the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.830 
center until it eventually goes to the
next<00:01:52.500> screen<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> adjust<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.399> grip<00:01:53.840> now

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
next screen to adjust your grip now

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.030 
next screen to adjust your grip now
basically<00:01:55.229> what<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.380> means<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.710> wants<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
basically what this means it wants to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.190 
basically what this means it wants to
get<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> edges<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.939> your<00:01:57.000> fingerprints<00:01:57.960> so

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
get the edges of your fingerprints so

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.190 
get the edges of your fingerprints so
basically<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.189> edges<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.579> your<00:01:59.610> finger<00:02:00.210> so

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
basically the edges of your finger so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.730 
basically the edges of your finger so
we're<00:02:01.380> actually<00:02:01.500> gonna<00:02:01.740> take<00:02:02.159> our<00:02:02.399> finger<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
we're actually gonna take our finger and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.830 
we're actually gonna take our finger and
rotate<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.829> 45<00:02:05.100> degrees<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> right<00:02:06.420> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
rotate it 45 degrees to the right so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.520 
rotate it 45 degrees to the right so

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.210 
get that then we're gonna do the very
tip<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.450> our<00:02:23.930> finger<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:26.260> then<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.650> bottom<00:02:28.040> so
