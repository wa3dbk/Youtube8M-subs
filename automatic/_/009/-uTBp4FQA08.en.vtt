00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.990
 hi everyone welcome to this 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.250
 new weekly buy video I'll you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.849
 present what I found this 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.800
 week in store I found a lot 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.400
 good game I'll show you that 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.450
 right now 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.730
 so we start with ps2 games then 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.810
 I found this one that I owned 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.570
 not so I write it is canis canem 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:31.740
 edit ah so it's bully scholarship 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:37.820
 psill quillan version perfect edition and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.820
 out of play the ecopee for 3 euros 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.470
 so it's really complete there is even 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.230
 the poster included here i'll get you 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.570
 show 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.340
 so there is the map of the game that's 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.440
 really typical that rockstar puts it 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.100
 always the game card with a small 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.100
 poster behind 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.530
 I find a little rpg not too good 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.310
 I know it's a bit of a mud this game 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.020
 he was very poorly rated and me for the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.480
 little that I tested it's true that I 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.220
 found the beauf but for the price I 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.080
 the payais I said to myself to have 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.450
 bulls in my collection as much as 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:25.010
 it's really rpg style that I 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:27.030
 so prefer everbright edited by krever 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.619
 entertainment 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.549
 I have the impression that it was said 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.950
 ear really makes that dung the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.690
 game is complete cd there is no 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.119
 stripes and pay 2 50 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.100
 but frankly for 2.50 to nadir game 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.200
 it is complete there to see reported of 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.060
 nature and I priced them so I got 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.759
 took a game ds too I had it loose 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.850
 so it really pissed me off 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.540
 own a wolf jeans on ds i'm going 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.000
 finally find in full box version 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.630
 this final fantasy crystal chronicles 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.159
 ring of fates so this one I'm good 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.530
 glad to have found it finally in 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:13.590
 full version 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:16.140
 I paid them 10 euros to micromania I 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.690
 finally managed to catch the last dragon 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.940
 what was missing on ds so there I 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.370
 really has all the episodes that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.860
 have come out on ds now this is the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.510
 dragon who is the celestial bride 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.799
 so it's the most rated currently 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.200
 jelly price on the net in immediate purchase 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.970
 on ebay at 35 euros 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.310
 so I think I did a good 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.870
 deal because this episode here it is 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.959
 listed more or less fifty 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.269
 of euros on occasions so blow 35 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.660
 euros it's a good deal it's 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.660
 full 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:03:00.650
 when a dragon episode quest on as soon as he 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:05.560
 There was shown dragon quest vi the kingdom of 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.750
 dragon dreams that is the epic of the elect 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.990
 dragon quest 9 the sentinels of the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.050
 firmament this daring game show the fiancee 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.400
 heavenly and the two episodes a little 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.160
 pokemon like dragon quest monster joker 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.410
 and dragon quest monsters joker 2 on 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.650
 going on now to ps3 games then 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.540
 I grabbed an excluded ps3 me I them 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.440
 really bought for especially for the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.870
 excluded so I found a heavy rain at 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.610
 5 euros so I was happy because 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.520
 this game it's true that if we want to play 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.810
 an object to own a ps3 so that 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.210
 good as I bought one 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.160
 little on purpose for excluded games so 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.420
 here I do not know if there is a notice to 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.780
 the base but I had it that 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.670
 origami in it but good for 5 euros 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.700
 I think I made a good 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.410
 case I also bought a rpg 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:05.380
 exclusive to ps3 so this is the celta of 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:09.070
 exclusive ps3 it's tales of graces f 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.070
 I am very happy to have it 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.230
 already 20 euros it is listed more than one 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.840
 thirty euros of opportunities so there the 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:22.150
 cd of the game he is in the cs3 and so he 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.270
 there is a little cd bonus and there is the band 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.800
 its original of the game so it's rather 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.520
 cool to have inflicted small cd bonuses 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.330
 and we will end with games vita so 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.070
 now that I believe it's ps 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.480
 vita she's going to blow I'll try to 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.160
 make me a small collection of games 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.600
 in box version 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.300
 is it true that it is a 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.260
 big hall that drives to download the 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.110
 games in materials 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.200
 they really did they really did 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.700
 the console a little for that we will tell me 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.600
 I still prefer the versions 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.950
 boxes either that I like the rpg you 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.050
 doubt it I'm going frankly 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.260
 practically only rpg above so the 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.240
 final fantasy 10 and 10.2 so what 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.860
 must know about this episode is that 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.230
 so this is the episode remastered ps2 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.550
 so in fact on the game cartridge 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.760
 you own that the 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.070
 the final fantasy 10 is actually the 10 2 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.320
 he marks well down there in fact he 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.180
 is downloadable on the store you 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.810
 do not have it physically in the box 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:31.090
 here we are I bought them gilles 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.090

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:40.729

 on ps vita south sacred fries 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.340
 15 euros it is not very very expensive 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.029
 so that's it for this week 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.749
