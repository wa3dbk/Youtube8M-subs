not really difficult it's really really

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.580 
not really difficult it's really really
quite<00:02:20.160> simple<00:02:20.430> what<00:02:21.390> I've<00:02:21.540> done<00:02:21.750> here<00:02:21.810> now<00:02:22.319> is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
quite simple what I've done here now is

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.490 
quite simple what I've done here now is
to<00:02:22.860> split<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.519> front<00:02:23.819> pull<00:02:24.120> me<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.540> half<00:02:25.140> and

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
to split the front pull me in half and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.270 
to split the front pull me in half and
then<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.040> flapped<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.850> back<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.780> create<00:02:28.250> what<00:02:29.250> I

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
then I flapped it back to create what I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.530 
then I flapped it back to create what I
