out to the outside place your door and
there<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.230> go<00:04:11.260> your<00:04:12.220> door<00:04:12.459> defies<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.910> laws

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
there you go your door defies the laws

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.690 
there you go your door defies the laws
of<00:04:13.720> physics<00:04:13.840> somehow<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.650> water<00:04:15.010> stops<00:04:15.340> and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
of physics somehow the water stops and

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.310 
of physics somehow the water stops and
if<00:04:16.390> you<00:04:16.450> guys<00:04:16.510> want<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.959> guys<00:04:17.049> can<00:04:17.170> make<00:04:17.260> a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
if you guys want you guys can make a

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.690 
if you guys want you guys can make a
little<00:04:17.500> escape<00:04:17.770> route<00:04:17.980> so<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.310> know<00:04:18.520> you<00:04:18.609> can

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
little escape route so you know you can

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.840 
little escape route so you know you can
put<00:04:18.970> your<00:04:19.060> ladders<00:04:19.750> up<00:04:19.930> on<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.170> side<00:04:20.850> that's

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
put your ladders up on the side that's

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.510 
put your ladders up on the side that's
right<00:04:22.000> they<00:04:22.300> fix<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.690> but<00:04:22.840> um<00:04:23.160> if<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.340> want

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
right they fix that but um if you want

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.990 
right they fix that but um if you want
you<00:04:24.700> can<00:04:24.790> go<00:04:24.850> like<00:04:25.030> this<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.480> then<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.230> can<00:04:26.500> go

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
you can go like this and then you can go

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.720 
you can go like this and then you can go
dirt<00:04:28.000> there<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.660> there<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.550> then<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.640> can

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
dirt there and there and then you can

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.880 
dirt there and there and then you can
put<00:04:30.850> ladders<00:04:31.150> down<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.600> there<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:32.560> go<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
put ladders down and there you go the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.960 
put ladders down and there you go the
water<00:04:33.100> can't<00:04:33.340> get<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.580> through<00:04:33.760> ladder

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
water can't get in through ladder

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.120 
water can't get in through ladder
somehow<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.320> know<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.530> could<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.980> could

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
somehow so you know you could you could

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.010 
somehow so you know you could you could
just<00:04:36.280> like<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.150> then<00:04:37.830> go<00:04:38.830> like<00:04:39.010> this

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
just like this and then go like this

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.270 
just like this and then go like this
there's<00:04:41.020> an<00:04:41.200> input<00:04:41.590> another<00:04:41.800> ladder<00:04:42.070> down

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
there's an input another ladder down

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.980 
there's an input another ladder down
there's<00:04:42.640> many<00:04:42.820> different<00:04:42.880> variations

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
there's many different variations

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.170 
there's many different variations
so<00:04:44.260> you<00:04:44.350> know<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:45.340> know<00:04:45.460> just<00:04:45.640> work<00:04:46.000> with<00:04:46.120> what

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
so you know you know just work with what

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.390 
so you know you know just work with what
you<00:04:46.330> got<00:04:46.360> yes<00:04:47.230> right<00:04:47.470> now<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.040> new

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
you got yes right now that the new

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.340 
you got yes right now that the new
update<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:49.120> can't<00:04:49.390> do<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.660> but<00:04:49.900> um<00:04:52.260> so<00:04:53.260> you

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
update you can't do that but um so you

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.320 
update you can't do that but um so you
know<00:04:53.380> just<00:04:53.710> do<00:04:53.800> this<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.820> guys<00:04:54.940> can<00:04:55.210> make

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
know just do this and you guys can make

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.700 
know just do this and you guys can make
a<00:04:55.360> house<00:04:55.570> now<00:04:55.780> guess<00:04:56.200> we<00:04:56.350> can<00:04:56.470> uh<00:04:56.500> know<00:04:56.590> what<00:04:56.680> a

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
a house now guess we can uh know what a

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.890 
a house now guess we can uh know what a
house<00:04:56.890> so<00:04:57.730> I<00:04:57.760> can<00:04:57.970> hop<00:04:58.210> up<00:04:58.240> here<00:04:58.480> and<00:04:58.660> I<00:04:58.750> can

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
house so I can hop up here and I can

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.980 
house so I can hop up here and I can
just<00:04:59.020> hop<00:04:59.110> back<00:04:59.230> down<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.710> go<00:04:59.800> whoop<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.840> I'm

have any questions about on a water

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.400 
have any questions about on a water
house<00:05:07.210> there's<00:05:07.480> something<00:05:07.720> didn't<00:05:07.900> work<00:05:08.020> you

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
house there's something didn't work you

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.880 
house there's something didn't work you
know<00:05:08.560> follow<00:05:09.220> exactly<00:05:09.370> i<00:05:09.610> did<00:05:09.760> so<00:05:10.300> first<00:05:10.540> step

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
know follow exactly i did so first step

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.830 
know follow exactly i did so first step
make<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.070> mold<00:05:12.370> of<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.760> house<00:05:12.940> second<00:05:13.660> step

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
make the mold of the house second step

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.570 
make the mold of the house second step
cover<00:05:14.140> it<00:05:14.290> in<00:05:14.380> glass<00:05:14.620> or<00:05:14.920> whatever<00:05:15.130> material

you want your outside your house to be
third<00:05:17.680> step<00:05:17.980> break-in<00:05:18.820> and<00:05:19.450> then<00:05:19.690> like<00:05:20.110> you

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
third step break-in and then like you

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.570 
third step break-in and then like you
know<00:05:20.500> break<00:05:20.800> in<00:05:20.950> through<00:05:21.160> here<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:21.430> then<00:05:21.550> go

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
know break in through here and then go

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.850 
know break in through here and then go
in<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.150> then<00:05:22.420> fill<00:05:22.750> back<00:05:22.960> up<00:05:22.990> or<00:05:23.380> whatever<00:05:23.530> so

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
break every block and there you go you

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.790 
break every block and there you go you
have<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:28.630> whole<00:05:28.900> you<00:05:29.170> have<00:05:29.290> your<00:05:29.410> nice<00:05:29.530> little
