 [Music] 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.410
 time of mind because I already know that many 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.060
 of you are not used to seeing 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.770
 this kind of tutorials but good as 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.920
 the channel stopped being and is incorporating 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.600
 what it would be rooms for lg 3 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.760
 in the saw everything is showing a small 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.470
 tutorial that they are showing you as well 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.259
 two ways how to enter the mode 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.270
 recovery on our the 3 axis then I know 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.650
 nothing more to say if you like the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.790
 installation of ramses equipment 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.160
 tutorials do not forget to leave your 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.690
 comment I had like to follow me in the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.940
 social networks I did nothing more to say 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.320
 we started tonality and good guys like 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.600
 I told them to like it by showing the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.040
 tutorial of how it will reach the recovery 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.260
 deadly mode recovery in our 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.940
 device in this case is the lg g3 and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.410
 well this is going to serve to make a 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.660
 One hour product when you want 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.920
 install some rom or of planes and you 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.230
 went to the other phone 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.910
 everything is showing the methods or the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.680
 manual method and the method that then a 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.450
 application can save you from everything and in 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.100
 the application much much more but then 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.080
 good in this case all this show the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.299
 tutorial because the other day install a 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.979
 rom improperly then not 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.869
 I had how to access the application 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.520
 so I had to do it manually 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.550
 so first, let's pay 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.040
 our device 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.140
 eleven caparrÃ³s we are going to wait for it to stop 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.850
 completely and good the steps that we are going 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.770
 to be doing first of all 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.990
 we're going to have to press the button 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.000
 Volume down as well as on 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.190
 at the same time you turn on 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.580
 device we go but we are not more than 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.680
 the device and be paid ready now 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.540
 we press the power button and the button 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.490
 of volume or down at the same time and in 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.030
 when we see his logo 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.670
 we are going to release it again we press the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.040
 power button and volume down once 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.320
 that we saw the logo of the jee and we will 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.540
 expect us to return here to the hub 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.010
 bizet men me now as you can see if 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.220
 they did the right thing that would come 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.810
 then volume down and power so that 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.290
 start the device will appear 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.480
 the logo of him and release and release the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.160
 two volumes and again go back to 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.340
 press the two buttons that is the 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.230
 power and menu down then here we go to 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.020
 give laws we are going to move with the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.360
 volume keys 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.430
 come on here you should not have yes and we're going to 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.590
 hope that again is the animation of 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.400
 he and we now send our 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.870
 travel 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.370
 let's wait here let's leave it in 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.500
 live time so that you more or 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.180
 least see how much less it takes and what if 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.100
 it takes much longer to scare 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.770
 and good as you can see I'm already in the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.410
 in my record and mod in this case I can already 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.940
 route to the system can install 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.280
 Something else breaks something like that 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.710
 not here I can already wide format options 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.590
 let's make a simple debut so that 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.959
 see that everything is in order 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.910
 we go for the one that loads and good in this 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.920
 case then it is much faster no 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.599
 we have nothing to worry about sometimes 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.280
 it takes a little longer than 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.620
 unusual but water is not normal is 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.760
 completely part of the process and good 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.280
 next you will be showing 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.810
 a free application that is going to 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.450
 be saving the day believe me this 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.250
 lador application should be noted that 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.860
 Well obviously you should have a 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.930
 installed recovery as well as being root 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.599
 because it has no light you can not deny with it 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.400
 and well now we will see the second method 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.349
 which is carried out through a 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.700
 application that is called ifai flash in 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.640
 this case we already have it installed 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.079
 let's open the fault now yes once 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.489
 that opens here we will appear 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.769
 always this ad let's give it 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.239
 accept let's wait for him to load everything 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.410
 this is the guy in the root let's 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.990
 guarantee access 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.910
 and basically ready in this application 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.220
 You will be able to do a lot of things 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.570
 but new direct to the record and in 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.670
 this case then having this tutorial 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.800
 because something emergency happened with your 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.660
 phone you want to do a robbery like this 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.930
 fast then well then here we have 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.360
 3.3 dots this is the universal icon 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.880
 of a menu in this case we press it and 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.980
 here we have reboot to recover and right now 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.020
 we will look like the boot we are going to leave 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.490
 so the phone automatically alone 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.970
 is going to be carrying out all the 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.800
 operation 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.270
 let's put it here to be left 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.070
 then apply nothing is going to be like magic 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.080
 let's give this time sent over here 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.610
 although there is no problem and good for 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.950
 the people who are watching this video 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.900
 and we wonder what happened with more videos 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.150
 do not worry here I have more behind 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.740
 here we are going to make a whole focus 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.420
 list of applications that are already coming 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.459
 for the channel and one as you can see already 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.769
 loaded the recovery and directito here 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.360
 we can install ships as you can see 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.970
 it works wonders both back 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.680
 we want wood system now and good 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.030
 obviously having a record installed 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.220
 for this to appear if you do not have 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.200
 a recovery is not going to work for you 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.370
 way and see - with this includes this 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.410
 small tutorial is productivity has 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.760
 served that will serve you if nothing else 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.010
 what to say you already know that I am will cost 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.840
 of topic 6 tv you can subscribe if you 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.550

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.560
 lg 13 that device that I'm

 using right now with this I
