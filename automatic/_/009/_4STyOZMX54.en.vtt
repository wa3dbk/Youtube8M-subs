00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.240
 Today I am going to teach you a very 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.150
 delicious how to prepare a salmon to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.340
 me this recipe I launched my mom and she's 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.039
 very easy the ingredients 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.770
 the amounts you can choose 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.380
 there is no problem really is 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.240
 very very rich and very easy to do well 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.519
 what am I going through these days with just 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.109
 videos of recipes for is that they are me 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.330
 liking a lot and my mom is 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.149
 teaching recipes then I teach them 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.059
 also to you and ready let's start 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.070
 with him well let's start scratching a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.500
 whole onion and if you have these 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.050
 gadgets that cut your food from a 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.789
 very easy way because you can also 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.610
 do but if you do not have it you can 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.520
 grating there is no problem we are going to 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.469
 leave on medium fire more or less for 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.320
 three minutes the amount of oil that 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.890
 you think necessary then we are going to add 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.899
 our onion already crushed and what 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.399
 we're going to do is mix it until 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.399
 they are very soft 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.159
 we leave it in the skillet well couple 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.140
 more or less for three minutes and then you 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.510
 let's take with any kind of 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.920
 dark vinegar I give vinegar 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.159
 apple so that the bittersweet touch 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.469
 out stronger 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.749
 after this we will mix it very 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.880
 very good every time we go to add 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:29.130
 We will mix an ingredient for a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.399
 time for him to release all his 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.399
 flavors 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.729
 Now let's add a little paprika 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.830
 sweet to me I love the bittersweet touch 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.280
 who has and also is to give 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.280
 colour 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.500
 we put a teaspoon of salt 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.810
 Now I added a generous spoonful 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.580
 of real honey is delicious 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.710
 difference that makes is great 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.850
 now a little soy sauce 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.720
 and as always we mix very very well 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.720
 Y 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.390
 you are going to put the pieces of your fish in 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.690
 a refractory or in some container 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.720
 that you can put in the oven we are going to do 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.730
 pigment the salmon mine is one that already 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.310
 is mixed for the same reason you can take 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.620
 apart salt and pepper 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.890
 now came the part that in my opinion 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.290
 is the one that is cooler and we are going to 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.270
 take our mix and we'll go 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.970
 putting on top of the salmon fillets 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.790
 we are going to disappear by the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:56.090
 part up on the sides like that and that 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:57.980
 all well well covered once all 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.620
 are well well anointed of our 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.660
 delicious mix you are going to place another 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.489
 spoonful of honey on top if it is 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.370
 you like this sweet touch that we can 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.250
 give food we will use a paper 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.010
 aluminum to be like the lid of 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.080
 our refractory or something like that but not 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.569
 it is completely necessary I give it to you 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.120
 I recommend so obviously it's going to 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.099
 delay much longer the time in which 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.920
 they sew the fish in the oven to stay 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.680
 a little richer we will place in 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.780
 our oven at 400 degrees and we 're going to 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.120
 leave for half an hour 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.819
 to accompany the fish I go to 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.790
 serve rice and what I do is take a 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.069
 coca as a little girl and put rice there 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.370
 and push it until it looks like a little 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.069
 compressed and then flipped it over the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.020
 dish are very nice and it's a way 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.819
 as more organized serving rice 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.390
 because I've always been a 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.510
 real disaster and look how it was 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.569
 truth is seen and smells and everything and knows 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.459
 very rich I recommend it very much 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.190
 because it is also a very option 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.190
 healthy to eat and really is 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.019
 I accompanied her with paprika and 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.019
 avocado leaflets 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.159
 i 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.670
 it really was delicious if you 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.250
 come to make this recipe with the 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.680

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.630

 they have an oven they can also do it in 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.389
 pan is obviously much richer 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.860
 in the oven but then also 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.600
 can and will also be very rich 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.669
