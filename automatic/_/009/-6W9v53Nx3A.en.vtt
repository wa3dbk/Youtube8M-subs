with<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.219> CVT<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.390> gets<00:01:00.600> 148<00:01:01.379> horsepower

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
with that CVT this gets 148 horsepower

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.420 
with that CVT this gets 148 horsepower
145<00:01:03.300> pound<00:01:03.660> feet<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.960> torque<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.070> opinion

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
145 pound feet of torque in my opinion

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
145 pound feet of torque in my opinion
this<00:01:05.519> engine<00:01:05.909> feels<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.450> little<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> weak

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
this engine feels a little on the weak

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:07.580 
this engine feels a little on the weak
side

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
side

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.219 
side
there's<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.460> much<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> form<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.479> pop<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
there's not much in the form of pop and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.399 
there's not much in the form of pop and
needs<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:10.979> muscle<00:01:11.760> my<00:01:12.630> thinking<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
needs more muscle my thinking is if the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.499 
needs more muscle my thinking is if the
word<00:01:13.560> Sport<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> title<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.939> should<00:01:15.240> be

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
word Sport is in the title it should be

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.899 
word Sport is in the title it should be
a<00:01:15.540> little<00:01:15.720> sporty<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.130> not<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.729> much

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
a little sporty and this is not so much

unfortunately<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.439> us<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:29.400> some<00:01:29.549> of

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
unfortunately for us I think some of
