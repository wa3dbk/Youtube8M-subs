00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
going to draw two more lines that come

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.570 
going to draw two more lines that come
down<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:40.230> want<00:02:40.380> these<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.040> about<00:02:41.370> the

down and you want these to be about the
same<00:02:42.410> same<00:02:43.410> distance<00:02:45.470> as<00:02:47.030> as<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.570> two<00:02:49.350> sides

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
same same distance as as the two sides

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.100 
same same distance as as the two sides
that<00:02:49.830> we<00:02:49.920> already<00:02:50.220> drew<00:02:50.450> good<00:02:51.450> job<00:02:51.690> dude<00:02:51.960> and

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
that we already drew good job dude and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.510 
that we already drew good job dude and
then<00:02:52.320> one<00:02:52.650> last<00:02:52.890> one<00:02:53.250> right<00:02:53.460> at<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.640> bottom

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
awesome so all of these should be

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.250 
awesome so all of these should be
roughly<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.710> same<00:02:58.860> same<00:02:59.790> size<00:03:00.050> that's<00:03:01.050> all

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
roughly the same same size that's all

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.330 
roughly the same same size that's all
right<00:03:01.380> yeah<00:03:01.680> you're<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.890> little<00:03:02.040> off-center

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
right yeah you're a little off-center

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.760 
right yeah you're a little off-center
that's<00:03:03.150> okay<00:03:03.510> because<00:03:03.690> your<00:03:04.050> soccer<00:03:04.320> ball<00:03:04.500> is

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
that's okay because your soccer ball is

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.470 
that's okay because your soccer ball is
going<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.010> look<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:05.250> it's<00:03:05.460> rolling<00:03:05.670> okay
