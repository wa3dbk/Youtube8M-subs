00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480

are<00:03:24.660> gonna<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.930> incredibly<00:03:25.410> easy<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.829> should

be consistent and now I think I can

be consistent and now I think I can
actually<00:03:29.010> see<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:30.180> turn<00:03:30.599> one<00:03:30.930> genex<00:03:31.440> undying

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920

trish and what it does for yang zing is
it<00:03:53.280> finally<00:03:53.639> gives<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.940> deck<00:03:54.120> some<00:03:54.359> non

targeting removal and it also gives the

deck something that it hasn't had before

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.379 
deck something that it hasn't had before
and<00:03:59.190> that's<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.519> way<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.730> attack<00:04:00.209> the

and that's a way to attack the
opponent's<00:04:00.840> graveyard<00:04:01.349> I<00:04:01.440> actually<00:04:01.560> think

opponent's graveyard I actually think

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.680 
opponent's graveyard I actually think
that<00:04:02.099> yang<00:04:02.340> zing<00:04:02.549> will<00:04:02.730> benefit<00:04:03.090> more<00:04:03.359> from

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.580 
teleport engine and he made top aides
and<00:06:30.370> I<00:06:30.730> think<00:06:31.000> that<00:06:31.240> the<00:06:31.420> turn<00:06:31.660> one<00:06:31.990> just<00:06:32.350> power

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
and I think that the turn one just power

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.760 
and I think that the turn one just power
play<00:06:32.890> of<00:06:33.220> multiple<00:06:33.670> connor<00:06:33.880> hawke<00:06:34.030> Spanish<00:06:34.480> is

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
play of multiple connor hawke Spanish is

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.810 
play of multiple connor hawke Spanish is
devastating<00:06:35.770> for<00:06:35.920> slower<00:06:36.100> pace<00:06:36.340> decks<00:06:36.610> like

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
devastating for slower pace decks like

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.580 
devastating for slower pace decks like
teller<00:06:37.090> Knights<00:06:37.330> and<00:06:37.630> CLE<00:06:37.930> forts<00:06:38.260> and<00:06:38.380> it's

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
teller Knights and CLE forts and it's

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.900 
teller Knights and CLE forts and it's
more<00:06:38.800> or<00:06:38.830> less<00:06:38.920> just<00:06:39.040> the

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
more or less just the

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.340 
more or less just the
moralizing<00:06:40.240> knowing<00:06:40.690> that<00:06:40.810> your<00:06:40.930> opponent

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
moralizing knowing that your opponent

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.050 
moralizing knowing that your opponent
was<00:06:41.440> supposed<00:06:41.830> to<00:06:41.950> have<00:06:42.130> five<00:06:42.340> cards<00:06:42.670> but<00:06:42.910> then

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
was supposed to have five cards but then

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.730 
was supposed to have five cards but then
they<00:06:43.180> ultimately<00:06:43.450> ended<00:06:44.170> their<00:06:44.290> turn<00:06:44.530> with

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
they ultimately ended their turn with

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.710 
they ultimately ended their turn with
like<00:06:44.920> five<00:06:45.340> or<00:06:45.790> or<00:06:46.060> excuse<00:06:46.300> me<00:06:46.360> they<00:06:46.540> ended

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
like five or or excuse me they ended

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.540 
like five or or excuse me they ended
their<00:06:46.870> turn<00:06:47.110> with<00:06:47.290> like<00:06:47.440> seven<00:06:47.950> maybe<00:06:48.160> even

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
their turn with like seven maybe even

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.790 
their turn with like seven maybe even
eight<00:06:48.760> cards<00:06:49.090> it's<00:06:49.660> really<00:06:50.140> really<00:06:50.410> potent

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
eight cards it's really really potent

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.740 
eight cards it's really really potent
and<00:06:51.040> I<00:06:51.340> think<00:06:51.610> that's<00:06:51.880> one<00:06:52.360> of<00:06:52.390> the<00:06:52.510> biggest

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
and I think that's one of the biggest

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.330 
and I think that's one of the biggest
reasons<00:06:53.110> that<00:06:53.290> rich<00:06:53.410> will<00:06:53.560> be<00:06:53.590> succeed<00:06:54.100> is

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
reasons that rich will be succeed is

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.010 
reasons that rich will be succeed is
that<00:06:54.520> most<00:06:54.940> people<00:06:55.060> just<00:06:55.300> don't<00:06:55.750> take<00:06:55.990> the

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
that most people just don't take the

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.750 
that most people just don't take the
death<00:06:56.320> very<00:06:56.530> seriously<00:06:57.040> you<00:06:57.190> really<00:06:57.520> don't

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
death very seriously you really don't

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.580 
death very seriously you really don't
see<00:06:57.940> people<00:06:58.120> siding<00:06:58.630> that<00:06:58.660> heavy<00:06:59.020> Fortin

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
see people siding that heavy Fortin

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.900 
see people siding that heavy Fortin
that's<00:07:00.100> why<00:07:00.250> the<00:07:00.310> deck<00:07:00.580> has<00:07:00.730> been

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
that's why the deck has been

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.880 
that's why the deck has been
consistently<00:07:01.600> topping<00:07:02.140> over<00:07:02.500> like<00:07:02.680> the<00:07:02.860> last

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
consistently topping over like the last

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.070 
consistently topping over like the last

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
think we're there any budget decks that

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.760 
think we're there any budget decks that
are<00:07:07.240> really<00:07:07.510> good<00:07:07.690> that<00:07:07.840> I<00:07:07.870> missed<00:07:08.200> out<00:07:08.410> on<00:07:08.440> if
