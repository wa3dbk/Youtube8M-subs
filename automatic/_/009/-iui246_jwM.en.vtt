 strange stressed are circles 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.570
 perfectly designed on the seabed of the 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.830
 sea ​​for example off the island of 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.660
 10 8

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.180
 300 meters from each other 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.340

 maso may added is a mystery not 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.970
 grows in the center of these circles only 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.430
 sand 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.470
 we are carrying out chemical analyzes 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.440
 to see a little more clearly in this 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.830
 case it is as if the plants of the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.160
 poseidonia were extracted with gods 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.160
 corkscrew 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.660
 we do not know when or how we are 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.880
 formats but there must be a reason 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.910
 on the question of agata d'agata 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.640

 cases in particular of the association 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.910
 environmentalist sums to explain this 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.149
 phenomenon 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.369
 that is, an illegal fishing also 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.060
 in any case the dynamite or 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.310
 polls to look for oil but these 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:22.770
 two activities leave different marks 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:24.750
 sea ​​bottoms according to the TV because 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.440
 four sata the inhabitants of the region 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.760

 from art the short and mostly on

 cost 3 I gave the accuracy of 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.400
 this makes sense according to the sea said 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:51.129
 merkel some difficulty might 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:54.440
 to have been sent by man I want

 I would assume an original was anyway 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.299
 I throw it there 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:02.870
 I know I'm a conspiracy theorist of us 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.890
 scandalizes no one now and the thing does not

 may not be the well-known 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.569
 interesting they let me know what

 do you think that the days you did the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.599
 channel of everything for finished that is good 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.599
 to the sentence
