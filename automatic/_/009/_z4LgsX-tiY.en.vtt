corruption<00:01:16.160> that<00:01:16.490> that's<00:01:16.790> definitely<00:01:17.120> one

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
corruption that that's definitely one

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.410 
corruption that that's definitely one
part<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:17.840> but<00:01:18.440> then<00:01:18.590> there's<00:01:18.740> also<00:01:18.830> the

resource curse pretty much one area

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.300 
resource curse pretty much one area
we'll<00:01:23.450> just<00:01:23.810> rely<00:01:24.110> on<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.350> one<00:01:24.560> resource<00:01:24.980> and

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
we'll just rely on that one resource and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.410 
we'll just rely on that one resource and
if<00:01:25.370> something<00:01:25.520> happens<00:01:25.910> to<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.090> price<00:01:26.240> of

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
if something happens to the price of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.690 
if something happens to the price of
that<00:01:26.480> resource<00:01:26.870> or<00:01:27.140> for<00:01:27.830> some<00:01:28.010> reason<00:01:28.340> there

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
that resource or for some reason there

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.970 
that resource or for some reason there
is<00:01:28.730> no<00:01:28.820> resource<00:01:29.300> left<00:01:29.540> then<00:01:29.990> that<00:01:30.290> community

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
is no resource left then that community

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.250 
is no resource left then that community
has<00:01:31.130> no<00:01:31.340> has<00:01:31.940> no<00:01:32.060> means<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.390> income<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.110> what

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
has no has no means of income so what

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.780

its mia donna supplies man-made diamonds

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.690 
its mia donna supplies man-made diamonds
in<00:01:47.300> Risa<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.050> recycled<00:01:48.620> gold<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:49.250> it's<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.460> cost

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
in Risa and recycled gold so it's a cost

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.940 
in Risa and recycled gold so it's a cost

repair<00:01:57.950> diamond<00:01:58.310> mining<00:01:58.490> communities<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.200> can

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
repair diamond mining communities so can

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.980 
repair diamond mining communities so can
these<00:02:00.680> be<00:02:00.890> called<00:02:01.330> for<00:02:02.330> one<00:02:02.420> of<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.600> better<00:02:02.780> word

it's<00:02:08.720> exactly<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.379> same<00:02:09.560> just<00:02:09.590> made<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.069> a

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
it's exactly the same just made in a

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.860 
it's exactly the same just made in a
controlled<00:02:10.489> environment<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:11.330> that's

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
controlled environment and that's

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.360 
controlled environment and that's
exactly<00:02:12.049> what<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.349> man-made<00:02:12.709> diamonds<00:02:12.890> are<00:02:13.190> so

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
exactly what a man-made diamonds are so

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.130 
exactly what a man-made diamonds are so
how<00:02:13.580> do<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.760> make<00:02:13.940> your<00:02:13.970> man-made<00:02:14.750> diamonds

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
how do you make your man-made diamonds

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.870 
how do you make your man-made diamonds
okay<00:02:15.650> well<00:02:15.860> there's<00:02:16.069> two<00:02:16.400> there's<00:02:16.790> two

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
okay well there's two there's two

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.840 
okay well there's two there's two

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
man-made diamonds down here which are

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.290 
man-made diamonds down here which are
made<00:02:22.380> they're<00:02:23.250> growing<00:02:23.490> their<00:02:23.580> optically<00:02:24.120> and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
made they're growing their optically and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
growing in a chamber of heat and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.570 
growing in a chamber of heat and
pressure<00:02:28.160> unfortunately<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.250> can't<00:02:29.430> give

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
pressure unfortunately we can't give

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.190 
pressure unfortunately we can't give
them<00:02:29.610> totally<00:02:30.120> colorless<00:02:30.450> yet<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:30.870> can't<00:02:31.080> give

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
them totally colorless yet we can't give

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170 
them totally colorless yet we can't give
them<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.410> very<00:02:31.590> large<00:02:31.770> sizes<00:02:32.160> then<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.030> that's

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
them in very large sizes then so that's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.340 
them in very large sizes then so that's
why<00:02:33.300> we've<00:02:33.450> developed<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.990> hybrid

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
why we've developed the hybrid

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.140 
why we've developed the hybrid
technology<00:02:34.980> which<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.280> very<00:02:35.520> similar<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
technology which is very similar to a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.420 
technology which is very similar to a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
cultured pearl has a seed in the center

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.010 
cultured pearl has a seed in the center
it's<00:02:38.580> not<00:02:38.730> diamond<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> support<00:02:39.540> crystal<00:02:39.930> we

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
it's not diamond to support crystal we

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.810 
it's not diamond to support crystal we
make<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.380> lab<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.740> then<00:02:41.130> we<00:02:41.250> infuse<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
make in the lab and then we infuse the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.700 
make in the lab and then we infuse the
same<00:02:42.060> man<00:02:42.270> made<00:02:42.480> diamond<00:02:42.630> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:42.990> outer<00:02:43.380> layer

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
same man made diamond on the outer layer

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.220 
same man made diamond on the outer layer
but<00:02:44.430> by<00:02:44.520> doing<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.910> we<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.210> get<00:02:45.390> them<00:02:45.600> very

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
but by doing this we can get them very

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.070 
but by doing this we can get them very
large<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.650> size<00:02:46.830> how<00:02:47.640> long<00:02:47.910> from<00:02:48.180> shall<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:48.900> say

situational jewelry sister sure sure our

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.330 
situational jewelry sister sure sure our
hybrids<00:02:55.050> take<00:02:55.410> about<00:02:55.590> three<00:02:55.830> months<00:02:55.950> and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
hybrids take about three months and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.010 
hybrids take about three months and
that's<00:02:56.670> with<00:02:56.880> quality<00:02:57.270> control<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:57.840> just

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
that's with quality control we just

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.140 
that's with quality control we just
check<00:02:58.230> every<00:02:58.560> single<00:02:58.740> point<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.910> that's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
check every single point of it that's

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.210 
check every single point of it that's
why<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.390> takes<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:00.750> long<00:03:01.020> but<00:03:01.890> our<00:03:01.920> man-made

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
why it takes so long but our man-made

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.980 
why it takes so long but our man-made
diamonds<00:03:02.730> take<00:03:02.850> up<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> year<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.510> make<00:03:03.810> when

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
diamonds take up to a year to make when

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.510 
diamonds take up to a year to make when
we<00:03:04.080> lose<00:03:04.380> about<00:03:04.710> ninety<00:03:05.040> percent<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.340> what<00:03:05.490> we

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
we lose about ninety percent of what we

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.800 
we lose about ninety percent of what we
make<00:03:05.820> cuz<00:03:06.060> that's<00:03:06.270> growing<00:03:06.480> I'm<00:03:06.660> not<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
make cuz that's growing I'm not a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.540 
make cuz that's growing I'm not a
geologist<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.560> suspect<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.070> diamonds

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
geologist and I suspect that diamonds

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.370 
geologist and I suspect that diamonds
mined<00:03:08.850> out<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.210> ground<00:03:09.420> are<00:03:09.900> formed<00:03:10.230> over

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
mined out of the ground are formed over

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.200 
mined out of the ground are formed over
what<00:03:10.620> millions<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.220> millions<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.730> years<00:03:11.910> and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
what millions and millions of years and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.250 
what millions and millions of years and
now<00:03:12.330> we<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.480> chambers<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:13.020> heat<00:03:13.140> and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
now we have chambers of heat and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.530 
now we have chambers of heat and
pressure<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.680> mimic<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.010> exact<00:03:14.540> natural

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
pressure that mimic the exact natural

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.000 
pressure that mimic the exact natural
environment<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:16.710> you<00:03:17.640> know<00:03:17.810> real<00:03:18.810> love<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.200> at

man-made<00:03:20.520> diamonds<00:03:20.670> are<00:03:21.270> they<00:03:22.050> are<00:03:22.260> real<00:03:22.530> in

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
man-made diamonds are they are real in

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.780 
man-made diamonds are they are real in
the<00:03:22.800> sense<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.100> they're<00:03:23.310> chemically

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the sense that they're chemically

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.780 
the sense that they're chemically
identical<00:03:24.030> there<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.720> no<00:03:25.110> difference

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
identical there is no difference

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.380 
identical there is no difference
absolutely<00:03:26.790> no<00:03:26.910> difference<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.300> they're

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
absolutely no difference and they're

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.760 
absolutely no difference and they're
also<00:03:27.510> graded<00:03:27.870> just<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.350> an<00:03:28.470> earth<00:03:28.560> mine

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
also graded just like an earth mine

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.020 
also graded just like an earth mine
diamond<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:30.030> one<00:03:30.210> quick<00:03:30.480> question<00:03:30.660> um

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
diamond is just one quick question um

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.700 
diamond is just one quick question um
diamonds<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.720> main<00:03:33.870> use<00:03:34.050> of<00:03:34.080> diamonds<00:03:34.590> and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
diamonds is the main use of diamonds and

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.250 
diamonds is the main use of diamonds and
jewelry<00:03:35.040> or<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.550> in<00:03:36.110> industrial<00:03:37.110> and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
jewelry or is that in industrial and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.930 
jewelry or is that in industrial and
that's<00:03:37.680> where<00:03:37.920> we<00:03:37.950> first<00:03:38.370> got<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.640> idea<00:03:38.670> of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
that's where we first got the idea of

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.030 
that's where we first got the idea of
the<00:03:39.030> hybrid<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.780> there's<00:03:39.960> more<00:03:40.140> diamonds<00:03:40.860> used

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
the hybrid so there's more diamonds used

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.920 
the hybrid so there's more diamonds used
in<00:03:41.190> industrial<00:03:41.340> machinery<00:03:41.940> on<00:03:42.150> their<00:03:42.300> own<00:03:42.420> but

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
in industrial machinery on their own but

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.620 
in industrial machinery on their own but
even<00:03:43.170> rohrich<00:03:43.680> coat<00:03:44.280> their<00:03:44.490> kazem<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.150> diamond

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
even rohrich coat their kazem in diamond

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.770 
even rohrich coat their kazem in diamond
nASA<00:03:46.500> uses<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.430> coat<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.910> Hubble<00:03:48.240> when<00:03:48.690> it

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
nASA uses it to coat the Hubble when it

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.120 
nASA uses it to coat the Hubble when it
goes<00:03:48.870> into<00:03:49.080> space<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.620> because<00:03:49.830> diamond

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
goes into space just because diamond

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.950 
goes into space just because diamond
obviously<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.760> hardest<00:03:51.270> on<00:03:51.450> substance

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
obviously is the hardest on substance

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.210 
obviously is the hardest on substance
two<00:03:52.110> men<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:52.620> at<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.800> moment<00:03:53.100> you're<00:03:53.190> just

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
two men then at the moment you're just

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.590 
two men then at the moment you're just
making<00:03:53.610> diamonds<00:03:53.790> for<00:03:54.060> jewelry<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.450> now<00:03:54.540> we

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
making diamonds for jewelry and now we

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.390 
making diamonds for jewelry and now we
brought<00:03:54.840> them<00:03:54.990> into<00:03:55.110> gem<00:03:55.410> quality<00:03:55.560> exactly

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
brought them into gem quality exactly

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.510 
brought them into gem quality exactly
yeah<00:03:56.850> its<00:03:57.090> crystallized<00:03:57.540> carbon<00:03:57.950> it's<00:03:58.950> it's

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
yeah its crystallized carbon it's it's

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.540 
yeah its crystallized carbon it's it's
really<00:04:00.120> not<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.600> hard<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.080> make<00:04:01.380> yeah<00:04:02.250> I

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
really not that hard to make yeah I

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.870 
really not that hard to make yeah I
suppose<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.390> important<00:04:03.840> thing<00:04:03.960> as<00:04:04.080> far<00:04:04.470> as

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
suppose the important thing as far as

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.900 
suppose the important thing as far as
diamonds<00:04:05.900> consumption<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:07.020> concerned<00:04:07.440> for

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
diamonds consumption is concerned for

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.310 
diamonds consumption is concerned for
the<00:04:08.910> woman<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.390> street<00:04:09.660> or<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.900> woman<00:04:10.200> who

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
the woman on the street or the woman who

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.040 
the woman on the street or the woman who
wants<00:04:10.650> some<00:04:10.860> nice<00:04:11.160> jewelry<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.510> price<00:04:12.780> so

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
wants some nice jewelry is the price so

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.370 
wants some nice jewelry is the price so
how<00:04:13.380> much<00:04:13.530> cheaper<00:04:14.130> are<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.550> then<00:04:15.380> diamonds

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
how much cheaper are you then diamonds

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.470 
how much cheaper are you then diamonds
mined<00:04:16.530> out<00:04:16.710> of<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.880> man-made<00:04:17.880> diamonds<00:04:18.270> even

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
mined out of the man-made diamonds even

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.560 
mined out of the man-made diamonds even
though<00:04:18.540> they're<00:04:18.720> totally<00:04:19.850> eco-friendly<00:04:20.850> they

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
though they're totally eco-friendly they

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.760 
though they're totally eco-friendly they
are<00:04:21.690> about<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.960> same<00:04:22.080> price<00:04:22.260> as<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:22.650> earth

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
are about the same price as in earth

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.070 
are about the same price as in earth

Sierra Leone but the diamond industry in
Sierra<00:05:13.389> Leone<00:05:13.629> totally<00:05:14.379> corrupt<00:05:14.679> as<00:05:14.799> far<00:05:14.949> as

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
Sierra Leone totally corrupt as far as

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.819 
Sierra Leone totally corrupt as far as
you<00:05:15.129> can<00:05:15.279> see<00:05:15.599> I<00:05:16.599> think<00:05:17.049> there<00:05:17.199> needs<00:05:17.409> to<00:05:17.679> be<00:05:17.709> a

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:17.829 
you can see I think there needs to be a

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:20.429 
you can see I think there needs to be a
much<00:05:18.669> better<00:05:18.699> way<00:05:19.360> of<00:05:19.389> managing<00:05:19.839> the<00:05:20.019> Natural

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
much better way of managing the Natural

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.279 
much better way of managing the Natural
Resources<00:05:20.860> yes<00:05:21.239> and<00:05:22.239> what<00:05:22.659> I<00:05:22.689> found<00:05:22.989> when<00:05:23.229> I

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
Resources yes and what I found when I

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.269 
Resources yes and what I found when I
was<00:05:23.499> there<00:05:23.889> is<00:05:24.809> it<00:05:25.809> never<00:05:26.469> comes<00:05:26.709> back<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:27.189> the

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
was there is it never comes back to the

was there is it never comes back to the
local<00:05:27.639> people<00:05:28.079> even<00:05:29.079> though<00:05:29.259> the<00:05:29.409> kono

local people even though the kono

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:31.949 
local people even though the kono
district<00:05:30.159> is<00:05:30.279> so<00:05:30.639> wealthy<00:05:31.119> and<00:05:31.299> diamonds<00:05:31.779> I

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:31.959 
district is so wealthy and diamonds I

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.259 
district is so wealthy and diamonds I
mean<00:05:32.379> it's<00:05:32.529> it's<00:05:33.189> common<00:05:33.639> to<00:05:33.729> find<00:05:33.759> a<00:05:33.969> diamond

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:34.269 
mean it's it's common to find a diamond

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:35.819 
mean it's it's common to find a diamond
on<00:05:34.329> the<00:05:34.389> ground<00:05:34.629> when<00:05:34.779> it<00:05:34.869> rains<00:05:35.079> heavily<00:05:35.469> or

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:37.239 
if the ground shifts a little that's how

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:39.509 
if the ground shifts a little that's how
it<00:05:37.360> bundan<00:05:37.689> it<00:05:37.779> is<00:05:37.929> in<00:05:38.050> diamonds<00:05:38.379> yet<00:05:39.039> the

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:39.519 
it bundan it is in diamonds yet the

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.189 
it bundan it is in diamonds yet the
local<00:05:39.759> people<00:05:39.909> never<00:05:40.179> see<00:05:40.479> any<00:05:40.719> of<00:05:40.809> that<00:05:41.019> the

local people never see any of that the

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.499 
local people never see any of that the
poverty<00:05:41.679> is<00:05:41.860> is<00:05:42.669> just<00:05:42.999> nothing<00:05:43.179> I've<00:05:43.389> seen

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
poverty is is just nothing I've seen

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.299 
poverty is is just nothing I've seen
before<00:05:43.569> but<00:05:44.439> many<00:05:44.679> of<00:05:44.829> the<00:05:44.919> world's<00:05:45.159> most

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:45.309 
before but many of the world's most

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:47.699 
before but many of the world's most
famous<00:05:45.459> diamonds<00:05:45.819> come<00:05:46.509> from<00:05:46.809> places<00:05:47.469> that

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:47.709 
famous diamonds come from places that

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:50.009 
famous diamonds come from places that
you'd<00:05:47.979> like<00:05:48.009> to<00:05:48.159> say<00:05:48.579> are<00:05:49.209> civilized<00:05:49.719> and

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:50.019 
you'd like to say are civilized and

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:51.269 
you'd like to say are civilized and
surely<00:05:50.439> there's<00:05:50.589> not<00:05:50.679> the<00:05:50.800> corruption<00:05:51.189> in

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
surely there's not the corruption in

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.189 
surely there's not the corruption in
those<00:05:51.399> places<00:05:51.639> like<00:05:51.969> bull<00:05:52.209> australia

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
those places like bull australia

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.309 
those places like bull australia
australia<00:05:53.819> industry<00:05:54.819> russia<00:05:55.449> russia<00:05:55.989> has

australia industry russia russia has

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.709 
australia industry russia russia has
again<00:05:56.860> and<00:05:57.159> South<00:05:57.669> Africa<00:05:58.119> is<00:05:58.239> I<00:05:58.479> guess<00:05:58.689> the

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
again and South Africa is I guess the

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.169 
again and South Africa is I guess the
place<00:05:59.079> that<00:05:59.289> we<00:05:59.549> associate<00:06:00.549> most<00:06:00.999> with

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:01.179 
place that we associate most with

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:03.899 
place that we associate most with
diamonds<00:06:01.569> don't<00:06:01.749> we<00:06:01.919> they<00:06:02.919> don't<00:06:03.099> suffer<00:06:03.549> too

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
diamonds don't we they don't suffer too

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:05.669 
diamonds don't we they don't suffer too
much<00:06:03.939> from<00:06:04.269> the<00:06:04.419> humanity<00:06:04.929> aspect<00:06:05.439> but<00:06:05.559> the

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:05.679 
much from the humanity aspect but the

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:07.049 
much from the humanity aspect but the
environmental<00:06:06.309> aspect<00:06:06.699> is<00:06:06.849> just

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:07.059 
environmental aspect is just

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:10.469 
environmental aspect is just
catastrophic<00:06:07.659> I<00:06:08.229> mean<00:06:08.889> to<00:06:08.919> mine<00:06:09.279> one<00:06:09.969> carat

and for the gold on the other hand we

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:17.939 
and for the gold on the other hand we
actually<00:06:16.929> have<00:06:17.019> to<00:06:17.079> mix<00:06:17.199> that<00:06:17.349> with<00:06:17.499> cyanide

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
actually have to mix that with cyanide

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:19.559 
actually have to mix that with cyanide
to<00:06:18.189> get<00:06:18.309> the<00:06:18.399> gold<00:06:18.549> out<00:06:18.669> of<00:06:18.729> the<00:06:18.849> dirt<00:06:19.059> and<00:06:19.329> then

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569 
to get the gold out of the dirt and then

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:20.639 
to get the gold out of the dirt and then
the<00:06:19.659> dirts<00:06:19.839> released<00:06:20.229> into<00:06:20.469> the<00:06:20.499> natural

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:20.649 
the dirts released into the natural

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:24.179 
the dirts released into the natural
environment<00:06:21.089> but<00:06:22.089> the<00:06:22.809> funny<00:06:23.229> thing<00:06:23.319> is<00:06:23.529> gold

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
environment but the funny thing is gold

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.759 
environment but the funny thing is gold
and<00:06:24.459> platinum<00:06:24.669> is<00:06:24.999> is<00:06:25.209> easy<00:06:25.539> to<00:06:25.779> recycle<00:06:26.110> as<00:06:26.559> it

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:26.769 
and platinum is is easy to recycle as it

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:29.429 
and platinum is is easy to recycle as it
is<00:06:26.889> an<00:06:27.129> aluminium<00:06:27.279> can<00:06:27.939> and<00:06:28.299> so<00:06:28.509> really<00:06:29.289> that's

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:29.439 
is an aluminium can and so really that's

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:31.289 
is an aluminium can and so really that's
that's<00:06:29.889> where<00:06:30.129> what<00:06:30.399> we're<00:06:30.549> doing<00:06:30.789> now<00:06:30.939> it's

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:31.299 
that's where what we're doing now it's

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:32.699 
that's where what we're doing now it's
just<00:06:31.449> recycling<00:06:31.899> a<00:06:32.019> fascinating<00:06:32.499> concept

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:32.709 
just recycling a fascinating concept

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:34.679 
just recycling a fascinating concept
