remote desktop connection it allows you
to<00:00:09.719> use<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.200> pc<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.800> connect<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.160> another<00:00:11.250> pc

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
to use one pc to connect to another pc

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.450 
to use one pc to connect to another pc
in<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.150> different<00:00:12.480> location<00:00:12.889> you<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:14.040> then<00:00:14.219> use

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
in a different location you can then use

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.890 
in a different location you can then use
the<00:00:14.610> remote<00:00:14.820> computer<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.540> if<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.809> were

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
the remote computer as if you were

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.080 
the remote computer as if you were
sitting<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.230> front<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.880> you<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.000> even

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
sitting in front of it you can even

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.790 
sitting in front of it you can even
print<00:00:18.359> out<00:00:18.570> documents<00:00:19.080> for<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> remote<00:00:19.410> pc

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
print out documents for the remote pc

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.759 
print out documents for the remote pc
directly<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.550> your<00:00:20.640> local<00:00:20.880> printer<00:00:21.619> you<00:00:22.619> may

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
directly to your local printer you may

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.439 
directly to your local printer you may
have<00:00:22.890> used<00:00:23.100> something<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.490> logmein<00:00:24.060> before

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
have used something like logmein before

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.179 
have used something like logmein before
to<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> features<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
to do this but with the features and

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.769 
to do this but with the features and
speed<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> remote<00:00:26.820> desktop<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.359> think<00:00:27.660> it's

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
speed a remote desktop I think it's

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.679 
speed a remote desktop I think it's
worth<00:00:27.930> giving<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> try<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.849> use<00:00:29.970> any<00:00:30.179> pc

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
worth giving it a try you can use any pc

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.330 
worth giving it a try you can use any pc
to<00:00:30.840> initiate<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> connection<00:00:31.769> but<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
to initiate the connection but the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.040 
to initiate the connection but the
remote<00:00:32.579> machine<00:00:32.940> needs<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.270> pro<00:00:33.540> version<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
remote machine needs a pro version of

from a windows 8 to windows 7 machine so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.880 
from a windows 8 to windows 7 machine so
some<00:00:39.930> settings<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.440> different<00:00:40.649> if
