00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.380 
extinguishers are in a facility maybe
you<00:00:33.160> just<00:00:33.250> know<00:00:33.460> instinctively<00:00:33.880> where<00:00:34.300> they

all are or how does that all work that's
a<00:00:36.130> good<00:00:36.280> question

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
a good question

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.940 
a good question
we<00:00:37.060> actually<00:00:37.210> have<00:00:37.480> a<00:00:37.510> personal<00:00:38.320> rep<00:00:38.500> computer

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
we actually have a personal rep computer

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.100 
we actually have a personal rep computer
it<00:00:39.700> stores<00:00:40.000> all<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.300> customers<00:00:40.750> information

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
it stores all the customers information

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.650 
it stores all the customers information
inside<00:00:42.010> here<00:00:42.579> so<00:00:42.910> when<00:00:43.210> we<00:00:43.300> go<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.450> the

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
inside here so when we go to the

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.020 
inside here so when we go to the
facility<00:00:43.809> we're<00:00:44.350> able<00:00:44.469> to<00:00:44.739> find<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.130> size<00:00:45.370> and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
facility we're able to find the size and

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.700 
facility we're able to find the size and
type<00:00:46.570> and<00:00:46.840> location<00:00:47.020> of<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:47.500> fire

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
extinguisher but it also gives us the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.270 
extinguisher but it also gives us the
option<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.050> print<00:00:50.470> out<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:50.710> invoice<00:00:50.980> at<00:00:51.160> the

the fire extinguisher you look at the
gauge<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.630> make<00:00:55.780> sure<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.050> hasn't<00:00:56.350> been

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
gauge and make sure it hasn't been

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.740 
gauge and make sure it hasn't been
discharged<00:00:57.690> once<00:00:58.690> that<00:00:58.840> happens<00:00:59.230> I<00:01:00.630> like<00:01:01.630> to

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
discharged once that happens I like to

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.000 
discharged once that happens I like to
clean<00:01:01.930> off<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.079> fire<00:01:02.380> extinguisher<00:01:02.890> that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
clean off the fire extinguisher that

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.979 
clean off the fire extinguisher that
helps<00:01:03.220> me<00:01:03.340> feel<00:01:03.550> for<00:01:03.730> any<00:01:03.910> bits<00:01:04.150> things

rust<00:01:05.909> gouges<00:01:06.909> okay<00:01:07.390> while<00:01:08.290> I'm<00:01:08.409> doing<00:01:08.680> that<00:01:08.710> it

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
rust gouges okay while I'm doing that it

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.200 
rust gouges okay while I'm doing that it
gives<00:01:09.100> me<00:01:09.189> a<00:01:09.250> chance<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.610> look<00:01:09.759> at<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> dates

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
gives me a chance to look at the dates

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.270 
gives me a chance to look at the dates
on<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.479> fire<00:01:10.659> extinguisher<00:01:11.320> why<00:01:12.040> as

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
inspection or a hydrostatic test what it

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.660 
inspection or a hydrostatic test what it
has<00:01:19.630> internal<00:01:20.409> inspection<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:21.130> when<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.430> fire

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
has internal inspection is when the fire

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.940 
has internal inspection is when the fire
extinguisher<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.590> completely<00:01:23.590> broken<00:01:23.800> down

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
extinguisher is completely broken down

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.980 
extinguisher is completely broken down
and<00:01:24.400> internal<00:01:24.880> parts<00:01:25.180> are<00:01:25.330> removed<00:01:25.720> and

and internal parts are removed and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.480 
and internal parts are removed and
replaced<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:27.300> hydrostatic<00:01:28.300> test<00:01:29.490> basically

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
replaced a hydrostatic test basically

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.340 
replaced a hydrostatic test basically
the<00:01:30.729> same<00:01:30.940> thing<00:01:31.180> as<00:01:31.330> internal<00:01:31.990> maintenance

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
the same thing as internal maintenance

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.110 
the same thing as internal maintenance
but<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.830> cylinder<00:01:33.220> itself<00:01:33.490> actually<00:01:33.940> gets

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
but the cylinder itself actually gets

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.340 
but the cylinder itself actually gets
pressurized<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:34.810> tested

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
pressurized and tested

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.600 
pressurized and tested
okay<00:01:36.150> once<00:01:37.150> that's<00:01:37.299> done<00:01:37.600> take<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:39.159> hose<00:01:39.340> off

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
give it a quick blow to make sure

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.660 
give it a quick blow to make sure
there's<00:01:43.690> nothing<00:01:43.930> obstructing<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.560> flow<00:01:44.770> the
