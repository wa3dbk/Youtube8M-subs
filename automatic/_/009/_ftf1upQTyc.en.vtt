and you do a little fat and by doing
this<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:37.950> also<00:02:38.100> find<00:02:38.430> other<00:02:38.670> glitches

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
this you can also find other glitches

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.350 
this you can also find other glitches
and<00:02:39.450> sheets<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:40.410> well<00:02:40.700> which<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.880> found<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.270> the
