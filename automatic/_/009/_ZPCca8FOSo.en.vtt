00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
we have one structure deck which I guess

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.250 
we have one structure deck which I guess
I'll<00:01:01.940> all<00:01:02.120> open<00:01:02.360> one<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.600> them<00:01:02.719> but<00:01:02.960> because<00:01:03.050> i

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
have three of the boxes there's no point

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.910 
have three of the boxes there's no point
in<00:01:04.790> opening<00:01:04.940> three<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.290> same<00:01:06.470> structure

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
in opening three of the same structure

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.230
