00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 then never heard the analysis in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.220
 conference where he was when already so much 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.370
 of the match 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.349
 try to see a positivity because 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.360
 tonight with a team that like 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.250
 all the others came here and started 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.990
 they were everywhere 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.150
 instead you make the goal then you do another 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.189
 goals are among the many solutions 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.410
 maybe a little different than usual for 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.349
 unhinge this kind of team thing 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.869
 kind of attitude of the opponents you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.120
 Thank you talk like you 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.770
 you will realize that tomorrow will count only 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.149
 result all these things do not 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.700
 look nobody 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.550
 we must not continue to do so a 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.550
 really amazing period where it is 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.690
 difficult to find justifications 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.820
 rational and logical because the team has 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.399
 made today with livorno and true the second 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
 time is not seen danger is a little 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.059
 our fault that we are not in Livorno 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.449
 made a little reach we thought of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.430
 therefore win over these errors of this kind 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 the three games should not be made but today 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.170
 at home they are unbelievable if not 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.630
 there is a logical justification for saying 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.299
 we even made two draws and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.250
 a defeat 4 equal with the salt today 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.799
 as rightly said that we have 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.140
 try all different solutions and there 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.060
 they went really well too 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.759
 the program that was written that also 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.400
 today at the first cross from the trocar a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.330
 our boy slid the ball of 2 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.130
 a 2 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 we recapture we throw back in front and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.790
 let's do some nice things 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.650
 net rigor of the otherwise speaks up 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.170
 he probably would have made it 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.650
 and then we're wrong too, that goes wrong 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.960
 all 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.790
 let's take it this way since Tuesday we reload 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.380
 we think about the next and we hope that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.079
 then the wind changes a little because 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.990
 actually now it turns too badly 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.930
 to be true Florentine Rome Verona 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.340
 three games at the time that looked like 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.310
 7 points very complicated 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.630
 now comes a calendar and I know if 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.490
 I tell you parma you say no there is the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.200
 sampdoria first i would like chiric 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.539
 sampdoria parma naples derby matches that 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.150
 as a level of difficulty, perhaps meanwhile 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.500
 bring us different teams to play 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.080
 in the house of others 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.090
 between conceiving on four can change 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.250
 something 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.959
 look at me work on performance co 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.129
 I see what the team does see 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.709
 the one that made the team with the 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.660
 teams that go for the most ha 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.690
 always done well I see what they do 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.940
 the teams are the least not anyway 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.260
 in the ranking I'm not like today with 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.540
 leghorn 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.810
 I don't think there is much to say except 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.120
 in the match and livorno the second half 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.340
 both with the atanta and with the Udine that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.110
 it is however on teams difficult to 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.940
 deal with scorbutic we did a 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.099
 performance level is better than that of 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.049
 what the teams that are the most do 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.470
 high of him in the charts that unfortunately 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.690
 I don't collect this then us 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.690
 we hope that maybe with the teams like 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.100
 you say more accredited maybe go there 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.480
 something well maybe thousands of whether the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.190
 play a bit of petri had been 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.900
 different 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.170
 we will see that we try to continue 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.819
 improve the various defects and see if 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.069
 then it also generates us a little bit because 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.010
 now there is also a good talk of that 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.459
 that maybe roberto good evening mister has 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.450
 always on the subject of positivity 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.950
 we said before instead it really liked 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.340
 the attitude with which kovacic entry 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.440
 in the field today he has had so many 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.480
 playable balls and ran behind it 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.000
 that on the final occasion it was 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.829
 the last man despite being relationship 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.480
 previous one behind three 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.040
 quarters so he really gave it all 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.630
 what she had she liked yes 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.730
 together to improve like so many to see it 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.980
 finite median and from median when c is 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.239
 school was the uncovering starts from 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.329
 behind for preventive coverage 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.000
 because we placed our we had gone 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.160
 all ahead to try to score goals and has 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.959
 made a great run is tried to like 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.359
 he did and if you saw him hernanes 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.410
 they tried to plug up to the last 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.360
 the counter-attacks were 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.620
 the two medians of the moment belonged to them 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.320
 they did it with all the commitment 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.460
 which needed very well 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.140
 Good evening, he always wanted me 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.930
 instead a comment on two episodes the 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.310
 first I wanted to know what he thinks 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.780
 of the action that led to the first goal 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.700
 of mauro icardi because the ball in short 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.410
 the action begun by the defense is there 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.570
 been a collective ball ride i guess 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.459
 that for the job that a coach 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.980
 prepare in the week ago face you 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.540
 no, thank goodness there is someone e 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.530
 look at some market in a way 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.180
 different thanks 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.650
 manual action instead of this other 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.600
 what a bit maybe made her angry 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:40.070
 the goal always taken from a throw-in 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:42.380
 side covered by a coach is one 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.540
 situation that if already proposed we say 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.210
 in a first race on this from remittance 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.480
 side you on the sky several times 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.580
 pointed out the parity with the atanta and e 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.350
 it seems to me that this shows that kind of 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.440
 fragility that we often have 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.910
 spoken and that is the thing that does not 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.340
 make this team with the jump of 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.680
 quality that should have good and more e 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.690
 the more we will pay everything right now 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.330
 and that the first and 100 goals take place 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.090
 however they could be remediable 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.950
 and it went all the competition does not 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.630
 ball that attracts patience after the end 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.540
 it passed between the legs if it did not have 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.880
 diverted he could resume handanovic e 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.240
 there really is we have made 100 shots 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.800
 from the edge of the area and so quela 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.720
 ball always ended up on them 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.730
 rebound goes to the end there was someone e 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.280
 he put his foot away he sent her away 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.890
 moment to the boys is a high moment is 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.290
 difficult to explain lire and explain it with 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.120
 a rational ojika dap roll from people 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.700
 human there are so many things that are not there 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.530
 moments when whatever you do you like 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.720
 all wrong 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.270
 thanks to mister two days of rest then 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.130
