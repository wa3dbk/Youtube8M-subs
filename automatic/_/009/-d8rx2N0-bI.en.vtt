00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
riding it splashes up in the upper

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.050 
riding it splashes up in the upper
lining<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.229> upper<00:01:50.159> lining<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.729> very

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
lining and that upper lining is very

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.120 
lining and that upper lining is very
delicate<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:52.470> burn<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> hole<00:01:52.920> through<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
delicate and can burn a hole through it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.499 
delicate and can burn a hole through it
as<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.520> 15<00:01:53.850> minutes<00:01:54.119> will<00:01:54.210> open<00:01:54.420> your

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
as little as 15 minutes will open your

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.420 
as little as 15 minutes will open your
horse<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.810> an<00:01:54.869> empty<00:01:55.020> stomach<00:01:55.259> while<00:01:55.500> I've

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
horse on an empty stomach while I've

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
horse on an empty stomach while I've
talked<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.119> people<00:01:57.509> about<00:01:57.719> horse

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
talked to a lot of people about horse

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.569 
talked to a lot of people about horse
nutrition<00:01:58.500> I've<00:01:58.619> never<00:01:58.829> heard<00:01:59.100> somebody

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
nutrition I've never heard somebody

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.450 
nutrition I've never heard somebody
bring<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.540> all<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.350> about<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.979> saliva

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
bring in all of this about the saliva

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.330 
bring in all of this about the saliva
and<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.450> pH<00:02:03.840> balance<00:02:04.170> Rob<00:02:04.530> how<00:02:04.890> did<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.189> learn

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and the pH balance Rob how did you learn

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.850 
and the pH balance Rob how did you learn
all<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.969> was<00:02:06.299> doing<00:02:06.719> rehab<00:02:07.350> on

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
all of that I was doing rehab on

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.130 
all of that I was doing rehab on
foundered<00:02:08.819> horses<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.450> horses<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:09.869> insulin

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
foundered horses and horses with insulin

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.059 
foundered horses and horses with insulin
resistance<00:02:10.590> problems<00:02:11.039> yeah

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
resistance problems yeah

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.770 
resistance problems yeah
and<00:02:12.159> it<00:02:12.609> all<00:02:12.760> comes<00:02:12.999> back<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.480> way<00:02:13.599> we're

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and it all comes back to the way we're

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.289 
and it all comes back to the way we're
feeding<00:02:14.069> that's<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.159> type<00:02:15.340> 2<00:02:15.519> sugar<00:02:15.819> diabeetus

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
feeding that's a type 2 sugar diabeetus

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.229 
feeding that's a type 2 sugar diabeetus
more<00:02:16.569> or<00:02:16.659> less<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.829> reacts<00:02:18.129> to<00:02:18.249> sugar<00:02:18.519> when

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
more or less and it reacts to sugar when

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.759 
more or less and it reacts to sugar when
we<00:02:19.359> feed<00:02:19.569> our<00:02:19.689> horses<00:02:19.959> twice<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.349> day<00:02:20.560> feeding

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
we feed our horses twice a day feeding

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.199 
we feed our horses twice a day feeding
is<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.010> first<00:02:21.310> thing<00:02:21.489> they<00:02:21.609> do<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.939> reason

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
is the first thing they do the reason

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.399 
is the first thing they do the reason
they're<00:02:22.329> snuffling<00:02:22.719> through<00:02:22.959> all<00:02:23.079> that<00:02:23.200> hay

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
they're snuffling through all that hay

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.050 
they're snuffling through all that hay
and<00:02:23.560> breathing<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> dust<00:02:24.219> is<00:02:24.549> to<00:02:24.909> eat<00:02:25.030> the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
and breathing the dust is to eat the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.750 
and breathing the dust is to eat the
sugar<00:02:25.359> first<00:02:25.629> sugar<00:02:26.469> makes<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:26.859> run<00:02:26.980> fast<00:02:27.280> but

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
sugar first sugar makes you run fast but

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.129 
sugar first sugar makes you run fast but
you<00:02:27.909> eat<00:02:28.060> too<00:02:28.209> much<00:02:28.359> sugar<00:02:28.569> we<00:02:28.719> all<00:02:28.930> know<00:02:29.079> you

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:29.139 
you eat too much sugar we all know you

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.780 
you eat too much sugar we all know you
don't<00:02:29.409> run<00:02:29.530> very<00:02:29.709> fast<00:02:29.859> you<00:02:30.310> wanted<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.609> see

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
don't run very fast you wanted to see

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.470 
don't run very fast you wanted to see
how<00:02:30.969> horses<00:02:31.269> actually<00:02:32.280> selected<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.489> picked

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
how horses actually selected and picked

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.869 
how horses actually selected and picked
a<00:02:34.719> bite<00:02:35.109> and<00:02:35.379> what<00:02:35.799> they<00:02:35.950> did<00:02:36.159> with<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.400> tell<00:02:36.700> me

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
a bite and what they did with it tell me

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.209 
a bite and what they did with it tell me
how<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.090> did<00:02:37.389> that<00:02:37.510> research<00:02:37.980> well<00:02:38.980> what<00:02:39.099> we

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.219 
how you did that research well what we

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.470 
how you did that research well what we
did<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.609> I<00:02:39.760> looked<00:02:40.000> at<00:02:40.120> several<00:02:40.359> different

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
did is I looked at several different

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.479 
did is I looked at several different
designs<00:02:41.109> of<00:02:41.290> feeders<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.769> knew<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.219> they

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
designs of feeders I knew that they

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.190 
designs of feeders I knew that they
needed<00:02:42.609> to<00:02:42.760> slow<00:02:43.090> down<00:02:43.299> but<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.810> didn't<00:02:44.139> know

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
needed to slow down but I didn't know

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.470 
needed to slow down but I didn't know
how<00:02:44.409> to<00:02:44.439> slow<00:02:44.829> them<00:02:45.040> down<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.579> have<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.359> be

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
how to slow them down and have it be

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.240 
how to slow them down and have it be
effective<00:02:46.750> because<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.469> can't<00:02:47.709> force<00:02:48.069> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
effective because you can't force a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.770 
effective because you can't force a
horse<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.579> do<00:02:48.700> anything<00:02:48.879> and<00:02:49.180> end<00:02:49.510> up<00:02:49.629> with

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
horse to do anything and end up with

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.470 
horse to do anything and end up with
good<00:02:49.930> results<00:02:50.349> so<00:02:51.040> we<00:02:51.189> went<00:02:51.370> out<00:02:51.489> film<00:02:52.090> several

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
good results so we went out film several

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.689 
good results so we went out film several
hours<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.049> horses<00:02:53.439> grazing<00:02:53.709> we<00:02:54.280> took<00:02:54.489> some

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:54.699 
hours of the horses grazing we took some

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.599 
hours of the horses grazing we took some
samples<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.829> we<00:02:56.829> build<00:02:57.069> a<00:02:57.159> feeder<00:02:57.400> to

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
samples and we build a feeder to

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.629 
samples and we build a feeder to
actually<00:02:58.120> match<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.419> bite<00:02:58.900> size<00:02:59.199> and<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.519> way

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
actually match the bite size and the way

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.670 
actually match the bite size and the way
they<00:03:00.819> graze<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.930> actually<00:03:02.230> got<00:03:02.409> down<00:03:02.620> on

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
they graze but you actually got down on

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.229 
they graze but you actually got down on
the<00:03:02.919> ground<00:03:03.219> this<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.549> part<00:03:03.819> I<00:03:03.879> love<00:03:04.030> to

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
the ground this is the part I love to

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.539 
the ground this is the part I love to
pup<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:04.780> story<00:03:05.109> with<00:03:05.709> your<00:03:05.859> camera<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.459> I

pup this story with your camera and I

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.879 
pup this story with your camera and I
mean<00:03:06.669> just<00:03:06.959> right<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.109> there<00:03:08.379> I've<00:03:08.680> been

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
mean just right in there I've been

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.679 
mean just right in there I've been
around<00:03:09.010> horses<00:03:09.219> my<00:03:09.430> whole<00:03:09.459> life<00:03:09.760> I've<00:03:10.329> watched

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
around horses my whole life I've watched

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.659 
around horses my whole life I've watched
in<00:03:10.900> me<00:03:11.019> but<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.290> never<00:03:11.560> really<00:03:11.980> watched<00:03:12.310> them

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
in me but I never really watched them

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.119 
in me but I never really watched them
eat<00:03:12.909> and<00:03:13.180> what<00:03:13.870> we<00:03:13.989> realize<00:03:14.379> is<00:03:14.409> they<00:03:14.799> search

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
eat and what we realize is they search

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.420 
eat and what we realize is they search
with<00:03:15.760> their<00:03:15.909> lips<00:03:16.169> they<00:03:17.169> pull<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.979> while

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
with their lips they pull and while

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.710 
with their lips they pull and while
there<00:03:18.579> while<00:03:19.030> they're<00:03:19.120> pulling<00:03:19.569> they're

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
there while they're pulling they're

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.839 
there while they're pulling they're
sizing<00:03:20.079> that<00:03:20.470> bite<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.009> then<00:03:21.280> they<00:03:21.430> tear<00:03:21.699> it

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
sizing that bite and then they tear it

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.460 
sizing that bite and then they tear it
but<00:03:22.000> while<00:03:22.780> they're<00:03:22.989> chewing<00:03:23.259> and<00:03:23.349> swallowing

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
but while they're chewing and swallowing

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.259 
but while they're chewing and swallowing
they're<00:03:23.919> searching<00:03:24.250> pulling<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.639> tearing<00:03:24.790> if

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
they're searching pulling and tearing if

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.610 
they're searching pulling and tearing if
you<00:03:25.359> watch<00:03:25.569> your<00:03:25.750> horse<00:03:25.870> real<00:03:26.079> closely<00:03:26.319> what

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
you watch your horse real closely what

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.379 
you watch your horse real closely what
they<00:03:26.739> do<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:26.979> they<00:03:27.099> actually<00:03:27.280> gather<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:28.030> bite

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
they do is they actually gather a bite

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.969 
they do is they actually gather a bite
and<00:03:28.720> what<00:03:28.959> they're<00:03:29.109> doing<00:03:29.139> is<00:03:29.409> sizing<00:03:29.859> that

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:29.979 
and what they're doing is sizing that

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:31.920 
and what they're doing is sizing that
bite<00:03:30.189> and<00:03:30.430> that's<00:03:30.909> something<00:03:31.359> you<00:03:31.479> and<00:03:31.599> I<00:03:31.720> will

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
bite and that's something you and I will

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.539 
bite and that's something you and I will
never<00:03:32.079> figure<00:03:32.470> out<00:03:32.500> for<00:03:32.859> them<00:03:33.040> because<00:03:33.189> only

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
never figure out for them because only

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.580 
never figure out for them because only
the<00:03:33.790> horse<00:03:34.000> knows<00:03:34.269> how<00:03:34.810> big<00:03:35.019> their<00:03:35.199> bites<00:03:35.379> are

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
the horse knows how big their bites are

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.530 
the horse knows how big their bites are
no<00:03:36.159> different<00:03:36.519> than<00:03:36.609> a<00:03:36.729> person<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.180> can<00:03:37.359> tell

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
no different than a person I can tell

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.789 
no different than a person I can tell
when<00:03:37.659> a<00:03:37.689> person's<00:03:38.049> taken<00:03:38.229> too<00:03:38.470> big<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.709> a<00:03:38.769> bite

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
when a person's taken too big of a bite

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.499 
when a person's taken too big of a bite
because<00:03:39.129> they<00:03:39.189> basically<00:03:39.340> act<00:03:39.759> I<00:03:40.120> reach<00:03:40.299> for<00:03:40.329> a

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:40.509 
because they basically act I reach for a

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.960 
because they basically act I reach for a
glass<00:03:40.689> of<00:03:40.840> water<00:03:41.019> okay<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:41.889> we<00:03:42.519> have<00:03:42.699> our<00:03:42.729> own

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
glass of water okay so we have our own

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.270 
glass of water okay so we have our own
bite<00:03:43.150> size<00:03:43.419> so<00:03:43.689> today<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.229> they<00:03:44.409> they<00:03:44.709> monitor

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
bite size so today and they they monitor

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.059 
bite size so today and they they monitor
their<00:03:45.400> bite<00:03:45.639> size<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:46.720> feed<00:03:47.349> their<00:03:47.500> digestive

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
their bite size to feed their digestive

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.909 
their bite size to feed their digestive
system<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.519> right<00:03:48.790> amount<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.359> saliva<00:03:49.919> mixed

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
system the right amount of saliva mixed

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.009 
system the right amount of saliva mixed
with<00:03:51.009> the<00:03:51.129> hay<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:52.060> go<00:03:52.209> through<00:03:52.419> the<00:03:52.509> digestive

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
with the hay to go through the digestive

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.929 
with the hay to go through the digestive
system<00:03:53.049> correctly<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.009> is<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.519> bite<00:03:54.699> size

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
system correctly so is the bite size

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.759 
system correctly so is the bite size
always<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.689> same<00:03:55.930> or<00:03:56.139> does<00:03:56.229> that<00:03:56.290> change

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
always the same or does that change

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.490 
always the same or does that change
during<00:03:57.189> feeding<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.090> bite<00:03:58.329> size<00:03:58.599> when<00:03:59.349> they

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
during feeding the bite size when they

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.009 
during feeding the bite size when they
graze<00:03:59.799> is<00:04:00.099> pretty<00:04:00.430> much<00:04:00.639> always<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.060> same<00:04:01.479> and

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
graze is pretty much always the same and

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.539 
graze is pretty much always the same and
what's<00:04:02.169> interesting<00:04:02.469> about<00:04:02.739> that<00:04:02.919> why<00:04:03.310> that's

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
what's interesting about that why that's

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.520 
what's interesting about that why that's
important<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.239> because<00:04:04.810> if<00:04:05.049> that<00:04:05.199> horse<00:04:05.409> is

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
important is because if that horse is

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.719 
important is because if that horse is
hungry<00:04:05.799> you've<00:04:05.919> been<00:04:06.009> riding<00:04:06.219> all<00:04:06.430> day<00:04:06.459> and

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
hungry you've been riding all day and

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.580 
hungry you've been riding all day and
you<00:04:06.790> turn<00:04:07.000> him<00:04:07.120> loose<00:04:07.359> it<00:04:08.109> looks<00:04:08.289> like<00:04:08.379> he's

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
you turn him loose it looks like he's

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.170 
you turn him loose it looks like he's
eating<00:04:08.829> fast<00:04:09.069> but<00:04:09.340> if<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.489> realize<00:04:09.609> he's

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
eating fast but if you realize he's

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.899 
eating fast but if you realize he's
chewing<00:04:10.810> fast<00:04:11.099> he's<00:04:12.099> not<00:04:12.340> getting<00:04:12.669> big

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
chewing fast he's not getting big

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.429 
chewing fast he's not getting big
mouthfuls<00:04:13.419> like<00:04:13.599> he<00:04:13.719> would<00:04:13.900> with<00:04:14.049> loose<00:04:14.229> hay

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
mouthfuls like he would with loose hay

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.349 
mouthfuls like he would with loose hay
which<00:04:14.799> could<00:04:15.009> create<00:04:15.219> a<00:04:15.310> colleague<00:04:15.729> he's

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
which could create a colleague he's

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.839 
which could create a colleague he's
actually<00:04:16.630> taking<00:04:17.320> bites<00:04:17.739> about<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.639> same

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
actually taking bites about the same

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.569 
actually taking bites about the same
size<00:04:19.090> maybe<00:04:19.509> a<00:04:19.659> little<00:04:19.810> larger<00:04:19.989> but<00:04:20.680> it's

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
size maybe a little larger but it's

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.519 
size maybe a little larger but it's
quickly<00:04:21.880> chewing<00:04:22.360> those<00:04:22.539> so<00:04:22.870> he<00:04:23.020> chews<00:04:23.289> him

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:23.529 
quickly chewing those so he chews him

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.540 
quickly chewing those so he chews him
applies<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.340> saliva<00:04:24.639> he<00:04:24.969> knows

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
applies the saliva he knows

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.399 
applies the saliva he knows
what's<00:04:25.669> good<00:04:25.849> for<00:04:26.030> him<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.870> porter<00:04:27.199> grazier

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:27.409 
what's good for him the porter grazier

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.460 
what's good for him the porter grazier
allows<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:28.129> horse<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.639> search<00:04:28.940> pool<00:04:29.720> tear

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
allows the horse to search pool tear

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.559 
allows the horse to search pool tear
while<00:04:31.190> he<00:04:31.430> chews<00:04:31.699> and<00:04:31.849> swallows<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.419> that's

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
while he chews and swallows so that's

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:33.399 
while he chews and swallows so that's
very<00:04:32.780> important

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
very important

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.830 
very important
yeah<00:04:33.800> what<00:04:34.699> so<00:04:34.819> often<00:04:35.180> it's<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.389> matter<00:04:35.539> of<00:04:35.629> kind

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
yeah what so often it's a matter of kind

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.089 
yeah what so often it's a matter of kind
of<00:04:35.900> getting<00:04:36.080> out<00:04:36.229> of<00:04:36.349> the<00:04:36.440> way<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.860> horse

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
of getting out of the way of the horse

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.300 
of getting out of the way of the horse
and<00:04:37.430> allowing<00:04:37.699> the<00:04:38.419> early<00:04:38.599> here<00:04:38.780> smiling<00:04:39.310> that

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
and allowing the early here smiling that

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.550 
and allowing the early here smiling that
seems<00:04:40.639> to<00:04:40.789> be<00:04:40.940> what<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.479> intended<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:41.960> do<00:04:42.169> here

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
seems to be what you intended to do here

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.409 
seems to be what you intended to do here
yeah<00:04:42.770> what<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:43.400> does<00:04:43.580> it's<00:04:43.789> a<00:04:43.849> very<00:04:44.030> simple

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
yeah what it does it's a very simple

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.339 
yeah what it does it's a very simple
design<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:46.400> pen<00:04:46.639> has<00:04:46.849> a<00:04:46.879> series<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:47.840> holes<00:04:48.110> in

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
design the pen has a series of holes in

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.600 
design the pen has a series of holes in
it<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.560> these<00:04:48.650> holes<00:04:48.889> are<00:04:49.069> specifically

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
it and these holes are specifically

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.029 
it and these holes are specifically
designed<00:04:50.060> for<00:04:50.300> your<00:04:50.960> horse<00:04:51.199> to<00:04:51.319> actually<00:04:51.860> not

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
designed for your horse to actually not

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.790 
designed for your horse to actually not
eat<00:04:52.310> through<00:04:52.819> but<00:04:53.629> as<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:54.050> rotates<00:04:54.259> in<00:04:54.710> a

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
eat through but as it rotates in a

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.469 
eat through but as it rotates in a
barrel<00:04:55.129> whenever<00:04:55.430> he<00:04:55.520> tears<00:04:55.849> off<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.300> food

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
barrel whenever he tears off the food

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.119 
barrel whenever he tears off the food
it'll<00:04:56.780> move<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:57.139> little<00:04:57.289> bit<00:04:57.470> it'll<00:04:57.770> pop<00:04:57.949> the

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
it'll move a little bit it'll pop the

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:59.589 
it'll move a little bit it'll pop the
ends<00:04:58.400> of<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.550> hay<00:04:58.669> up<00:04:58.699> and<00:04:59.090> when<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.449> hay

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
ends of the hay up and when the hay

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.899 
ends of the hay up and when the hay
sticks<00:04:59.960> up<00:05:00.139> he<00:05:00.919> bites<00:05:01.129> it<00:05:01.280> he<00:05:01.400> bites<00:05:01.639> it<00:05:01.819> and

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
sticks up he bites it he bites it and

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.420 
sticks up he bites it he bites it and
tears<00:05:02.120> it<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.710> which<00:05:03.710> is<00:05:03.860> very<00:05:03.919> much<00:05:04.129> like

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
tears it and which is very much like

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.830 
tears it and which is very much like
what<00:05:04.490> he<00:05:04.699> does<00:05:04.849> when<00:05:05.120> he's<00:05:05.240> grazing<00:05:05.629> it's

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
what he does when he's grazing it's

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.420 
what he does when he's grazing it's
exactly<00:05:06.349> the<00:05:06.560> same<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:06.889> he<00:05:07.009> does<00:05:07.190> when<00:05:07.340> he's

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
exactly the same that he does when he's

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.790 
exactly the same that he does when he's
great<00:05:07.639> hence<00:05:07.879> the<00:05:08.090> name<00:05:08.240> Porter<00:05:08.810> crazy<00:05:09.319> right

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
great hence the name Porter crazy right

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.040 
great hence the name Porter crazy right
and<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:11.270> reason<00:05:11.569> it<00:05:11.690> ended<00:05:11.780> up<00:05:11.900> being

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
and the reason it ended up being

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.570 
and the reason it ended up being
portable<00:05:12.530> because<00:05:12.650> as<00:05:12.949> we<00:05:13.129> are<00:05:13.159> designing

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
portable because as we are designing

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.550 
portable because as we are designing
this<00:05:13.759> we<00:05:14.060> did<00:05:14.150> want<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.330> leave<00:05:14.449> at<00:05:14.569> home<00:05:14.599> one<00:05:15.530> of

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
this we did want to leave at home one of

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.230 
this we did want to leave at home one of
the<00:05:15.710> biggest<00:05:16.069> causes<00:05:16.280> of<00:05:16.520> colic<00:05:16.969> and<00:05:17.090> other

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
the biggest causes of colic and other

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.300 
the biggest causes of colic and other
problems<00:05:17.690> on<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.080> road<00:05:18.259> is<00:05:18.469> changing<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.159> way

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
problems on the road is changing the way

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.459 
problems on the road is changing the way
your<00:05:19.490> horse<00:05:19.699> eats<00:05:20.020> not<00:05:21.020> particularly

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:21.469 
your horse eats not particularly

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.589 
your horse eats not particularly
changing<00:05:21.949> what<00:05:22.129> he<00:05:22.340> eats<00:05:22.490> because<00:05:23.120> when<00:05:23.479> he

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
changing what he eats because when he

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.119 
changing what he eats because when he
gets<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.990> food<00:05:24.199> correctly<00:05:24.620> serviced

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:25.129 
gets the food correctly serviced

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.520 
gets the food correctly serviced
elevated<00:05:25.819> and<00:05:26.000> swallows<00:05:26.690> it<00:05:26.840> it's<00:05:27.050> just<00:05:27.319> food

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
elevated and swallows it it's just food

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.519 
elevated and swallows it it's just food
it's<00:05:28.520> how<00:05:28.699> fast<00:05:29.000> he<00:05:29.240> eats<00:05:29.419> it<00:05:29.599> changes<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.169> yeah

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529 
it's how fast he eats it changes it yeah

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.680 
it's how fast he eats it changes it yeah
the<00:05:30.919> engineering<00:05:31.460> of<00:05:31.550> this<00:05:31.669> also<00:05:32.090> fascinated

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
the engineering of this also fascinated

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.589 
the engineering of this also fascinated
me<00:05:32.810> because<00:05:32.860> this<00:05:33.860> is<00:05:34.210> exactly<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.479> right

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
me because this is exactly the right

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:36.939 
me because this is exactly the right
tolerance<00:05:36.110> II<00:05:36.139> I<00:05:36.169> can't<00:05:36.440> pull<00:05:36.620> it<00:05:36.650> out<00:05:36.770> unless

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
tolerance II I can't pull it out unless

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.550 
tolerance II I can't pull it out unless
I<00:05:37.159> line<00:05:37.400> it<00:05:37.430> up<00:05:37.699> there<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.750> this<00:05:38.960> actually<00:05:39.469> the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
I line it up there and this actually the

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.409 
I line it up there and this actually the
way<00:05:39.680> these<00:05:39.800> are<00:05:39.979> designed<00:05:40.009> when<00:05:40.969> the<00:05:41.090> hay<00:05:41.270> is

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
way these are designed when the hay is

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.050 
way these are designed when the hay is
lower<00:05:41.690> in<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.050> barrel<00:05:42.409> this<00:05:42.770> lip<00:05:43.099> locks<00:05:43.490> in<00:05:43.819> so

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
lower in the barrel this lip locks in so

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.209 
lower in the barrel this lip locks in so
it's<00:05:44.210> double<00:05:44.599> locking<00:05:44.810> so<00:05:45.469> say<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.680> horse<00:05:45.979> with

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:46.219 
it's double locking so say a horse with

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.219 
it's double locking so say a horse with
insulin-resistant<00:05:47.090> problems<00:05:47.479> or<00:05:47.630> laminitis

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
insulin-resistant problems or laminitis

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.830 
insulin-resistant problems or laminitis
cannot<00:05:48.830> access<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.580> free<00:05:49.789> hay<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.180> overload

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
cannot access the free hay and overload

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.839 
cannot access the free hay and overload
the<00:05:50.990> sugar<00:05:51.229> even<00:05:51.949> behavioral<00:05:52.370> problems<00:05:52.729> are

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
the sugar even behavioral problems are

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.469 
the sugar even behavioral problems are
caused<00:05:53.060> by<00:05:53.330> given<00:05:54.020> that<00:05:54.169> flake<00:05:54.409> of<00:05:54.590> alfalfa<00:05:54.919> or

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
caused by given that flake of alfalfa or

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.640 
caused by given that flake of alfalfa or
regular<00:05:56.479> hay<00:05:56.659> and<00:05:56.840> they<00:05:56.930> eat<00:05:57.080> all<00:05:57.289> the<00:05:57.409> sugar

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
regular hay and they eat all the sugar

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.200 
regular hay and they eat all the sugar
first<00:05:57.949> there's<00:05:58.279> that<00:05:58.400> kid<00:05:58.580> on<00:05:58.699> Captain<00:05:59.060> Crunch

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
first there's that kid on Captain Crunch

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.080 
first there's that kid on Captain Crunch
and<00:05:59.389> you're<00:05:59.509> going<00:05:59.629> to<00:05:59.659> go<00:05:59.810> riding<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:01.340> see<00:06:01.940> as

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
and you're going to go riding and see as

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.119 
and you're going to go riding and see as
it<00:06:02.270> turns<00:06:02.509> it<00:06:02.930> picks<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.289> into<00:06:03.529> the<00:06:03.620> hay<00:06:03.740> up<00:06:03.919> it

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:04.129 
it turns it picks the into the hay up it

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.309 
it turns it picks the into the hay up it
just<00:06:04.400> keeps<00:06:04.550> feeding<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.150> horse<00:06:05.360> this<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:06.139> not

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
just keeps feeding the horse this is not

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.469 
just keeps feeding the horse this is not
a<00:06:06.349> restrictor<00:06:07.069> it<00:06:07.250> actually<00:06:07.759> feeds<00:06:08.060> him<00:06:08.270> the

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
a restrictor it actually feeds him the

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.570 
a restrictor it actually feeds him the
way<00:06:08.599> he<00:06:08.779> needs<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:09.080> be<00:06:09.199> fed<00:06:09.440> if<00:06:09.680> he<00:06:10.190> doesn't

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
way he needs to be fed if he doesn't

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.399 
way he needs to be fed if he doesn't
feel<00:06:10.789> any<00:06:10.969> hay<00:06:11.210> he'll<00:06:11.449> actually<00:06:11.659> reach<00:06:12.080> in<00:06:12.110> and

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
feel any hay he'll actually reach in and

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.680 
feel any hay he'll actually reach in and
move<00:06:12.529> it<00:06:12.680> with<00:06:12.800> this<00:06:13.240> and<00:06:14.240> they<00:06:14.330> figured<00:06:14.659> that

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
move it with this and they figured that

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.330 
move it with this and they figured that
out<00:06:14.810> pretty<00:06:15.199> fast<00:06:15.500> I<00:06:15.860> thought<00:06:16.039> I<00:06:16.099> mean<00:06:16.310> I

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
out pretty fast I thought I mean I

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.399 
out pretty fast I thought I mean I
wondered<00:06:16.729> with<00:06:16.819> my<00:06:17.000> own<00:06:17.150> horses<00:06:17.449> are<00:06:18.289> they

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
wondered with my own horses are they

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.290 
wondered with my own horses are they
going<00:06:18.590> to<00:06:18.650> know<00:06:18.889> to<00:06:19.310> kind<00:06:19.430> of<00:06:19.550> spin<00:06:19.879> this<00:06:20.060> thing

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
going to know to kind of spin this thing

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.550 
going to know to kind of spin this thing
or<00:06:20.419> they<00:06:20.509> figure<00:06:20.779> that<00:06:20.810> out<00:06:21.110> yeah<00:06:21.409> they

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
or they figure that out yeah they

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.439 
or they figure that out yeah they
figured<00:06:21.860> out<00:06:21.979> real<00:06:22.279> quick<00:06:22.490> you<00:06:23.029> and<00:06:23.150> I<00:06:23.180> talked

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
figured out real quick you and I talked

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:24.519 
figured out real quick you and I talked
a<00:06:23.539> little<00:06:23.629> bit<00:06:23.779> about<00:06:23.870> this<00:06:24.080> idea<00:06:24.289> of

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:24.529 
a little bit about this idea of

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:26.860 
a little bit about this idea of
conserving<00:06:25.129> complexity<00:06:25.879> because<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.629> new

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
conserving complexity because the new

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.110

to use is we don't want them to be
complex<00:06:31.430> to<00:06:31.669> use<00:06:31.699> we<00:06:32.659> want<00:06:32.840> the<00:06:32.990> complexity

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
complex to use we want the complexity

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.379 
complex to use we want the complexity
and<00:06:33.919> the<00:06:34.130> difficulty<00:06:34.789> to<00:06:34.820> have<00:06:35.000> come<00:06:35.210> in

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
and the difficulty to have come in

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.180 
and the difficulty to have come in
thinking<00:06:35.899> it<00:06:36.080> up<00:06:36.259> and<00:06:36.500> the<00:06:36.589> design<00:06:36.919> and<00:06:37.130> the

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
thinking it up and the design and the

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.129 
thinking it up and the design and the
engineering<00:06:37.639> which<00:06:38.120> is<00:06:38.270> exactly<00:06:38.779> why

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
engineering which is exactly why

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:41.709 
engineering which is exactly why
happen<00:06:39.499> here<00:06:39.919> you've<00:06:40.310> got<00:06:40.520> a<00:06:40.550> product<00:06:41.539> that's

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:41.719 
happen here you've got a product that's

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:44.350 
happen here you've got a product that's
very<00:06:41.870> very<00:06:42.319> easy<00:06:42.469> to<00:06:42.800> use<00:06:42.830> it<00:06:43.759> wasn't<00:06:44.120> easy<00:06:44.210> for

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
very very easy to use it wasn't easy for

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.409 
very very easy to use it wasn't easy for
you<00:06:44.539> to<00:06:44.719> create<00:06:45.099> so<00:06:46.099> you<00:06:46.639> kind<00:06:46.879> of<00:06:46.969> absorbed

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
you to create so you kind of absorbed

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.089 
you to create so you kind of absorbed
all<00:06:47.569> that<00:06:47.599> complexity<00:06:48.289> for<00:06:48.590> the<00:06:48.650> rest<00:06:48.830> of<00:06:48.979> us

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
all that complexity for the rest of us

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.339 
all that complexity for the rest of us
so<00:06:49.310> a<00:06:49.340> good<00:06:49.669> on<00:06:49.819> you<00:06:49.939> best<00:06:50.689> of<00:06:50.810> luck<00:06:50.960> to<00:06:51.080> you<00:06:51.139> all

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
so a good on you best of luck to you all

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.979 
so a good on you best of luck to you all
thank<00:06:51.680> you<00:06:51.740> Rick
