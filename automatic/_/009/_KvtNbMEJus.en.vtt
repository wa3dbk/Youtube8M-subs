00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 but the good agent to arrange dae and I 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.190
 played description very easy to tip 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.650
 you to make that button mass that is 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.750
 A very dark lipstick need not be just 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 Dark I'll give a tip but it's a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.570
 generic tip you can use at any 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.220
 lipstick color 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.539
 you just have to have a creamy lipstick 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.539
 basis for doing this 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.220
 You need to have a creamy lipstick. 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.200
 be a normal patton cream lipstick only 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.030
 it can not be magic that this market will 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.770
 give it to put the shadow itself 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.470
 so I picked up here marroada that I 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.270
 I want to make a pouting brown paper with 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.100
 this brown base also making a lipstick 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:53.480
 fry so first and pass lipstick 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:56.390
 usually and there you come with the brush 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.280
 smooth and soft vanishing brush and 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.320
 with the shadow you want the color of 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.960
 lipstick in my case I want dark brown 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.220
 I came here it seems clear but 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.930
 When I put it in the mouth, it's a good 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.520
 stay well dark and you will 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.530
 depositing on the button is very 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.690
 simple people is that kind of tip 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.759
 left tomatoes alone instead of leaving 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.009
 the tomato bar with the loose powder you leave the 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.270
 tomato with a shadow because it intensifies 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.220
 plus color 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.570
 You can even change because you understand me. 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.110
 I'll leave that lipstick well and they'll heal 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.110
 depositing 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:49.679
 your radar has a chance of the 3rd and so leave 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.509
 more mayor, I come to the end and 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.880
 a little corrective just to find 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:00.289
 in the back around to let his mouth more 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.289
 gay marriage even missing 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:16.050
 Well I'm going to vote sharot will be in 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.050
 a new role for me was there 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.890
 Unprecedented I already learned a long time ago 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.569
 and many of you should know more 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.110
 I started when I posted a photo with this 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.910
 lipstick 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.160
 many will ask I already decided to do 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.620
 a video explaining everything because 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.480
 as many people already know a lot 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.190
 people may also not know 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.680
 if you want a darker lipstick button 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.450
 brown a black lipstick and finally does not serve 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.709
 only for dark lipsticks but I prefer 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.319
 to do when I want a lipstick more 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.480
 dark is just to do this tip because she 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.330
 gives a close and the button gets mate 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.090
 pretty and hard enough in the mouth so old 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.950
 super super rapidinha is this video 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.660
 then he said he let out here 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.360
 low for me to debut on the channel for 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.590
 more videos and for magic like this one 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.590
 Kiss and see you tomorrow
