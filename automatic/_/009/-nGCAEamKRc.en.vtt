to show you how to add some different

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.580 
to show you how to add some different
details<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.140> make<00:00:22.290> the<00:00:22.410> fish

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
details so that you can make the fish

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.380 
details so that you can make the fish
whatever<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.160> want<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.550> could<00:00:23.670> draw<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.150> whole

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
whatever you want you could draw a whole

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.700 
whatever you want you could draw a whole
ocean<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.869> fish<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.230> they<00:00:25.320> could<00:00:25.470> all<00:00:25.680> be

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
ocean of fish and they could all be

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.679 
ocean of fish and they could all be
different<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.400> unique<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.239> let's<00:00:27.509> get

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
different and unique so let's get

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
different and unique so let's get
started<00:00:28.079> you<00:00:28.200> just<00:00:28.230> need<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.650> paper<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
started you just need your paper and a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.810 
started you just need your paper and a
crayon<00:00:30.029> or<00:00:30.450> a<00:00:30.480> pencil<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.960> draw<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.369> okay<00:00:32.369> for

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
crayon or a pencil to draw with okay for

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.420 
crayon or a pencil to draw with okay for
the<00:00:32.970> basic<00:00:33.360> fish<00:00:33.600> shape<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.860> need<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> do

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the basic fish shape all we need to do

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.120 
the basic fish shape all we need to do
is<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> curved<00:00:36.329> line<00:00:36.510> we're<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.560> draw<00:00:37.800> one

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
is a curved line we're going to draw one

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.100 
is a curved line we're going to draw one
curved<00:00:38.760> line<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
curved line like this kind of like a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.710 
curved line like this kind of like a
rainbow<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> frowny<00:00:41.190> face<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.850> we're<00:00:42.630> going

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
rainbow or a frowny face and we're going

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.550 
rainbow or a frowny face and we're going
to<00:00:42.810> draw<00:00:43.020> another<00:00:43.350> curved<00:00:43.800> line<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.400> smile

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
to draw another curved line like a smile

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.880 
to draw another curved line like a smile
like<00:00:46.560> this<00:00:47.420> okay<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:48.900> for<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.410> fins<00:00:49.710> I'm

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
like this okay now for the fins I'm

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.810 
like this okay now for the fins I'm
going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.070> show<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.220> a<00:00:50.310> couple<00:00:50.430> different

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
going to show you a couple different

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
going to show you a couple different
ways<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.360> easiest<00:00:51.930> fin<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.620> would<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
ways the easiest fin of all would be a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.810 
ways the easiest fin of all would be a
triangle<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.800> also<00:00:58.950> add<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.250> triangle<00:00:59.550> on

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
triangle you can also add a triangle on

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.440 
triangle you can also add a triangle on
the<00:00:59.940> top<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:03.120> small<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.630> down<00:01:03.810> here<00:01:05.450> okay

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the top and a small one down here okay

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
the top and a small one down here okay
that's<00:01:06.720> your<00:01:06.869> simplest<00:01:07.439> fish<00:01:07.710> let's<00:01:08.189> draw<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that's your simplest fish let's draw a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.340 
that's your simplest fish let's draw a
couple<00:01:08.579> more<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.200> an<00:01:10.259> idea

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
couple more so that you can get an idea

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.080 
couple more so that you can get an idea
of<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.579> fish<00:01:11.850> shape

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of what you can do with this fish shape

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.690 
of what you can do with this fish shape
again<00:01:12.810> we're<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.079> to<00:01:13.170> draw<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.829> curved<00:01:14.369> line

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
again we're going to draw a curved line

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.050 
again we're going to draw a curved line
for<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.479> top<00:01:15.719> and<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:17.009> curved<00:01:17.460> line<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.969> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
for the top and a curved line for the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
for the top and a curved line for the
bottom<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:19.140> time<00:01:19.380> we're<00:01:19.499> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.649> make<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
bottom this time we're going to make the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.620 
bottom this time we're going to make the
fin<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> little<00:01:20.759> bit<00:01:20.909> different

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
fin a little bit different

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.059 
fin a little bit different
I'm<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.619> go<00:01:22.880> curved<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.569> the<00:01:24.929> top<00:01:25.139> and<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:26.069 
I'm going to go curved at the top and a

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.330 
I'm going to go curved at the top and a
curved<00:01:26.700> line<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.329> bottom<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.039> then<00:01:29.039> I'm

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
curved line at the bottom and then I'm

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.039 
curved line at the bottom and then I'm
going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.759> connect<00:01:30.149> these<00:01:30.359> I'm<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
going to connect these I'm going to do a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
going to connect these I'm going to do a
curved<00:01:31.380> line<00:01:31.499> this<00:01:31.770> way<00:01:32.039> and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.149> curved

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
curved line this way and then a curved

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.910 
curved line this way and then a curved
line<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.659> way<00:01:33.990> until<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.319> touch<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> fin

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
line that way until I touch the fin

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
line that way until I touch the fin
let's<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> different<00:01:36.329> finit<00:01:36.780> pr2<00:01:37.229> we're

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
let's do a different finit pr2 we're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.739 
let's do a different finit pr2 we're
going<00:01:37.679> to<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.859> curved<00:01:38.429> out<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.329> then<00:01:40.170> curve<00:01:40.619> in

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
going to go curved out and then curve in

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:47.059 
going to go curved out and then curve in
curved<00:01:42.749> out<00:01:43.670> curve<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:45.049> okay<00:01:46.049> let's<00:01:46.770> talk

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
curved out curve in okay let's talk

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:48.529 
curved out curve in okay let's talk
about<00:01:47.249> a<00:01:47.369> couple<00:01:47.729> different<00:01:47.759> fins<00:01:48.209> you<00:01:48.329> can

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
about a couple different fins you can

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.050 
about a couple different fins you can
add<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:49.170> could<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.499> a<00:01:49.530> fin<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.549> went<00:01:50.789> out

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
add you could do a fin that went out

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.230 
add you could do a fin that went out
like<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.469> then<00:01:53.310> curve<00:01:53.639> shapes<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.060> here

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
like this and then curve shapes in here

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.699 
like this and then curve shapes in here
like<00:01:54.359> use<00:01:54.749> connected<00:01:55.649> together<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:57.590> at<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
like use connected together and at the

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.590 
like use connected together and at the
top<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.249> would<00:01:59.399> look<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:02.479> then<00:02:03.479> if

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
top it would look like this and then if

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.090 
top it would look like this and then if
you<00:02:03.689> wanted<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.109> step<00:02:04.350> further<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.920> could

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
you wanted to go step further you could

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.710 
you wanted to go step further you could
draw<00:02:05.279> lines<00:02:06.319> inside<00:02:07.319> this<00:02:07.799> fin<00:02:10.400> like<00:02:11.400> that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
draw lines inside this fin like that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
draw lines inside this fin like that
okay<00:02:12.720> let's<00:02:12.930> talk<00:02:13.050> about<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.380> body<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.740> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
okay let's talk about the body of the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320 
okay let's talk about the body of the
fish<00:02:13.980> there's<00:02:14.430> some<00:02:14.580> easy<00:02:14.760> things<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.209> could

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
fish there's some easy things we could

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.059 
fish there's some easy things we could
do<00:02:15.450> here<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.750> make<00:02:15.900> these<00:02:16.080> fish<00:02:16.349> fun<00:02:16.590> first<00:02:16.830> of

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
do here to make these fish fun first of

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.070 
do here to make these fish fun first of
all<00:02:17.190> he<00:02:17.370> needs<00:02:17.400> an<00:02:17.760> eyeball<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.780> we're<00:02:18.930> going

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
all he needs an eyeball so we're going

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.140 
all he needs an eyeball so we're going
to<00:02:19.260> draw<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.710> circle<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.690> another<00:02:21.690> circle<00:02:22.020> in

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
to draw a circle and another circle in

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.690 
to draw a circle and another circle in
we're<00:02:23.329> going<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> color<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:24.140> circle<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.769> okay

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
we're going to color that circle in okay

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.059 
we're going to color that circle in okay
and<00:02:25.879> now<00:02:26.480> we<00:02:26.540> need<00:02:27.049> to<00:02:27.200> draw<00:02:27.379> where<00:02:27.709> his<00:02:27.829> head

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
and now we need to draw where his head

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.830 
and now we need to draw where his head
is<00:02:28.099> separate<00:02:28.640> from<00:02:28.790> his<00:02:28.939> body<00:02:29.150> fish<00:02:29.599> have

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
is separate from his body fish have

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.199 
is separate from his body fish have
gills<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.590> we're<00:02:31.189> going<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.370> draw<00:02:31.549> a<00:02:31.579> curved

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
gills so we're going to draw a curved

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.170 
gills so we're going to draw a curved
line<00:02:32.420> like<00:02:32.629> this<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.560> then<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.610> lot<00:02:34.909> of<00:02:34.939> fish

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
line like this and then a lot of fish

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.100 
line like this and then a lot of fish
have<00:02:35.360> another<00:02:35.689> fin<00:02:36.170> here<00:02:37.689> okay<00:02:38.689> and<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:38.930> could

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
have another fin here okay and we could

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.619 
have another fin here okay and we could
stop<00:02:39.379> there<00:02:39.620> or<00:02:39.650> we<00:02:40.310> could<00:02:40.459> keep<00:02:40.640> going<00:02:40.700> you

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
stop there or we could keep going you

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.809 
stop there or we could keep going you
could<00:02:42.049> make<00:02:42.290> your<00:02:42.590> fish<00:02:42.829> striped<00:02:45.189> or<00:02:46.189> you

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
could make your fish striped or you

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.339 
could make your fish striped or you
could<00:02:47.030> make<00:02:47.239> your<00:02:47.480> fish<00:02:47.870> polkadot<00:02:49.599> or<00:02:50.599> let's

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
could make your fish polkadot or let's

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.929 
could make your fish polkadot or let's
show<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:51.620> right<00:02:51.829> here<00:02:51.890> we'll<00:02:52.519> draw<00:02:52.670> an<00:02:52.790> eye

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
show you right here we'll draw an eye

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.440 
show you right here we'll draw an eye
we've<00:02:53.239> got<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.420> circle<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.200> circle<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:56.180> fin

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
we've got a circle and a circle the fin

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.449 
we've got a circle and a circle the fin
or<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:57.109> could<00:02:57.290> do<00:02:57.409> scales<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:58.069> those<00:02:58.280> are

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
or you could do scales and those are

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.550 
or you could do scales and those are
just<00:02:58.579> you<00:02:58.970> shapes<00:02:59.359> turn<00:02:59.720> sideways<00:03:02.440> kind<00:03:03.440> of

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
just you shapes turn sideways kind of

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.119 
just you shapes turn sideways kind of
pass<00:03:03.739> that<00:03:03.769> fin<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.370> we<00:03:04.459> don't<00:03:04.609> draw<00:03:04.760> over<00:03:05.060> it

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
pass that fin so we don't draw over it

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.330 
pass that fin so we don't draw over it
so<00:03:07.129> I'm<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.430> drawing<00:03:07.730> use<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.629> are

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
so I'm just drawing use that are

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.759 
so I'm just drawing use that are
connected<00:03:10.340> like<00:03:10.370> this<00:03:11.319> okay<00:03:12.319> don't<00:03:12.590> forget

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
connected like this okay don't forget

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.339 
connected like this okay don't forget
that<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.159> can<00:03:13.340> make<00:03:13.519> your<00:03:13.670> fish<00:03:13.879> smaller<00:03:14.780> and

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
that you can make your fish smaller and

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.619 
that you can make your fish smaller and
thinner<00:03:15.859> we're<00:03:16.489> still<00:03:16.790> using<00:03:16.970> curved<00:03:17.389> lines

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
thinner we're still using curved lines

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.410 
thinner we're still using curved lines
but<00:03:17.870> look<00:03:18.019> at<00:03:18.139> this<00:03:18.319> some<00:03:19.280> fish<00:03:19.670> are<00:03:19.939> really

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
but look at this some fish are really

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.140 
but look at this some fish are really
long<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.109> stretched<00:03:21.920> out<00:03:22.159> and<00:03:22.370> have<00:03:22.639> thin

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
long and stretched out and have thin

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.970 
long and stretched out and have thin
triangle<00:03:23.810> fins<00:03:24.049> but<00:03:24.290> they<00:03:24.409> still<00:03:24.739> have<00:03:24.950> a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
triangle fins but they still have a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.580 
triangle fins but they still have a
curved<00:03:25.310> line<00:03:25.459> by<00:03:25.819> their<00:03:25.970> head<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.480> they<00:03:27.199> still

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
curved line by their head and they still

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.030 
curved line by their head and they still
have<00:03:27.919> a<00:03:27.949> round<00:03:28.340> eyeball<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:30.139> fin<00:03:30.379> here<00:03:30.829> and
