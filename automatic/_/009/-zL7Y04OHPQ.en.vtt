come up with a strategy for you guys
that<00:00:04.830> actually<00:00:05.160> works<00:00:05.790> on<00:00:06.029> this<00:00:06.240> stage<00:00:06.799> having

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
that actually works on this stage having

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.720 
that actually works on this stage having
a<00:00:08.069> bit<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.610> problems<00:00:09.920> trying<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.130> get<00:00:11.550> a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
a bit of problems trying to get a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.000 
a bit of problems trying to get a
strategy<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.830> consistently<00:00:13.830> works<00:00:14.190> and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
strategy that consistently works and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.529 
strategy that consistently works and
we'll<00:00:17.010> see<00:00:17.279> what<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:17.789> make<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.330> this

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
we'll see what I can make of this this

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.230 
we'll see what I can make of this this
is<00:00:18.949> rather<00:00:19.949> annoying<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.760> me<00:00:21.500> that<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> cannot

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
is rather annoying for me that I cannot

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.210 
is rather annoying for me that I cannot
that<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> can't<00:00:24.539> repeat<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.710> strategy<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.099> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
that I can't repeat the strategy that I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.089 
that I can't repeat the strategy that I
used<00:00:26.580> when<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.359> waiting<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.199> waiting<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
used when I was waiting and waiting and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.160 
used when I was waiting and waiting and
waiting<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:30.090> second<00:00:30.630> daughter<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.050> be

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
waiting for my second daughter to be

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.780 
waiting for my second daughter to be
born<00:00:31.380> yes<00:00:33.020> I<00:00:34.020> am<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> grown<00:00:35.100> man<00:00:35.309> who<00:00:35.520> enjoys

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
born yes I am a grown man who enjoys

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.520 
born yes I am a grown man who enjoys
video<00:00:36.059> games<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.660> there's<00:00:36.809> nothing<00:00:37.350> wrong

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
video games and there's nothing wrong

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:51.549 
video games and there's nothing wrong
with<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.980> all

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.259 

maybe<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.649> don't<00:00:52.949> need<00:00:53.159> these<00:00:53.339> guys<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
maybe I don't need these guys up to that

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.079 
maybe I don't need these guys up to that
level<00:00:54.420> three<00:00:54.809> tower<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.699> I<00:00:56.699> should<00:00:56.879> just

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
level three tower and I should just

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.119 
level three tower and I should just
start<00:00:57.239> investing<00:00:58.110> into<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.409> Dwarven<00:00:58.799> towers

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
start investing into the Dwarven towers

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.210 
start investing into the Dwarven towers
a<00:00:59.159> bit<00:00:59.430> earlier<00:00:59.729> let<00:01:00.479> me<00:01:00.539> try<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.750> strategy

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.789 

that's<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.430> starting<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> there<00:01:06.180> again<00:01:06.799> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that's good starting it there again and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:35.310 
that's good starting it there again and
wait<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> Reapers<00:01:09.030> wait<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.780> them

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:48.060 

all<00:01:36.320> right<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.070> far<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:38.360> far<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:38.810> good

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.250 

I<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:52.030> really<00:01:52.360> like<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.659> get<00:01:52.870> this<00:01:52.960> up<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.140> a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
I would really like to get this up to a

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.890 
I would really like to get this up to a
dwarven<00:01:53.680> tower<00:01:53.860> or<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.370> next<00:01:54.850> hour<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.360> bring

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
dwarven tower or the next hour and bring

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:20.780 
dwarven tower or the next hour and bring
it<00:01:55.990> over<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.350> fight

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.739 

if<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.879> didn't<00:02:22.090> see<00:02:22.209> what<00:02:22.329> I<00:02:22.359> did<00:02:22.450> there<00:02:22.569> I

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:22.749 
if you didn't see what I did there I

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.819 
if you didn't see what I did there I
upgraded<00:02:23.620> my<00:02:23.790> night<00:02:24.790> just<00:02:25.329> in<00:02:25.569> time<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.650> that

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
upgraded my night just in time so that

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.129 
upgraded my night just in time so that
he<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:27.069> still<00:02:27.370> fight<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.879> gorilla<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.510> and

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:29.139 
he can still fight the gorilla and and

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.259 
he can still fight the gorilla and and
have<00:02:29.739> more<00:02:30.040> hip<00:02:30.280> points<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:30.730> not<00:02:30.849> get<00:02:31.090> taken

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
have more hip points and not get taken

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.720 
have more hip points and not get taken
down<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.569> quite<00:02:31.959> yet<00:02:32.139> a<00:02:32.709> little<00:02:33.489> bit<00:02:33.609> of<00:02:33.670> a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
down just quite yet a little bit of a

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.610 
down just quite yet a little bit of a
strategy<00:02:33.879> it's<00:02:34.329> it's<00:02:35.019> like<00:02:35.139> instantly

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
strategy it's it's like instantly

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.830 
strategy it's it's like instantly
training<00:02:36.400> up<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:37.060> getting<00:02:37.359> your<00:02:37.450> knight<00:02:37.689> to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
training up and getting your knight to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.199 
training up and getting your knight to
be<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:37.989> little<00:02:38.319> bit<00:02:38.469> more<00:02:38.590> stronger<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:40.060> that

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
be a little bit more stronger so that

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.360 
be a little bit more stronger so that
you<00:02:40.299> can<00:02:40.450> tank<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:41.019> tower<00:02:41.379> just<00:02:41.530> or<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.219> can

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
you can tank that tower just or it can

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.789 
you can tank that tower just or it can
tank<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.760> big<00:02:42.939> gorilla<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:44.019> little<00:02:44.620> while

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
tank the big gorilla just a little while

00:02:44.799 --> 00:03:06.479 
tank the big gorilla just a little while
longer<00:02:44.829> there<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:05.290> not<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.980> towers<00:03:06.370> you

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
longer there it's not the towers you

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.360 
longer there it's not the towers you
build<00:03:06.730> it's<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.209> order<00:03:07.599> you<00:03:07.750> build<00:03:08.019> them<00:03:08.169> in

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
build it's the order you build them in

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.660 
build it's the order you build them in
all<00:03:09.370> right

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.870 

so<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:17.060> seems<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.480> be<00:03:17.570> a<00:03:18.050> bit<00:03:18.680> easier<00:03:19.190> this

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
so this seems to be a bit easier this

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.300 
so this seems to be a bit easier this
time<00:03:19.940> around<00:03:23.440> just<00:03:24.440> having<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.770> little<00:03:25.220> bit

time around just having a little bit

00:03:25.310 --> 00:04:26.530
