I'd<00:00:05.730> like<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:06.029> talk<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.420> really<00:00:06.690> briefly

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
I'd like to talk to you really briefly

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.430 
I'd like to talk to you really briefly
about<00:00:07.740> how<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.160> find<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.670> amount<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.330> charge<00:00:09.900> a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
about how to find the amount of charge a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.009 
about how to find the amount of charge a
charge<00:00:10.679> object<00:00:11.639> has<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.570> let's<00:00:12.750> just<00:00:12.929> imagine

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
charge object has so let's just imagine

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.259 
charge object has so let's just imagine
we<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.590> six<00:00:13.920> different<00:00:14.370> balloons<00:00:14.849> they're

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
we have six different balloons they're

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.849 
we have six different balloons they're
from<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.450> best<00:00:15.630> picture<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> balloon<00:00:16.410> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
from the best picture of a balloon and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.529 
from the best picture of a balloon and
I'm<00:00:17.160> gonna<00:00:17.310> draw<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> situation<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
I'm gonna draw a situation for you and

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.939 
I'm gonna draw a situation for you and
we'll<00:00:18.840> just<00:00:18.869> kind<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.199> work<00:00:19.380> through<00:00:19.650> how<00:00:19.890> to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
we'll just kind of work through how to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.800 
we'll just kind of work through how to
find<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> amount<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.090> charge<00:00:21.150> which<00:00:21.449> is

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
find the amount of charge which is

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.840 
find the amount of charge which is
typically<00:00:22.380> measured<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:23.039> coulombs<00:00:23.550> or

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
typically measured in coulombs or

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.450 
typically measured in coulombs or
capital<00:00:24.269> C<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> unit<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.800> let<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> fans

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
capital C for the unit so let the fans

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.859 
capital C for the unit so let the fans
that<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> start<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> balloon<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.570> has<00:00:27.779> an

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
that I start with a balloon that has an

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.479 
that I start with a balloon that has an
even<00:00:28.109> number<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:29.720> electrons<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> protons

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
even number of electrons and protons

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.530 
even number of electrons and protons
unlikely<00:00:32.489> situation<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.149> let's<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.390> I've

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
unlikely situation but let's just I've

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.090 
unlikely situation but let's just I've
got<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> same<00:00:34.020> exact<00:00:34.530> same<00:00:34.739> number<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
got the same exact same number of

Hung's<00:00:37.320> event<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:37.800> i'm<00:00:37.890> gonna<00:00:37.980> model<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.610> by

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
Hung's event but i'm gonna model that by

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.720 
Hung's event but i'm gonna model that by
just<00:00:38.969> drawing<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.420> few<00:00:39.930> years<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:44.430> here's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
just drawing a few years and then here's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
just drawing a few years and then here's
a<00:00:44.789> proton<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.180> same<00:00:48.450> number<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.870> times<00:00:49.410> this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
a proton the same number of times this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
a proton the same number of times this
and<00:00:49.829> negatives<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> they<00:00:51.329> each<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and negatives and they each have the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.229 
and negatives and they each have the
same<00:00:51.989> quantity<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.190> charge<00:00:53.670> associated<00:00:54.030> with

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
same quantity of charge associated with

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.450 
same quantity of charge associated with
that<00:00:54.390> an<00:00:54.570> electron<00:00:55.110> has<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> charge<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that an electron has a charge of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
that an electron has a charge of
negative<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:57.360> point<00:00:57.570> six<00:00:57.930> times<00:00:58.379> 10<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
negative one point six times 10 and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.069 
negative one point six times 10 and
negative<00:00:58.829> 19<00:00:59.340> coulombs<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> proton<00:01:00.960> has

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
negative 19 coulombs and a proton has

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.810 
negative 19 coulombs and a proton has
the<00:01:01.230> same<00:01:01.410> amount<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.680> charge<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.280> positive

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the same amount of charge but positive

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.250 
the same amount of charge but positive
so<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.629> balance<00:01:03.899> each<00:01:03.960> other<00:01:04.140> out

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
so they kind of balance each other out

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.230 
so they kind of balance each other out
there's<00:01:04.650> no<00:01:05.010> more<00:01:05.309> positives<00:01:06.060> than<00:01:06.180> negatives

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
there's no more positives than negatives

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
there's no more positives than negatives
and<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:06.990> no<00:01:07.140> more<00:01:07.350> negatives<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and there's no more negatives and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.070 
and there's no more negatives and
positives<00:01:08.189> there's<00:01:09.060> no<00:01:09.210> excess<00:01:09.600> electrons

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
positives there's no excess electrons

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.990 
positives there's no excess electrons
there's<00:01:10.320> no<00:01:10.470> access<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> protons<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.790> call

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
there's no access to protons we call

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.450 
there's no access to protons we call
that<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> neutral<00:01:12.810> object<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.619> fact<00:01:13.920> very<00:01:14.130> often

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that a neutral object in fact very often

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
that a neutral object in fact very often
we<00:01:14.760> don't<00:01:14.850> even<00:01:15.030> draw<00:01:15.540> an<00:01:15.869> even<00:01:16.080> number<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
we don't even draw an even number of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.920 
we don't even draw an even number of
charges<00:01:19.820> we<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.030> leave<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.210> alone<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.780> show

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
charges we just leave it alone to show

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.480 
charges we just leave it alone to show
that<00:01:22.049> there's<00:01:22.229> no<00:01:22.409> extra<00:01:22.680> negatives<00:01:23.130> no<00:01:23.250> extra

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that there's no extra negatives no extra

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.859 
that there's no extra negatives no extra
positives<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.030> that's<00:01:24.240> our<00:01:24.390> base<00:01:24.570> case

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
positives and that's our base case

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.450 
positives and that's our base case
scenario<00:01:25.350> saying<00:01:25.650> well<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.130> any

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
scenario saying well we don't have any

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
scenario saying well we don't have any
charge<00:01:26.790> that's<00:01:27.330> zero<00:01:27.810> coulombs<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
charge that's zero coulombs for the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
charge that's zero coulombs for the
amount<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.189> charge<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:30.689> then<00:01:30.810> again<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
amount of charge and then again it's a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.450 
amount of charge and then again it's a
very<00:01:31.320> unlikely<00:01:31.710> situation<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.400> let's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
very unlikely situation but let's

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.950 
very unlikely situation but let's
imagine<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.030> charge<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> balloon<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.869> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
imagine you charge the balloon that you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
imagine you charge the balloon that you
rubbed<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.380> hair<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.560> something<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
rubbed on your hair or something and it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
rubbed on your hair or something and it
used<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.299> start<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.600> even<00:01:37.259> numbers<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
protons electrons but for some reason it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.230 
protons electrons but for some reason it
has<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:40.049> more<00:01:40.320> electron<00:01:40.380> than<00:01:40.950> proton<00:01:41.579> one

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
has one more electron than proton one

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.660 
has one more electron than proton one
excess<00:01:43.079> electron<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.430> instead

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
excess electron if you will so instead

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
excess electron if you will so instead
of<00:01:44.729> drawing<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.180> bunch<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.780> negatives<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.439> a

the<00:01:49.079> positive<00:01:49.229> I'm<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.490> gonna<00:01:50.579> draw<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> one

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the positive I'm just gonna draw the one

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.109 
the positive I'm just gonna draw the one
excess<00:01:51.899> negative<00:01:52.350> here's<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.250> extra

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
excess negative here's the one extra

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.149 
excess negative here's the one extra
electron<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
electron that

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.849 
electron that
it<00:01:55.310> has<00:01:55.840> really<00:01:56.840> unlife<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.289> situation<00:01:57.740> but

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
it has really unlife in situation but

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.200 
it has really unlife in situation but
we're<00:01:58.009> just<00:01:58.039> kind<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.340> imagining<00:01:58.759> aside<00:01:58.999> even

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
we're just kind of imagining aside even

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.300 
we're just kind of imagining aside even
number<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.569> negatives<00:02:00.380> until<00:02:00.679> you<00:02:00.770> put<00:02:00.979> one

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
number of negatives until you put one

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.249 
number of negatives until you put one
extra<00:02:01.939> electron<00:02:01.969> on<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:02.869> that's<00:02:03.049> what<00:02:03.170> I'm

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
extra electron on it and that's what I'm

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.370 
extra electron on it and that's what I'm
drawing<00:02:03.380> there<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.100> each<00:02:05.000> electron<00:02:05.689> has<00:02:06.020> a

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
drawing there and each electron has a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.400 
drawing there and each electron has a
charge<00:02:06.469> that's<00:02:07.069> negative<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:08.780> magnitude

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
charge that's negative and a magnitude

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.009 
charge that's negative and a magnitude
of<00:02:09.530> charge<00:02:09.769> of<00:02:10.099> 1.6<00:02:11.060> times<00:02:11.390> 10<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.989> the

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
of charge of 1.6 times 10 to the

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.880 
of charge of 1.6 times 10 to the
negative<00:02:12.230> 19<00:02:12.920> cool

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
negative 19 cool

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.050 
negative 19 cool
okay<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:16.010> let's<00:02:16.190> imagine<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.610> rub<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
okay now let's imagine you rub the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.520 
okay now let's imagine you rub the
balloon<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.360> little<00:02:17.390> more<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:17.989> put<00:02:18.260> an

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
balloon a little more and you put an

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.670 
balloon a little more and you put an
even<00:02:18.980> 1<00:02:19.250> more<00:02:19.640> electron<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.690> balloon<00:02:20.959> so

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
even 1 more electron on this balloon so

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.250 
even 1 more electron on this balloon so
instead<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:21.950> having<00:02:22.129> one<00:02:22.430> extra<00:02:23.299> electron<00:02:23.330> one

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
instead of having one extra electron one

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.039 
instead of having one extra electron one
more<00:02:24.530> electron<00:02:24.890> than<00:02:25.069> proton<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:26.720> it's<00:02:26.900> got

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
more electron than proton now it's got

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.430 
more electron than proton now it's got
two<00:02:27.379> excess<00:02:28.220> negative<00:02:28.519> excess<00:02:29.269> electrons<00:02:30.079> two

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
two excess negative excess electrons two

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.000 
two excess negative excess electrons two
more<00:02:30.769> electrons<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.610> protons<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.829> so<00:02:33.829> as<00:02:33.950> a

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
more electrons and protons and so as a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.740 
more electrons and protons and so as a
result<00:02:34.190> they'll<00:02:34.519> have<00:02:34.730> twice<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.480> charge

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
result they'll have twice the charge

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.449 
result they'll have twice the charge
that<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:36.110> used<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.470> be<00:02:36.650> used<00:02:36.799> to<00:02:36.950> have<00:02:37.160> this

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
that it used to be used to have this

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.319 
that it used to be used to have this
amount<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.879> charge<00:02:38.680> since<00:02:39.680> each<00:02:40.010> electron<00:02:40.670> has

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
amount of charge since each electron has

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.509 
amount of charge since each electron has
a<00:02:41.360> charge<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.930> negative<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.769> point<00:02:42.980> six<00:02:43.310> times

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
a charge of negative one point six times

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.930 
a charge of negative one point six times
ten<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:43.970> negative<00:02:44.180> 19<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:46.340> there's<00:02:46.549> two

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
ten to the negative 19 and there's two

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.550 
ten to the negative 19 and there's two
extra<00:02:47.239> electrons<00:02:47.390> it'll<00:02:48.019> have<00:02:48.109> twice<00:02:48.500> that

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
extra electrons it'll have twice that

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:57.430 
extra electrons it'll have twice that
amount<00:02:48.769> of<00:02:49.040> charge<00:02:49.280> or<00:02:49.900> negative<00:02:50.950> 3.2<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:57.200> I

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
amount of charge or negative 3.2 and I

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.660 
amount of charge or negative 3.2 and I
know<00:02:57.500> what<00:02:57.769> time<00:02:58.069> you're<00:02:58.280> getting<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.519> hang

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
know what time you're getting the hang

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.890 
know what time you're getting the hang
of<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.819> let's<00:02:58.970> just<00:02:59.030> do<00:02:59.209> one<00:02:59.389> more<00:02:59.420> let's

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
of it let's just do one more let's

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.839 
of it let's just do one more let's
saying<00:03:00.109> I've<00:03:00.260> got<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> whole<00:03:00.799> bunch<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.160> protons

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
saying I've got a whole bunch of protons

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.839 
saying I've got a whole bunch of protons
the<00:03:02.359> whole<00:03:02.569> bunch<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.930> electrons<00:03:03.410> yeah<00:03:04.190> three

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
the whole bunch of electrons yeah three

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.750 
the whole bunch of electrons yeah three
extra<00:03:05.359> electrons<00:03:05.900> three<00:03:06.620> more<00:03:06.920> electrons<00:03:07.519> and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
extra electrons three more electrons and

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.420 
extra electrons three more electrons and
protons<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:09.019> now<00:03:09.139> the<00:03:09.560> charge<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.220> have

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
protons so now the charge that I have

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.670 
protons so now the charge that I have
for<00:03:10.579> this<00:03:10.669> is<00:03:10.880> three<00:03:11.359> times<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.840> charge<00:03:12.139> of

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
for this is three times the charge of

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.980 
for this is three times the charge of
each<00:03:13.010> electron

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.460 

and<00:03:19.500> that'll<00:03:19.770> be<00:03:19.800> negative<00:03:20.430> four<00:03:20.700> point<00:03:20.940> eight

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
and that'll be negative four point eight

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.040 
and that'll be negative four point eight
times<00:03:22.470> 10<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.860> 19th<00:03:23.340> coops<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.840> think

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
times 10 to the 19th coops and I think

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.870 
times 10 to the 19th coops and I think
you're<00:03:25.140> seeing<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.500> pattern<00:03:25.710> here<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.640> point

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
you're seeing a pattern here the point

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.950 
you're seeing a pattern here the point
where<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.000> could<00:03:27.150> say<00:03:27.180> alright<00:03:27.660> let's<00:03:27.720> imagine

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
where I could say alright let's imagine

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.660 
where I could say alright let's imagine
now<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:28.740> this<00:03:28.830> balloon<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.310> has<00:03:29.490> a

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
now that I have this balloon that has a

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.180 
now that I have this balloon that has a
lot<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.420> excess<00:03:30.900> electrons<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.590> lot<00:03:31.860> more

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
lot of excess electrons a lot more

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.430 
lot of excess electrons a lot more
electrons<00:03:32.760> than<00:03:32.820> protons<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.600> fact<00:03:34.110> let's<00:03:34.290> say

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
electrons than protons in fact let's say

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.090 
electrons than protons in fact let's say
we<00:03:34.560> don't<00:03:34.650> even<00:03:34.890> know<00:03:35.100> how<00:03:35.310> many<00:03:35.370> it's<00:03:35.760> just<00:03:35.820> n

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
we don't even know how many it's just n

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:51.980 
we don't even know how many it's just n
more<00:03:38.100> electrons<00:03:38.820> than<00:03:39.560> protons

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.700 

a<00:03:52.520> number<00:03:53.520> of<00:03:53.700> extra<00:03:54.150> electrons<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:54.900> each

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
a number of extra electrons and each

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.610 
a number of extra electrons and each
electron<00:03:56.370> has<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.700> much<00:03:56.940> charge<00:03:57.300> then<00:03:58.200> an

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
electron has this much charge then an

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.840 
electron has this much charge then an
extra<00:03:59.130> you'll<00:03:59.370> have<00:03:59.520> n<00:03:59.760> times<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:01.050> much<00:04:01.850> for

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
extra you'll have n times this much for

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.020 
extra you'll have n times this much for
the<00:04:02.910> charge<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.520> can<00:04:08.640> kind<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.850> use

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
the charge and so you can kind of use

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.220 
the charge and so you can kind of use
this<00:04:09.210> pattern<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.630> figure<00:04:09.840> out<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.020> charge

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
this pattern to figure out the charge

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.050 
this pattern to figure out the charge
based<00:04:10.650> on<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.920> number<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.160> extra<00:04:11.580> electrons

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
based on the number of extra electrons

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.750 
based on the number of extra electrons
if<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.080> extra<00:04:13.560> protons<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:14.580> for

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
if you have extra protons like for

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.490 
if you have extra protons like for
example<00:04:14.850> let's<00:04:15.390> say<00:04:15.600> this<00:04:15.840> balloon<00:04:16.230> here

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
example let's say this balloon here

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.770 
example let's say this balloon here
somehow<00:04:16.920> or<00:04:17.190> another<00:04:17.220> had<00:04:17.610> started<00:04:18.540> even

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
somehow or another had started even

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.330 
somehow or another had started even
numbers<00:04:19.140> of<00:04:19.170> electrons<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.770> protons<00:04:19.830> and

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
numbers of electrons and protons and

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.820 
numbers of electrons and protons and
then<00:04:20.489> an<00:04:20.670> electron<00:04:21.030> was<00:04:21.209> taken<00:04:21.720> away<00:04:21.840> maybe<00:04:22.200> so

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
then an electron was taken away maybe so

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.560 
then an electron was taken away maybe so
now<00:04:22.950> it's<00:04:23.040> got<00:04:23.190> one<00:04:23.400> less<00:04:23.880> electron<00:04:24.090> than

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
now it's got one less electron than

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.240 
now it's got one less electron than
normal<00:04:24.900> or<00:04:25.350> one<00:04:25.830> more<00:04:26.430> proton<00:04:26.760> that<00:04:27.480> electron

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
normal or one more proton that electron

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.620 
normal or one more proton that electron
protons<00:04:29.250> electrons<00:04:29.340> have<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.850> same<00:04:30.060> negative

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
protons electrons have the same negative

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.240 
protons electrons have the same negative
charge<00:04:30.870> just<00:04:31.200> different<00:04:31.470> signs<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.040> you<00:04:32.100> got

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
charge just different signs and you got

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.760 
charge just different signs and you got
an<00:04:32.370> extra<00:04:32.640> proton<00:04:33.080> then<00:04:34.080> your<00:04:34.290> charge<00:04:34.560> is

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
an extra proton then your charge is

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.360 
an extra proton then your charge is
positive<00:04:35.180> one<00:04:36.180> point<00:04:36.450> six<00:04:36.980> times<00:04:37.980> ten<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.310> the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
positive one point six times ten to the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.880 
positive one point six times ten to the
nineteenth<00:04:38.730> coulombs<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:40.560> can<00:04:40.710> kind<00:04:40.860> of

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
nineteenth coulombs and you can kind of

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.190 
nineteenth coulombs and you can kind of
use<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.250> same<00:04:41.430> pattern<00:04:41.850> of<00:04:41.940> how<00:04:42.180> many<00:04:42.510> x-rays

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
use the same pattern of how many x-rays

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.590 
use the same pattern of how many x-rays
you<00:04:43.350> have<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:44.280> figure<00:04:44.520> out<00:04:44.700> what<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.420> total

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
you have to figure out what the total

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.480 
you have to figure out what the total
charge<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.050> going<00:04:46.170> to<00:04:46.230> be<00:04:46.290> based<00:04:47.070> on<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.250> fact

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
charge is going to be based on the fact

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.880 
charge is going to be based on the fact
that<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.700> proton<00:04:48.210> has<00:04:48.390> this<00:04:48.570> charge<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.710> an

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
that a proton has this charge and an

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.000 
that a proton has this charge and an
electron<00:04:50.340> has<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:50.760> church
