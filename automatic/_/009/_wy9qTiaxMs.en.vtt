really natural because um during that

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.480 
really natural because um during that
time<00:05:58.870> my<00:05:59.139> skin<00:05:59.409> was<00:05:59.560> breaking<00:05:59.740> out<00:06:00.039> and<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.370> was

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
time my skin was breaking out and it was

time my skin was breaking out and it was
just<00:06:00.520> not<00:06:00.969> happy<00:06:01.539> with<00:06:02.259> other<00:06:02.620> things<00:06:02.860> that<00:06:03.039> I

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
just not happy with other things that I

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.070 
just not happy with other things that I
were<00:06:03.460> what<00:06:03.940> I<00:06:03.969> was<00:06:04.240> using<00:06:04.419> at<00:06:04.629> the<00:06:04.719> time<00:06:04.900> or

maybe<00:06:05.259> it<00:06:05.379> was<00:06:05.469> just<00:06:05.500> a<00:06:05.740> weather<00:06:05.889> I<00:06:06.099> don't<00:06:06.279> know

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
also get it on their website as well but

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.860 
also get it on their website as well but
I<00:06:32.560> personally<00:06:33.159> got<00:06:33.370> this<00:06:33.520> at<00:06:33.729> Sephora<00:06:34.240> and<00:06:34.570> it

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
I personally got this at Sephora and it

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.560 
I personally got this at Sephora and it
worked<00:06:35.110> really<00:06:35.289> well<00:06:35.380> they<00:06:35.649> have<00:06:35.830> sets<00:06:36.190> too<00:06:36.639> so

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
worked really well they have sets too so

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.570 
worked really well they have sets too so
and<00:06:38.050> they<00:06:38.170> cost<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:38.530> same<00:06:38.590> as<00:06:38.950> if<00:06:39.160> you<00:06:39.370> got

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
and they cost the same as if you got

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.280 
and they cost the same as if you got
this<00:06:40.060> alone

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
this alone

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.100 
this alone
so<00:06:41.950> yeah<00:06:42.400> my<00:06:42.610> set<00:06:42.880> came<00:06:43.060> like<00:06:43.270> this<00:06:43.450> but<00:06:43.900> I

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
so yeah my set came like this but I

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.420 
so yeah my set came like this but I
think<00:06:44.230> they<00:06:44.560> change<00:06:44.830> them<00:06:44.950> every<00:06:45.070> now<00:06:45.310> and

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
think they change them every now and

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.400 
think they change them every now and
then<00:06:45.490> so<00:06:45.760> it<00:06:46.330> depends<00:06:46.840> on<00:06:46.900> what<00:06:47.080> they<00:06:47.260> feel

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
then so it depends on what they feel

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.760 
then so it depends on what they feel
like<00:06:47.680> pairing<00:06:48.520> them<00:06:48.670> with<00:06:48.840> at<00:06:49.840> that<00:06:49.900> time<00:06:50.320> so

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
like pairing them with at that time so

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.570 
like pairing them with at that time so
