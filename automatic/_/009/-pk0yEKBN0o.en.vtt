00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.780
Make sure you only the doll's hand when walking down the runway

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.940
Make it look hanging!

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.660
Hello!

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.680
Hello!

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.140
I'm designer Sujin Kim from SOULSPOT STUDIO

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.820
Nice to meet you!

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.500
The ICONtv!

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.980
You looked really busy!

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.220
I was busy running the rehearsal

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.220
There are many effects on today's show

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.020
So I'm busy directing

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.220
And deciding on who needs an acting lesson

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.760
This collection includes story telling

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.820
I saw a kid model as well!

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.240
This collection's concept is 'In Seoul'

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.660
We all start out as a soul with a dream

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.040
And when the dream is professionalized

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.660
We are actually worn out from the job for most of the time

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.720
The kid model symbolizes

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.160
The reunion with the childhood self

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.540
As we worked on a project about Seoul

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.020
We thought it's necessary to reach out to people who live in Seoul

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.980
So we had a contest

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.780
Which people sent in their life stories based on Seoul

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.640
And there were so many great stories!

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.700
We had stories sent in from those who studies 'in Seoul'

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.300
Who works 'in Seoul'

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.480
Just like the common 'IN SEOUL' term the Koreans use

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.420
Are you close with models?

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.160
Only for the show!

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.240
That's not true~

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.060
We're mainly for business haha

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.620
I like to have the same models for my shows!

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.640
Oh~

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.900
Since I was in today's show

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.700
I should be in the next show as well hehe

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.200
Isn't it your first time at my show?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.740
Yes!

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.540
You'll probably come back next time!

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.840
I look for models with a good personality

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.480
Yes!

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.400
I always have different male models though...

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.380
Ki Young is the only one who was in my show 3 times...

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.860
I'm proud of myself

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.380
I think the female models I have in my show well show the color of my designing style

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.840
I mostly use the same models for the finale runway

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.780
Each model has her own objet

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.000
Different shapes in the t-shirts represent the block figures we used to play with as a kid

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.260
Kids usually see the world based on those shapes!

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.900
There is a model with a sketchbook

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.060
It's actually my sketchbook from middle and high school

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.740
I had prepared for art school examinations after I had taken the college entrance exam

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.120
It snowed really hard on the day I came to Seoul for the exam

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.860
And I think that memory affected many aspects of the collection

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.620
In terms of fabric and mood

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.420
Aren't you going to name my TV?

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.360
'A Pine Grove TV'!

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.120
Whenever we make a fabric order

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.760
We order it under the brand's name

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.780
And once the owner

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.940
Wrote down 'sol-bat' (a pine grove) instead of SOULSPOT!

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.060
That happened to designer Munsoo Kwan as well!

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.820
Oh yeah! It was Moosoo Kwang!

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.020
Whenever I go to pick up the fabric I had ordered over the phone

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.880
It says Moosoo Kwang...

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.860
The most memorable ICONtv interview clip

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.720
Was of a firefighter Seung Ho Park

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.560
I think you did really well on drawing the humanism side of a firefighter!

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.260
Should we be expecting to capture any humanism side of you from your show?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.600
I'm afraid my interview won't turn out to be great like other designers' interviews...

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.780
I can already feel the pressure!

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.280
We, the models, find the clothes really practical and fancy!

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.240
Definitely!

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.800
Feel free to contact me if you find anything missing haha

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.620
Okay~

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.520
It will probably be more than one...

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.260
I feel obligated to give them the clothes LOL

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.380
You should!!!

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.560
How was your first interview with The ICONtv?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.200
I can now understand why designer Kye wanted to take the microphone off!

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.840
I need this off to leave...

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.740
And now I know why she had asked if she can really leave for good haha

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.900
I will see you at the show!
