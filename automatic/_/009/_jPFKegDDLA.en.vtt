00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
but all I had time to of course it was a

it<00:00:34.290> adds<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.620> nice<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:34.829> element<00:00:35.520> of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
it adds a nice little element of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.819 
it adds a nice little element of
surprise<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.809> six<00:00:37.170> four<00:00:37.380> six<00:00:37.590> way

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
surprise that are six four six way

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.920 
surprise that are six four six way

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
doesn't have doesn't have that guessing

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.889

skin but a rocky helmet attached to the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.600 
skin but a rocky helmet attached to the
guard<00:02:02.869> trip<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.890> kind<00:02:04.099> of<00:02:04.130> sucks<00:02:04.399> so
