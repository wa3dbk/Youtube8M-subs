as<00:00:19.550> you<00:00:20.330> can<00:00:20.510> see<00:00:20.720> we're<00:00:20.960> tying<00:00:21.230> off<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.950> split

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
as you can see we're tying off a split

branch on a pinus pinaster tallien stone
pine<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:25.369> we've<00:00:26.210> observed<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.840> big<00:00:27.020> defect<00:00:27.500> in

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
pine and we've observed a big defect in

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.100 
pine and we've observed a big defect in
the<00:00:27.740> corona<00:00:28.070> one<00:00:28.580> of<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.849> limbs<00:00:29.509> has<00:00:29.810> acquired

the corona one of the limbs has acquired

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.100 
the corona one of the limbs has acquired
a<00:00:30.290> long<00:00:30.529> linear<00:00:31.250> split<00:00:31.730> on<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.029> top<00:00:32.239> side<00:00:32.570> we

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
a long linear split on the top side we

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.960 
a long linear split on the top side we
find<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:33.680> pine<00:00:33.890> espana<00:00:34.370> is<00:00:34.610> very

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
find that the pine espana is very

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.790 
find that the pine espana is very
forgiving<00:00:35.570> when<00:00:35.720> it<00:00:35.870> comes<00:00:36.080> to<00:00:36.290> wind<00:00:36.530> throw

forgiving when it comes to wind throw

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.220 
forgiving when it comes to wind throw
and<00:00:37.040> tear<00:00:37.280> outs<00:00:37.489> because<00:00:38.269> what<00:00:38.750> they'll<00:00:38.930> do<00:00:39.080> is

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
and tear outs because what they'll do is

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.720 
and tear outs because what they'll do is
they'll<00:00:39.410> split<00:00:39.800> on<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.040> top<00:00:40.250> side<00:00:40.489> of<00:00:40.670> the

they'll split on the top side of the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.700 
they'll split on the top side of the
limb<00:00:40.910> they'll<00:00:41.150> open<00:00:41.420> up<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:41.660> long<00:00:41.900> linear<00:00:42.350> crack

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
limb they'll open up a long linear crack

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.890 
limb they'll open up a long linear crack
and<00:00:43.010> they'll<00:00:43.580> just<00:00:43.850> arch<00:00:44.150> down<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:44.690> hang

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
and they'll just arch down and hang

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.140 
and they'll just arch down and hang
they're<00:00:45.170> usually<00:00:45.739> out<00:00:46.010> from<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.580> base<00:00:46.790> of<00:00:47.059> the

stem or the trunk

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.289 
stem or the trunk
you'll<00:00:50.690> see<00:00:50.960> how<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.260> limb<00:00:51.949> widens<00:00:52.790> it<00:00:53.030> kind

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
you'll see how the limb widens it kind

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.719 
you'll see how the limb widens it kind
of<00:00:53.449> flares<00:00:53.809> out<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.470> from<00:00:55.040> underneath<00:00:55.339> you

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
of flares out and from underneath you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.490 
of flares out and from underneath you
can't<00:00:55.970> see<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.330> crack<00:00:56.570> but<00:00:56.870> from<00:00:57.110> below<00:00:57.440> you

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
can't see the crack but from below you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.160 
can't see the crack but from below you
can<00:00:57.860> see<00:00:58.010> this<00:00:58.159> flare<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:59.000> they<00:00:59.809> give<00:00:59.989> you

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
can see this flare and they give you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.560 
can see this flare and they give you
plenty<00:01:00.409> of<00:01:00.530> time<00:01:00.830> to<00:01:00.860> notice<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.909> descending

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
plenty of time to notice the descending

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.090 
plenty of time to notice the descending
limb<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.019> canopy<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:03.470> can<00:01:03.710> get<00:01:03.830> up<00:01:03.920> there

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
limb in the canopy you can get up there

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.190 
limb in the canopy you can get up there
and<00:01:04.190> remove<00:01:04.519> it<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.330> it's<00:01:05.720> not<00:01:05.900> one<00:01:06.049> of<00:01:06.080> those

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
and remove it so it's not one of those

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.109 
and remove it so it's not one of those
trees<00:01:06.470> it'll<00:01:06.710> just<00:01:06.890> shed<00:01:07.100> big<00:01:07.369> limbs<00:01:07.670> on<00:01:07.940> you

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
trees it'll just shed big limbs on you

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.660 
trees it'll just shed big limbs on you
the<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.630> italian<00:01:09.049> stone<00:01:09.290> pine<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:10.130> believe

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
the the italian stone pine is I believe

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.280 
the the italian stone pine is I believe
a<00:01:11.060> well-chosen

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
a well-chosen

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.870 
a well-chosen

urban landscape tree because of their

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.080 
urban landscape tree because of their
safety<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.510> reliability<00:01:15.640> we've<00:01:16.640> gotten<00:01:16.970> this

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
safety and reliability we've gotten this

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.850 
safety and reliability we've gotten this
branch<00:01:17.360> down<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:17.900> can<00:01:18.080> see<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.650> base

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
branch down you can see that the base

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.130 
branch down you can see that the base
end<00:01:19.189> is<00:01:19.340> about<00:01:19.549> six<00:01:19.909> inches<00:01:20.180> in<00:01:20.360> diameter<00:01:20.510> and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
end is about six inches in diameter and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.849 
end is about six inches in diameter and
it<00:01:21.860> was<00:01:21.979> probably<00:01:22.250> 30<00:01:23.000> 35<00:01:23.030> feet<00:01:23.869> long<00:01:23.899> a<00:01:24.409> lot<00:01:24.710> of

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
it was probably 30 35 feet long a lot of

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.340 
it was probably 30 35 feet long a lot of
foliage<00:01:25.039> on<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.549> we<00:01:26.149> see<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.570> split<00:01:26.929> this<00:01:27.200> is

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
foliage on it we see the split this is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.169 
foliage on it we see the split this is
the<00:01:27.469> top<00:01:27.710> side<00:01:28.009> of<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.310> limb<00:01:28.490> right<00:01:28.729> here<00:01:28.969> that

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
the top side of the limb right here that

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.389 
the top side of the limb right here that
we're<00:01:29.329> observing<00:01:29.869> this<00:01:30.649> is<00:01:30.829> right<00:01:31.130> at<00:01:31.310> the

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
we're observing this is right at the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.029 
we're observing this is right at the
trunk<00:01:31.700> right<00:01:31.880> out<00:01:32.329> from<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.689> main<00:01:32.929> stem<00:01:33.289> this

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
trunk right out from the main stem this

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.730 
trunk right out from the main stem this
split<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.759> pretty<00:01:35.149> old<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:36.079> been<00:01:36.320> there<00:01:36.499> for

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
split is pretty old it's been there for

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.679 
split is pretty old it's been there for
probably<00:01:36.770> four<00:01:37.340> or<00:01:37.429> five<00:01:37.609> years<00:01:37.969> maybe<00:01:38.299> more

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
probably four or five years maybe more

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.560 
probably four or five years maybe more
and<00:01:39.469> then<00:01:39.740> we<00:01:39.979> have<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.310> newer<00:01:40.520> break<00:01:40.909> right

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
and then we have the newer break right

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.260 
and then we have the newer break right
here<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:42.350> end<00:01:42.649> grain<00:01:42.979> has<00:01:43.249> failed<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:43.820> we

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
here this end grain has failed and we

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.179 
here this end grain has failed and we
can<00:01:44.479> see<00:01:44.719> the<00:01:44.929> fresh<00:01:45.200> tissue<00:01:45.499> here<00:01:45.950> of<00:01:46.070> the

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
can see the fresh tissue here of the

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.340 
can see the fresh tissue here of the
split<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.060> this<00:01:47.329> has<00:01:47.479> failed<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.929> a<00:01:48.020> couple<00:01:48.289> of

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
split so this has failed in a couple of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.859 
split so this has failed in a couple of
stages<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:49.579> initial<00:01:49.999> opening<00:01:50.479> was<00:01:50.630> right

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
stages the initial opening was right

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.980 
stages the initial opening was right
here<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:51.439> then<00:01:52.100> over<00:01:52.340> time<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:53.090> is<00:01:53.509> weakened

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
here and then over time it is weakened

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.719 
here and then over time it is weakened
and<00:01:54.200> now<00:01:54.350> we<00:01:54.409> have<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.679> failure<00:01:54.979> at<00:01:55.249> this<00:01:55.399> point

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
and now we have a failure at this point

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.940 
and now we have a failure at this point
so<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.329> branch<00:01:56.569> was<00:01:56.840> drooping<00:01:57.079> lower<00:01:57.530> and

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
so the branch was drooping lower and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.399 
so the branch was drooping lower and
lower<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.490> lower<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:59.090> here's<00:01:59.689> that<00:01:59.899> flare<00:02:00.380> I

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
lower and lower and here's that flare I

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.069 
lower and lower and here's that flare I
was<00:02:00.799> talking<00:02:01.310> about<00:02:01.369> where<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.420> can<00:02:02.630> see<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
was talking about where you can see the

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.050 
was talking about where you can see the
the<00:02:03.380> widening<00:02:04.009> of<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.219> stem<00:02:04.609> where<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
the widening of the stem where the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.480 
the widening of the stem where the
fracture<00:02:05.569> occurs<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.259> usually<00:02:07.189> this<00:02:07.340> is

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
fracture occurs and usually this is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.279 
fracture occurs and usually this is
outta<00:02:07.700> sight<00:02:07.819> it's<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.600> top<00:02:08.810> side<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.259> the

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
outta sight it's on the top side of the

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.620 
outta sight it's on the top side of the
limb<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:10.160> can't<00:02:10.460> observe<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.330> this

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
limb and you can't observe this this

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.620 
limb and you can't observe this this
failure<00:02:12.380> but<00:02:13.069> from<00:02:13.460> underneath<00:02:13.790> when<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.390> see

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
failure but from underneath when you see

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.590 
failure but from underneath when you see
that<00:02:14.810> wide<00:02:15.200> flare<00:02:15.770> that's<00:02:16.459> an<00:02:16.700> indicator<00:02:17.180> that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
that wide flare that's an indicator that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.630 
that wide flare that's an indicator that
a<00:02:17.750> failure<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.500> possible<00:02:19.010> on<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.190> top<00:02:19.400> side<00:02:19.610> of

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
a failure is possible on the top side of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.840 
a failure is possible on the top side of
that<00:02:19.850> limb<00:02:20.530> since<00:02:21.530> failures<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.430> do<00:02:22.580> happen

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
that limb since failures that do happen

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.170 
that limb since failures that do happen
in<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.390> pine<00:02:23.569> espana<00:02:24.080> happen<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.340> that

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
in the pine espana happen like this that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.750 
in the pine espana happen like this that
gives<00:02:26.959> us<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.440> good<00:02:27.680> safety<00:02:28.010> record<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
gives us a good safety record of the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.360 
gives us a good safety record of the

trees performance in urban settings

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.320 
trees performance in urban settings
generally<00:02:31.370> they're<00:02:31.520> going<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.730> tell<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.180> if

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
generally they're going to tell you if

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.780 
generally they're going to tell you if
there's<00:02:32.540> a

there's a

there's a
and<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.599> address<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.110> before<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.590> becomes

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
and you can address it before it becomes
