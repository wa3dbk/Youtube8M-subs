a<00:00:35.079> while<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.320> get<00:00:35.710> into<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.010> mindset<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.399> less

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
a while to get into the mindset of less

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.760 
a while to get into the mindset of less
is<00:00:37.059> more<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.629> simple<00:00:37.989> controls<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.500> simple

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.160 
meters and all that go away we're pretty
hardcore<00:00:50.739> gamers<00:00:51.250> ourselves<00:00:52.090> so<00:00:52.390> we<00:00:52.660> just

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
hardcore gamers ourselves so we just

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.950 
hardcore gamers ourselves so we just
tear<00:00:53.829> things<00:00:54.100> apart<00:00:54.329> controls<00:00:55.329> and<00:00:55.750> gameplay

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
tear things apart controls and gameplay

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.470 
tear things apart controls and gameplay
we<00:00:56.320> tear<00:00:56.679> it<00:00:56.980> apart<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:58.000> point<00:00:58.269> where<00:00:58.390> in

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
we tear it apart to the point where in

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.869 
we tear it apart to the point where in
the<00:00:58.600> end<00:00:58.780> we<00:00:59.350> want<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.649> make<00:00:59.800> sure<00:00:59.829> that<00:01:00.100> we

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
the end we want to make sure that we

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.209 
the end we want to make sure that we

play a single leader you play one of

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.860 
play a single leader you play one of

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
liters and that dictate your technology

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.550 
liters and that dictate your technology
tree<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.210> dictates<00:01:22.690> you<00:01:23.020> know<00:01:23.230> what<00:01:23.440> up

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
tree and that dictates you know what up

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.410 
tree and that dictates you know what up
grazing<00:01:23.920> units<00:01:24.160> you<00:01:24.250> can<00:01:24.430> get<00:01:24.670> in<00:01:24.940> the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
grazing units you can get in the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.120 
grazing units you can get in the
campaign<00:01:25.750> is<00:01:25.960> much<00:01:26.140> freer<00:01:26.410> because<00:01:26.800> you're

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
campaign is much freer because you're

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.850 
campaign is much freer because you're
playing<00:01:27.400> you<00:01:27.880> know<00:01:27.970> as<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.660> whole<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:28.990> UNSC<00:01:29.350> so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
playing you know as the whole of UNSC so

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.890 
playing you know as the whole of UNSC so
it's<00:01:30.400> more<00:01:30.610> mix<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.060> match<00:01:31.210> but<00:01:31.720> then<00:01:31.840> they

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
it's more mix and match but then they

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.780 
it's more mix and match but then they
can<00:01:31.990> also<00:01:32.110> play<00:01:32.320> skirmish<00:01:32.800> so<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.460> is<00:01:33.580> kind

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
can also play skirmish so this is kind

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
can also play skirmish so this is kind
