that you'll notice about the aeneid is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.430 
that you'll notice about the aeneid is
it<00:00:35.760> spilled<00:00:36.090> quality<00:00:36.600> because<00:00:36.990> it's<00:00:37.140> built

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it spilled quality because it's built

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.340 
it spilled quality because it's built
pretty<00:00:38.310> much<00:00:38.580> from<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.090> solid<00:00:39.960> block<00:00:40.170> of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
pretty much from one solid block of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.800 
pretty much from one solid block of
anodized<00:00:40.800> aluminium<00:00:41.030> there<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.180> no<00:00:42.450> Greeks

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
what so ever since there is not even a

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.810 
what so ever since there is not even a
removable<00:00:46.050> battery<00:00:46.500> cover<00:00:46.740> there<00:00:47.670> are
