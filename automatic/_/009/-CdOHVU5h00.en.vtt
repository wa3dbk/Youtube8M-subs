00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.890 
striking good everything blends in the
toppings<00:02:33.620> themselves<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.910> flavors<00:02:35.450> are<00:02:35.630> good

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
toppings themselves the flavors are good

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.080 
toppings themselves the flavors are good
and<00:02:36.200> nothing<00:02:36.830> once<00:02:36.980> again<00:02:37.190> striking<00:02:37.700> out<00:02:37.820> too

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
and nothing once again striking out too

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.870 
and nothing once again striking out too
far<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:39.200> although<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.950> flavors<00:02:40.310> all<00:02:40.460> combine

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
far so although the flavors all combine

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.660 
far so although the flavors all combine
very<00:02:41.210> well<00:02:41.300> into<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:41.990> good<00:02:42.200> pizza<00:02:42.520> I'm<00:02:43.520> just

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
very well into a good pizza I'm just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.890 
very well into a good pizza I'm just
going<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.850> take<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> bite<00:02:44.300> out<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.630> crust

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
going to take a bite out of the crust

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.840 
going to take a bite out of the crust
here<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.230> see<00:02:45.410> how<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.710> is<00:02:45.760> doesn't<00:02:46.760> look

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
here to see how that is doesn't look

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.430 
here to see how that is doesn't look
like<00:02:46.970> anything<00:02:47.360> special<00:02:47.390> about<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.050> but<00:02:48.320> we're

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
like anything special about it but we're

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:56.949 
like anything special about it but we're
going<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.590> try<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.890> anyway

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.050 

the<00:02:57.440> crust<00:02:57.709> itself<00:02:57.890> isn't<00:02:58.280> too<00:02:58.489> hard<00:02:58.730> at<00:02:58.909> all

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
the crust itself isn't too hard at all

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.600 
the crust itself isn't too hard at all
that's<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.870> good<00:03:00.049> thing<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:01.129> know<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:01.489> the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
that's a good thing you know so the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.009 
that's a good thing you know so the
crust<00:03:01.819> itself<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.330> can<00:03:02.569> eat<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.930> know

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
crust itself you can eat you know

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.420 
crust itself you can eat you know
sometimes<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.560> just<00:03:03.620> put<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.920> crust<00:03:04.190> on<00:03:04.310> the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
sometimes I just put the crust on the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.920 
sometimes I just put the crust on the
side<00:03:04.640> if<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.790> like<00:03:04.940> hard<00:03:05.180> as<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.330> rock<00:03:05.390> but<00:03:05.750> this

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
side if you like hard as a rock but this

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.559 
side if you like hard as a rock but this
actually<00:03:06.260> does<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:07.310> know<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.940> softer<00:03:08.450> as

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
actually does you know it is softer as

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.470 
actually does you know it is softer as
you<00:03:08.659> can<00:03:08.810> see<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.860> it's<00:03:10.400> not<00:03:10.489> bad<00:03:10.760> not<00:03:11.239> bad<00:03:11.269> at

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
you can see so it's not bad not bad at

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:21.699 
you can see so it's not bad not bad at
all<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:18.530> with<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.890> pizza<00:03:20.530> comes<00:03:21.530> your

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
all so with the pizza comes your

all so with the pizza comes your
habanero<00:03:22.310> pepper<00:03:22.640> it's<00:03:23.629> not<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.870> habanero

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
habanero pepper it's not a habanero

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
some of the pizza in the garlic sauce

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.369 
some of the pizza in the garlic sauce
just<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:58.970> see<00:03:59.120> how<00:03:59.269> it<00:03:59.390> goes<00:03:59.599> because<00:03:59.959> we<00:04:00.230> have

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
just to see how it goes because we have

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.530 
just to see how it goes because we have
to<00:04:00.530> try<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.579> first<00:04:01.790> time<00:04:02.000> trying<00:04:02.269> Papa

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
to try it is the first time trying Papa

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.839 
to try it is the first time trying Papa
John's<00:04:02.900> all<00:04:03.169> right<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:04.160> dip<00:04:04.400> some<00:04:04.669> of<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
John's all right so dip some of the

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:05.949 
John's all right so dip some of the
garlic<00:04:05.060> sauce<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:05.419> think<00:04:05.630> that's<00:04:05.750> what<00:04:05.870> we're

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
garlic sauce I think that's what we're

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.330 
garlic sauce I think that's what we're
supposed<00:04:06.109> to<00:04:06.380> do<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.769> don't<00:04:06.950> know<00:04:07.010> what<00:04:07.190> else

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
supposed to do I don't know what else

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.460 
supposed to do I don't know what else
you<00:04:07.459> would<00:04:07.579> do<00:04:13.810> even<00:04:14.810> then<00:04:14.930> I'm<00:04:15.049> what<00:04:15.319> might

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
you would do even then I'm what might

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.990 
you would do even then I'm what might
not<00:04:15.500> smuggle<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.220> pizza<00:04:16.549> in<00:04:16.609> this<00:04:16.729> but<00:04:16.910> it

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
not smuggle the pizza in this but it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.710 
not smuggle the pizza in this but it
still<00:04:17.209> goes<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.820> for<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.120> first<00:04:23.300> time<00:04:23.539> trying

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
still goes so for the first time trying

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.600 
still goes so for the first time trying
Papa<00:04:24.110> John's<00:04:24.440> in<00:04:24.590> my<00:04:24.710> life<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.160> think<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.430> worked

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
Papa John's in my life I think it worked

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.730 
Papa John's in my life I think it worked
out<00:04:25.760> pretty<00:04:25.820> well

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
out pretty well

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.279

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
now with this pizza and the reason why

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.400 
now with this pizza and the reason why
we<00:04:30.470> got<00:04:30.620> this<00:04:30.830> pizza<00:04:31.220> specifically<00:04:32.199> was<00:04:33.199> for

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
we got this pizza specifically was for
