00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.510 

the<00:01:46.420> future

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.440 

and<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.880> things<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.179> we<00:01:54.270> talked

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and one of the things that we talked

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.370 
and one of the things that we talked
about<00:01:54.600> beforehand<00:01:55.319> was<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.979> fact<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:57.380> lot

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
about beforehand was the fact that a lot

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
about beforehand was the fact that a lot
of<00:01:58.469> people<00:01:58.740> don't<00:01:59.009> understand<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.640> parallel

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
of people don't understand that parallel

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.250 
of people don't understand that parallel
parking<00:02:00.539> is<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:00.840> about

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.160 

they<00:02:03.860> started<00:02:04.160> out<00:02:04.280> too<00:02:04.520> far<00:02:04.760> back<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:05.420> does

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
they started out too far back so does

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.760 
they started out too far back so does
the<00:02:06.290> truck<00:02:06.530> tell<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.780> when<00:02:08.780> your<00:02:09.020> final<00:02:09.530> Ford

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
the truck tell you when your final Ford

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.970 
the truck tell you when your final Ford
and<00:02:09.979> what<00:02:10.310> about<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.670> distance<00:02:11.710> yeah<00:02:12.710> there's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
and what about the distance yeah there's

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.320 
and what about the distance yeah there's
a<00:02:13.070> there's<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.460> practical<00:02:13.850> limit<00:02:14.210> that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
a there's a practical limit that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.460 
a there's a practical limit that
limitation<00:02:14.870> how<00:02:15.170> far<00:02:15.440> out<00:02:16.960> we<00:02:17.960> tuned<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.350> in

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
limitation how far out we tuned it in

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.190 
limitation how far out we tuned it in
such<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> way

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.990 

sometimes<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.320> typical<00:02:25.740> Lane<00:02:25.890> Lane<00:02:26.190> where<00:02:26.520> we

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
sometimes a typical Lane Lane where we

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.540 
sometimes a typical Lane Lane where we
would<00:02:27.120> have<00:02:27.270> parallel<00:02:27.720> parking<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.830> yes<00:02:29.280> it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
would have parallel parking and yes it

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.400 
would have parallel parking and yes it
does<00:02:29.760> tell<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> pull<00:02:30.600> forward<00:02:30.870> after<00:02:31.350> it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
does tell you the pull forward after it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.020 
does tell you the pull forward after it
finds<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.860> slot<00:02:32.100> because<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.520> needs<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.910> to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
finds the slot because it needs you to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.130 
finds the slot because it needs you to
go<00:02:33.150> far<00:02:33.420> enough<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:39.150> start<00:02:39.480> steering<00:02:39.810> pretty

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
go far enough to start steering pretty

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.820 
go far enough to start steering pretty
early<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.530> sweeps<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.130> yeah
