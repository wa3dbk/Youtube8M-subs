00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.400 
there's maybe about two meters of ice
and<00:02:50.709> then<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.160> kind<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.519> get<00:02:52.269> into<00:02:52.450> some<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.140> it

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
prefer more like real ice climbing so

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.460 
prefer more like real ice climbing so
when<00:03:06.489> we<00:03:06.790> have<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.359> don't<00:03:07.569> know<00:03:07.660> for<00:03:07.900> example<00:03:08.019> in

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
when we have I don't know for example in

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.370 
when we have I don't know for example in
Cairo<00:03:08.739> when<00:03:09.040> it's<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.310> ice<00:03:09.519> block<00:03:09.989> not<00:03:10.989> good

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
Cairo when it's the ice block not good

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.800 
Cairo when it's the ice block not good
no<00:03:11.530> hurt<00:03:11.859> you<00:03:12.370> know<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.970> were<00:03:13.120> kick<00:03:13.630> it

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
no hurt you know and you were kick it

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.470 
no hurt you know and you were kick it
nice<00:03:14.169> it's<00:03:14.410> such<00:03:14.769> it's<00:03:15.130> it's<00:03:15.549> much<00:03:15.790> better<00:03:16.090> for

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
nice it's such it's it's much better for

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.440 
nice it's such it's it's much better for
me<00:03:16.690> because<00:03:17.590> I'm<00:03:17.919> more<00:03:18.160> like<00:03:18.370> an<00:03:18.609> ice<00:03:18.819> climber

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
me because I'm more like an ice climber

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.099 
me because I'm more like an ice climber
it<00:03:19.959> looks<00:03:20.169> really<00:03:20.560> difficult<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.930> put<00:03:22.930> your

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
it looks really difficult to put your

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.110 
it looks really difficult to put your
crampons<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:24.130> they<00:03:24.340> look<00:03:24.489> like<00:03:24.639> modified

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
crampons that they look like modified

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.970

crampons that you're trying to jab into

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.650 
crampons that you're trying to jab into
the<00:03:27.220> wood<00:03:27.370> like<00:03:27.609> what's<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.269> difference

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
the wood like what's the difference

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.530 
the wood like what's the difference
between<00:03:29.220> those<00:03:30.220> crampons<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.150> normal

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
between those crampons and the normal

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.449 
between those crampons and the normal
ones<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.900> other<00:03:32.139> Mountaineers<00:03:33.010> might<00:03:33.220> take

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
ones that other Mountaineers might take

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.159
