00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.400
 easy and very easy to do 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.350
 we have to use scissors as tail 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.500
 of mouse or ribbon 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.680

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.310

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.790
 tutorial 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.680
 Well look, we'll take the bridles and 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:02.520
 we will put 12 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.720
 we will never put 12 i 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.320
 nothing when we have two is twelve o'clock 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.920
 we will place it 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.930

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.210

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.220
 He liked me 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.090
 combining the colors because it is very 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.659
 pretty 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.659
 you know 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.420
 and nothing and after we have 12 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:48.400
 after we have 12 we already have it like that 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.980
 we will place a 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.660
 then the other because we 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.410
 one of 15 is placed putting the well a 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.330
 with the other one 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.550
 this already after it closes it is no longer 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.140
 open you know 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.960
 after we take it and we close it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.060
 can not be opened then to a le 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.630
 15 small pieces 12 will already 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.810
 we will put 14 and then cut with the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.810
 scissors 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:26.610
 and we close it with others in the corners 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.209
 in the closed corners which I 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.850
 I put a little nervous we closed it in 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.740
 the corners 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.370
 If you do not enter, we give you the 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.930
 back entrance girl on the other side 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.519
 A) Yes 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.110
 you see that when it closes they do not come out 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:51.740
 we cut 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.740
 and we put on the other side another 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.830
 when we see that you can not place 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.820
 well we look at the bridle because it has a 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.440
 entry that closes and no longer leaves anymore 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.560
 they are not taken out 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.790
 we cut 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:19.849
 and the necklace is already there we only have 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:23.330
 that putting the cord here is not 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:28.740
 chemistry we place the cord 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:32.040
 one and the other cut and that's it 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.490
 now we can put you on the tips of 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.490
 cord 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.690
 look that look at the tip of the cord 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:47.470
 I did what we will do then 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.180
 some never biacs 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.180
 that clear now 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.380
 so with a doctor 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.319
 and we can put it or the same color 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:10.340
 or of different color like 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.340
 we are yes 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.799
 we put each one to him so that it is 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.799
 well pretty 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.290
 and we were with the other two 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.040
 this necklace is very beautiful 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.340
 simple and very nice 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.650
 It is also very original 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.900
 the girl will love to wear them because 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.680

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.680
 beautiful 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:51.640
 so already you see is how are the 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.640
 tips 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.020
 so then we tie it 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:07.940
 and I've already made this necklace to use 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.940

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:28.620
 I will teach you that I have made one of three 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.009
 colors 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.659

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.659

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:54.390
 You can both make it longer or longer 

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:58.040
 short as you like to do it 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:01.409
