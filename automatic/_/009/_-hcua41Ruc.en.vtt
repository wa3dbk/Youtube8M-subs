00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:01.619
 four wheels enhanced 

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:03.629
 patency and it does not matter two people 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.440
 quad bike something between 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.990
 madrid and car 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.560
 SUV broken road 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.360
 rough terrain very 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.530
 needed nothing but how will behave 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.100
 similar technique on the ice of Baikal does not know 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.100
 no one 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.970
 this event will be in the book of records 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.119
 Guinness on quad bike Baikal 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.310
 haven't crossed yet 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.970
 ride on a frozen lake 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.140
 decided 17 daredevils are tourists from 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.029
 germany krasnoyarsk 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.119
 exit Parisians 3 quad and two 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.860
 jeep for a week the group will 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.580
 I will travel under the guidance 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.920
 club expedition 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.140
 prepared 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.319
 meaning you have things for cold archers 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.010
 its food is normally organized 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.700
 how would we accompany 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.180
 employees of moh who left and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.540
 control 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.570
 in ice situation on the first day 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.909
 the expedition presented its surprises 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.829
 on the eve of a heavy snow 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.829
 and cars are often stuck in snowdrifts 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.720
 she has a slippery ice surface 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.929
 technique brings 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.700
 sometimes rotate it 360 degrees 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.700
 interferes 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.800
 similar faults appear on baikal 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.510
 every day huge chunks of ice 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.730
 collide forming a jumble 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.750
 Hurry cracks are heard crackle 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.000
 there is a push this is the result 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.860
 seismic activity to 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.690
 need to pass such sites experienced 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.080
 navigator it is called honey 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.810
 captain and reliable technique quad bikes 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 easily copes with the task 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 during travel the group spend the night on 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.110
 recreation centers 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.060
 but not overnight tents on 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 this case has everything you need 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.390
 sleeping bags and tea thermoses temperature 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.619
 minus 10 degrees but sleep is not cold 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.330
 the main thing is to understand that in the tent it is right 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.690
 then let go 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.660
 attempts 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.970
 Hispanic 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.570
 how many people 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.940
 we all understand 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.400
 travelers on the ice 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.469
 make a fire 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.659
 between quadrocycles stretch the growth 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.090
 which hang the boiler 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.349
 old men and grays is krisito go 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.969
 forward 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.969
 very beautiful if you want 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.069
 political scientist 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.069
 30 h 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.859
 this warming drinks on a halt 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.209
 all the same 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.209
 it serves the hole will enter

 Olkhon Island Chivyrkuy Bay 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.670
 the cannon is not islands in total 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.690
 tourists drove across a frozen lake 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.940
 more than a thousand kilometers
