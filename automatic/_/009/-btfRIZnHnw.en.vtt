00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
 Flaxseed and breast cancer survival: epidemiological evidence 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.720
 A class of phyto-nutrients known as lignans can be considered 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.660
 the western equivalent of isoflavone phytoestrogens, 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.160
 which are found in soy products that are popular in traditional Asian cuisine. 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.360
 Lignans and isoflavones share many of their alleged anti-cancer properties. 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.040
 As we have discussed together, eating soy foods is linked to prevention, 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.060
 and with the survival of breast cancer. 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.980
 One could expect the same effects for lignans. 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.680
 We've already discussed the preventive side of things together 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.500
 we have shown evidence from population studies, in-vitro experiments and clinical findings, 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.860
 that have promoted the role of lignans in preventing breast cancer. 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.380
 But what about the women who have already been told this dreaded diagnosis? 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.440
 Three recently published studies followed a total of a thousand women 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.940
 with breast cancer diagnosed and tried to answer this question. 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 The first was from New York, researchers reported a significant reduction in risk 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.700
 overall mortality and in particular breast cancer mortality 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.140
 with higher lignans intake in postmenopausal women. 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.960
 "... Though higher lignan intake can only be an indicator of a rich diet 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.740
 on vegetable foods, specific combinations of certain high foods 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 lignans may be necessary to achieve a beneficial effect on risk 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.680
 factors associated with breast cancer mortality and thus prolonging the life of patients. " 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.240
 In 2012 one study came from Italy. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.360
 For surgical interventions to remove primary tumors in the breast, 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.600
 doctors took blood samples from women. They had women in the next five years 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.400
 with the smallest amount of lignans in the blood (shown in blue) much larger 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.240
 probability of death due to cancer recurrence 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.860
 than women with higher levels of lignans in the blood (shown in red). 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.000
 The researchers concluded that “lignans could play an important role in reducing mortality 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.780
 to all causes and to cancer in patients with removed breast cancer. ” 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.980
 The same results came from Germany. 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.080
 Latest and Biggest Studies: "Postmenopausal breast cancer patients 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.020
 which have high levels of lignans in the blood, can survive longer. " 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.540
 Here is the survival curve; the higher the better. 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.740
 The women who had the most lignans in their bodies 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.500
 they had a tendency to live the longest and at the same time the longest without the disease. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.520
 So, what should oncologists say to their patients? 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.280
 "Given this objective evidence that higher levels of lignans in the blood, 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.220
 which is an indicator of higher lignans intake, improves breast cancer treatment results 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.160
 it is appropriate to declare victory and recommend 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.200
 breast cancer patients enrich their diet with flax seeds? " 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.880
 The editorial concluded that not just evidence from laboratories and populations was sufficient for the recommendation 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.480
 studies, strong evidence from clinical research is needed. We'll talk about them next time.
