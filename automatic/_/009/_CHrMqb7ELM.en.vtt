00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.920
 the following video is part of 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.720
 our educational innovation project 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.580
 done in kindergarten is read 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.189
 will show how the stimulation works 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.890
 multisensory in a scientific way and 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.460
 coordinated for 3-month - old children 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.649
 from now on in the 60s a group of 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.110
 neurologists through research 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.059
 found that when the child fails 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.489
 correctly process the 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.899
 Sensory information is difficult 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.090
 reach levels of development 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.000
 higher causing problems of 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.840
 learning skills at the level 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 cognitive motor and no and language 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.380
 Following these studies it was developed 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.130
 the stimulation technique 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.800
 multisensory multisensory room 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.579
 multi cencic is equipped with stimuli 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.100
 of lights smells textures sounds and 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.890
 colors where the person explores 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.930
 discover and enjoy the sensations 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.600
 that the team in the room provides 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.290
 managing to mature the nervous system 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.690
 central 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.390
 some of the benefits that the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.040
 Multisensory stimulation is a better 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.870
 concentration attention and self control 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.270
 enhancing cognitive abilities and 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.810
 intellectuals avoiding failure 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.240
 school 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 bolt and sense that is applied in a 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.950
 individual by means of a person 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.080
 specialized and trained to achieve 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.670
 the objectives of the program 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.370
 multisensory presentation of 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.770
 stimuli follows a strict program already 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.290
 from an established protocol that 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.150
 allows the development of the senses to 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.369
 working on the multi system without 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.450
 that children achieve a maturation 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.360
 balanced 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.280
 precise and evolved by strengthening its 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.700
 customized both in appearance 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.040
 neurological as emotional physicist and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.220
 affective through stimulation 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.810
 multisensory we are stimulating all 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.420
 the reactions that the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.800
 organism focusing on the five 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.610
 visual sensory auditory olfactory tactile 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.230
 and gustatory tactile stimulation 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.900
 it is observed through exercise 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.790
 certain body parts so that 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.790
 enter a state of relaxation and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.770
 auditory attention auditory sense 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.750
 constantly stimulated during the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.180
 instance of the child in the room 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.820
 multisensory with specialized music 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.130
 of relaxation in addition to communication 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.020
 verbal with the therapist stimulation 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.920
 visual is obtained by means of 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.750
 ambience of lights colors and figures 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.510
 reflected throughout the room which 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.730
 they are changing according to the activity 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.280
 realized with this, the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.770
 back of the brain where he resides 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.160
 the ability to perceive and memorize 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.980
 figures letters and numbers that will lead to 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.950
 learning to read and write with the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.380
 help of different aromas and flavors 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.510
 we stimulate the smell and taste of this 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.120
 way the central part of the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.600
 brain maturing the capabilities of the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.550
 a high stimulation method

 neuro psychopedagogical quality arrives 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.870
 perhaps to a high degree the maturation of
