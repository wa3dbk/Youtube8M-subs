00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello my little viewers and 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.110
 subscribers and all who looked at all 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.900
 who started watching this video in general 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.830
 Hello 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.259
 I decided to download and watch the society 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.470
 This zengra then not when she's cool 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:25.759
 and even more so for me 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.849
 Familiar, too, this game began to play and I 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.529
 I thought why not for some reason, too, and 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:35.140
 to play 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:37.739
 I don't know anything here, so 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 if anything 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.579
 do not be offended, well, I will say everything 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:52.620
 what I will see in essence 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:55.579
 the film goes on on here boots 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.579
 well ok 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.090
 Now back such that experience 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.090
 I am pregnant 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.620
 even this one 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.870
 she is shorter 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.380
 ran 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.950
 so here I ran somewhere out there some 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.340
 part 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.340
 and strength is the essence 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.810
 than they do not say that I am bazaar 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.740
 now so now where to now he 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.190
 need to run there she run 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.340
 tell something 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.730
 Well, the principle of the graph is not so black here 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.770
 it is a pity that you can not fly or you can fly 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.650
 in general, are not I there saw only 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.060
 horses 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.970
 least flying objects i'm not 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:53.690
 I did not see here at all here the schedule here too 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.280
 such good good and of course 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.280
 convenient to write down the most important thing 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.640
 here 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:12.850
 just to see my gameplay is nothing 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:17.320
 there is no such hard here and I am 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.720
 the second became ha ha ha oh my goodness yes 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.390
 investment remained 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.750
 sorry sorry i stumble 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.750
 strong 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.740
 because recently got up and mara decided 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.010
 out 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.610
 media stanislav 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.880
 so tell everyone in general people and to whom 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.800
 like cream 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.590
 but you seem to me exactly 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.210
 give up and interesting for me so 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.580
 Well, at least I have a lot of games 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.580
 by 15 to 10 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.000
 not everyone likes everything yet 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.950
 and what's so difficult there isnâ€™t all true 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.370
 English but only 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.650
 I don't really mean it 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.319
 figured out what to do here and he 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.200
 this is a novice course can leave 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:21.160
 prologue and there it is all told 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.769
 and that is the management of the main firebox in 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.980
 the game 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.980
 interface well and every such beard here 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.200
 by gosh this is 5 euros i think 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.340
 seeking 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.370
 I 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.370
 but 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.910
 dude you have no power 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.910
 where did he pretend 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.640
 i don't really understand i thought your 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.640
 boobs records 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.260
 in general, everything is there 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.780
 200 x with normal understanding that 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.830
 such a 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.819
 because 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.310
 almond then 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.310
 see your comments 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.549
 it's like it 's the little things that i will 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.549
 only available on 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:23.180
 3 ml el-lia i only 2 and 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:27.910
 unfortunately this is a scroll I read skill 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.910
 skill that there throws holder 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.910
 well me all passive passive ancestor i 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.910
 fearfully 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.850
 hi man 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.840
 Lena I think that they will tell 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.220
 what are the times and classes, etc. 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.030
 because you can do it yourself 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.610
 from the official website and and already see 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.630
 I threw the link in the description look 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.630
 wonder how 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.340
 I know before all about this game 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:11.710
 fact and and heard that there was some 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.780
 rumor yes but did not go into details 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.370
 Now I am tormented by the question what should I do 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.470
 Further just what to do next is real 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:26.060
 because i don't understand 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:28.300
 so there could be no Levish opinion 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.930
 no levitsky they have a tray 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.059
 by the way 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.310
 so I generally did not understand something like 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:40.810
 do and 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:44.040
 my character is just a couple and 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.840
 dad we can about what kuni hand 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.770
 gentlemen hike content on the butt and 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:54.789
 some yes yes yes yes need to tell 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.250
 In general, I noticed one thing that in crowded 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.800
 places you have sag fps you see 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.099
 Here and parts there look at this very 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.970
 the market and everything is slack 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:09.099
 overall i think i will finish on this 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:13.180
 What a chick is in general I think that on 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:18.599
