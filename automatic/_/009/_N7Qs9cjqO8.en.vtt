00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello so here is the new flight 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.680
 six stadium flights is the new fable 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.850
 is from hp 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.380
 this fable is actually what is it 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.859
 the best of all worlds between a 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.900
 smartphone and a tablet i.e. 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.269
 a more powerful smartphone and a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.310
 tablet better connect with 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.399
 functions or even works under android 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.200
 4.2 in standard mode it will be the setting 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.149
 day of 4 4 will obviously be 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.840
 available at launch it integrates 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.760
 a four- core processor marvel in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.920
 terms of design 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.770
 we are on a slab y ps did not see a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 design that wants to be relatively late on 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.680
 a weight that is 160 grams so if 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.379
 we really make a mobile product 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.579
 two speakers in frontals it can 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.690
 sound anecdotal but it's very 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.280
 important since we realize 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 that in fact people are left a lot 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.430
 of time with their smartphone or their 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.500
 mobile device to use it as a 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.050
 tablet and having the high 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.600
 speakers on the front allows for 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.720
 to have a better a better 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.710
 double camera sound reproduction 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 frontal a back exposed with 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 built-in flash 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.800
 here is a battery of 3000 put in bores 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.690
 which grants him an autonomy of more than 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.690
 13 hours in rotating video mode 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.660
 so that's so in terms of service we 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.910
 has completed eprint which actually allows 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.560
 to print using an application to 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.070
 ability to print photos of content 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.330
 web just since since his fable 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.180
 to be directly on a printer 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.100
 knows compatible wifi direct and we 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.130
 also integrates another another 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.340
 solution that evokes what allows in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.760
 being able to store for free 25 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.010
 gigabytes of content in the cloud and thus 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.660
 benefit from a better of a better 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.080
 storage space inherent in the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.370
 Tablet 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.700
 she is also on stage gilles 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.610
 standard garand expandable to 32 giga via 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.860
 microsd which also makes it its 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.890
 specificity precisely these cantons louvre 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.510
 is that we actually have the micro slot here 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.360
 sd for memory expansion but 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.370
 we also have two sim sim slots 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.080
 standard size and a micro sim 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.420
 additional which actually allows 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.959
 to use voice and data 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.280
 sheep way this last point earlier 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.720
 penultimate point she will be 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.599
 marketed in indifference is 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.090
 of color there will be in total 5.7 of 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.610
 additional color to the silver color 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.500
 standard and with different shapes to 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.140
 2-2 cover which are actually flips 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.209
 cover so that's where the career 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.370
 including the front cover that exists in 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.660
 3 colors you have black here and a 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:02.220
 white and a move version 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.959
 its price will be 249 euros ttc 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.860
 it will be available on shelf at 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.860
 from June 1st
