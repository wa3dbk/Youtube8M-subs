what was going to happen next but the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.220 
what was going to happen next but the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
word few that actually got pretty close

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.990 
word few that actually got pretty close
so<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.590> thought<00:00:16.830> why<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.070> give<00:00:17.369> those<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.820> little

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
so I thought why not give those a little

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.730 
so I thought why not give those a little
bit<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.270> credit<00:00:18.600> because<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.199> course<00:00:19.410> they<00:00:19.529> did

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
bit of credit because of course they did

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.050 
bit of credit because of course they did
guess<00:00:19.980> one<00:00:20.279> thing<00:00:20.310> right<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:20.970> was

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
guess one thing right and it was
