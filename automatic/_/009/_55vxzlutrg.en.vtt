00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and I think we can do it um I might why

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.210 
and I think we can do it um I might why

for each legend that i get i will play
another<00:01:16.530> game<00:01:16.650> that's<00:01:17.460> pretty<00:01:17.610> much<00:01:17.759> how<00:01:17.939> it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
another game that's pretty much how it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.899 
another game that's pretty much how it's
gonna<00:01:18.150> work<00:01:18.270> guys<00:01:18.619> I<00:01:19.619> think<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.640> good

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
gonna work guys I think that's a good

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.870 
gonna work guys I think that's a good
way<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.369> if<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.729> go

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
way to kind of do this and if we can go

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.160 
way to kind of do this and if we can go
that<00:01:24.119> way<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.659> might<00:01:24.840> make<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that way then that might make it a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.450 
that way then that might make it a
little<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:25.380> challenging<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.040> me<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
little more challenging for me as you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.230 
little more challenging for me as you
can<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.790> lacked<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.479> game<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.350> um

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
can see I lacked out one game but um

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.580 
can see I lacked out one game but um
yeah<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.630> mean<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.500> gonna

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
yeah so I mean it's not like it's gonna

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.870 
yeah so I mean it's not like it's gonna
be<00:01:31.680> difficult<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.220> bothered<00:01:32.369> probably
