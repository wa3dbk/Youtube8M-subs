just<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.620> make<00:04:17.769> those<00:04:17.890> more<00:04:18.850> XYZ<00:04:19.299> place<00:04:19.510> namely

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
just to make those more XYZ place namely

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.440 
just to make those more XYZ place namely
lavabo<00:04:20.380> chain<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.950> then<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.789> upstart<00:04:22.120> goblins

I'm<00:04:22.570> teching<00:04:22.930> testing<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.680> at<00:04:23.770> two

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
I'm teching testing it at two

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.870 
I'm teching testing it at two
now<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:24.870> not<00:04:25.080> bad<00:04:25.260> so<00:04:26.010> yeah<00:04:26.160> just<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.760> two

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
now it's not bad so yeah just to the two

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.430 
now it's not bad so yeah just to the two
thousand<00:04:27.180> point<00:04:27.360> gain<00:04:27.570> isn't<00:04:27.870> anything<00:04:28.050> when
