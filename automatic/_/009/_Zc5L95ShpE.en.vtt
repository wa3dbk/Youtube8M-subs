I'm<00:01:29.219> old<00:01:29.610> enough<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.479> remember<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.439> war<00:01:31.649> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I'm old enough to remember the war the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.800 
I'm old enough to remember the war the
Second<00:01:32.820> World<00:01:32.850> War<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.109> when<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> child

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
Second World War and when I was a child

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.550 
Second World War and when I was a child
you<00:01:36.810> ate<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.500> was<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.740> your<00:01:37.770> plate<00:01:39.560> however

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you ate what was on your plate however

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.819 
you ate what was on your plate however
unappetizing<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.670> might<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:42.320> not<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.680> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
unappetizing it might be not because you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.289 
unappetizing it might be not because you
thought<00:01:44.070> by<00:01:44.280> eating<00:01:44.609> it<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.759> were<00:01:44.969> going<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
thought by eating it you were going to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.709 
thought by eating it you were going to
defeat<00:01:45.990> Hitler<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.619> week<00:01:46.770> after<00:01:46.979> next<00:01:47.719> but

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
defeat Hitler the week after next but

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.279 
defeat Hitler the week after next but
because<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.409> wrong<00:01:50.039> to<00:01:50.939> waste<00:01:51.289> it

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
because it's actually wrong to waste it

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.840 
because it's actually wrong to waste it
was<00:01:52.530> morally<00:01:53.189> wrong<00:01:53.609> to<00:01:54.030> waste<00:01:54.570> food<00:01:55.549> well<00:01:56.549> now

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
was morally wrong to waste food well now

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.550 
was morally wrong to waste food well now
it's<00:01:57.450> morally<00:01:58.170> wrong<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.799> waste<00:01:59.250> energy<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
it's morally wrong to waste energy and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.039 
it's morally wrong to waste energy and
my<00:02:01.560> suspicion<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.240> feeling<00:02:03.810> is

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
my suspicion is that that feeling is

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.649 
my suspicion is that that feeling is
going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.469> spread<00:02:05.149> throughout<00:02:06.149> lots<00:02:06.509> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
going to spread throughout lots of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.870 
going to spread throughout lots of
people<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.109> people<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.710> turn<00:02:08.070> turn<00:02:08.610> lights

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
people and people will turn turn lights

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.609 
people and people will turn turn lights
up<00:02:09.090> because<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.570> it's<00:02:09.869> wrong<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
up because they think it's wrong to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.890 
up because they think it's wrong to
waste<00:02:11.220> energy

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
waste energy

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.899
