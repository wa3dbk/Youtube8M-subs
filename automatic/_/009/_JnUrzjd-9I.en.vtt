give you ten pocket service I put a time
it'll<00:02:50.920> create<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.280> though<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.670> felt<00:02:52.060> them<00:02:52.120> all

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
it'll create it though I felt them all

around<00:02:52.510> my<00:02:52.600> walls<00:02:52.840> again<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:53.860> texture<00:02:54.250> pack

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
around my walls again this texture pack

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.860 
around my walls again this texture pack
is<00:02:54.550> called<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.880> gritty<00:02:55.090> portal<00:02:55.420> texture<00:02:55.720> pack

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
is called the gritty portal texture pack

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.470 
is called the gritty portal texture pack
no<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.410> think<00:02:56.950> about<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:58.390> will

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
no I think about this is it will

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.180 
no I think about this is it will
actually<00:02:58.570> kill<00:02:58.900> enemies<00:02:59.410> when<00:02:59.950> they<00:03:00.040> walk

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
actually kill enemies when they walk

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.500 
actually kill enemies when they walk
into<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.580> but<00:03:00.700> you'll<00:03:00.820> have<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.000> enable<00:03:01.270> this

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
into it but you'll have to enable this

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.199 
into it but you'll have to enable this
within<00:03:01.720> your<00:03:01.959> actual<00:03:02.260> mod<00:03:02.470> properties<00:03:03.209> just

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
within your actual mod properties just

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.150 
within your actual mod properties just
go<00:03:04.300> into<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.540> actual<00:03:04.750> mod<00:03:05.020> file<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:06.130> can

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
go into the actual mod file and you can

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.380 
go into the actual mod file and you can
enable<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.670> there<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:06.970> it'll<00:03:07.090> kill<00:03:07.360> anything

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
enable it there so it'll kill anything

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.600 
enable it there so it'll kill anything
that<00:03:07.810> walks<00:03:08.020> through<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.350> for<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.489> the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
that walks through it for you so the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.229 
that walks through it for you so the
next<00:03:09.730> thing<00:03:09.850> we're<00:03:10.030> gonna<00:03:10.120> craft<00:03:10.360> here<00:03:10.690> is

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
next thing we're gonna craft here is

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.479 
next thing we're gonna craft here is
high-energy<00:03:13.239> pellet<00:03:13.720> launcher<00:03:14.370> mobile<00:03:15.370> so

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
high-energy pellet launcher mobile so

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.550 
high-energy pellet launcher mobile so
need<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.670> high-energy<00:03:16.090> pellet<00:03:16.600> catcher<00:03:16.780> which

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
need a high-energy pellet catcher which

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.670 
need a high-energy pellet catcher which
will<00:03:18.370> catch<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:19.060> actual<00:03:19.390> energy<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:20.560> you're

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
will catch the actual energy and you're

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.229 
will catch the actual energy and you're
probably<00:03:20.830> wondering<00:03:21.160> what<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.280> does<00:03:21.610> well

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
probably wondering what this does well

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.150 
probably wondering what this does well
basically<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.930> launcher<00:03:23.320> launches<00:03:23.739> energy

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
basically the launcher launches energy

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.500 
basically the launcher launches energy
and<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.580> catcher<00:03:24.760> catches<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.360> you're

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
and the catcher catches it you're

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.000 
and the catcher catches it you're
probably<00:03:25.660> thinking<00:03:25.840> wallace<00:03:26.200> icity<00:03:26.500> well

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
probably thinking wallace icity well

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.470 
probably thinking wallace icity well
it's<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.310> way<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.459> transferring<00:03:27.910> energy<00:03:28.120> within

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
it's a way of transferring energy within

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.320 
it's a way of transferring energy within
minecraft<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:30.220> we<00:03:30.400> activated<00:03:30.820> by<00:03:30.940> redstone
