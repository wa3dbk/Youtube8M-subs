00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.309
 doing the second part of the numbers 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:16.400
 in Swedish the first part we gave from 1 to 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:20.900
 10 and today we are going to do from 11 to 20 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:24.529
 Well, let's go to the next template 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.400
 here we have it well then the following 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.220
 numbers from 11 to 20 are the 11 that is 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.040
 the ba 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:41.570
 we have the 12 that is sun 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:47.910
 tretton is the 13th is the 14th center 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:51.480
 is the 15th is the 16th 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.809
 houston is 17 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.920
 orton is 18 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.920
 milton is 19 and juice 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 it can be said of the two juicy forms 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.040
 which is number 20 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.110
 I would like to comment interesting things to 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.870
 keep in mind so that we are more 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.909
 easy to remember these numbers by 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.240
 example we have 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.700
 that he 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.500
 11 and 12 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.799
 you know a little bit of English it looks like 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.920
 English enough he will raise it of 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.110
 worth that is to say these two numbers are 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.740
 easy to remember because they remind 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.939
 English then we look between the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.630
 following numbers from 13 to 19 os 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:51.210
 you set all end in tom tom tom tom 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.210
 tom tom tom 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:59.180
 then when we give those of 20 of 20 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.840
 forgiveness from 20 to million 20 30 40 50 a 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.960
 the 100 but the important thing from the 20 to the 90 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.590
 For example, we will see what is more 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.980
 easy the 20 is a little special juice 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.550
 you know that the number 2 is clear says it is 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.260
 that has to do with 20 with 2 that is 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.330
 I 'm a little different from the rest of 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.370
 numbers but that we will give in the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.430
 next number in the next 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.430
 chapter of the Swedish numbers already 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.200
 we will give the third and last part of the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:41.610
 numbers so here you have this second 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.099
 number that or I also know that I think 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.280
 that is quite easy is this part of 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.530
 numbers and nothing to practice a little 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.810

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.049

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.129
