00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
if this gets on the air I think it

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.599 
if this gets on the air I think it
actually<00:03:17.109> could<00:03:17.410> turn<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.620> few<00:03:17.799> heads<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.370> so

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
actually could turn a few heads and so

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.390 
actually could turn a few heads and so
