this but that was not the case so they

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
this but that was not the case so they
started<00:01:17.130> doing<00:01:17.670> all<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.150> games<00:01:18.390> and

playing Halo after school and stuff so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.929 
playing Halo after school and stuff so
it<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.500> good<00:01:40.740> game<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it was a good game this is like the the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.789 
it was a good game this is like the the
game<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.450> hate<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.380> made<00:01:43.560> halo

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
game of hate like this is what made halo

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.990 
game of hate like this is what made halo
halo<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> guess<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> best

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
halo I guess because it's like the best

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
halo I guess because it's like the best
Halo<00:01:45.420> game<00:01:45.570> ever<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.500> custom<00:01:46.920> kids

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
Halo game ever and they have custom kids

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.469 
Halo game ever and they have custom kids
and<00:01:47.220> everything<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.970> kind<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.210> cool<00:01:48.390> but

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and everything so it is kind of cool but

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.420 
and everything so it is kind of cool but
it<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.659> kinda<00:01:48.810> suckish<00:01:49.500> because<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.310> like

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it is kinda suckish because it's like

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.520 
it is kinda suckish because it's like
two<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> half<00:01:51.240> weeks<00:01:51.509> until<00:01:51.720> Call<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.259> Duty

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
ghost comes out and then like a month

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.179 
ghost comes out and then like a month
until<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.450> new<00:01:54.869> consoles<00:01:55.350> come<00:01:55.470> out<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.950> a

until the new consoles come out so not a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.440 
until the new consoles come out so not a
lot<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.520> people<00:01:56.670> are<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.119> playing<00:01:57.329> it
