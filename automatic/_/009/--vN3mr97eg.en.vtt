00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.279
 very well what we are going to demonstrate now is the power of the ph and level with that point 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.909
 5 of the aguán also strong 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.909
 When it comes to avoiding pesticide herbicides 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.420
 and a lot of substance on fruits and vegetables 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.370
 that you do not want to ingest mike your family did here I have two steps 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.970
 with small tomatoes 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.539
 and I'm going to put water from the tap in 1 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.630
 because this is usually the way people go to their fruits and 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.609
 vegetables 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.609
 with tap water 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.940
 in a couple of minutes I will show what regular water could not avoid 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.360
 in the other glass of tomatoes very to put the water so well strong 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 so that you can vote for the power of the level water with 6 points 5 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.320
 and so you can see how many chemicals and other substances are removed from you 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.489
 do not want to ingest 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.489
 or that his family did 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.380
 sometimes 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.060
 Many people want to know why we have so many poisons within 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 our bodies 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.049
 and until there is a demonstration like this one that we are doing today 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.750
 we do not know the different ways in which we ingest these chemicals to see what 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:30.840
 what happens in this demonstration when you removed the water you will be able to understand 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.850
 better how those things happen 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 in the first step with the tap water I will place the water and you can 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.290
 see that the tap water stays clear and clean what it means 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.390
 that regular water did not remove anything absolutely 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.740
 and unfortunately this is the way many people go to their fruits and 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
 vegetables 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.220
 was going to be the other glass of tomatoes washed with water also strong unevenness 11 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.220
 points 5 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.919
 I think that observing the two steps is very, very, very clear that the water 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.819
 regular did not remove the pif ideas pesticides and other substances 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.090
 that you do not want to influence one wants you to make your family through the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.159
 different fruits and vegetables that are consuming 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.569
 you can see that the two colors of ambassadors after the pope the 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.700
 tomatoes for less than a minute you can see the impact they have had on 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.699
 vegetables 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:45.769
 and the best thing is that when you feel the difference you will never wash your 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.719
 fruits and vegetables with tap water and to know the health benefits for 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.719
 avoid these types of chemicals will always look for water candín
