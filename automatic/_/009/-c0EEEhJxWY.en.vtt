 termination of the more than 500 characters itself is not yet 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.380
 have reached 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.189
 m 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.189
 of course you have to work hard 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.329
 in the article simple words back to 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.650
 system because she 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.560
 sweet 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.869
 with the longer 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.949
 so very strange why me 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:29.949
 not personally 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.439
 in a new way 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.439
 I'm in my cat oao night club major 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.660

 sending points 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.270
 Vladivostok 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.210
 so glasses 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.420
 but rude 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.210
 everything was fine 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.120
 igor beetles 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.340
 center 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.340
 Especially as in society cases when 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 on status so 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 Nikolai Semenets discretion 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 buy 2 million 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.530
 so try 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.890
 second riot 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.520
 I guess the card is also because with him 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.820
 everything is interesting just 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 show off 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.310
 in base 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.340
 but 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.810
 by customers 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 so jumps off 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.530
 three payouts owed clear 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.530
 what is this project and colombia 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.010
 attacks so the team 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.160
 mammoth calla polikova to the bottom 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.560
 he did not help to help 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.380
 dura aut 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.380
 it happened our cheat 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.979
 a.v 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.719
 from where 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.719
 however those who are about to miss 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.039
 Magadan 10 sticks 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.889
 they were delivered 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.889
 speaker 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.619
 for which hate 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.079
 however, that device could do the same 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.019
 must learn 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.019
 the bow is small is hard to say goodbye 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.909
 we will not catch up 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.429
 according to 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.429
 and then that motility 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.709
 so and yet 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.709
 Lithuanian executive committee yet such thoughts 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.939
 including 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.239
 it seems nothing 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.239
 he can use 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.479
 via 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.509
 of course you remember the fun of your hand 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:37.129
 pumping the very beginning do not spin 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.129
 ball 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.659
 dzintars than chekiev 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:01.839
 by the way read here and 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.839
 would love to have more 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.359
 etc 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.269
 cool that this book has such a trick 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.579
 this principle can flow quite 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.269
 grabs with hand 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.800
 it's not every day since morning is very cool 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 d.gaev 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.499
 we will lose 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.499
 preparation for riot 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.300
 who lived in prague segment 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.279
 CSKA will not send cells 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.279
 I definitely not before 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:06.499
 according to plan 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:08.559
 bored 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.460
 holy Tikhonovsky 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.460
 what is the failure of this little misha 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.400
 euro motor show 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.350
 so it happened mhk generally light 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.339
 subordinate can not only he 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:24.650
 but because it's cooler 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.849
 however get 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.800
 bulykin even cooler moment product cube 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.039
 you know we assign the assessment of certain 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.740
 there in the planned for the first time 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.740
 First Half Confection 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.749
 brain 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:45.860
 limit and only one 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.860
 instead of 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.599
 buying is very similar 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.599
 if you figure it out 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.889
 so wants to buy the drug 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.210
 hide the corpse deed 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.100
 inspectors understand and from tokyo cues 9 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.479
 so problems to prepare 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:23.430
 omitting how 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.349
 such measure 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:26.789
 so in general 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.990
 batch percentage 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.990
 very nice prize 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.259
 but everything is fine 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.889
 but because it is worth 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.889
 bushman reports 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:48.359
 sheptytsky volunteers 

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:50.849
 Bishkek innovator hide 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.849
 and not crumbles 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.930
 so here at the pyramid 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.669
 roosters communities 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.990
 crowd loft security officials 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.479
 work on our buyers of course 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.129
 all this 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:15.040
 I've lost 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.040
 but on 5 thousand 

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:25.719
 You see, I have so why in Canada 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:26.729
 country 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.729
 cool 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:37.129
 and further 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:40.599
 cabaret is unusual 

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:42.729
 but I understand it 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.729
 news that's why generations 

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:49.119
 cap 

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:52.119
 assistance fund 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.069
 drinking 

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:01.069
 silent but now let's go we'll finish 

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:04.120
 good luck to all and bye
