00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
other big Film Fest quake 3 arena which

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.870 
other big Film Fest quake 3 arena which
I'll<00:00:13.049> directly<00:00:13.469> could<00:00:13.710> compare<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.639> in

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
I'll directly could compare it to in

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.820 
I'll directly could compare it to in
this<00:00:15.420> video<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.900> if<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.139> see<00:00:16.320> little<00:00:16.590> clips

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this video and if you see little clips

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.529 
this video and if you see little clips
of<00:00:17.100> quake<00:00:17.430> 3<00:00:17.609> then<00:00:17.850> don't<00:00:18.090> be<00:00:18.180> surprised

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
of quake 3 then don't be surprised

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.540 
of quake 3 then don't be surprised
because<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:19.650> really<00:00:19.830> hard<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.250> talk<00:00:20.400> about

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
because it's really hard to talk about

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.920 
because it's really hard to talk about
one<00:00:20.850> without<00:00:21.000> talking<00:00:21.390> about<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> other<00:00:21.720> it's

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
one without talking about the other it's

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.390 
one without talking about the other it's
kind<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.109> like<00:00:22.230> Simon<00:00:22.590> &amp;<00:00:22.710> Garfunkel

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
kind of like Simon &amp; Garfunkel

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.580 
kind of like Simon &amp; Garfunkel
they<00:00:23.640> really<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.119> kind<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.570> go<00:00:25.050> together<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
they really do kind of go together and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.710 
they really do kind of go together and
personally<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.910> said<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.180> my<00:00:27.210> quake<00:00:27.510> 3

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
personally as I said in my quake 3

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.349 
personally as I said in my quake 3
review<00:00:28.500> which<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.039> something<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.029> don't<00:00:30.090> say

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
review which is something I don't say

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.560 
review which is something I don't say
about<00:00:30.539> law<00:00:30.720> games<00:00:31.019> I'm<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.759> pinning<00:00:32.759> my<00:00:32.880> colors

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
about law games I'm a pinning my colors

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.880 
about law games I'm a pinning my colors
to<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> master<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> sense<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.710> said

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
to the master in a sense because I said

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.410 
to the master in a sense because I said
that<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.280> unreal<00:00:35.610> tournament<00:00:35.850> kind<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that I was an unreal tournament kind of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
that I was an unreal tournament kind of
guy<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.710> think<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.100> holds<00:00:38.309> through<00:00:38.730> still

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
guy and I think it holds through still

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.750 
guy and I think it holds through still
it's<00:00:39.239> um<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.750> mean<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.340> great<00:00:41.550> game<00:00:41.700> I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
it's um I mean it's it's a great game I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.299 
it's um I mean it's it's a great game I
think<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.180> does<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.540> quake<00:00:43.530> 3<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.980> most

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
think it does be quake 3 in most

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
think it does be quake 3 in most
respects<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.480> some<00:00:45.690> respects<00:00:46.079> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
respects but there are some respects of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.869 
respects but there are some respects of
quake<00:00:46.350> 3<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.680> bare<00:00:46.829> enough<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.340> mentioned

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
quake 3 it's bare enough I mentioned

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
quake 3 it's bare enough I mentioned
those<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.300> well<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.320> already<00:00:49.469> know

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
those as well if you don't already know

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
those as well if you don't already know
Unreal<00:00:50.219> Tournament<00:00:50.250> quake<00:00:51.030> 3<00:00:51.300> were

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
Unreal Tournament quake 3 were

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.729 
Unreal Tournament quake 3 were
first-person<00:00:52.050> shooters<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.500> an<00:00:52.590> emphasis

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
first-person shooters with an emphasis

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.299 
first-person shooters with an emphasis
on<00:00:53.010> high<00:00:53.280> paced<00:00:53.579> frantic<00:00:54.360> multiplayer<00:00:54.960> action

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
on high paced frantic multiplayer action

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.000 
on high paced frantic multiplayer action
and<00:00:56.309> mayhem<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.870> never<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.410> always

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and mayhem and I never really always

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.790 
and mayhem and I never really always
played<00:00:59.340> them<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> bots<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> things

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
played them for the bots and things

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.250 
played them for the bots and things
because<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.829> couldn't<00:01:02.489> stand<00:01:03.140> opponents<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
because I couldn't stand opponents of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.770 
because I couldn't stand opponents of
differing<00:01:04.619> abilities<00:01:05.299> but<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
differing abilities but and there is a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.080 
differing abilities but and there is a
single-player<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.350> both<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.700> they

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
single-player and both you know they

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.700

nothing to write home about it's not

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
nothing to write home about it's not
like<00:01:10.830> Star<00:01:11.070> Trek<00:01:11.100> Voyager<00:01:11.460> Elite<00:01:11.909> Force<00:01:12.150> where

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
there's a 50/50 kind of split between

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.060 
there's a 50/50 kind of split between
single-player<00:01:14.939> story<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.509> more<00:01:16.350> eclair<00:01:16.770> kind

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
pretty useless but in quake it comes in

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.170

the<00:02:17.319> form<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.590> very<00:02:17.890> cool<00:02:18.160> chainsaw<00:02:18.819> already

and the the objectives for assault were
always<00:03:24.760> kind<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.359> felt<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.630> bit<00:03:25.780> baked<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.260> I

but<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.569> bits<00:03:45.750> where<00:03:45.960> you<00:03:46.050> fall<00:03:46.230> off<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> high

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890

there<00:03:49.680> just<00:03:49.709> like<00:03:50.040> in<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.490> quake<00:03:51.060> 3<00:03:51.240> you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
there just like in that quake 3 you

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.670 
there just like in that quake 3 you
could<00:03:52.410> customize<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.069> HUD<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.970> kind<00:03:54.209> of

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
could customize the HUD the kind of

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.440 
could customize the HUD the kind of
things<00:03:55.680> by<00:03:56.130> for<00:03:56.640> some<00:03:56.730> reason<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.060> don't<00:03:57.150> think

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
things by for some reason I don't think

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.230 
things by for some reason I don't think
you<00:03:57.569> could<00:03:57.750> customize<00:03:58.170> how<00:03:58.530> big<00:03:58.740> your

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
you could customize how big your

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.560 
you could customize how big your
crosshair<00:04:00.240> was<00:04:00.450> which<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:01.580> did<00:04:02.580> in<00:04:02.760> Unreal

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
crosshair was which I did in Unreal

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.370 
crosshair was which I did in Unreal
Tournament<00:04:03.709> 2004<00:04:05.209> which<00:04:06.209> was<00:04:06.390> quite<00:04:06.990> nice<00:04:07.170> one

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
Tournament 2004 which was quite nice one

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.430 
Tournament 2004 which was quite nice one
nice<00:04:08.209> as<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.360> can<00:04:09.510> see<00:04:09.690> I'm<00:04:09.780> trying<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.140> kind

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
nice as you can see I'm trying to kind

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.280 
nice as you can see I'm trying to kind
of<00:04:10.700> I've<00:04:11.700> got<00:04:11.850> loads<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.300> different<00:04:12.450> thoughts

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
of I've got loads of different thoughts

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.930 
of I've got loads of different thoughts
going<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:13.709> in<00:04:13.830> my<00:04:13.890> head<00:04:14.010> at<00:04:14.160> once<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:14.610> I'll<00:04:14.730> try

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
going on in my head at once so I'll try

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.880 
going on in my head at once so I'll try
and<00:04:14.970> make<00:04:15.450> sense<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:15.900> all<00:04:15.989> this<00:04:16.230> was<00:04:16.709> my

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
and make sense of it all this was my

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.670 
and make sense of it all this was my
favorite<00:04:17.370> map<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.700> all<00:04:17.850> this<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.419> quite<00:04:19.350> simply

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
favorite map of all this is quite simply

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.380 
favorite map of all this is quite simply
I<00:04:19.799> think<00:04:19.919> one<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.489> greatest<00:04:20.790> Maps<00:04:21.150> ever

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
I think one of the greatest Maps ever

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.230 
I think one of the greatest Maps ever
made<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.930> if<00:04:22.019> they<00:04:22.230> keep<00:04:22.470> on<00:04:22.680> having<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.060> a

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
made and if they keep on having it in a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.230 
made and if they keep on having it in a
and<00:04:24.600> Unreal<00:04:24.930> Tournament<00:04:25.250> game<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.790> wouldn't

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
and Unreal Tournament game it wouldn't

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.940 
and Unreal Tournament game it wouldn't
be<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.390> bad<00:04:27.600> thing<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:28.110> just<00:04:28.230> such<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> great

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
be a bad thing it's just such a great

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.730 
be a bad thing it's just such a great
map<00:04:29.220> it's<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.550> capture<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.000> flag<00:04:30.090> map<00:04:30.740> called

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
map it's a capture the flag map called

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.450 
map it's a capture the flag map called
face<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:33.330> really<00:04:33.690> this<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.380> another<00:04:35.280> one

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
face and it really this and another one

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.550 
face and it really this and another one
called<00:04:35.790> Morpheus<00:04:36.419> which<00:04:36.630> you'll<00:04:36.840> which<00:04:37.380> you

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
called Morpheus which you'll which you

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.080 
called Morpheus which you'll which you
already<00:04:37.860> saw<00:04:38.040> Ashley<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.610> was<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.790> one<00:04:38.910> where

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
already saw Ashley it was the one where

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.120 
already saw Ashley it was the one where
there's<00:04:39.870> all<00:04:40.020> these<00:04:40.110> buildings<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.770> stuff<00:04:40.890> I

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
there's all these buildings and stuff I

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.280 
there's all these buildings and stuff I
think<00:04:41.580> these<00:04:42.030> two<00:04:42.300> maps<00:04:42.480> literally<00:04:43.050> made

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
think these two maps literally made

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.810 
think these two maps literally made
Unreal<00:04:43.860> Tournament<00:04:44.660> like<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.870> can't<00:04:46.800> say<00:04:47.160> set

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
Unreal Tournament like I can't say set

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.210 
Unreal Tournament like I can't say set
anymore<00:04:48.080> Canepa<00:04:49.110> powerfully<00:04:49.800> than<00:04:49.979> that

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
anymore Canepa powerfully than that

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.050 
anymore Canepa powerfully than that
these<00:04:50.520> two<00:04:50.760> games<00:04:51.060> really<00:04:51.510> were<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.590> good

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
these two games really were so good

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.719 
these two games really were so good
these<00:04:54.060> maps<00:04:54.330> are<00:04:54.510> so<00:04:54.690> good<00:04:54.930> that<00:04:55.190> it's<00:04:56.190> hard<00:04:56.520> to

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
these maps are so good that it's hard to

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.020 
these maps are so good that it's hard to
kind<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.950> think<00:04:59.160> about<00:04:59.490> Unreal<00:04:59.970> Tournament

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
kind of to think about Unreal Tournament

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.360 
kind of to think about Unreal Tournament
without<00:05:00.720> them<00:05:00.930> precise<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.440> play<00:05:01.620> play<00:05:02.220> these

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
without them precise to play play these

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.280 
without them precise to play play these
ones<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:02.850> much<00:05:03.120> especially<00:05:03.840> with<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.050> sniper

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
ones so much especially with the sniper

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.460 
ones so much especially with the sniper
rifle<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.710> loved<00:05:05.040> just<00:05:05.960> taking<00:05:06.960> people's<00:05:07.260> heads

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
rifle I loved just taking people's heads

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.810 
rifle I loved just taking people's heads
off<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.890> thing

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
off that thing

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.610 
off that thing
so<00:05:09.210> in<00:05:09.300> terms<00:05:09.540> of<00:05:09.660> maps<00:05:09.930> I'd<00:05:10.140> say<00:05:10.320> actually

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
so in terms of maps I'd say actually

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.320 
so in terms of maps I'd say actually
quake<00:05:10.800> three<00:05:11.040> has<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.190> better<00:05:11.460> designed<00:05:12.090> ones

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
quake three has the better designed ones

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.390 
quake three has the better designed ones
although<00:05:12.720> UT<00:05:13.260> has<00:05:13.440> some<00:05:13.590> real<00:05:13.740> classics<00:05:14.220> as

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
although UT has some real classics as

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.280 
although UT has some real classics as
just<00:05:14.729> mentioned<00:05:15.060> without<00:05:15.450> those<00:05:15.780> two<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.200> the

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
just mentioned without those two and the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.070 
just mentioned without those two and the
additional<00:05:16.680> sniper<00:05:16.950> rifle<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:18.180> know<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.870> you

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
additional sniper rifle you know the you

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.450 
additional sniper rifle you know the you
two<00:05:19.260> would<00:05:19.380> probably<00:05:19.680> drop<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.890> point<00:05:20.190> in<00:05:20.310> my

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
two would probably drop a point in my

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.100 
two would probably drop a point in my
estimation<00:05:20.940> on<00:05:21.180> top<00:05:21.479> of<00:05:21.570> these<00:05:21.660> were<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.900> bunch

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
estimation on top of these were a bunch

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.510 
estimation on top of these were a bunch
of<00:05:22.229> mutaters<00:05:22.770> orbit<00:05:23.070> week<00:05:23.250> there<00:05:23.490> are

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
of mutaters orbit week there are

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.430 
of mutaters orbit week there are
tweakable<00:05:23.910> options<00:05:24.330> in<00:05:25.050> Unreal<00:05:25.410> Tournament

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
tweakable options in Unreal Tournament

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.860 
tweakable options in Unreal Tournament
such<00:05:25.890> as<00:05:26.010> game<00:05:26.220> speed<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:26.820> even<00:05:27.330> though<00:05:27.450> UT

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
such as game speed so even though UT

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.130 
such as game speed so even though UT
felt<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.200> little<00:05:28.289> bit<00:05:28.470> slower<00:05:28.740> than<00:05:29.990> quake<00:05:30.990> 3

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
felt a little bit slower than quake 3

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.840 
felt a little bit slower than quake 3
you<00:05:31.350> could<00:05:31.500> actually<00:05:31.650> increase<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.430> speed<00:05:32.669> at

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
you could actually increase the speed at

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.210 
you could actually increase the speed at
which<00:05:32.880> she<00:05:33.150> played<00:05:33.360> at<00:05:33.539> and<00:05:33.720> low<00:05:34.590> gravity<00:05:34.860> and

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
which she played at and low gravity and

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.710 
which she played at and low gravity and
other<00:05:35.340> things<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:36.180> could<00:05:36.330> change<00:05:36.539> in

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
other things that you could change in

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.529 
other things that you could change in
the<00:05:36.810> game<00:05:36.990> which<00:05:37.410> was<00:05:37.620> made<00:05:37.979> I<00:05:38.280> think<00:05:38.640> UT<00:05:39.240> more

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
the game which was made I think UT more

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.810 
the game which was made I think UT more
of<00:05:39.630> a<00:05:39.690> fuller<00:05:39.960> package<00:05:40.470> really<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:41.550> allows

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
of a fuller package really and allows

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.190 
of a fuller package really and allows
the<00:05:42.000> you<00:05:42.300> to<00:05:42.450> play<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.720> game<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.020> way<00:05:43.050> you

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
the you to play the game the way you

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.029 
the you to play the game the way you
want<00:05:43.590> it

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
want it

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.650 
want it
furthermore<00:05:44.550> each<00:05:44.760> weapon<00:05:44.970> has<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.240> secondary

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
furthermore each weapon has a secondary

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.620 
furthermore each weapon has a secondary
function<00:05:45.870> unlike<00:05:46.350> in<00:05:46.620> quake<00:05:46.860> 3<00:05:47.100> and<00:05:48.030> there's<00:05:48.330> a

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
function unlike in quake 3 and there's a

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.850 
function unlike in quake 3 and there's a
similar<00:05:49.169> health<00:05:49.380> armor<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.130> damage<00:05:50.490> pick

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
similar health armor and damage pick

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.619 
similar health armor and damage pick
as<00:05:51.310> well<00:05:53.189> so<00:05:54.189> this<00:05:54.310> was<00:05:54.490> just<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:54.849> the<00:05:55.240> assault

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:55.629 
as well so this was just the the assault

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.589 
as well so this was just the the assault
mode<00:05:55.870> and<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:57.400> know<00:05:57.490> this<00:05:57.699> is<00:05:57.849> a<00:05:58.090> pretty<00:05:58.449> good

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
mode and you know this is a pretty good

00:05:58.599 --> 00:05:59.969 
mode and you know this is a pretty good
fun<00:05:58.780> as<00:05:58.900> well<00:05:59.050> I<00:05:59.080> felt<00:05:59.439> they<00:05:59.560> could<00:05:59.740> have<00:05:59.860> had

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
fun as well I felt they could have had

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.040 
fun as well I felt they could have had
some<00:06:00.189> better<00:06:00.340> maps<00:06:00.669> and<00:06:00.909> things<00:06:01.090> on<00:06:01.689> this<00:06:01.840> one

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
some better maps and things on this one

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.320 
some better maps and things on this one
and<00:06:02.229> as<00:06:02.469> I<00:06:02.680> said<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:03.009> the<00:06:03.250> objectives<00:06:03.759> screen

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
and as I said the the objectives screen

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.300 
and as I said the the objectives screen
could<00:06:04.449> have<00:06:04.569> been<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:05.710> interface<00:06:06.069> could<00:06:06.189> have

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
could have been the interface could have

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.679 
could have been the interface could have
been<00:06:06.400> laid<00:06:06.580> out<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.789> lot<00:06:06.969> better<00:06:07.210> so<00:06:07.449> that<00:06:07.599> you

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
been laid out a lot better so that you

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.629 
been laid out a lot better so that you
just<00:06:07.780> kind<00:06:08.199> of<00:06:08.259> quit<00:06:08.469> quickly<00:06:09.069> see<00:06:09.280> what<00:06:09.520> the

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
just kind of quit quickly see what the

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.929 
just kind of quit quickly see what the
objectives<00:06:10.150> were<00:06:11.129> you<00:06:12.129> know<00:06:12.280> usually<00:06:12.610> I<00:06:12.699> felt

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:12.939 
objectives were you know usually I felt

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.640 
objectives were you know usually I felt
I<00:06:12.969> had<00:06:13.000> to<00:06:13.240> play<00:06:13.419> the<00:06:13.599> one<00:06:13.810> a<00:06:13.840> few<00:06:14.139> times<00:06:14.379> before

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
I had to play the one a few times before

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.990 
I had to play the one a few times before
I<00:06:14.889> could<00:06:15.159> actually<00:06:16.229> do<00:06:17.229> it<00:06:17.349> through<00:06:17.849> so<00:06:18.849> in

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
I could actually do it through so in

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.390 
I could actually do it through so in
conclusion<00:06:19.150> of<00:06:19.659> both<00:06:19.870> UT<00:06:20.560> and<00:06:20.800> quake<00:06:21.099> 3<00:06:21.280> arena

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
conclusion of both UT and quake 3 arena

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.950 
conclusion of both UT and quake 3 arena
gave<00:06:21.849> the<00:06:22.000> world<00:06:22.150> something<00:06:22.389> special<00:06:22.870> in

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
gave the world something special in

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.350 
gave the world something special in
December<00:06:23.379> 1999<00:06:24.099> and<00:06:24.430> have<00:06:24.819> left<00:06:24.969> a<00:06:25.120> large

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
December 1999 and have left a large

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.050 
December 1999 and have left a large
footprint<00:06:25.870> in<00:06:26.050> FPS<00:06:26.650> gaming<00:06:27.039> both<00:06:27.639> deserve

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
footprint in FPS gaming both deserve

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.360 
footprint in FPS gaming both deserve
applause<00:06:28.419> but<00:06:28.659> my<00:06:28.750> personal<00:06:29.139> favorite<00:06:29.199> is<00:06:29.560> UT

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
applause but my personal favorite is UT

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.830 
applause but my personal favorite is UT
which<00:06:30.610> I<00:06:30.759> feel<00:06:30.969> better<00:06:31.180> than<00:06:31.330> this<00:06:31.569> opponent

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
which I feel better than this opponent

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.990 
which I feel better than this opponent
on<00:06:32.080> most<00:06:32.349> counts<00:06:32.740> final<00:06:33.430> thing<00:06:33.550> I<00:06:33.610> have<00:06:33.729> to<00:06:33.849> say

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
on most counts final thing I have to say

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.029 
on most counts final thing I have to say
about<00:06:34.120> UT<00:06:34.599> and<00:06:34.810> quake<00:06:35.050> 3<00:06:35.259> is<00:06:35.620> that<00:06:35.919> they're

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
about UT and quake 3 is that they're

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:38.879 
about UT and quake 3 is that they're
both<00:06:36.189> fun<00:06:36.550> something<00:06:37.090> that<00:06:37.240> most<00:06:37.569> games<00:06:37.889> fail

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
both fun something that most games fail

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.550 
both fun something that most games fail
at<00:06:39.159> so<00:06:39.729> in<00:06:39.969> conclusion<00:06:40.150> this<00:06:40.629> game<00:06:40.870> gets<00:06:41.289> an<00:06:41.409> 8

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
at so in conclusion this game gets an 8

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.819 
at so in conclusion this game gets an 8
out<00:06:41.770> of<00:06:41.800> 10<00:06:43.020> and<00:06:44.639> that's<00:06:45.639> me
