00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 hi the countries today still a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.830
 fluo makeup video tutorial i'm going 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.060
 realize with the smic palace I got 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.880
 realized I remembered that 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.030
 I had acid slick and I thought 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.220
 slim bah I show them a makeup 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.929
 fluo with a palette they will not have 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.240
 certainly not I said to myself I'm going 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.800
 show them a makeup with the slick 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.779
 palette 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.659
 so these are just maths 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.320
 except these two same or too 3la so 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:34.170
 the two blues and this red burgundy 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 red burgundy they are a little what 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.600
 iridescent they are notified all the rest and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.900
 maths 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.120
 there are some we have some fluo that this 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.860
 pallet is just sublime what 10 euros 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 also that it is sublime I want 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.610
 to say so here I do not know I did not 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.890
 more focus if I did not want to do 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.570
 That's what happens 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.540
 I find it all a little too 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.820
 friendly so that's so if this 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.000
 makeup interests you continues to 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000
 to follow 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.979
 we start with a good white base 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.979
 fat to bring out the colors 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.780
 we start with the fluo yellow with a 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.780
 small flat brush and we chat 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.850
 comes the turn of the fluo orange suits 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.850
 to pose right next 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.700
 for blurring actually I'm going 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.649
 use both brushes sense 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.539
 of materials first the yellow on the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.539
 orange and after orange on yellow 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.659
 well the turn of the fluo pink con 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.659
 nearby 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.810
 and I'm going dimmed as if I were doing 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.810
 a banal 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.849
 I take a small beveled brush to 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:30.549
 to make the inside corner down, he swore 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:33.709
 lower I follow with neon green 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.329
 and after I will see swept with yellow 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.599
 from above to make it even more 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.599
 top 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.240
 I would have preferred to put fluorescent blue 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.820
 blue matte but hey it's like that it's 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.210
 too bad we do with 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.210
 That's what happens 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.170
 we take purple to start the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.830
 banana so I put it on the pink that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.830
 I had faded 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.710
 in fact I clean up I reset between 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.060
 quote the brush to make a good 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.060
 Ham fades about 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.050
 I add a touch of color because 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.050
 that blurring to both of them 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.160
 we take the white to put it in 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.160
 under the brow bone 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.129
 and that's what it gives now 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:46.079
 miss more than ben the eyeliner and the rad 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:48.409
 lower eyelashes and even very will be 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.409
 mucous 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.810
 the final blurring by emphasizing of course 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.590
 internal costs because the beginning of the game 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.270
 was not very fluid 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.739
 after that it is to the choice white or black that 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.319
 you want but to know nevertheless that 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.319
 black always shrinks eyes
