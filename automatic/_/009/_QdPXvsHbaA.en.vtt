00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
through every stride but it is somewhat

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.860 
through every stride but it is somewhat
soft<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.820> better<00:00:32.970> for<00:00:33.060> those<00:00:33.330> guys<00:00:33.510> just

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
response through every stride and then

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.870 
response through every stride and then
into<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.290> pump<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> lowest

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
into the pump here this is the lowest

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.240 
into the pump here this is the lowest
skate<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.110> Reebok<00:00:55.440> line<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.920> does<00:00:56.070> offer

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the pump so that it is a good feature

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.510 
the pump so that it is a good feature
this<00:00:58.410> will<00:00:58.590> help<00:00:58.740> lock<00:00:58.950> in<00:00:59.160> your<00:00:59.250> heel<00:00:59.490> and

way back here that will help keep the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.209 
way back here that will help keep the
structure<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.259> boot<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.560> help<00:01:07.859> keep<00:01:08.070> your

heel locked in in the back area here and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
heel locked in in the back area here and
then<00:01:10.710> running<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.070> into<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> tenon<00:01:11.640> guard

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
then running up into the tenon guard

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.880 
then running up into the tenon guard
this<00:01:12.329> is<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.600> flexible<00:01:12.960> tendon<00:01:13.350> guards<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.740> will

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this is a flexible tendon guards so will

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.489 
this is a flexible tendon guards so will
give<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.219> the<00:01:14.369> maximum<00:01:14.719> mobility<00:01:15.719> in<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:16.289> top

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
give you the maximum mobility in the top

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:18.590 
give you the maximum mobility in the top
of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.679> skate<00:01:16.950> giving<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.640> longer<00:01:18.299> strides

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of the skate giving you longer strides

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.899 
of the skate giving you longer strides
for<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:18.990> powerful<00:01:19.530> strides<00:01:19.770> looking<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.789> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
for more powerful strides looking at the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.910 
for more powerful strides looking at the
front<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.179> this<00:01:21.270> skate<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:21.990> did<00:01:22.170> give<00:01:22.289> it<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.499> 5

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
front of this skate they did give it a 5

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.010 
front of this skate they did give it a 5
millimeter<00:01:23.219> felt<00:01:23.789> tongue<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.329> then<00:01:24.749> backed

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
millimeter felt tongue and then backed

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.480 
millimeter felt tongue and then backed
it<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.350> thin<00:01:25.590> layer<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.920> foam<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.369> do

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
it with a thin layer of foam so you do

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.160 
it with a thin layer of foam so you do
get<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.759> comfort<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.420> also<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> little

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
get that comfort but also with a little

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.200 
get that comfort but also with a little
bit<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> protection<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:29.939> gave<00:01:30.119> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
bit of protection and then they gave it
