00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.480 
and what also what I like about it is
that<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:54.169> doesn't<00:04:54.500> have<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.800> antenna<00:04:55.130> for<00:04:55.430> the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
that it doesn't have the antenna for the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.360
