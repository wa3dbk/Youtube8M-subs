00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.930
 hello welcome to a new tech today 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.960
 let's show the new ipad air here 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.180
 what we have is quite light is one of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.300
 its great characteristics although it has 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.970
 a few more than now we explain 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.599
 to start is lighter and more 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.119
 narrow and smaller than its predecessor 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.910
 the ipad of fourth generation this ipad 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.600
 air is the fifth screens of the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.089
 two ipad are exactly the same 9.7 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.449
 inch as you can see they are equal 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.449
 wide 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.840
 and long 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.470
 but 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.440
 the two devices change a lot of 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.120
 size 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.039
 the ipad has cut to the sides 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.960
 and this makes it a tablet a lot 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.850
 easier to carry but with the same 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.390
 characteristics that we could have with 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.790
 the previous face 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.970
 among the features of this ipad 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.320
 It was necessary to have a processor with 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.770
 what goes on inside that is the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.300
 processor a-7 which is a very processor 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.550
 powerful that we have already found in the 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.290
 iphone 5 that and that has a 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.020
 differential characteristic with respect to 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.390
 others and that is 64 bits that wants 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.520
 say that he works with much more 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.700
 information that the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.759
 above and allows you to do things a lot 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.159
 more powerful than the 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.259
 previous generation of the ipads between 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.119
 other things for example edit 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.009
 photography or video is now much more 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.710
 easy much simpler much more 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.700
 powerful and we can also for example 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.100
 edit documents like this I already did 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.350
 the previous epda but not with the ease 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.830
 with which we can do it with this 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.830
 new 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.910
 the new ipad contains inside another 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.920
 feature that is the m 7 processor 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.540
 that already has the iphone 5 s this 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.550
 processor for what it serves to 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.320
 basically collect data from 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.540
 movement and what applications that 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.790
 use these data do not have to be 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.250
 connected all the time with which 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.920
 we save battery that is your main 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.920
 function and quite useful in addition 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.810
 definitely a much smaller ipad 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.420
 much lighter below the middle 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.709
 kilo and with a very powerful processor 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.440
 inside that will allow us to do 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.640
 many more things in the creative plane of 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.190
 what we could do with their 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.190
 ancestors nothing more until the next
