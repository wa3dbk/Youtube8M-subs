ultimate<00:00:28.980> legend<00:00:29.250> 90<00:00:29.939> catching<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.570> car

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
ultimate legend 90 catching on this car

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.479 
ultimate legend 90 catching on this car
in<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> hit<00:00:31.109> power<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.590> think<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> hit<00:00:32.279> power

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
in the hit power I think the hit power

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.580 
in the hit power I think the hit power
might<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> 98<00:00:33.450> he<00:00:33.600> never<00:00:33.840> has<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> great<00:00:34.380> hit

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
might be a 98 he never has the great hit

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.530 
might be a 98 he never has the great hit
power<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.309> i'm<00:00:35.399> guessing<00:00:35.610> 98<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.420> hit

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
power so i'm guessing 98 for the hit

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.840 
power so i'm guessing 98 for the hit
power<00:00:36.719> we'll<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.649> right<00:00:37.829> 99<00:00:38.250> hit<00:00:38.640> power

power we'll see and right 99 hit power

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.639

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
picking early in the draft that so we

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.129 
picking early in the draft that so we
got<00:04:43.490> me<00:04:43.610> on<00:04:43.639> Titans<00:04:44.180> let<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.750> books<00:04:44.960> we<00:04:45.020> got

draft<00:04:48.889> collectibles<00:04:49.340> for<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.490> most<00:04:49.669> part<00:04:49.880> it

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
draft collectibles for the most part it

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.850

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
should be fun and once again it's a deep

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.129 
should be fun and once again it's a deep
draft<00:04:52.160> chew<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:52.729> I<00:04:52.759> think<00:04:52.849> much<00:04:53.630> any<00:04:53.870> clock

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139
