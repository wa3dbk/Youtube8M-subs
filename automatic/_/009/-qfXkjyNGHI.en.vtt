up but it doesn't leave any flakes are
integral<00:04:15.620> residue<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.580> I'm<00:04:16.670> gonna<00:04:16.880> be<00:04:17.030> left

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
integral residue so I'm gonna be left

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.490 
integral residue so I'm gonna be left
that<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.600> when<00:04:17.690> you're<00:04:17.810> looking<00:04:17.930> for<00:04:18.230> an<00:04:18.320> edge

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
that and when you're looking for an edge

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.229 
that and when you're looking for an edge
control<00:04:18.950> for<00:04:19.190> your<00:04:19.280> box<00:04:19.430> braids<00:04:19.790> you<00:04:19.910> want<00:04:19.940> to

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
control for your box braids you want to

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.480 
control for your box braids you want to
look<00:04:20.600> for<00:04:20.780> something<00:04:20.959> without<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.350> residue<00:04:21.799> so

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
look for something without a residue so

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.820 
look for something without a residue so
I<00:04:22.520> think<00:04:22.610> this<00:04:22.880> will<00:04:23.060> work<00:04:23.300> very<00:04:23.480> very<00:04:23.900> well<00:04:24.110> on

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
I think this will work very very well on

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.580 
I think this will work very very well on
your<00:04:25.610> edges<00:04:26.210> when<00:04:26.510> you're<00:04:26.690> in<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:26.960> protective

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
your edges when you're in a protective

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.340 
your edges when you're in a protective
style<00:04:27.710> where<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.460> can't<00:04:28.760> really<00:04:28.970> get<00:04:29.750> in<00:04:29.990> to

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
style where you can't really get in to

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.260 
style where you can't really get in to
wash<00:04:30.590> out<00:04:30.890> those<00:04:31.100> edges<00:04:31.340> in<00:04:31.610> washing<00:04:31.970> out<00:04:32.060> the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
wash out those edges in washing out the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.320 
wash out those edges in washing out the
build-up<00:04:32.980> now<00:04:33.980> as<00:04:34.310> far<00:04:34.460> as<00:04:34.520> my<00:04:34.730> parameter

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
build-up now as far as my parameter

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.990 
build-up now as far as my parameter
since<00:04:35.870> I've<00:04:36.020> been<00:04:36.170> using<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:37.430> edge<00:04:37.610> control

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
since I've been using the edge control

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.240 
since I've been using the edge control
of<00:04:38.240> my<00:04:38.390> our<00:04:39.020> perimeter<00:04:39.500> of<00:04:39.530> my<00:04:39.620> hair<00:04:39.950> still

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
of my our perimeter of my hair still

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.790 
of my our perimeter of my hair still
looks<00:04:40.280> really<00:04:40.880> really<00:04:41.120> good<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:42.530> brains

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
looks really really good the brains

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.680 
looks really really good the brains
still<00:04:43.040> look<00:04:43.250> pretty<00:04:43.460> pretty<00:04:43.820> fresh<00:04:44.240> because

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
still look pretty pretty fresh because

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.750 
still look pretty pretty fresh because
there<00:04:44.870> is<00:04:45.050> no<00:04:45.230> buildup<00:04:45.620> so<00:04:45.950> yeah<00:04:46.130> so<00:04:46.370> that's<00:04:46.520> my

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
there is no buildup so yeah so that's my

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.490 
there is no buildup so yeah so that's my
overall<00:04:47.240> thoughts<00:04:47.480> on<00:04:47.720> an<00:04:47.840> action<00:04:48.230> of<00:04:48.410> the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
overall thoughts on an action of the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.800 
overall thoughts on an action of the
product<00:04:48.920> on<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.760> scale<00:04:50.030> of<00:04:50.060> one<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.360> ten<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.660> would

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
product on a scale of one to ten I would

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.780 
product on a scale of one to ten I would
give<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.260> an<00:04:51.440> eight<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.010> I<00:04:52.070> had<00:04:52.250> but<00:04:52.490> they<00:04:52.640> can

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
give it an eight and I had but they can

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.940 
give it an eight and I had but they can
get<00:04:52.940> rid<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:55.660> oily<00:04:56.660> build-up<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.560> office

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
get rid of the oily build-up and office

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.620 
get rid of the oily build-up and office
just<00:04:58.130> my<00:04:58.400> climate<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.000> they<00:04:59.090> just<00:04:59.270> need<00:04:59.450> me

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
just my climate and they just need me

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.030 
just my climate and they just need me
let<00:04:59.810> me<00:04:59.870> know<00:05:00.020> in<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.200> comments<00:05:00.620> below<00:05:00.710> have

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
let me know in the comments below have

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.420 
let me know in the comments below have
you<00:05:01.160> try<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.490> product<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:03.350> do<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:03.830> have<00:05:04.100> that

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
you try the product and do you have that

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.760 
you try the product and do you have that
oily<00:05:05.030> build-up<00:05:05.270> or<00:05:05.660> greasy<00:05:06.050> buildup<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:06.590> guess

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
oily build-up or greasy buildup I guess

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.470 
oily build-up or greasy buildup I guess
that's<00:05:07.070> what<00:05:07.220> you<00:05:07.340> call<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.790> greasy<00:05:08.000> buildup

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
that's what you call the greasy buildup

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.600 
that's what you call the greasy buildup
it's<00:05:09.230> like<00:05:09.410> when<00:05:09.650> you<00:05:09.740> put<00:05:09.920> too<00:05:10.160> much<00:05:10.190> grease

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
it's like when you put too much grease

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.430 
it's like when you put too much grease
on<00:05:10.790> your<00:05:10.910> scalp<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:11.690> just<00:05:11.900> starts<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.170> drag

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
on your scalp and it just starts to drag

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.140 
on your scalp and it just starts to drag
down<00:05:12.650> on<00:05:12.680> you<00:05:12.800> for<00:05:12.980> it<00:05:13.160> that's<00:05:13.430> kind<00:05:13.940> of<00:05:13.970> the

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
down on you for it that's kind of the

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.450 
down on you for it that's kind of the
effect<00:05:15.050> that<00:05:15.200> I<00:05:15.260> get<00:05:15.470> from<00:05:15.650> it<00:05:15.770> when<00:05:15.890> I<00:05:15.920> use<00:05:16.130> too

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
effect that I get from it when I use too

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.380 
effect that I get from it when I use too
much<00:05:16.640> but

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
much but

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.690 
much but
