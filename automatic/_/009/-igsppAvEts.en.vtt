00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello to all of you at these atomium to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.970
 welcome to indymac in a new 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.500
 preview video today I'm going 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
 you talk about euro nina which is a game 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.690
 infiltration action that we owe to 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.789
 tomasz vaclav ex it will be available on 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.199
 pc so windows and linux but also on 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.670
 mac and so what are we going to see 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.140
 today well it's the game demo 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.310
 which is available on steam at you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.630
 go access do not hesitate to download 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.519
 to get an idea yourself 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.660
 really accurate about what there is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.279
 in the game but I will try to you 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.240
 talk about it a little bit and I'll go 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.830
 of course to share with me 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.090
 impressions about ben here is 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.989
 the experience that is proposed there are 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.670
 things to say good things about 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.809
 things less honestly honest even though 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.190
 overall it's pretty cool but 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.930
 it is true that to pay the game 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.370
 complete immediately I know 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.059
 not yet frankly I think there is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.860
 a little bit of work 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.480
 unfortunately short we will come back so 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.579
 there we are going to play a murderer 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.620
 so that's the name rollins and that's it 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.270
 so feel the murderous woman that we're going 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.340
 to incarnate who will have to kill five members 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.989
 from an organization a little bit a little 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.190
 little doubtful of which we do not know for the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.230
 moment not much in any case we'll 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.730
 having to kill them that's for sure and in fact 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.350
 well, it's a stealth game in 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.449
 the sense where you go like that power 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.430
 you move recover here people here 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.780
 a sword make small jumps and everything 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.130
 here and there what they know by heart 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.850
 gunfight have to say but wait 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.189
 What is this mess 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.390
 what is this plagiarism what is this bazaar 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.850
 in fact 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.090
 let's say that without really really without 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.770
 complex the game completely plagiarizes a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.330
 part of the gameplay of gan paint to know 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.070
 you have levels that are in a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.689
 atmosphere a little bit ben that rain 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.400
 try the words they mean nothing 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.070
 so with just ben colors 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000
 around pale gray dark blue tones 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.100
 green etc 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.540
 with a gameplay the mouse that goes 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.729
 rely mainly on the use 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.740
 seals where we go like that want 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.210
 jump over more and further away and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.710
 jump on enemies to be able to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.420
 kill so filtration all that and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.670
 also so it will have to be pirates and so 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.590
 computer terminals this 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.869
 way there so really it's very 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.340
 plagiarist from this point of view 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.630
 now it is also inspired 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.860
 other games like marks of the ninja 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.600
 for example and so it's also a lot 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.950
 more bloody is actually here so I 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.640
 jump on the enemy tac I break it in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.990
 big what will happen is that you 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.130
 you will have to do your actions in 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.229
 two times on the one hand with 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.370
 movements and secondly with 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.570
 little buttons like that on which 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.850
 you will be able to support 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.380
 now you're going to have some 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.600
 battles that will not be in real time 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.380
 but well turn-based and in fact this 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.690
 what will happen is that you have 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.610
 like that hop jump for power 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.060
 actually dodge enemy fire that is going 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.340
 fall 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.390
 where you have the laser marker in 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.670
 some sort of blow so it's very 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.739
 important to do an action that is going 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.880
 you get out of this laser and then the 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.430
 kick that I can jump on the enemy 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.590
 like that go to him I can not get me 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.110
 hide then returned to him and has it 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.550
 typed hop like that I am so voila 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.840
 a little bit what is proposed to you there 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.519
 so I got the keys that allows 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.500
 to open the door we can continue so 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.330
 these are really the actions that are you 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.180
 proposed then I know that it 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.710
 it may sound very fun and very cool 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.300
 now I want to tell you 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.770
 no it's not super fun actually the 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.420
 things that annoy me a little bit good already 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.740
 the big legros shameless pumping of 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.640
 gunfight but it's again good 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.720
 that's true if you have not and 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.980
 megan hunt maybe you'll like 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.960
 this one even though I find that for the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.330
 blow he is much less well in his 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.790
 general mood for the blow that was 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.740
 very laid down jazzy and not files there is a 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.930
 very classy side made of a gameplay 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.700
 which is not necessarily there and but by 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.230
 against next to that 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.670
 good know that yes just one thing there 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.599
 has no unhealthy rivalry on 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.500
 developer of greenpoint has done full 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.340
 but it's so cool and touching too much 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.700
 glad to see a game that is inspired by 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.200
 my work 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.660
 there is no problem with this bridge 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.010
 tired but so suddenly this is actually what 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.849
 what is going to happen is that certainly we will 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.480
 see this gameplay that will be very very 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.160
 class to watch but who is ultra h 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.120
 is celebrating and that's something 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.069
 which I do not like at all ie 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.840
 that in fact we certainly have a return everywhere 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.370
 and all that but we have the impression that 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.879
 all our actions are extremely 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.959
 hard to do and I do not really 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.120
 I did not really appreciate this 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.459
 look out of the game that I actually find 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.930
 completely breaks the rhythm it could 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.190
 to be very well done and finally it did not 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.660
 not been that much and it's a small 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.769
 little damage if I will succeed my neck 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.620
 no i knew i was going to keep myself 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.599
 it's not top in water then the attacked 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.920
 we hit I'm going to get killed yeah 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.390
 see there I made you are good 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.010
 it's not serious but it's true here is the 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.329
 jerky side of the actions I find that 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.340
 it completely serves the experience 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.329
 overall game and where we could 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.260
 expect a bloody thing and a 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.220
 little frenetic 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.299
 maybe we could go a little bit more 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.140
 it's okay to have a ride 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.010
 turn for the fighting but it's true 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.459
 that there is way to do it maybe a 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.709
 little better 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.569
 I admit that I was a little bit 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.100
 disturbed so good everyone everyone his thing 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.900
 again after the mood is 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.519
 rather not too bad 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.919
 the rhone side an assassin with precisely 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.180
 this motorcycle helmet and all that good yeah yes 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.010
 why not go crazy has let 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.380
 not so much trouble but it's 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.860
 true that I think there was way to 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.240
 do maybe a little more how to say 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.430
 in aulas I will still do anything 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.510
 what a little more fluid and pleasant to 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.710
 take in hand so yes I did not want to 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.630
 also says but with the right click as 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.590
 that you can if you wish 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.840
 so I can not do what I 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.449
 want to do like that you can if you 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.460
 wish it with the right click 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.830
 move the camera of course for more 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.330
 fluidity and then finally for more 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.490
 forgiveness visibility because doing this 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.469
 we jump and hop here on him I 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.809
 hacker say it again I go again 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.909
 jumped on him decidedly I did not have 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:58.419
 view and therefore there is the hop here 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.240
 gat 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.779
 I managed my bonus kill goal 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.960
 all enemies 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:07.120
 so now it only takes 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.430
 go hop like that here's the up 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.439
 we go to the bike and we break and 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.539
 so that's the way the mission was 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.550
 completed 1 in hand if they miss a 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.589
 terminal I did not do to the ball at the 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.240
 wanted it good it's okay it's not 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.469
 serious anyway I think there with 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.460
 this tutorial most of the game you'll have 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.349
 understood by now there are several 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.270
 missions that are available do not hesitate 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.319
 not to do them because honestly ben 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.370
 this is always a game that is 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.569
 interesting and especially the demo is 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.370
 free so it would still be a 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.409
 little bit stupid to deprive himself but in 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.699
 anyway this is this guy it's a notice a 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.319
 little mixed I think that what 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.509
 works well actually was more or less 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.490
 price of a game that was already working well and 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.649
 next to it maybe a little bit in 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.349
 less well precisely in all this side 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:45.879
 a little choppy and then also in his 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.870
 level design choices that are sometimes 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.469
 a little bit a little chaotic 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.550
 so here I did not necessarily want 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.139
 show because it's more in the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.189
 levels that comes after but there are some 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.879
 things that are done very well ago 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:53.050
 things that are a bit difficult 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.520
 for example on the use of the 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.839
 rope a little bit gives it and then 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.120
 other things like that that are a bit 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:59.169
 here is a little wobbly we'll see 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.580
 sure the final game anyway I think 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.249
 that we will test you on indymac without 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.800
 no worries and so you'll see that at 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:07.060
 time of the full game release 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.870
 just I show you for use of 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.899
 the rope in fact what will happen 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.180
 is that we're going to jump like that and 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:15.219
 redo the click is this way 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.779
 hop seeing in the rope and so that's 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:17.649
 in three clicks we will have to make a 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.459
 body launch I find that a little 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:20.199
 pity we can not do it 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:21.729
 present with just one click and a 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.689
 button or I do not know me a touch that 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.589
 allows us to throw the rope and 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:24.639
 shot automatically and without being 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:26.649
 finally remember at pai and things 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.919
 like that I did not necessarily understand 

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:31.360
 see on this thread good end of the day to 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.709
 you and see you soon on an image 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.860
 for new content go bye all 

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:34.860
 the world
