00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
is awesome and I have to say this one of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.460 
is awesome and I have to say this one of
the<00:01:08.880> few<00:01:09.119> games<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.510> actually<00:01:09.630> did<00:01:10.290> make

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the few games that actually did make

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.679 
the few games that actually did make
good<00:01:10.740> utilization<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> wii<00:01:12.000> u<00:01:12.180> gamepad

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
good utilization of the wii u gamepad

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.410 
good utilization of the wii u gamepad

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
because it actually has you micromanage

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.969 
because it actually has you micromanage
different<00:01:15.900> people<00:01:16.170> controlling<00:01:16.560> different

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
groups of pigment with the top down map

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.859 
groups of pigment with the top down map
that<00:01:19.320> happens<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.100> touchscreen<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.210> on

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that happens on the touchscreen so on

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.170

I'll<00:02:06.300> be<00:02:06.540> honest<00:02:06.870> with<00:02:06.900> everyone<00:02:07.260> when<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
I'll be honest with everyone when I

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.190 
I'll be honest with everyone when I
played<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.370> dead<00:02:08.520> space<00:02:08.760> 3<00:02:08.820> demo<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.869> saw

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
played the dead space 3 demo and I saw

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.470 
played the dead space 3 demo and I saw
some<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.619> gameplay<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.490> trailers<00:02:12.240> I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
some of the gameplay in trailers I

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.090 
some of the gameplay in trailers I
thought<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.050> they<00:02:13.170> had<00:02:13.200> gone<00:02:13.500> off<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.740> rails

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
thought that they had gone off the rails

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.520 
thought that they had gone off the rails
I<00:02:14.460> thought<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.030> dead<00:02:15.390> space<00:02:15.660> 3<00:02:15.720> was

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
I thought that dead space 3 was

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.990 
I thought that dead space 3 was
basically<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> play<00:02:17.460> like<00:02:17.670> lost

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
basically going to play like lost

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.960 
basically going to play like lost
planning<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.110> bad<00:02:19.410> thing<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.790> what

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
planning and that's a bad thing but what

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.760 
planning and that's a bad thing but what
it<00:02:21.090> turned<00:02:21.300> out<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.990> demo<00:02:22.350> actually

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
it turned out was that the demo actually

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.890 
it turned out was that the demo actually
was<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.310> very<00:02:23.700> good<00:02:23.790> representation<00:02:24.780> of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
was not a very good representation of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.900 
was not a very good representation of
what<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.260> actual<00:02:25.710> game<00:02:25.830> was<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.880> cool<00:02:28.910> newly

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
what the actual game was a cool newly

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.360 
what the actual game was a cool newly
expanded<00:02:30.630> gameplay<00:02:31.290> experience<00:02:31.890> from<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
expanded gameplay experience from the
