to<00:00:07.620> talk<00:00:07.770> about<00:00:07.950> units<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.150> clicks<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
to talk about units and clicks and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.820 
to talk about units and clicks and
settings<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.429> all<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.759> good<00:00:11.969> stuff<00:00:12.030> so

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
have noticed beside each of the input

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.560 
have noticed beside each of the input
boxes<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.289> units<00:00:22.289> box<00:00:23.180> each<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.390> these

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
boxes is a a units box each of these

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.830 
boxes is a a units box each of these
little<00:00:24.960> boxes<00:00:25.260> are<00:00:25.769> clickable<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:27.539> all

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
little boxes are clickable and they all

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.550 
little boxes are clickable and they all
bring<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.529> secondary<00:00:29.160> menu<00:00:29.990> for<00:00:30.990> example

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
bring up a secondary menu for example

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.350 
bring up a secondary menu for example
the<00:00:31.650> projectile<00:00:32.160> wait<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.940> click<00:00:33.210> on

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the projectile wait we can click on

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.150 
the projectile wait we can click on
where<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.600> says<00:00:33.690> grain<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.680> gives<00:00:34.860> us<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
where it says grain and it gives us the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.139 
where it says grain and it gives us the
option<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.550> grain<00:00:35.820> grams<00:00:36.420> or<00:00:36.660> milligrams<00:00:38.149> this

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
option of grain grams or milligrams this

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.900 
option of grain grams or milligrams this
goes<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.899> all<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.340> applicable

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
goes for all of them that are applicable

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
goes for all of them that are applicable
and<00:00:43.399> most<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.610> them<00:00:44.730> offer<00:00:45.230> all<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
and most of them offer all of the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.850 
and most of them offer all of the
options<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.789> could<00:00:47.969> possibly<00:00:48.000> want

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
options that you could possibly want

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.060 
options that you could possibly want
there<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.070> some<00:00:50.700> omitted<00:00:51.440> but<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:52.860> are

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
there are some omitted but they are

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.060 
there are some omitted but they are
rarely<00:00:53.520> used<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.020> requests<00:00:55.860> for

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
rarely used and if we get requests for

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.790 
rarely used and if we get requests for
them<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.579> certainly<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:57.120> added<00:00:57.420> later

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
them they can certainly be added later

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.990 
them they can certainly be added later
now<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:59.039> thing<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.250> has<00:00:59.579> been<00:00:59.820> mentioned

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
now one thing that has been mentioned

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.319 
now one thing that has been mentioned
about<00:01:00.359> i<00:01:00.420> snipe<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.109> there's<00:01:01.530> no<00:01:01.739> switch<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.789> go

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
about i snipe is there's no switch to go

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.219 
about i snipe is there's no switch to go
in<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> say<00:01:03.989> make<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> metric<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.489> imperial<00:01:06.299> we

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
in and say make it metric or imperial we

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
in and say make it metric or imperial we
did<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.650> purpose<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.790> did<00:01:08.939> this

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
did this on purpose and we did this

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
did this on purpose and we did this
because<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:09.780> are<00:01:10.049> very<00:01:10.350> few<00:01:10.409> countries

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
because there are very few countries

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.170 
because there are very few countries
that<00:01:11.490> are<00:01:11.820> strictly<00:01:12.330> metric<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.470> imperial<00:01:14.180> for

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that are strictly metric or imperial for

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.719 
that are strictly metric or imperial for
example<00:01:15.630> i<00:01:15.840> live<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.229> canada<00:01:16.530> where<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.610> are

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
example i live in canada where we are

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.510 
example i live in canada where we are
apparently<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.509> metric<00:01:18.990> country<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.340> there

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
apparently a metric country but there

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
apparently a metric country but there
are<00:01:20.549> still<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.420> things<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.110> people

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
are still a lot of things that people

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.240 
are still a lot of things that people
measure<00:01:22.700> imperially<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> word<00:01:25.590> Imperioli

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
measure imperially that a word Imperioli

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.480 
measure imperially that a word Imperioli
it<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.670> reason<00:01:30.630> exactly

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
it is now so for this reason exactly

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
it is now so for this reason exactly
I've<00:01:32.490> we've<00:01:33.420> left<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:35.570> every<00:01:36.570> input

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
I've we've left it so that every input

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.999 
I've we've left it so that every input
can<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.299> decided<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.600> way<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
can be decided the way that you like the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.880 
can be decided the way that you like the
same<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> output<00:01:42.500> they<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.710> be

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
same with the output they can be

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.219 
same with the output they can be
different<00:01:44.520> from<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:44.880> input<00:01:45.299> even<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.020> if

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
different from your input even if you if

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.230 
different from your input even if you if
you<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.869> let's<00:01:49.470> go<00:01:49.649> ahead<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.189> show<00:01:50.759> how

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you like so let's go ahead and show how

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.740 
you like so let's go ahead and show how
some<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.840> might<00:01:52.079> work<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:53.869> example

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
some of this might work for example

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.950 
some of this might work for example
maximum<00:01:57.750> range<00:01:58.610> let's<00:01:59.610> say<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.299> would<00:02:00.630> prefer

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
maximum range let's say we would prefer

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.249 
maximum range let's say we would prefer
to<00:02:01.320> work<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.490> metric<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.960> we're<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
to work in in metric so we're going to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.850 
to work in in metric so we're going to
go<00:02:04.380> ahead<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.619> change<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.280> meters

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.720 

and<00:02:08.960> you'll<00:02:09.960> see<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.710> has<00:02:10.740> automatically

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
and you'll see that it has automatically

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.670 
and you'll see that it has automatically
converted<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:14.060> yards<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.360> meters<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
converted the yards to meters just a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.420 
converted the yards to meters just a
handy<00:02:16.920> little<00:02:16.950> tool<00:02:17.690> there<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:20.160> we'll<00:02:20.340> go

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
handy little tool there and we'll go

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.070 
handy little tool there and we'll go
ahead<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.760> say<00:02:22.010> 1000<00:02:23.010> meters<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:24.030> our<00:02:24.690> maximum

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
ahead and say 1000 meters is our maximum

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.460 
ahead and say 1000 meters is our maximum
range<00:02:25.580> let's<00:02:26.580> hit<00:02:26.730> compute<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.470> you'll

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
range let's hit compute and you'll

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.250 
range let's hit compute and you'll
notice<00:02:29.180> range<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.360> still<00:02:30.570> being<00:02:30.720> displayed<00:02:31.110> in

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
notice range is still being displayed in

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.430 
notice range is still being displayed in
yards<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.210> we<00:02:33.210> asked<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.690> thousand<00:02:34.170> meters

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
yards and we asked for a thousand meters

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.060 
yards and we asked for a thousand meters
and<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:34.740> go<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.040> thousand<00:02:35.490> 75<00:02:36.030> yards<00:02:37.010> now<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
and we go to a thousand 75 yards now the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.050 
and we go to a thousand 75 yards now the
reason<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.910> again<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:41.060> maximum

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
reason for this again is is maximum

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.320 
reason for this again is is maximum
flexibility<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.290> zero<00:02:43.920> compromise<00:02:44.550> for

flexibility and zero compromise for

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.800 
flexibility and zero compromise for
choosing<00:02:46.170> your<00:02:46.470> units<00:02:46.920> there<00:02:47.910> are<00:02:48.239> will<00:02:48.630> be

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
choosing your units there are will be

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.350 
choosing your units there are will be
times<00:02:49.140> where<00:02:49.590> you're<00:02:50.070> shooting<00:02:50.400> at<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> at<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
times where you're shooting at a at a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.930 
times where you're shooting at a at a
different<00:02:51.810> range<00:02:51.989> or<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> new<00:02:52.530> range<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.100> their

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
different range or a new range and their

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.940 
different range or a new range and their
range<00:02:54.239> works<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.780> yards<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.470> prefer<00:02:55.830> to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
range works in yards but you prefer to

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.790 
range works in yards but you prefer to
work<00:02:56.070> in<00:02:56.250> meters<00:02:56.610> or<00:02:56.880> vice<00:02:57.180> versa<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.620> is

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
work in meters or vice versa so this is

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.180 
work in meters or vice versa so this is
a<00:02:58.970> feature<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.330> built<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.080> we<00:03:02.040> think

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
a feature that we built in and we think

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.890 
a feature that we built in and we think
it's<00:03:02.430> something<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.090> will<00:03:03.209> be<00:03:03.330> convenient

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
it's something that will be convenient

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.130 
it's something that will be convenient
for<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.440> lot<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.800> users<00:03:05.090> okay<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.480> let's<00:03:06.959> head

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
for a lot of users okay so let's head

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.840 
for a lot of users okay so let's head
into<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.350> settings<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.040> change<00:03:08.370> them<00:03:08.580> things

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
into the settings and change them things

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.780 
into the settings and change them things
around<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:09.660> our<00:03:09.870> output<00:03:10.320> units<00:03:10.620> match<00:03:11.430> our

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
around so our output units match our

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.900 
around so our output units match our
input<00:03:12.330> units<00:03:12.630> now<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:14.370> we<00:03:14.459> go<00:03:14.519> ahead<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.820> the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
input units now so we go ahead to the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.690 
input units now so we go ahead to the
settings<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:16.160> we're<00:03:17.160> going<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.340> change<00:03:17.519> our

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
settings and we're going to change our

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.160 
settings and we're going to change our
your<00:03:18.150> range<00:03:18.630> from<00:03:18.959> yards<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.590> meters<00:03:21.170> and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
your range from yards to meters and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.650 
your range from yards to meters and
we'll<00:03:22.440> go<00:03:22.560> back<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.970> now<00:03:24.360> when<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:24.630> click

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
we'll go back and now when we click

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.650 
we'll go back and now when we click
compute<00:03:25.530> you'll<00:03:26.459> notice<00:03:26.640> our<00:03:26.940> ranges<00:03:27.480> in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
compute you'll notice our ranges in

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.190 
compute you'll notice our ranges in
meters<00:03:28.549> it's<00:03:29.549> kind<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.299> garbled<00:03:30.720> because

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
meters it's kind of garbled because

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.960 
meters it's kind of garbled because
we've<00:03:31.920> set<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.420> 25-yard<00:03:33.739> difference<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:35.400> you'll

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
we've set a 25-yard difference so you'll

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.400 
we've set a 25-yard difference so you'll
see<00:03:36.209> we<00:03:36.390> don't<00:03:36.600> quite<00:03:36.780> make<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.019> down<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.380> a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
see we don't quite make it down to a

over two meters as well and we'll say

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.210 
over two meters as well and we'll say

every ten meters and compute and now of
course<00:03:50.430> we<00:03:50.549> make<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:50.940> down<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.299> thousand<00:03:54.320> and

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.400 
your scope is is different so now when
we<00:05:03.130> compute<00:05:03.490> everything<00:05:04.480> is<00:05:04.720> starting<00:05:05.230> to

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
we compute everything is starting to

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.220 
we compute everything is starting to
line<00:05:05.590> up<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.300> we've<00:05:07.300> got<00:05:07.480> it<00:05:07.600> all<00:05:07.720> in<00:05:07.750> metric

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
line up and we've got it all in metric

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.220 
line up and we've got it all in metric
and<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:09.610> excellent<00:05:10.120> thing<00:05:10.420> about<00:05:10.720> this<00:05:10.990> is

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
and the excellent thing about this is

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.220 
and the excellent thing about this is
that<00:05:11.320> it's<00:05:11.950> all<00:05:12.160> saved<00:05:12.490> so<00:05:13.270> we<00:05:13.840> can<00:05:14.020> go

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
that it's all saved so we can go

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.620 
that it's all saved so we can go
elsewhere<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:15.460> when<00:05:15.490> we<00:05:15.790> come<00:05:15.970> back<00:05:16.210> into<00:05:16.600> I

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
elsewhere and when we come back into I

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.100 
elsewhere and when we come back into I
snipe<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.350> hit<00:05:17.860> compute<00:05:18.310> all<00:05:19.030> of<00:05:19.360> our<00:05:19.510> units

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
snipe and hit compute all of our units

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.930 
snipe and hit compute all of our units
have<00:05:20.200> been<00:05:20.350> saved<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:21.070> we<00:05:21.370> don't<00:05:21.520> ever<00:05:21.730> have

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
have been saved and we don't ever have

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.550 
have been saved and we don't ever have
to<00:05:22.120> think<00:05:22.330> about<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.720> settings<00:05:23.080> ever<00:05:23.230> again

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
to think about the settings ever again

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.670 
to think about the settings ever again
so<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.490> little<00:05:25.000> bit<00:05:25.180> longer<00:05:25.450> to<00:05:25.690> enter<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.470> very

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
so a little bit longer to enter the very

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.830 
so a little bit longer to enter the very
first<00:05:26.980> time<00:05:27.190> around<00:05:27.370> but<00:05:28.180> much<00:05:28.600> more

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
first time around but much more

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.260 
first time around but much more
convenient<00:05:29.260> for<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:30.430> majority<00:05:30.760> of<00:05:30.970> users

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
convenient for the majority of users

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.710 
convenient for the majority of users
that<00:05:32.520> don't<00:05:33.520> have<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:33.910> luxury<00:05:34.060> of<00:05:34.360> abiding

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
that don't have the luxury of abiding

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.330 
that don't have the luxury of abiding
strictly<00:05:35.470> by<00:05:35.650> Imperial<00:05:36.610> or<00:05:36.790> metric<00:05:36.820> system

strictly by Imperial or metric system
now<00:05:39.340> lastly<00:05:39.760> let's<00:05:40.300> have<00:05:40.480> a<00:05:40.540> quick<00:05:40.720> look<00:05:40.750> at

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
now lastly let's have a quick look at

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.400 
now lastly let's have a quick look at
one<00:05:42.070> of<00:05:42.160> the<00:05:42.250> most<00:05:42.570> requested<00:05:43.570> features<00:05:43.930> is

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
one of the most requested features is

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.080 
one of the most requested features is
the<00:05:44.670> clicks<00:05:46.410> a<00:05:47.410> majority<00:05:48.400> of<00:05:48.430> scopes<00:05:48.760> will

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
the clicks a majority of scopes will

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.960 
the clicks a majority of scopes will
will<00:05:49.780> be<00:05:49.990> defaulted<00:05:50.650> in<00:05:50.920> in<00:05:51.280> one<00:05:51.610> or<00:05:51.730> one

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
will be defaulted in in one or one

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.020 
will be defaulted in in one or one
quarter<00:05:52.330> minute<00:05:52.600> of<00:05:52.720> angle<00:05:53.550> increments<00:05:54.550> per

quarter minute of angle increments per

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.800 
quarter minute of angle increments per
click<00:05:56.190> but<00:05:57.190> there<00:05:57.400> are<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:58.120> slew<00:05:58.510> of<00:05:58.630> different

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810

version<00:06:12.370> I<00:06:13.290> can<00:06:14.290> show<00:06:14.440> you<00:06:14.500> a<00:06:14.590> quick

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
version I can show you a quick

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.440 
version I can show you a quick
demonstration<00:06:15.010> of<00:06:15.550> how<00:06:15.940> choosing<00:06:16.390> a

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
demonstration of how choosing a

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.360 
demonstration of how choosing a
different<00:06:16.570> value<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:17.140> going<00:06:17.350> to<00:06:17.440> change<00:06:17.650> the

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
different value is going to change the

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.840 
different value is going to change the
the<00:06:19.000> cliq<00:06:19.210> value<00:06:19.560> it's<00:06:20.850> fairly

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
the cliq value it's fairly

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.830 
the cliq value it's fairly
straightforward<00:06:22.000> and<00:06:22.990> more<00:06:23.980> than<00:06:24.130> likely

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
straightforward and more than likely

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.890 
straightforward and more than likely
understood<00:06:25.890> so<00:06:26.890> we<00:06:27.220> have<00:06:27.310> an<00:06:27.430> IM<00:06:27.820> negative<00:06:28.360> 9<00:06:28.600> i

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
understood so we have an IM negative 9 i

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.010 
understood so we have an IM negative 9 i
click<00:06:29.590> value<00:06:30.070> there

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
click value there

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.499 
click value there
whereas<00:06:32.620> if<00:06:33.190> we<00:06:33.400> were<00:06:33.460> in<00:06:33.940> its<00:06:34.090> default

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
whereas if we were in its default

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:38.550 
whereas if we were in its default
one-quarter<00:06:35.080> stage<00:06:37.289> there<00:06:38.289> would<00:06:38.410> be<00:06:38.440> a

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
one-quarter stage there would be a

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.589 
one-quarter stage there would be a
negative<00:06:38.740> three<00:06:41.099> so<00:06:42.099> that's<00:06:42.460> the<00:06:43.060> units<00:06:43.389> in

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
negative three so that's the units in

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.589 
negative three so that's the units in
