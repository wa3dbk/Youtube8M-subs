areas like in the back you know I didn't

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.360 
areas like in the back you know I didn't
go<00:04:19.840> crazy<00:04:20.020> you<00:04:20.590> know<00:04:20.680> because<00:04:20.859> I<00:04:20.980> know<00:04:21.040> that

go crazy you know because I know that
it's<00:04:21.520> not<00:04:21.700> as<00:04:21.970> crucial<00:04:22.660> that<00:04:23.050> every<00:04:23.710> single

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
it's not as crucial that every single

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.700 
it's not as crucial that every single
ounce<00:04:24.190> is<00:04:24.490> off<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.090> as<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.169> top<00:04:26.410> and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
ounce is off of it as on the top and

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.170 
ounce is off of it as on the top and
they<00:04:26.919> sod<00:04:27.250> you<00:04:27.640> know<00:04:27.729> what<00:04:27.880> you're<00:04:28.000> going<00:04:28.120> to

be very visible

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.360 
be very visible
so<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.990> know<00:04:30.110> like<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.530> it'll<00:04:30.680> be<00:04:30.800> it'll<00:04:31.190> be<00:04:31.280> a

so you know like and it'll be it'll be a

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.480 
so you know like and it'll be it'll be a
lot<00:04:31.580> easier<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:32.150> take<00:04:32.600> some<00:04:32.990> of<00:04:33.139> the<00:04:33.490> stripper

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
lot easier to take some of the stripper

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.460 
lot easier to take some of the stripper
that's<00:04:34.820> around<00:04:35.210> those<00:04:35.540> areas<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:36.260> there's

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
that's around those areas that there's

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.070 
that's around those areas that there's
less<00:04:36.889> and<00:04:37.280> they<00:04:37.970> can<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:38.510> know<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.690> can<00:04:38.870> kind

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
less and they can you know it can kind

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.290 
less and they can you know it can kind
of<00:04:39.199> you<00:04:39.830> can<00:04:39.979> spread<00:04:40.250> it<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.460> little<00:04:40.699> thin<00:04:40.970> as

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
of you can spread it a little thin as

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.180 
of you can spread it a little thin as
you're<00:04:41.510> working<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:42.139> off<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:42.919> will<00:04:43.070> kind

you're working it off and it will kind

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.610 
you're working it off and it will kind
of<00:04:43.310> help<00:04:43.460> remove<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.150> but<00:04:44.690> so<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.320> can<00:04:45.410> see

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
of help remove it but so you can see

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.290 
of help remove it but so you can see
there's<00:04:45.830> some<00:04:46.040> areas<00:04:46.430> you<00:04:46.460> can<00:04:46.790> see<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:47.000> shadow

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
there's some areas you can see a shadow

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.290 
there's some areas you can see a shadow
but<00:04:47.810> for<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.080> most<00:04:48.260> part<00:04:48.380> it's<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.460> pretty<00:04:49.760> a

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
perfect yet it's not going to be

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.230 
perfect yet it's not going to be
completely<00:06:02.240> perfect<00:06:03.370> the<00:06:04.370> point<00:06:04.669> is<00:06:04.849> is<00:06:05.120> it's

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
completely perfect the point is is it's

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.260 
completely perfect the point is is it's
wet<00:06:05.510> under<00:06:05.960> there<00:06:06.169> so<00:06:06.740> what<00:06:07.460> we<00:06:07.580> want<00:06:07.820> to<00:06:07.880> do<00:06:08.030> is

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
wet under there so what we want to do is

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.990 
wet under there so what we want to do is
get<00:06:08.449> all<00:06:08.690> this<00:06:08.930> residue<00:06:09.320> off<00:06:09.889> so<00:06:10.340> that<00:06:10.490> that<00:06:10.760> is

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
get all this residue off so that that is

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.600 
get all this residue off so that that is
what's<00:06:11.270> not<00:06:11.479> left<00:06:11.870> does<00:06:12.740> that<00:06:12.770> make<00:06:13.039> sense<00:06:13.070> I

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
what's not left does that make sense I

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.060 
what's not left does that make sense I
hope<00:06:13.760> so<00:06:14.000> um<00:06:14.320> it's<00:06:15.320> not<00:06:15.530> that<00:06:15.710> it's<00:06:15.889> going<00:06:16.010> to

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
hope so um it's not that it's going to

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.920 
hope so um it's not that it's going to
look<00:06:16.280> perfect<00:06:16.729> the<00:06:16.910> first<00:06:17.030> time<00:06:17.210> that<00:06:17.510> you<00:06:17.690> you

I'm going to take a take a picture so
you<00:06:42.199> can<00:06:42.289> see<00:06:42.559> it<00:06:42.649> pretty<00:06:42.770> close<00:06:43.069> up<00:06:43.279> right

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
you can see it pretty close up right

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.739 
you can see it pretty close up right
here<00:06:43.819> you<00:06:44.029> know<00:06:44.119> there's<00:06:44.300> a<00:06:44.360> little<00:06:44.509> bitty

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:44.749 
here you know there's a little bitty

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:47.439 
here you know there's a little bitty
bits<00:06:45.439> of<00:06:45.679> residue<00:06:46.189> that<00:06:46.459> are<00:06:46.610> left<00:06:46.939> and<00:06:47.300> that's

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
bits of residue that are left and that's

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.239 
bits of residue that are left and that's
okay<00:06:47.809> because<00:06:48.110> you<00:06:48.409> know<00:06:48.529> you<00:06:48.589> can't<00:06:48.979> get<00:06:49.129> it

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:49.249 
okay because you know you can't get it

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:53.010 
okay because you know you can't get it
all<00:06:49.369> off<00:06:49.610> at<00:06:49.849> one<00:06:50.029> time<00:06:50.379> so<00:06:51.379> it<00:06:51.800> on<00:06:52.069> but<00:06:52.339> it<00:06:52.459> is

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
all off at one time so it on but it is

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.699 
all off at one time so it on but it is
it's<00:06:54.020> coming<00:06:54.379> off<00:06:54.499> nicely<00:06:54.830> and<00:06:55.869> I<00:06:56.869> just<00:06:57.469> so<00:06:57.649> you

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:57.709 
it's coming off nicely and I just so you

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:03.129 
it's coming off nicely and I just so you
know<00:06:57.860> left<00:06:58.639> it<00:06:58.849> on<00:06:58.990> for<00:07:00.849> two<00:07:01.849> hours<00:07:01.959> two<00:07:02.959> and<00:07:02.990> a

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:03.139 
know left it on for two hours two and a

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:05.199 
know left it on for two hours two and a
half<00:07:03.319> hours<00:07:03.800> and<00:07:04.129> it's<00:07:04.550> taking<00:07:04.939> it<00:07:05.029> all<00:07:05.179> off

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:05.209 
half hours and it's taking it all off

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:10.869 
half hours and it's taking it all off
and<00:07:05.959> that<00:07:06.279> had<00:07:07.279> quite<00:07:07.639> a<00:07:07.669> bit<00:07:08.059> of<00:07:09.369> paint<00:07:10.369> on<00:07:10.849> it

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 
and that had quite a bit of paint on it

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:13.749 
and that had quite a bit of paint on it
so<00:07:11.269> I<00:07:11.330> think<00:07:11.419> I<00:07:11.899> think<00:07:12.469> we're<00:07:12.679> going<00:07:12.800> to<00:07:12.889> see<00:07:13.729> a

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 
so I think I think we're going to see a

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.089 
so I think I think we're going to see a
pretty<00:07:14.059> good<00:07:14.300> pretty<00:07:15.259> good<00:07:15.379> result<00:07:15.919> even

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:16.099 
pretty good pretty good result even

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.279 
pretty good pretty good result even
after<00:07:16.459> just<00:07:16.490> one<00:07:16.879> coat<00:07:17.179> which<00:07:17.509> is<00:07:17.539> definitely

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.289 
after just one coat which is definitely

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:20.409 
after just one coat which is definitely
ideal<00:07:18.979> you<00:07:19.279> know<00:07:19.309> that's<00:07:19.610> again<00:07:19.999> while<00:07:20.300> we

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:20.419 
ideal you know that's again while we

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.299 
ideal you know that's again while we
applied<00:07:20.749> it<00:07:20.959> just<00:07:21.169> a<00:07:21.289> little<00:07:21.529> bit<00:07:21.679> thick<00:07:21.979> so

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:22.309 
applied it just a little bit thick so

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.540 
applied it just a little bit thick so
that<00:07:22.939> we<00:07:23.300> would<00:07:23.449> be<00:07:23.599> able<00:07:23.839> to<00:07:24.159> do<00:07:25.159> this<00:07:25.309> one

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
that we would be able to do this one

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.689 
that we would be able to do this one
time<00:07:25.580> and<00:07:25.969> be<00:07:25.999> done<00:07:27.009> okay<00:07:28.009> so<00:07:28.279> I'm<00:07:28.519> going<00:07:28.639> to
