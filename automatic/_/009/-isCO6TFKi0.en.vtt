 Step 1: Divide the hair in two parts by a diagonal parting. To pin the right part of hair a clip. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 Step 2: At the parting on the left side, select a narrow triangular section, divide it into three strands. Of them start to weave the usual braid. Perform one weave. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Step 3: Continue weaving the usual braid, but already with pickups. To do this, put the left strand of the braid on the middle, from the free hair on the left, separate the strand and connect it with the left strand of the braid. Next, put the right strand of the braid on the middle one, from the free hair on the right, separate the strand and connect it with the right strand of the braid. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Step 4: Continue weaving the braid with hooks on both sides to the edge hairline on the back of the head. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Step 5: Loose the ends of the hair into a regular braid. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Step 6: Secure the braid with a rubber band. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Step 7: On the right side, perform the same weaving with hooks on both sides, but finish it not at the edge hairline on the back of the head, but behind the ear. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Step 8: Loose the ends of the hair into a regular braid. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Step 9: Secure the braid with a rubber band. 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Step 10: The result should be two French braids, finished at different levels, the first on the regional hairline on the back of the head, the second behind the ear. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Step 11: Twist the braid on the left side into a bun and fasten it with pins on the lower occipital zone. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:05:08.600
 Step 12: Also, twist the braid on the right side into a bundle and fix it in the center of the head, above the previously executed bundle.
