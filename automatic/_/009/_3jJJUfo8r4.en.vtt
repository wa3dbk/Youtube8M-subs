00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
single strand knots so when I leave my

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:04.210 
single strand knots so when I leave my
hair<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.849> like<00:02:59.849> a<00:02:59.880> washing<00:03:00.239> girl<00:03:00.720> or<00:03:02.000> like<00:03:03.000> a

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
hair and like a washing girl or like a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.690 
hair and like a washing girl or like a
twist<00:03:05.220> out<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:06.239> ends<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:07.109> my<00:03:07.470> hair<00:03:07.700> wraps

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
twist out the ends of my hair wraps

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.259 
twist out the ends of my hair wraps
around<00:03:09.590> each<00:03:10.590> other<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.190> they<00:03:11.489> creep<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.090> it

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
around each other and they creep and it

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.809 
around each other and they creep and it
creates<00:03:12.599> really<00:03:13.530> tiny<00:03:13.799> knot<00:03:14.099> so<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.459> can't

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
creates really tiny knot so that I can't

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.430 
creates really tiny knot so that I can't
get<00:03:15.030> out<00:03:15.180> unless<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:16.160> cut<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.280> out<00:03:17.400> with<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.730> with

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
get out unless I cut it out with it with

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.410 
get out unless I cut it out with it with
scissors<00:03:19.630> so<00:03:20.650> that's<00:03:21.790> probably<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:23.180> biggest

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
scissors so that's probably the biggest

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.770 
scissors so that's probably the biggest
problem<00:03:23.960> that<00:03:24.290> I'm<00:03:24.530> having<00:03:25.270> obviously<00:03:26.270> it

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
problem that I'm having obviously it

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.570 
problem that I'm having obviously it
takes<00:03:26.960> some<00:03:27.260> more<00:03:27.500> time<00:03:27.800> styling<00:03:28.400> your

takes some more time styling your
natural<00:03:29.000> hair<00:03:29.180> than<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.690> would<00:03:29.900> take<00:03:30.290> for<00:03:30.980> you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
natural hair than it would take for you

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.280

and nine and like a nine in the front
I<00:03:50.930> haven't<00:03:51.920> measured<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.520> since<00:03:52.940> then<00:03:54.700> so

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
I haven't measured it since then so

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.110 
I haven't measured it since then so
let's<00:03:57.020> see<00:03:57.470> if<00:03:57.860> it's<00:03:58.070> grown<00:03:58.760> I<00:04:00.610> did<00:04:01.610> my<00:04:01.790> first

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
let's see if it's grown I did my first

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.980 
let's see if it's grown I did my first
length<00:04:02.720> check<00:04:03.110> at<00:04:03.350> three<00:04:03.830> weeks<00:04:04.630> post<00:04:05.630> big

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
length check at three weeks post big

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.650 
length check at three weeks post big
chopped<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:07.040> it's<00:04:07.220> been<00:04:07.370> over<00:04:07.610> two<00:04:08.000> months

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
chopped so it's been over two months

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.760 
chopped so it's been over two months
since<00:04:09.050> I<00:04:10.540> did<00:04:11.540> in<00:04:11.630> my<00:04:11.660> last<00:04:11.990> leg<00:04:12.290> check<00:04:12.560> so

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
since I did in my last leg check so

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.520 
since I did in my last leg check so
let's<00:04:12.800> see<00:04:13.280> how<00:04:13.520> much<00:04:13.730> it's<00:04:14.000> grown<00:04:14.630> since<00:04:15.140> of

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
let's see how much it's grown since of

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.699 
let's see how much it's grown since of
then

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.279 

he<00:04:20.669> still<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.000> front<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.359> my<00:04:21.539> ear<00:04:21.810> right<00:04:22.019> now

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
he still the front of my ear right now

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.110 
he still the front of my ear right now
is<00:04:22.680> about<00:04:22.919> ten<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.330> half<00:04:24.569> inches<00:04:25.050> long<00:04:26.120> when

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
is about ten and a half inches long when

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.920 
is about ten and a half inches long when
I<00:04:27.150> measured<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.080> about<00:04:28.970> two<00:04:29.970> months<00:04:30.419> ago<00:04:30.509> it

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
I measured it about two months ago it

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.050 
I measured it about two months ago it
was<00:04:32.000> nine<00:04:33.349> inches<00:04:34.349> long<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:34.860> it's<00:04:35.009> grown<00:04:35.310> about

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
was nine inches long so it's grown about

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.740 
was nine inches long so it's grown about
an<00:04:36.270> inch<00:04:36.479> and<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.780> half<00:04:36.979> since<00:04:37.979> my<00:04:38.310> last<00:04:38.750> lent

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
an inch and a half since my last lent

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.650 
an inch and a half since my last lent
Chuck<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:41.220> never<00:04:41.460> measured<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.090> size<00:04:42.360> I

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
Chuck and I never measured the size I

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.270 
Chuck and I never measured the size I
don't<00:04:42.690> know<00:04:42.960> why<00:04:43.139> but<00:04:43.349> I<00:04:43.410> forgot<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:44.069> measure

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
don't know why but I forgot to measure

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.230 
don't know why but I forgot to measure
the<00:04:44.550> sides<00:04:44.910> when<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.210> did<00:04:45.569> my<00:04:45.840> last<00:04:46.039> video<00:04:47.240> so

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
the sides when I did my last video so

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.690 
the sides when I did my last video so
I'm<00:04:48.360> gonna<00:04:48.569> do<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.139> now

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.950 

I<00:04:57.280> would<00:04:58.280> say<00:04:58.460> about<00:04:58.580> ten<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.240> half<00:04:59.480> as<00:04:59.750> well

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
I would say about ten and a half as well

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.110 
I would say about ten and a half as well
so<00:05:00.650> ten<00:05:00.920> and<00:05:01.070> a<00:05:01.100> half<00:05:01.280> in<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.550> front<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:01.910> ten

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
so ten and a half in the front and ten

so ten and a half in the front and ten
and<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.330> half<00:05:02.570> at<00:05:02.960> this<00:05:03.560> side<00:05:06.940> my<00:05:07.940> knee<00:05:08.000> is<00:05:08.390> about

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
and a half at this side my knee is about

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.880 
and a half at this side my knee is about
11<00:05:09.650> inches<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:11.600> last<00:05:11.840> time<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:12.260> measured<00:05:12.470> my

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
11 inches the last time I measured my

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.880 
11 inches the last time I measured my
hair<00:05:13.160> my<00:05:13.430> knee<00:05:13.490> was<00:05:14.360> nine<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.110> half<00:05:15.140> inches

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
hair my knee was nine and a half inches

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.640 
hair my knee was nine and a half inches
and<00:05:15.950> now<00:05:16.490> it's<00:05:16.730> 11<00:05:17.210> inches<00:05:17.510> so<00:05:18.050> it's<00:05:18.230> grown

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
and now it's 11 inches so it's grown

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:31.850 
and now it's 11 inches so it's grown
about<00:05:19.520> an<00:05:19.820> inch<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.600> half<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.880> middle

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:39.930 

the<00:05:32.860> middle<00:05:33.250> is<00:05:35.100> about<00:05:36.330> 11<00:05:37.330> inches<00:05:38.639> since<00:05:39.639> my

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
the middle is about 11 inches since my

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.080 
the middle is about 11 inches since my
last<00:05:40.210> length<00:05:40.930> check<00:05:41.470> which<00:05:41.770> was<00:05:42.040> two<00:05:42.490> and<00:05:42.850> a
