are are they're too small they're too
old<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.820> unfortunately<00:03:18.180> even<00:03:18.930> though

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
old and so unfortunately even though

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.150 
old and so unfortunately even though
we're<00:03:19.170> working<00:03:19.200> in<00:03:19.560> these<00:03:19.680> challenging

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
we're working in these challenging

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.670 
we're working in these challenging
conditions<00:03:20.660> even<00:03:21.660> if<00:03:21.750> we<00:03:21.870> wanted<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.320> get<00:03:22.440> new

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
conditions even if we wanted to get new

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.620 
conditions even if we wanted to get new
equipment<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.400> doesn't<00:03:23.670> fit<00:03:23.970> obviously

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
equipment in it doesn't fit obviously

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.120 
equipment in it doesn't fit obviously
with<00:03:24.780> better<00:03:24.989> equipment<00:03:25.110> we're<00:03:25.829> able<00:03:25.920> to

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
with better equipment we're able to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.860 
with better equipment we're able to
provide<00:03:26.370> better<00:03:26.610> care<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:27.090> our<00:03:27.120> patients<00:03:27.209> and

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
provide better care to our patients and

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.470 
provide better care to our patients and
so<00:03:28.110> it's<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.100> simple

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
so it's a simple

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.930 
so it's a simple
solution<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.099> we're<00:03:31.250> hoping<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.640> best<00:03:31.819> we

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
solution and so we're hoping the best we

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.930 
solution and so we're hoping the best we
can<00:03:32.120> but<00:03:32.420> obviously<00:03:32.870> strive<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.739> do<00:03:33.830> better<00:03:33.940> we

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
can but obviously strive to do better we

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.170 
can but obviously strive to do better we
are<00:03:35.629> able<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.989> do<00:03:36.200> some<00:03:36.590> things<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.920> improve

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
are able to do some things to improve

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.000 
are able to do some things to improve
efficiencies<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.750> helps<00:03:39.170> us<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.349> achieve<00:03:39.620> a
