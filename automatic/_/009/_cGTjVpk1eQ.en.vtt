some of the visual developments if you
like<00:00:19.199> within<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.619> game<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.010> certainly<00:00:20.400> there

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
like within the game and certainly there

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.060 
like within the game and certainly there
are<00:00:21.060> upper<00:00:21.660> among<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> best<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.439> them<00:00:22.590> at<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
are upper among the best of them at the
moment<00:00:23.430> obviously<00:00:23.849> you've<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.150> project<00:00:24.510> cars

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
moment obviously you've got project cars

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.900 
moment obviously you've got project cars
which<00:00:25.019> currently<00:00:25.619> leading<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.039> way<00:00:26.220> our

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
simulation and physics and they'll be

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
simulation and physics and they'll be
working<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.509> graphics<00:00:30.660> later<00:00:31.080> whereas<00:00:31.800> set<00:00:31.980> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
well so many games once you go into a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.930 
well so many games once you go into a
spin<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.680> if<00:01:07.800> it<00:01:07.920> says<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.250> want<00:01:08.490> into<00:01:08.820> an

back end you know and it can be a bit

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.520 
back end you know and it can be a bit
frustrating<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> feel<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.410> you're

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
nice flow to this circuit if you get it

nice flow to this circuit if you get it
right<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.330> see<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> little<00:02:03.630> bit<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.840> understeer

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
right you see a little bit of understeer

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.320 
right you see a little bit of understeer
there<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.740> exit<00:02:05.100> send<00:02:05.910> him<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> little<00:02:06.270> bit

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
there on the exit send him a little bit

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.620 
there on the exit send him a little bit
wide<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.899> able<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> capture<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.740> nicely<00:02:08.630> so

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
wide but able to capture that nicely so

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.850 
wide but able to capture that nicely so
it<00:02:09.720> seems<00:02:09.840> really<00:02:10.140> well<00:02:10.290> set<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.800> the

it seems really well set up for the
wheel<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.160> well<00:02:11.340> really<00:02:11.670> positive<00:02:11.850> graphics

looking fantastic I'm pleased to see it
working<00:02:16.050> well<00:02:16.350> I've<00:02:16.560> been<00:02:16.590> holding<00:02:17.130> off<00:02:17.220> on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
working well I've been holding off on

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.790 
working well I've been holding off on
reporting<00:02:17.910> much<00:02:18.300> on<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.690> game<00:02:19.500> or<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
reporting much on the game or the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.170 
reporting much on the game or the
simulation<00:02:20.280> should<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.489> say<00:02:20.700> until<00:02:21.030> we've

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
simulation should I say until we've

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.610 
simulation should I say until we've
actually<00:02:21.360> had<00:02:21.660> got<00:02:22.020> something<00:02:22.290> more<00:02:22.380> concrete

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
actually had got something more concrete

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.330 
actually had got something more concrete
to<00:02:23.100> actually<00:02:23.340> see<00:02:23.520> running<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.239> motion<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:26.160> so

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to actually see running in motion and so

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.680 
to actually see running in motion and so
far<00:02:26.640> then<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:26.940> looks<00:02:27.060> very<00:02:27.120> good<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.660> a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
far then it looks very good this is a

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.050 
far then it looks very good this is a
very<00:02:27.980> relatively<00:02:28.980> tidy<00:02:29.310> laughs<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.760> has<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.940> be

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
very relatively tidy laughs it has to be

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.590 
very relatively tidy laughs it has to be
said<00:02:31.250> pushing<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.940> same<00:02:33.150> time<00:02:33.360> quite

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
said pushing the same time quite

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.810 
said pushing the same time quite
sensible<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.860> when<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.190> final<00:02:35.580> corner

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
sensible and when that final corner

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.520 
sensible and when that final corner
where<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:36.450> much<00:02:36.570> time<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.989> be<00:02:37.110> gained<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.440> lost

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
where so much time to be gained and lost

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.759 
where so much time to be gained and lost
if<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.549> don't<00:02:38.730> get<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.940> right<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.650> across<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
if you don't get it right and across the

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.120 
if you don't get it right and across the
line

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.150 

and<00:02:46.670> that's<00:02:46.820> ended<00:02:47.090> up<00:02:47.120> laughing<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:48.320> looking

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
and that's ended up laughing so looking

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.890 
and that's ended up laughing so looking
good<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.340> far<00:02:49.520> back<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.510> these<00:02:50.630> screenshots

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
good so far back to these screenshots

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.420 
good so far back to these screenshots
obviously<00:02:51.530> we've<00:02:51.680> seen<00:02:51.860> lots<00:02:52.070> of<00:02:52.190> screen

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
obviously we've seen lots of screen

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.890 
obviously we've seen lots of screen
