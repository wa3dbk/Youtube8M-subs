fiberglass the hell dorado uses the same
lightweight<00:01:59.380> wood<00:01:59.680> core<00:02:00.330> with<00:02:01.330> glass<00:02:01.659> and

lightweight wood core with glass and
metal<00:02:02.170> instead<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.430> effect<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:05.080> this

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
metal instead so the effect is that this

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.080 
metal instead so the effect is that this
is<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.439> little<00:02:05.680> softer<00:02:06.159> flex<00:02:06.460> it's<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.820> little

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
is a little softer flex it's a little

is a little softer flex it's a little
more<00:02:07.210> nimble<00:02:07.689> as<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:07.900> lighter<00:02:08.349> ski<00:02:08.799> this<00:02:09.340> would

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
more nimble as a lighter ski this would

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.460 
more nimble as a lighter ski this would
be<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.670> great<00:02:10.119> combination<00:02:10.629> for<00:02:10.929> somebody<00:02:11.409> to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
be a great combination for somebody to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.769 
be a great combination for somebody to
