00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
 million to panadeira 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.000
 for this recipe we are going to use two 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.070
 kilos of mussels two onions a 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.590
 red pepper one green pepper two 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.650
 cloves of garlic three grated tomato 59 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.380
 bacon paprika parsley aura 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.740
 in a large pot we are going to put a glass 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.740
 of white wine 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.780
 we incorporate two bay leaves 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.880
 and now we add the mussels with 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.310
 much care that has escaped us 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.310
 some but good we incorporate it 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.740
 we cover the pot and we go until it 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.720
 open the mussels we have them there and 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.579
 careful to save the broth that has 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.070
 released the mussels 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.570
 well now let's sauté the bacon 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.140
 that we have cut into squares 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.140
 little ones 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.340
 and when he has already released his fat 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.340
 let's add garlic cloves 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.899
 we let them get brown 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.590
 and then we incorporate the two onions 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.590
 chopped 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.180
 we suffer the onion until it gets 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.420
 a bit transparent or change a bit of 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.420
 colour 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.580
 at that time we are going to take the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.120
 peppers first let's take the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.120
 Red pepper 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.680
 and then the green pepper 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.820
 we are going to add a spoonful of 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.650
 peppers 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.240
 we have used sweet but 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.060
 can you also use spicy me 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.110
 like and we will go suffering because 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.110
 they decide to sauté the peppers 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.270
 once the stir-fries add the tomato 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.670
 grated 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.310
 we have striped like 3 tomatoes 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.409
 and we put them in there let's let the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.409
 Tomato is incorporated into the sofrito 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.480
 now at this moment we are going to add the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.349
 broth of the mussels that we had 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.349
 booked before 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.430
 you can take advantage to open the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.189
 mussels and removing a layer here 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.750
 as you can see is an index power of some 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.610
 strands that will give your touch 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.819
 well because we have already put the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.249
 mussels 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.139
 on the oven plate let's go 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.139
 stuffing those in the vegetable sauce 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.270
 and we finished and only will be left 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.740
 throw bread crumbs on top 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.090
 We take it to the oven about 20 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.910
 minutes or until the bread crumbs 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.250
 let's see that it is toasted and we already have the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.080
 recipe ready if you like our
