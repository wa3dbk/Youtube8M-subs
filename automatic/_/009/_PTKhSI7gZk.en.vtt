Galicia<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.440> just<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.739> bit<00:02:24.920> smaller<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:27.560> know

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
Galicia is just a bit smaller you know

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.660 
Galicia is just a bit smaller you know
it's<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.310> uh

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
it's it's uh

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.440 
it's it's uh
the<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.570> duchies<00:02:30.140> are<00:02:30.350> randomized<00:02:30.980> but

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the the duchies are randomized but

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.729 
the the duchies are randomized but
they're<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.720> duchies<00:02:33.049> are<00:02:33.170> really<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.560> this

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
they're the duchies are really just this

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.940 
they're the duchies are really just this
sort<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.010> chunks<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.700> make<00:02:34.910> up<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.480> empires

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
sort of chunks that make up the empires

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.830 
sort of chunks that make up the empires
also<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:36.980> should<00:02:37.070> note<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.600> government<00:02:38.600> types

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
also I should note that government types

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.039 
also I should note that government types
are<00:02:39.079> unchanged<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.280> whoever<00:02:41.180> owns<00:02:41.420> Rome<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.989> a

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
are unchanged so whoever owns Rome is a

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.800 
are unchanged so whoever owns Rome is a
theocracy<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:44.049> Genoa<00:02:45.250> Venice<00:02:46.250> piece<00:02:46.730> all<00:02:47.540> of

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
theocracy and Genoa Venice piece all of

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.880 
theocracy and Genoa Venice piece all of
them<00:02:48.670> they<00:02:49.670> are<00:02:49.850> still<00:02:50.440> merchants<00:02:51.440> republics

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
them they are still merchants republics

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.949 
them they are still merchants republics
and<00:02:52.100> they<00:02:52.160> will<00:02:52.310> always<00:02:52.459> be<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.790> same<00:02:52.970> always

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
and they will always be the same always

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.690 
and they will always be the same always
like<00:02:55.440> for<00:02:55.650> instance<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:56.130> is<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> theocracy

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
like for instance this is a theocracy

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.080 
like for instance this is a theocracy
over<00:02:57.060> here<00:02:57.209> should<00:02:57.420> be<00:02:58.700> there's<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.819> theocracy

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
over here should be there's a theocracy

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.949 
over here should be there's a theocracy
somewhere<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.780> here

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.800 

oh<00:03:02.989> well<00:03:03.799> no<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.269> guess<00:03:05.269> would<00:03:05.420> just<00:03:05.599> be<00:03:05.689> that

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
oh well no I guess would just be that

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.630 
oh well no I guess would just be that
one<00:03:05.959> particular<00:03:06.140> County<00:03:06.980> would<00:03:07.099> be<00:03:07.129> theocracy

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
one particular County would be theocracy

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.110 
one particular County would be theocracy
you<00:03:10.640> should<00:03:10.819> also<00:03:10.939> note<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:12.760> whoever<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:13.970> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
you should also note that whoever is the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.300 
you should also note that whoever is the
king<00:03:14.360> controls<00:03:15.019> all<00:03:15.379> the<00:03:15.409> provinces<00:03:16.099> of<00:03:16.159> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
king controls all the provinces of the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.960 
king controls all the provinces of the
entire<00:03:17.560> country

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
entire country

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.229 
entire country
it<00:03:20.239> does<00:03:20.510> not<00:03:20.739> automatically<00:03:21.739> create<00:03:22.370> lower

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
it does not automatically create lower

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.960 
it does not automatically create lower
counts<00:03:24.079> at<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.349> beginning<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.129> game<00:03:25.280> but

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
counts at the beginning of the game but

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.009 
counts at the beginning of the game but
that<00:03:26.030> would<00:03:26.269> doesn't<00:03:26.510> be<00:03:26.569> done<00:03:26.689> by<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.840> AI

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
that would doesn't be done by the AI

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.300 
that would doesn't be done by the AI
anyway<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.739> doesn't<00:03:27.769> really<00:03:27.980> matter

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
anyway so it doesn't really matter

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.319 
anyway so it doesn't really matter
anyway<00:03:30.790> let's<00:03:31.790> go<00:03:31.939> -<00:03:32.000> does<00:03:32.269> your<00:03:32.859> kingdoms<00:03:33.859> now

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
interesting and then we go to did your

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.970 
interesting and then we go to did your
empires<00:04:05.580> also<00:04:06.150> note<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.230> nearly<00:04:07.560> every

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
empires also note that nearly every

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.199

province<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.459> game<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.760> part<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.150> a

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
province in the game is part of a

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.230 
province in the game is part of a
kingdom<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:11.130> makes<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.490> so<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.700> always<00:04:12.000> have

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
kingdom that makes it so you always have

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.159 
kingdom that makes it so you always have
a<00:04:12.270> higher<00:04:12.480> title<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.170> aspire<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.840> which<00:04:15.840> disbar

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
a higher title to aspire to which disbar

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.110 
a higher title to aspire to which disbar
and<00:04:16.320> then<00:04:16.440> we<00:04:16.560> go<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.709> de<00:04:17.010> jour<00:04:17.250> empires<00:04:17.910> now

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
and then we go to de jour empires now

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.150 
and then we go to de jour empires now
the<00:04:18.180> empires<00:04:18.720> are<00:04:19.019> again<00:04:19.440> random<00:04:19.799> as<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.010> can

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
the empires are again random as you can

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.890 
the empires are again random as you can
clearly<00:04:20.340> see<00:04:20.579> but<00:04:21.359> they<00:04:21.660> are<00:04:23.630> not<00:04:24.630> every

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
clearly see but they are not every

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.510 
clearly see but they are not every
province<00:04:25.080> is<00:04:25.380> part<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.620> an<00:04:25.710> empire<00:04:25.980> and<00:04:26.280> as<00:04:26.400> you

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
province is part of an empire and as you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.560 
province is part of an empire and as you
can<00:04:26.669> see<00:04:27.080> there<00:04:28.080> there<00:04:28.470> are<00:04:28.620> only<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.570> base

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
can see there there are only the base

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.770 
can see there there are only the base
empires<00:04:31.169> from<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.620> original<00:04:32.100> game<00:04:32.630> which<00:04:33.630> is

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
empires from the original game which is

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.970 
empires from the original game which is
a<00:04:33.810> bit<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.140> a<00:04:34.200> shame<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:37.350> randomization

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
a bit of a shame and the randomization

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.680 
a bit of a shame and the randomization
kind<00:04:38.250> of<00:04:38.370> screws<00:04:38.669> up<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.000> digital<00:04:39.300> empires

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
kind of screws up the digital empires

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.379 
kind of screws up the digital empires
quite<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.590> bit

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.189 

but<00:04:44.389> anyway<00:04:44.810> that's<00:04:45.349> that<00:04:45.650> now<00:04:46.129> I'm<00:04:46.370> going<00:04:46.430> to

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
but anyway that's that now I'm going to
