00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 and then ligated into galley health report ibr 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.310
 movies plus one video in today's video 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.130
 I'm bringing another video tutorial 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:32.130
 for you and today's tutorial is the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:37.350
 rio felipe good for you to make the flip 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.210
 You need to know neither, and the flip is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.750
 basically one flip generating by another 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.789
 side will generate on the other hand and but it 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.140
 It's a big difference from the flip that I 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:01:02.699
 I'll talk after showing a position. 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:01:08.790
 of the fingers that is this one, me too you 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:12.960
 beat the Utah Jazz beat your and and you 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:18.600
 going to drag points that dragging 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:26.040
 to 1212 conflict that creeps through 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 a new one on the a12 beat up the reason why 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.470
 we have here is to get to a museum only 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.040
 will will do here will drag more 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.119
 I pro here as if you were a 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:48.540
 such foot was any foot with any 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:52.860
 one knows to hit kick and it goes will turn and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.600
 To mark such is simple I will I will give 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.469
 maggi do it for you 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 if you 're falling too crooked type 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:07.640
 flip 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:10.619
 so he is spinning very little is 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.930
 now I do not know if to solve this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.329
 well lets go the first strip by generating a lot 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.310
 if it has generated a lot it means 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.230
 What are you doing, leaving you from here? 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.780
 much to point out that much to the point 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.379
 counter hit this is leaving a lot 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.180
 here is more here and vice versa if 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.750
 he is generating few and I left more 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.769
 to the tip is so conscious generating 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.810
 a lot you leave it more to the middle 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.719
 What else comes more 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.180
 but inside knows if he is 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.159
 generating little more off the finger 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.650
 indicator 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.750
 now that he has this vision that the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.019
 clip it is falling half crooked and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.939
 half forward back you have 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.829
 fallen with one foot off 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.919
 if you've fallen on the crook this is you 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:02.040
 I do not have time to hit the phone 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.909
 Serbian filip then pay the land 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.819
 isolated 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:10.590
 You're going to put more here for your 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.450
 Bad side , I'll spend the time there for you. 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.949
 Go back there. 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.010
 It's the time because if you put me here I 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:22.650
 I have you will you will finish 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.440
 pushing a little bit forward here 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.919
 so here it will generate more for there and here 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.150
 if you do let's go 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:38.750
 if you have here 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.750
 the opposite side of your body you go 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.959
 see the body 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.810
 if it is generating it was the failure 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.540
 fra in your body side of the body 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.919
 you put it aside but from the side of your 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.879
 body for him and there was the tutorial 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.069
 from my felipe 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.889
 I tried to give all my tips that 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.530
 They helped me for you. 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.810
 I hope you have succeeded in 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.400
 so this is it if you liked the video 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.840
