00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 so that greater good here we have 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.870
 humans the samsung galaxy is 3 min and the 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.790
 81 90 in studies how to remove the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.190
 sound the camera as how to silence the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.049
 Shutter can only be done 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.059
 we look to take photos privately 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.250
 silent in that you find that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.690
 I was photographing someone soon 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.760
 problem of that is that it is in certain 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.160
 way we are violating the law of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.410
 product the country in which we are and there 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.300
 laws that prohibit cell phones from 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.240
 defect can be removed the sound 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.070
 of the shutter nor is that why it's 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.170
 option has disappeared from many 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 high-end phones if we enter 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.559
 here in the camera option we are going to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.040
 find that not through their 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.079
 configuration options there is no 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.020
 option that allows me to remove the sound 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.570
 of the obturator people without every time that of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.680
 soon we'll press you here to take pictures 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.680
 let's hear the sound 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.260
 and this sound can not be removed by 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.090
 defect in the samsung galaxy s3 mini 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.730
 8190 the only way we can eliminate 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.130
 this sound there are two recommendations that 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.060
 they give us is not spoken or what is what 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.220
 they say on the internet is to download programs 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.040
 they suddenly call silent cameras 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.020
 come hammond or there are other applications 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.030
 who say they can do it however 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.160
 continue on the phone because by default 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.350
 does not allow it to make those applications not 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.350
 they will work and the only way and 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 only solution is removing the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.840
 phone sound then we enter 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.750
 here for notifications on the mac and two 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.009
 clicks one to vibrate and with the next one already 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.500
 on the phone is completely 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.240
 silenced in this way when silencing 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.220
 the phone completely is that we can 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.300
 remove sound from the camera but 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.680
 remember that we are really 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.750
 removing is the sound of all the 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.140
 phone we enter through here by 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.409
 camera 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.409
 and we can make two the shots 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.470
 there was a shot 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.050
 another shot as it was each time 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.730
 shot no sounds and in this way 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.790
 we have removed the shutter sound or 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.130
 removes the sound the camera without which 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.830
 We have been able to make photographic 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.090
 privately or discreetly the subject with 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.320
