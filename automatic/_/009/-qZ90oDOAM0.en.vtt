00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:03.270
 each one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.670
 Icarus 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.399
 since then why 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:13.329
 let's investigate the death of the inmate orlando zapata tamayo 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.470
 I have no doubt 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.359
 on this basis 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.390
 huh 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.659
 we will see 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.210
 I hope to be corresponding 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.330
 If you want to go, you were accused because 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.190
 at the fair 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.190
 and one thing is certain 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.670
 now he will have to pay 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.440
 start the event with Ana 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.930
 for each side 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.720
 but you have to go to the place 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.949
 the locality has at pt and pmdb 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.319
 - he would already be very close to the carnival meanwhile paulo 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.830
 my little boy he is practically consensus that the focus is the preservation 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.020
 of animals another proposal 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.140
 that's right 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.000
 one thing leads to another 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 really our program 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 he has a contract in force 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.060
 You'll make you shut up. 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.070
 control of the situation 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.930
 in front of the fight 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.280
 this year the disease 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.870
 in the fight for access what I'm going to do the fourth goal left 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 In this case, this is not the new 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.590
 acting in the city 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590
 in transforming being 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.390
 but I'll do my best to honor your contract and who you leave 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.390
 but with someone else 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.210
 ansa 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.210
 since January this year 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.830
 I'll do it right though 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.350
 "he said. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.350
 paulo minutes after more than three thousand 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.579
 it's done 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.259
 all these factors 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.259
 of total ipva 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:37.319
 10 but this dream the thermometers gotten to quintuple the proposals of the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.639
 companies I am very anxious to see if it were not all the 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.639
 surveys show this 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.969
 O 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.369
 built between the details you like that I will certainly stop this 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.369
 part 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.319
 I do not know if they are or not 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.409
 so a little while longer
