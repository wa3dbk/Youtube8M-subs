00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
braid we're going to start by pulling

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.650 
braid we're going to start by pulling
out<00:00:22.650> these<00:00:22.800> front<00:00:23.250> pieces<00:00:23.490> because<00:00:24.449> that's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
out these front pieces because that's

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.509 
out these front pieces because that's
how<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.080> not<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.529> end<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:26.340> don't

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
how it is not the end so that they don't

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.580 
how it is not the end so that they don't
get<00:00:27.269> caught<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.810> braid<00:00:28.080> they'll<00:00:28.289> stick

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
out if they're too short so plot the

out if they're too short so plot the
front<00:00:31.470> pieces<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:33.360> then<00:00:34.200> you're<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> do

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
make the rate a little loose try not to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.300 
make the rate a little loose try not to
hurt

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.559 

and<00:02:13.310> it'll<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.970> braids<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.560> bigger

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
and it'll get the braids of bigger

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.210 
and it'll get the braids of bigger
effect<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:17.810> obviously<00:02:18.319> she's<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> little<00:02:18.920> girl

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
effect and obviously she's a little girl

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.300 
effect and obviously she's a little girl
so<00:02:19.519> she<00:02:19.610> doesn't<00:02:19.940> have<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.239> whole<00:02:20.660> lot<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.590> thick

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
so she doesn't have a whole lot of thick

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.160 
so she doesn't have a whole lot of thick
