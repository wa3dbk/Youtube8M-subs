00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.389 
so kind of frustrating we have the basic
form<00:02:01.710> eight<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.270> form<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> hook

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
form eight I'm going to form the hook

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.740 
form eight I'm going to form the hook
and<00:02:05.399> about<00:02:05.700> all<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.540> is

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
and about all you can do with that is

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.359 
and about all you can do with that is
just<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.290> with<00:02:07.439> your<00:02:07.590> thumb<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.220> by

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
just do it with your thumb and do it by

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.750 
just do it with your thumb and do it by
hand<00:02:08.750> until<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.929> looks<00:02:10.259> right<00:02:10.520> about<00:02:11.520> like

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
hand until it looks right about like

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.550 
hand until it looks right about like
that

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
that

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.010 
that
and<00:02:12.830> I'll<00:02:12.920> take<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.300> pair<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.330> cutters<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.870> cut

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
and I'll take a pair of cutters and cut

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.490 
and I'll take a pair of cutters and cut
off<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.350> excess<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:20.630> always<00:02:20.990> turn<00:02:21.350> them

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
off the excess and I always turn them

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.309 
off the excess and I always turn them
over<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.490> same<00:02:22.700> pattern<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.140> make

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
over on the same pattern just to make

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.190 
over on the same pattern just to make
sure<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:25.430> they're<00:02:25.700> as<00:02:26.090> symmetric<00:02:26.690> as<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:26.990> can

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
sure that they're as symmetric as I can

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:36.610 
sure that they're as symmetric as I can
get<00:02:27.350> them<00:02:27.560> anyway<00:02:27.980> just<00:02:28.970> press<00:02:29.330> them<00:02:29.510> down<00:02:35.620> and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
get them anyway just press them down and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.290 
get them anyway just press them down and
that's<00:02:36.770> how<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.040> make<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> wire<00:02:37.550> hanger<00:02:37.940> sweet

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
that's how you make a wire hanger sweet

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.040 
that's how you make a wire hanger sweet
for<00:02:38.660> your<00:02:38.780> dolls<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:40.250> wheeze<00:02:41.050> 14-gauge

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
for your dolls so you wheeze 14-gauge

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.260 
for your dolls so you wheeze 14-gauge
but<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:42.470> can<00:02:42.620> also<00:02:42.800> use<00:02:43.069> 18<00:02:43.610> gauge<00:02:43.850> let's<00:02:44.060> just

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
but you can also use 18 gauge let's just

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.690 
but you can also use 18 gauge let's just
let<00:02:44.420> somebody<00:02:44.720> else<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:46.070> person<00:02:46.220> who<00:02:46.489> gave<00:02:46.640> me

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
let somebody else the person who gave me

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.720 
let somebody else the person who gave me
the<00:02:46.970> idea<00:02:47.090> use<00:02:47.510> 18<00:02:48.019> gauge<00:02:48.260> 18<00:02:49.040> gauge<00:02:49.190> lighter

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
the idea use 18 gauge 18 gauge lighter

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.570 
the idea use 18 gauge 18 gauge lighter
than<00:02:50.090> it's<00:02:50.510> lighter<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.260> if<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:51.769> are<00:02:52.220> gonna<00:02:52.340> do

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
than it's lighter so if you are gonna do

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.610 
than it's lighter so if you are gonna do
it<00:02:52.670> with<00:02:52.760> your<00:02:52.910> mom<00:02:53.090> maybe<00:02:53.390> 18<00:02:53.900> gauge<00:02:54.170> cuz<00:02:54.470> this

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
it with your mom maybe 18 gauge cuz this

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.130 
it with your mom maybe 18 gauge cuz this
is<00:02:54.830> not<00:02:55.040> easy<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.640> bend<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.330> can't<00:02:56.690> bend<00:02:56.989> it

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
is not easy to bend and I can't bend it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.790 
is not easy to bend and I can't bend it
so<00:02:57.850> anyways<00:02:58.850> yeah<00:02:59.569> that's<00:02:59.870> about<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.470> we're
