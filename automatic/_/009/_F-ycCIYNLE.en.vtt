 Hi

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.219
 mexico mix by naturally within a wk 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.379
 and that's why I make this drink and it 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.890
 what you need is starter 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.680
 flower 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 lime and fresh mint and her casio so 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.430
 now that we've had that let's get started 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.990
 with the drink and the first thing we did 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.380
 is going to do the watermelon in pieces 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.000
 to cut 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.800
 so do a bowl of water and put it on the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 cutting board and we cut the water corner 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.450
 first in half then on it goes off and on 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.680
 then just pick up the painter and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.870
 then then if the debts decrease 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.469
 we cut into cubes and they can 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.910
 continues the blender before being x pro 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.910
 This can already blending in 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.630
 and then we go stuck in their can 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.130
 you can pour with a safe and all 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.260
 Blind it off and then cut it 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.670
 in 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.340
 So handy to have made more pain 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.860
 so your help can mix a little until 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.450
 it is as if the skin is going to smoke 7 that is 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.490
 natural seeds to take and then 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.020
 get front door nice bag and do 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.610

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.410
 blender 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.030

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.700
 once it is dry, some mint leaves 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.229

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.580
