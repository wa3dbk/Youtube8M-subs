00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
like getting into all the before stuff

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.230 
like getting into all the before stuff
and<00:00:10.200> like<00:00:11.130> why<00:00:12.139> sengoku<00:00:13.849> ended<00:00:14.849> up<00:00:14.969> where<00:00:15.210> she

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and like why sengoku ended up where she

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.769 
and like why sengoku ended up where she
was<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.220> what<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.250> snake<00:00:17.580> want<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.300> his

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
was and what the snake want is his

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.830 
was and what the snake want is his
corpse<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.400> guessing<00:00:20.609> like<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.330> they<00:00:21.570> find

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
corpse so I'm guessing like if they find

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080 
corpse so I'm guessing like if they find
it<00:00:21.990> he<00:00:22.170> gets<00:00:22.350> his<00:00:22.590> power<00:00:22.830> back<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.580> that's<00:00:23.820> how

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it he gets his power back and that's how

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.750 
it he gets his power back and that's how
she<00:00:24.119> ends<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.650> way<00:00:25.830> she<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.189> looking<00:00:26.609> like

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
she ends up the way she is looking like

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.439 
she ends up the way she is looking like
Medusa<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.340> also<00:00:29.340> before<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.119> get<00:00:30.300> into

thought<00:02:14.550> old<00:02:14.760> broad<00:02:15.030> daylight<00:02:15.330> outside

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
thought old broad daylight outside

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.210 
thought old broad daylight outside
because<00:02:16.230> that's<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.740> looked<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.010> but

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
because that's what it looked like but

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.530 
because that's what it looked like but
it<00:02:17.370> was<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.880> middle<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> night

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
it was like in the middle of the night

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.230 
it was like in the middle of the night
which<00:02:19.230> was<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.500> weird<00:02:19.950> way<00:02:20.310> they<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.940> showed

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
which was a weird way they like showed

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.030 
which was a weird way they like showed
it<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.470> way<00:02:22.590> they<00:02:22.770> had<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
it but I like the way they had the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.030 
it but I like the way they had the
artwork<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:24.110> what<00:02:25.110> they<00:02:25.290> usually<00:02:25.440> do<00:02:25.890> all

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
artwork like what they usually do all

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.800 
artwork like what they usually do all
the<00:02:26.160> time<00:02:26.340> were<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.030> certain<00:02:27.390> person

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
the time were like a certain person

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.510 
the time were like a certain person
standing<00:02:28.290> someone<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.890> looked<00:02:29.130> like<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
standing someone it looked like the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.130 
standing someone it looked like the
shape<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.330> aberration<00:02:30.930> that's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
shape with like the aberration that's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.260 
shape with like the aberration that's
like<00:02:31.320> following<00:02:31.860> them<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.670> she<00:02:32.880> was<00:02:33.000> on<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
like following them like she was on the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.450 
like following them like she was on the
staircase<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:34.020> look<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.620> snake<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.070> she

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
staircase it look like the snake and she

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.950 
staircase it look like the snake and she
was<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> head<00:02:36.180> part<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:38.960> basically

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
was like at the head part and basically

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.680 
was like at the head part and basically
our<00:02:40.200> oggies<00:02:40.680> now<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.250> an<00:02:41.400> aberration<00:02:42.210> genius

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
our oggies now like an aberration genius

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.290 
our oggies now like an aberration genius
because<00:02:42.990> he<00:02:43.740> realizes<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.430> what's<00:02:44.850> going<00:02:45.180> on

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
because he realizes like what's going on

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.090 
because he realizes like what's going on
he<00:02:45.540> doesn't<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:45.930> realize<00:02:46.410> he<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:46.890> like

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
he doesn't really realize he just like

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.140 
he doesn't really realize he just like
assumes<00:02:48.050> what<00:02:49.050> could<00:02:49.500> be<00:02:49.710> happening<00:02:49.890> like<00:02:50.700> she

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
assumes what could be happening like she

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.570 
assumes what could be happening like she
might<00:02:51.390> have<00:02:51.540> lied<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.260> she's<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> part<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.370> like

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
might have lied and she's a part of like

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.820 
might have lied and she's a part of like
a<00:02:53.610> different<00:02:54.030> aberration<00:02:54.600> like<00:02:54.900> this

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
a different aberration like this

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.010 
a different aberration like this
aberration<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.670> guilted<00:02:57.240> her<00:02:57.390> into<00:02:57.870> doing

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
aberration like guilted her into doing

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.050 
aberration like guilted her into doing
something<00:02:58.440> or<00:02:58.710> like<00:02:58.740> asked<00:02:59.250> for<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.460> favor<00:02:59.670> and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
something or like asked for a favor and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.200 
something or like asked for a favor and
you're<00:03:00.240> doing<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.470> and

you're doing it and like that and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.700 
you're doing it and like that and
he<00:03:03.210> doesn't<00:03:03.420> know<00:03:03.600> he's<00:03:03.990> just<00:03:04.260> guessing<00:03:04.470> but

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
he doesn't know he's just guessing but

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.800 
he doesn't know he's just guessing but
he<00:03:04.950> got<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> completely<00:03:05.700> correct<00:03:06.000> I'm<00:03:06.240> thinking

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
he got a completely correct I'm thinking

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.740 
he got a completely correct I'm thinking
shinobu<00:03:07.350> knows<00:03:07.560> cuz<00:03:08.130> away<00:03:08.430> like<00:03:08.790> she<00:03:09.000> looks<00:03:09.510> at

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
shinobu knows cuz away like she looks at

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.060 
shinobu knows cuz away like she looks at
her<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:09.930> talks<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.620> her<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:11.100> basically<00:03:11.790> like

her and talks to her is basically like
like<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> way<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.400> act<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.300> thought<00:03:15.510> you

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
like the way you act like I thought you

like the way you act like I thought you
were<00:03:15.780> acting<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.320> on<00:03:16.530> purpose<00:03:16.770> like

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
were acting like this on purpose like

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.699 
were acting like this on purpose like
all<00:03:17.520> quiet<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.540> don't<00:03:18.840> like<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.410> seem

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
all quiet so you don't like you seem

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.860 
all quiet so you don't like you seem
smart<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:21.140> like<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:23.190> seem<00:03:23.610> shy<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.480> all<00:03:24.600> that

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
but that's not what you are people just

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.760 
but that's not what you are people just
assume<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.450> even<00:03:27.630> if<00:03:27.840> even<00:03:28.080> if<00:03:28.470> they're

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
assume that and even if even if they're

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.320 
assume that and even if even if they're
incorrect<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.550> even<00:03:29.820> if<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.030> do<00:03:30.150> something

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
incorrect like even if you do something

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.420 
incorrect like even if you do something
wrong<00:03:30.570> like<00:03:30.989> they're<00:03:31.500> nice<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.160> because

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
you're quiet and all that but that's

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.190 
you're quiet and all that but that's
just<00:03:34.470> how<00:03:34.680> she's<00:03:34.920> naturally<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.200> shinobu

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
just how she's naturally is and shinobu

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.440 
just how she's naturally is and shinobu
basically<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:37.950> that's<00:03:38.190> devilish<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:39.209> you
