 huge really there are many thanks 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.390
 Thank you 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.770
 I 'm happy revisiting so I know that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.180
 this design will like you very much and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.180
 we go to the workshop 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.809
 Well, I'm very happy to have 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.789
 cecilia here in my workshop we are going to do 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.820
 a very simple geometric design on 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.680
 this white apply a layer of a tone 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.780
 as a pearl to give it a shine 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.730
 much more beautiful 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.489
 so I would start doing some 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.070
 diagonal lines with only four lines 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.440
 I will make the lines cross 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.479
 as you see here I start with 2 then I do 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.670
 the 2 and the next 2 what I do is 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.970
 that this crossing does not pee in the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.700
 two other lines 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.610
 I do the same in the index 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.060
 diagonal and the next two towards the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.060
 other address 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.760
 and finally in this thumb then 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.800
 I will make three lines I fit these lines 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.200
 it depends on the length and width of your 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.190
 nails but this time I will make them a 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.510
 little more horizontal the diagonals 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.510
 very well here I finish 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.920
 now for the design part what 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.600
 I will do is to choose two colors myself 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.060
 I chose a palette of this fuchsia 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.920
 fluorescent and a mint green and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.090
 I'm just going to fill in two of the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.130
 spaces that you find within that 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.590
 inside this little hand 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.079
 also complementary with black and this 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.200
 is our design simply you 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.690
 let your imagination run wild each 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.390
 choose the color and design you want 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.830
 of the diagonals and choose two tones 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.830
 to fill 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.260
 also filled with black in this 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.910
 occasion I see this there is very little black 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.060
 then he simply stretched it a little 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.510
 more and I already like how I like 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.870
 here I'll start with the black then the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.430
 fluorescent see how I do the filling 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.709
 I choose a very big note 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.910
 and I just stretch that drop to 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.310
 fill my space 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.530
 here I finish and well this is our 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.200
 design is quite simple very 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.240
 elaborated also something happened to me and it's 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.510
 that the annular had left it blank 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.910
 but I did not like it so much then 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.590
 I simply chose one of the two 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.349
 colors and sell it 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.209
 Dona apointed complete nail 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.180
 Cecilia is a bit curved so look 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:13.340
 very well in painting them to the extremes not 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.340
 it matters if the cuticle is close together 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.710
 you clean and well here is 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.880
 our design I hope you liked it 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:24.130
 I send kisses and hugs wholesale 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.130
 remember to share and give it like draw 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.240
 Y
