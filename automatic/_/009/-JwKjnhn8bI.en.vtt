you<00:01:51.360> can't<00:01:51.570> debate<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:53.090> mayweather

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you can't debate it you know mayweather

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.920 
you can't debate it you know mayweather
won<00:01:54.180> fair<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:54.990> square

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
won fair and square

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
won fair and square
he's<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.200> man<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> didn't<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.070> any<00:01:59.250> chance

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
he's the man I didn't have any chance

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
he's the man I didn't have any chance
seriously<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.930> looking<00:02:01.380> into<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> fight

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
seriously I just looking into the fight

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.499 
seriously I just looking into the fight
he<00:02:01.979> did<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> good<00:02:02.340> job<00:02:02.399> he<00:02:02.820> did<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> good<00:02:03.119> job<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
he did a good job he did a good job and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.620 
he did a good job he did a good job and
I<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:04.380> he<00:02:04.560> did<00:02:04.799> put<00:02:05.210> Floyd<00:02:06.210> Mayweather

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
I I think he did put Floyd Mayweather

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.520 
I I think he did put Floyd Mayweather
you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.759> he<00:02:08.759> took<00:02:08.940> him<00:02:09.060> by<00:02:09.090> surprise<00:02:09.530> you

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you know he took him by surprise you

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.830 
you know he took him by surprise you
know<00:02:10.649> he<00:02:10.770> didn't<00:02:11.250> even<00:02:11.459> Floyd<00:02:11.790> he<00:02:12.150> admitted

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
know he didn't even Floyd he admitted

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.580 
know he didn't even Floyd he admitted
later<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.200> they

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
later on they

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.979 
later on they
did<00:02:13.739> he<00:02:14.550> beat<00:02:14.790> him<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.180> couple<00:02:15.390> rounds<00:02:15.629> and

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
did he beat him in a couple rounds and

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.660 
did he beat him in a couple rounds and
they<00:02:16.739> thought<00:02:16.950> probably<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.430> would<00:02:17.550> have

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
they thought probably you would have

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.430 
they thought probably you would have
finished<00:02:18.030> probably<00:02:18.239> before<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.989> 12th<00:02:19.319> round

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
finished probably before the 12th round

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.000 
finished probably before the 12th round
but<00:02:19.860> what's<00:02:20.550> crazy<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.940> think<00:02:21.269> was<00:02:21.860> Freddie<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
but what's crazy I think was Freddie and

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.970 
but what's crazy I think was Freddie and
his<00:02:23.069> team<00:02:23.310> probably<00:02:23.700> brought<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.860> packing<00:02:25.860> art

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
his team probably brought in packing art

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.869 
his team probably brought in packing art
that<00:02:26.160> way<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.640> because<00:02:27.650> Floyd<00:02:28.650> was<00:02:28.950> at<00:02:29.099> 160

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
that way is because Floyd was at 160

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.110 
that way is because Floyd was at 160
that's<00:02:30.090> his<00:02:30.299> weight<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.790> honest<00:02:33.060> they

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
that's his weight and to be honest they

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.880 
that's his weight and to be honest they
probably<00:02:33.390> were<00:02:33.569> afraid<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.900> Floyd<00:02:34.650> would

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
probably were afraid that Floyd would

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.210 
probably were afraid that Floyd would
knock<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:35.370> men<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:37.650> they<00:02:37.739> did<00:02:37.799> was<00:02:37.950> they

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
knock out men so what they did was they

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.100 
knock out men so what they did was they
brought<00:02:38.370> him<00:02:38.549> out<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:38.760> way<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.269> heavy<00:02:39.810> even

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
brought him out this way so heavy even

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.309 
brought him out this way so heavy even
yesterday<00:02:40.709> he<00:02:41.010> was<00:02:41.129> lighter<00:02:41.340> than<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.700> um

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
yesterday he was lighter than this um

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.240 
yesterday he was lighter than this um
honestly<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.530> think<00:02:43.769> he<00:02:43.830> would<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.010> been<00:02:44.069> way

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
honestly I think he would have been way

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.530 
honestly I think he would have been way
fast<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.760> he<00:02:44.819> would<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.060> been<00:02:45.180> able<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
fast and he would have been able to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.740 
fast and he would have been able to
dodge<00:02:45.720> more<00:02:46.079> shots<00:02:46.769> from<00:02:47.069> Floyd<00:02:47.579> but<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> think

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
dodge more shots from Floyd but I think

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.910 
dodge more shots from Floyd but I think
the<00:02:48.810> reason<00:02:49.110> they<00:02:49.200> put<00:02:49.230> him<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.769> is

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
the reason they put him in this is

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.949 
the reason they put him in this is
because<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.760> he<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.209> know<00:02:51.299> doesn't<00:02:51.840> want

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
because so he can you know doesn't want

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.900 
because so he can you know doesn't want
to<00:02:52.019> give<00:02:52.170> knocked<00:02:52.680> out<00:02:52.890> but<00:02:53.040> honestly<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.760> think

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
to give knocked out but honestly I think

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.089 
to give knocked out but honestly I think
it<00:02:54.120> was<00:02:54.209> pointless<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:55.530> he<00:02:55.650> didn't<00:02:55.860> want

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
it was pointless because he didn't want

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.930 
it was pointless because he didn't want
nothing<00:02:56.670> he<00:02:56.910> took<00:02:57.599> all<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.959> shots<00:02:58.610> if<00:02:59.610> they

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
nothing he took all the shots if they

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.119 
nothing he took all the shots if they
brought<00:03:00.209> him<00:03:00.299> in<00:03:00.450> brought<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.079> part<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.950> him

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
brought him in brought in a part of him

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.890 
brought him in brought in a part of him
probably<00:03:03.060> brought<00:03:03.180> him<00:03:03.329> in<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.780> know<00:03:03.870> a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
probably brought him in you know a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.050 
probably brought him in you know a
little<00:03:04.110> bit<00:03:04.290> with<00:03:05.220> less<00:03:05.489> weight<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.970> would

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
little bit with less weight it would

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.850 
little bit with less weight it would
have<00:03:06.150> been<00:03:06.269> faster<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.590> would<00:03:07.680> have<00:03:07.739> been

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
have been faster and you would have been

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.259 
have been faster and you would have been
able<00:03:07.980> dodge<00:03:08.340> more<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.670> probably<00:03:08.760> hit<00:03:09.060> more

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
able dodge more and probably hit more

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.900 
able dodge more and probably hit more
shots<00:03:09.510> against<00:03:09.810> Floyd<00:03:10.459> at<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> end<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.849> the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
shots against Floyd at the end of the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.869 
shots against Floyd at the end of the
day<00:03:12.090> if<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:13.049> ever<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:14.220> know<00:03:14.250> would<00:03:14.549> see<00:03:14.700> another

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
day if I ever you know would see another

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.759 
day if I ever you know would see another
fight<00:03:15.180> after<00:03:15.599> this<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:16.019> think<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.500> would<00:03:16.620> be

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
fight after this I think it would be

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.129 
fight after this I think it would be
floyd<00:03:17.870> versus<00:03:18.870> amir<00:03:19.739> khan<00:03:20.660> many<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> end

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
floyd versus amir khan many on the end

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.840 
floyd versus amir khan many on the end
under<00:03:22.530> hand<00:03:22.739> i<00:03:22.889> think<00:03:22.920> he<00:03:23.160> should<00:03:23.370> just<00:03:23.519> retire

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
under hand i think he should just retire

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.720 
under hand i think he should just retire
and<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.870> easy<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.980> over<00:03:26.280> with<00:03:26.459> for

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
and that's it easy it's over with for

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.449 
and that's it easy it's over with for
him<00:03:27.109> anyways<00:03:28.109> let<00:03:28.650> me<00:03:28.680> know<00:03:28.799> what<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.340> guys
