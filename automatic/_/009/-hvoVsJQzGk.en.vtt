00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.370
 Today I 'm going to show you how you can smooth 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:18.299
 hair without using heat 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.299
 I do not need you more no no no 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.050
 is my case 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.670
 it's a super easy method and maybe we 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.800
 the hair is smooth table but for 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.020
 example I have curly hair and if that 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.790
 I do not have a difference amount and the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.430
 next arrives as ready but maybe with 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.110
 a bandit for today but if you want it 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.670
 can review with the iron and if not 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.940
 I do then you can not leave so it's clear 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.940
 do not 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.380
 all you need are a few 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.340
 hairpins a handkerchief as to cover it 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.590
 case and that you will be ready 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.970
 because it's super super easy that yes 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.470
 you will have to have wet hair like that 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.120
 that I recommend that when you are guys in 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.110
 the shower you do it so good 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 let's start 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.310
 It is worth as you can see I have the hair 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.700
 wet 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.070
 just like I just took a shower so let's go 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.440
 to start all need hairpins like that 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.030
 what do we need and a comb 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.880
 but all the fences right side 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.040
 because normally it only takes in the stripe 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.220
 next door is basically 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.780
 brush the hair back in a 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.530
 so that we are like super replicates 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.840
 uefa and we are going to put a hairpin 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.010
 you also have hairstyle is this this is not 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.040
 for 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.070
 and on the other hand we do exactly what 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.070
 same 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.479
 because since I subject you 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.600
 when we have finished with that part 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.920
 The part about this we are going to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.909
 leave with 2 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.430
 what are we going to do with these two 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.860
 parts as we have them like that is cross 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.800
 or this is going to go there and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.800
 I was there for them we crossed in order 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.290
 we cross like this and now what we're going to 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.320
 do is put the hair like that but the hair 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.350
 it has to be styled so we're going to 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.210
 comb it before you do 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.990
 and beige have this part without applying 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.990
 super good first half 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.110
 we will be very balls and hairpins 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.990
 bitch this is a finished side then 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.730
 now let's take this hike brush it 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.920
 well and we're going to do the same as what 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.920
 let's do like this 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.920
 same 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.630
 baby water 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.380
 I'm single 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.350

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.380

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.330

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.069
 be 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.030
 but let's see sometimes there are also 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.030
 complicated parents 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.680

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.840
 I have made a 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.170

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.990
 That's how the hair is 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.780

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.340
 then it is wavy here but to see and 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.130
 then remove the tips that remain 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.220
 like a little weird but between what 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.670
