00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
can switch to your secondary weapon once

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.590 
can switch to your secondary weapon once
you<00:01:47.530> are<00:01:47.680> reloading<00:01:48.190> your<00:01:48.220> primary<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.180> vice

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
you are reloading your primary and vice

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.320 
you are reloading your primary and vice
versa<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.260> that<00:01:51.040> allows<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.520> keep<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:52.090> much

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
versa and that allows you to keep a much

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.710 
versa and that allows you to keep a much
higher<00:01:52.600> firepower<00:01:53.530> on<00:01:53.770> your<00:01:54.040> target<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:55.210> that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
higher firepower on your target and that

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.290 
higher firepower on your target and that
means<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:56.140> sustained<00:01:56.860> fire<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.580> your<00:01:57.970> target

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
means a sustained fire on your target

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.090 
means a sustained fire on your target
which<00:01:58.750> allows<00:01:59.260> you<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.500> have<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.650> much<00:01:59.920> higher

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
which allows you to have a much higher

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.450 
which allows you to have a much higher
dps<00:02:00.580> than<00:02:01.360> thanks<00:02:01.930> for<00:02:02.080> example<00:02:02.560> now<00:02:03.250> this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
reactions from a lot of pilots from

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.120 
reactions from a lot of pilots from
other<00:03:06.520> servers<00:03:07.060> when<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.930> had<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:08.709> with<00:03:08.739> my

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
other servers when it had to do with my

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.630 
other servers when it had to do with my
ESF<00:03:09.700> videos<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:11.230> most<00:03:11.470> common<00:03:12.070> server<00:03:12.310> was

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
ESF videos the most common server was

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.229 
ESF videos the most common server was
the<00:03:13.150> server<00:03:13.360> Matheson<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.610> yeah<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.880> kept

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
the server Matheson and yeah it kept

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.630 
the server Matheson and yeah it kept
going<00:03:16.420> on<00:03:16.690> until<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.440> started<00:03:17.739> flying<00:03:18.070> there<00:03:18.400> I

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
going on until I started flying there I

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.510 
going on until I started flying there I
think<00:03:19.060> it's<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> bit<00:03:19.300> sad<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.890> did<00:03:20.890> meet<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.130> lot<00:03:21.459> of

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
think it's a bit sad I did meet a lot of

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.640 
think it's a bit sad I did meet a lot of
really<00:03:22.000> good<00:03:22.090> pilots<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.600> Madison<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.320> made

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
really good pilots on Madison and I made

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.440 
really good pilots on Madison and I made
a<00:03:23.680> lot<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:23.980> good<00:03:24.190> friends<00:03:24.519> there<00:03:24.730> when<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.150> fly

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
a lot of good friends there when I fly

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.750 
a lot of good friends there when I fly
when<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:25.900> flew<00:03:26.080> there<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.440> we<00:03:27.430> had<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.580> lot<00:03:27.730> of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
when I flew there and we had a lot of

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.729 
when I flew there and we had a lot of
fun<00:03:28.000> we<00:03:28.180> did<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.420> lot<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.660> dueling<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.530> I

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
fun we did a lot of dueling and I

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.710 
fun we did a lot of dueling and I
learned<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.070> lot<00:03:30.250> from<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.820> pilots<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.239> Madison

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
learned a lot from the pilots on Madison

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.250 
learned a lot from the pilots on Madison
so<00:03:32.680> if<00:03:33.340> we<00:03:33.489> could<00:03:33.610> put<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:33.970> all<00:03:34.150> try<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:35.019> on

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
so if we could put that all try that on

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.060 
so if we could put that all try that on
whatever<00:03:35.890> server<00:03:36.220> crap<00:03:36.880> behind<00:03:37.480> us<00:03:37.890> at<00:03:38.890> least

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
whatever server crap behind us at least

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.190 
whatever server crap behind us at least
I<00:03:39.190> would<00:03:39.340> appreciate<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.780> do<00:03:40.840> know<00:03:41.170> that

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
I would appreciate it and I do know that

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.920 
I would appreciate it and I do know that
my<00:03:41.590> videos<00:03:41.950> here<00:03:42.220> about<00:03:42.640> balance<00:03:43.180> between<00:03:43.450> air

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
my videos here about balance between air

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.130 
my videos here about balance between air
and<00:03:43.959> ground<00:03:44.590> or<00:03:44.950> provocative<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:46.150> do<00:03:46.390> apologize

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.170 
and ground or provocative I do apologize
for<00:03:47.350> all<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.560> bad<00:03:48.190> blood<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.820> feelings

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
for all the bad blood and the feelings

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.500 
for all the bad blood and the feelings
that<00:03:49.239> I<00:03:49.360> stir<00:03:49.690> up<00:03:49.959> but<00:03:50.739> this<00:03:51.459> is<00:03:51.670> my<00:03:51.880> opinion<00:03:52.120> I

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
that I stir up but this is my opinion I

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.770 
that I stir up but this is my opinion I
think<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:53.410> tanks<00:03:54.070> if<00:03:54.280> anything<00:03:54.970> should<00:03:55.480> have

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
think that tanks if anything should have

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.110 
think that tanks if anything should have
been<00:03:56.079> balanced<00:03:56.650> rather<00:03:57.160> than<00:03:57.400> es<00:03:57.640> eps<00:03:57.880> if

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
been balanced rather than es eps if

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.180 
been balanced rather than es eps if
anything<00:03:58.930> should<00:03:59.170> have<00:03:59.410> been<00:03:59.620> balanced

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
anything should have been balanced

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.350 
anything should have been balanced
another<00:04:00.970> thing<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.390> of<00:04:02.260> course<00:04:02.320> Max's<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.360> i

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
another thing is of course Max's and i

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.120

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
gameplay to as an addition to the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.940 
gameplay to as an addition to the
balance<00:04:10.000> between<00:04:10.150> air<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:10.630> ground<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.829> now

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
balance between air and ground so now

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.490 
balance between air and ground so now
obviously<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.880> rotaries<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:14.200> hail

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
obviously the rotaries and the hail

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.590 
obviously the rotaries and the hail
storm<00:04:14.650> was<00:04:15.250> too<00:04:15.459> good<00:04:15.670> against<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.419> ground

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
storm was too good against the ground

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.170 
storm was too good against the ground
targets<00:04:17.260> or<00:04:17.560> these<00:04:17.950> some<00:04:18.250> ground<00:04:18.489> targets<00:04:18.910> and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
sense whatsoever so maybe since I don't

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.050
