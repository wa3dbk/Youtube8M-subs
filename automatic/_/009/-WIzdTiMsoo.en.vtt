eight 30s or a 40s I think the a 40s are

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.250 
eight 30s or a 40s I think the a 40s are
the<00:02:34.030> best<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.569> would<00:02:34.720> definitely<00:02:34.840> say<00:02:35.140> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
the best and I would definitely say the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.199 
the best and I would definitely say the
wired<00:02:35.530> version<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> 40s<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.000> best

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
wired version of the a 40s is the best

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.600 
wired version of the a 40s is the best
and<00:02:37.450> that's<00:02:37.959> because<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.470> had<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.010> x31

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
and that's because I had the x31

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.770 
and that's because I had the x31
wireless<00:02:40.330> but<00:02:41.290> after<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.770> while<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.780> the

interference<00:02:51.550> that<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.269> so<00:02:52.480> annoying<00:02:52.810> when<00:02:53.650> I

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
interference that is so annoying when I

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.199 
interference that is so annoying when I
would<00:02:53.860> play<00:02:54.010> game<00:02:54.250> battles<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.850> other<00:02:54.970> things

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
would play game battles and other things

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.360 
would play game battles and other things
like<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.540> online<00:02:55.780> gaming<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:57.100> would<00:02:57.250> get

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
like that online gaming it would get

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.009 
like that online gaming it would get
very<00:02:57.519> annoying<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.090> that's<00:02:58.420> why<00:02:58.569> I<00:02:58.630> decided<00:02:58.930> to

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
very annoying so that's why I decided to

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.070 
very annoying so that's why I decided to
go<00:02:59.140> with<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.350> wired<00:02:59.590> headset<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.310> plus<00:03:01.150> you

Astro<00:03:12.430> a40<00:03:12.819> cables<00:03:13.269> are<00:03:13.390> very<00:03:13.600> long<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.890> wired

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
Astro a40 cables are very long the wired

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.860 
Astro a40 cables are very long the wired
ones<00:03:15.370> are<00:03:15.580> very<00:03:15.760> long<00:03:15.970> I'm<00:03:16.209> not<00:03:16.239> sure<00:03:16.420> about

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
ones are very long I'm not sure about

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.400 
ones are very long I'm not sure about
the<00:03:17.340> turtlebeach<00:03:18.340> wired<00:03:18.780> headsets<00:03:19.780> if<00:03:19.959> those

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
the turtlebeach wired headsets if those

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.970 
the turtlebeach wired headsets if those
cables<00:03:20.799> are<00:03:20.890> long<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.250> then<00:03:21.880> also<00:03:22.709> Astro<00:03:23.709> does

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
cables are long and then also Astro does

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.100 
cables are long and then also Astro does
mix<00:03:24.250> amps<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.730> what<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.970> mix<00:03:25.150> amp<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:25.930> that

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
mix amps and what the mix amp is is that

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.580 
mix amps and what the mix amp is is that
allows<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.769> control<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:28.630> volume<00:03:28.810> like

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
allows you to control the volume like

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.560 
allows you to control the volume like
the<00:03:29.739> voice<00:03:29.920> volume<00:03:30.220> but<00:03:30.670> also<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:31.209> end<00:03:31.360> game

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
the voice volume but also the end game

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.440 
the voice volume but also the end game
volume<00:03:32.079> so<00:03:32.290> like<00:03:33.280> your<00:03:33.459> gun<00:03:33.700> that's<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.209> game

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
volume so like your gun that's in game

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.390 
volume so like your gun that's in game
and<00:03:34.780> then<00:03:34.900> voice<00:03:35.110> is<00:03:35.440> like<00:03:35.620> your<00:03:35.829> friends<00:03:36.280> or

people in xbox live chat talking things

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.479 
people in xbox live chat talking things
like<00:03:39.070> that<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.820> allows<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.239> control<00:03:40.450> that

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.460 
can control the regular volume as well
I'm<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:48.760> loud<00:03:48.970> up<00:03:49.329> or<00:03:49.510> down<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.959> know<00:03:50.049> minimum

is<00:03:53.230> on<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:54.160> turtle<00:03:54.519> beach<00:03:54.640> headset<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
is on the turtle beach headset like the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.900 
is on the turtle beach headset like the
actual<00:03:56.200> cable<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.890> actual<00:03:57.220> headset<00:03:57.549> itself

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
actual cable the actual headset itself

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.990 
actual cable the actual headset itself
is<00:03:58.090> put<00:03:58.870> into<00:03:59.170> what<00:03:59.590> what<00:03:59.950> a<00:03:59.980> stroke<00:04:00.430> calls<00:04:00.730> a

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
is put into what what a stroke calls a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.300 
is put into what what a stroke calls a
mix<00:04:01.299> amp<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:02.200> sits<00:04:02.530> like<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.920> front<00:04:03.190> of

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
mix amp and that sits like in front of

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.640 
mix amp and that sits like in front of
you<00:04:03.459> or<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:03.730> your<00:04:04.090> armrest<00:04:04.989> or<00:04:05.260> something<00:04:05.560> like
