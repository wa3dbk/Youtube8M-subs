this one right here is in foot 120-volt
AC<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.370> what<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.910> want<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.150> look<00:00:12.210> for<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
AC and what you want to look for is the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.980 
AC and what you want to look for is the
output<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.820> 9.6<00:00:14.820> volts<00:00:15.299> are<00:00:15.420> pretty<00:00:15.630> close<00:00:15.839> to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
output is 9.6 volts are pretty close to

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.439 
output is 9.6 volts are pretty close to
10<00:00:16.199> volts<00:00:16.379> which<00:00:17.100> runs<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.520> fan<00:00:17.820> about<00:00:18.330> on

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
10 volts which runs that fan about on

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.730 
10 volts which runs that fan about on
medium<00:00:18.900> that's<00:00:19.020> what<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.260> does<00:00:19.380> because<00:00:19.590> it's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
medium that's what it does because it's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.400 
medium that's what it does because it's
a<00:00:19.800> nine<00:00:19.980> volt<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> 13<00:00:20.880> bolt<00:00:21.260> give<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.350> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
a nine volt to the 13 bolt give you a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.290 
a nine volt to the 13 bolt give you a
little<00:00:22.590> bit<00:00:22.800> an<00:00:23.010> idea<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.670> here's<00:00:23.850> another<00:00:24.060> one

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
little bit an idea so here's another one

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.400 
little bit an idea so here's another one
you<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.449> see<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.689> print<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> little

you can see this print on this a little

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.870 
you can see this print on this a little
bit<00:00:25.590> better<00:00:25.680> i<00:00:25.830> get<00:00:26.070> pick<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.400> these<00:00:26.550> at<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
bit better i get pick up these at the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.900 
bit better i get pick up these at the
