think<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.780> slightly<00:02:28.020> thicker<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.950> kind

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
think that is slightly thicker it's kind

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.280 
think that is slightly thicker it's kind
of<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.489> marshmallow<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.150> consistency<00:02:30.900> I

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
of like a marshmallow in consistency I

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.590 
of like a marshmallow in consistency I
decided<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.459> use<00:02:32.610> thicker<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.970> think<00:02:33.330> because

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
decided to use thicker I think because

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.650 
decided to use thicker I think because
the<00:02:33.780> bow<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.230> kind<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.739> small<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.660> usually

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the bow is kind of small and usually

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.320 
the bow is kind of small and usually
with<00:02:37.200> small<00:02:37.500> areas<00:02:38.010> cave-ins<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.390> occur<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.560> I

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
with small areas cave-ins can occur so I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.699 
with small areas cave-ins can occur so I
wanted<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.480> make<00:02:42.660> sure<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.989> that's<00:02:43.530> not

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
wanted to make sure that that's not

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.710 
wanted to make sure that that's not
gonna<00:02:44.040> happen<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.670> I'm<00:02:44.819> using<00:02:45.030> thicker<00:02:45.600> I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
gonna happen so I'm using thicker I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.199 
gonna happen so I'm using thicker I
think<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.230> make<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.530> bow<00:02:52.610> now<00:02:53.610> take<00:02:53.880> pink

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
think to make the bow now take pink

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.490 
think to make the bow now take pink
royal<00:02:54.450> icing<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.080> outline<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.560> whole<00:02:55.890> cookie
