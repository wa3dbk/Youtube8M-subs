00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.529
 subscribers of my channel today I tell you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.189
 I want to show and tell how 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.599
 install shaders for minecraft 1.5.2 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.480
 first we need optifine cher from 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.410
 Spock shader shader armor and pure client 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.930
 minecraft 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.970
 I'll leave it all in the description if you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.220
 too lazy to install then I will leave the client with 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.189
 shaders you just take this daddy 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:34.320
 and pull this all remove from your 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:37.500
 folders and go away and now take 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.620
 so we need a clean minecraft client 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:50.250
 but now we take but they are sure to be clean 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:54.980
 write a percentage and where we go now . 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:59.190

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.680
 take and open with the help there open 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.809
 and open through winrar and you open 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.720
 what archiver you will have there through 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.820
 Someone plugin I prefer winrar and he 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.360
 convenient now we have a folder 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 Meta-inf and delete it can not 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.920

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.829
 all black screen removed 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:29.610
 and these more picture tags 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:32.860
 Now we need to open. maykravt and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.939
 open this where we all take optifine 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:46.090
 just take it all up and throw 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:50.189

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.960
 they threw everything well laid back and take 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.439

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.929
 Macro downloaded it more convenient Cheri Tigo 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:04.959

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.970
 investor now go into the game 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.360
 check and if these thoughts are set 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.720
 optifine options with this here optifine is like 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.269
 we see installed if it will not 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.510
 just minecraft is not installed 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:34.140
 will come in so now we take 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.590
 find the optifine mind behind shut it 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.079
 take again 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.410
 and take shader smog also take it and 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:50.030
 we throw right here manicraft 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:54.470
 here too we throw thrown what all 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.590
 Now we take a go in the lanes 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.130
 there is no minecraft go into this folder I 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:12.020

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:22.700
 with so-so now take Scheler could here the 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:30.850

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.850

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:47.290
 Yes, as a teacher could shaile for that is 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:53.920

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.920
 give excuse me for my mistake 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.320
 now everything should work out for us 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.090
 and there is no means that you have a shader 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.650
 Spock appeared means take it all right 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.539
 was meant to enter the game 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.210
 ok so shaderpacks throw here now 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.430
 back it can be removed from here we all 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.600
 installed mod shaders 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.370
 molting me for flooding like that 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:39.410

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:53.740
 someone would not just pull anyone so now 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.460
 we entered minecraft as 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:09.070
 shader options here are all shaders first 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:16.280

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:39.620
 You do not know for the shaders, but this is the address 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.490

00:05:47.750 --> 00:06:03.639
