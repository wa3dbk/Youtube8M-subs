to track your the ways you're going and

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.870 
to track your the ways you're going and
to<00:03:34.269> maybe<00:03:34.420> put<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:35.350> together<00:03:35.640> what<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.760> the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
to maybe put this together what is the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.970 
to maybe put this together what is the
reason<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.840> not<00:03:38.110> completely<00:03:38.470> mirror

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
reason that is not completely mirror

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.099 
reason that is not completely mirror
directly<00:03:39.989> this<00:03:40.989> is<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.350> course<00:03:42.810> yeah<00:03:43.840> so

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
directly this is of course yeah so

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.140 
directly this is of course yeah so
having<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.220> screen<00:03:45.400> directly<00:03:45.670> mirrored

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
having the screen directly mirrored

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.420 
having the screen directly mirrored
