let's<00:01:16.090> turn<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.540> tire<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:17.350> sound<00:01:17.680> died<00:01:17.980> away

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
let's turn the tire this sound died away

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.120 
let's turn the tire this sound died away
what<00:01:18.850> happened<00:01:19.450> turn<00:01:19.930> back<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.380> time<00:01:20.620> we

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
what happened turn back the time we

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.650 
what happened turn back the time we
