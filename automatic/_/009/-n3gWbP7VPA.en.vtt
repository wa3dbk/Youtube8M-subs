00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.619
 hello friends for that I propose a dessert 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.859
 with an ingredient that almost everyone likes chocolate 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:18.199
 I recommend you get it if you touch us so that they can also 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.029
 eat them carry 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.710
 to make these chocolates that Marijose proposes to us 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.839
 sugar-free chocolate suitable for diabetics 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.350
 mixture of nuts to taste in this case nuts 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.900
 and curly paper molds 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.680
 The first thing we will do is melt the chocolate in a bain marie 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.300
 when we check that it is well melted but we will separate from the fire 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.070
 VÃ¡zquez then we will take a metal mold 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 on which we will put the cake mold 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.980
 and smear it with chocolate, helping us with a brush 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.390
 the metal mold will help us to hold the paper without burning our fingers 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 while we use hot chocolate 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.979
 then 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:18.249
 We will harden the chocolate in the fridge for about an hour 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.529
 we take the molds out of the fridge 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.359
 and the fillings of minced dried fruits 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:09.819
 we will pour more hot chocolate on them, helping again 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.849
 Brush 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.670
 spector 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:37.070
 and we put them back in the fridge another masterpiece 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.070
 or until the time of serving 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.879
 Looks good 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.349
 the only precaution that you have to have is that you want to go back on paper before this 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.349
 Commerce 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:00.149
 I wonder if there is no consensus to approve 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.719
 asked bp that I expected that the action team is going to eat him the follow 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.689
