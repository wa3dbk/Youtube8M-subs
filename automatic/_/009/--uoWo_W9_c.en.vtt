top cover you put just very open show
you<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.670> device<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.180> so<00:01:47.170> there<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.530> type

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
you the device and so there is the type

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.260 
you the device and so there is the type

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
has got the light in character this is a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.380 
has got the light in character this is a
lightning<00:02:32.560> connector<00:02:32.680> as<00:02:33.550> an<00:02:33.760> eight-pointed

cover let's try to stick it back see how

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:44.379 
cover let's try to stick it back see how
it<00:03:30.200> sticks<00:03:41.439> so<00:03:42.439> this<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.879> lightning<00:03:44.269> can

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
it sticks so this is the lightning can

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.509 
it sticks so this is the lightning can
except<00:03:44.689> for<00:03:44.870> lightning<00:03:45.769> put<00:03:45.980> in<00:03:46.129> the<00:03:46.220> bottom
