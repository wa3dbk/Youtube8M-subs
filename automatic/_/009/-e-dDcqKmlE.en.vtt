 i 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.980
 hello how about friends very good afternoon 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.779
 welcome to a video more than 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.669
 amusement color decoration with 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.230
 balloons and more and this time we 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.849
 We are very happy because 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.129
 we are sure that this video is going 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.989
 to like a lot and apart it's going to be 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.970
 great utility because it's about that 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.070
 let's make a homemade calibrator 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.750
 with very easy to get materials 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.360
 anywhere you can find them 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.280
 so please join us do not be 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.780
 go and continue with us in this 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.519
 more fun video that color 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.790
 decoration with balloons hopefully you 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.790
 like 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.780
 and good friends the only thing we're going to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.140
 use to make this calibrator 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.430
 home is going to be a cardboard box 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 you are going to select a box of 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.750
 cardboard that they like the most they have to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.570
 take into account the size of the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.700
 holes that will be distributed in each 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.010
 of the faces of the box however 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.290
 you select the box that most 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.990
 agree here for example we have one of 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.410
 a well-known milk if this could be a 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.080
 example can also use another one that 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.210
 be for example bleach these 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 these elements are very easy to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.820
 get because you can go to the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.550
 shop at the corner store 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.950
 tell the shopkeeper he knows they come give me a 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.960
 cardboard box and it is very easy to 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.180
 get we recommend also 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.340
 make it an oil box 1 2 3 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.130
 specifically of that brand so that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.770
 they are better distributed their holes 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.250
 in the home calibrator on the other hand 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.770
 we are also going to need a pen to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.080
 can mark each of the holes and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.479
 the measures distributed in each of 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.340
 the faces the measures that we are going to 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.970
 handle in this calibrator are going to be in 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.980
 inches 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.080
 maybe for some people it's very 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.240
 difficult to handle a different measure of 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.550
 what is the centimeter but not 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.040
 worry because we have thought 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.900
 in that and in the description of this video 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.540
 they will be able to find a link to 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.670
 can download a file a file 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.220
 word specifically so that they can 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.990
 you print each of the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.570
 holes with their respective measure in 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.490
 inches print it cut it out already 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.930
 from that you will be able to 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.300
 select each of the templates 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.420
 to place it on faces for example 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.970
 I 've gone ahead a bit and here I have 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.370
 and the templates that I'm going to use like this 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.260
 for example here I have the number 2 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.959
 which is 2 inches which is this size 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.970
 approximately I also have the 3's 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.890
 you do not have to worry about 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.600
 take the measurements, much less because 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.610
 in that file that we're going to find 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.440
 here in the description of this video 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.930
 it will be much easier the only thing 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.730
 what they have to do is print it 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.870
 cut it out and use it then by 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.670
 example I have 2 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.849
 I have 3 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.090
 I have 4 and so on until 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.130
 get to 10 from 2 to 10 if you 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.569
 they want to use a wider measure 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.160
 they can do it there is no problem 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.440
 although you have to take into account that 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.660
 all modes can be inflated to a 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.819
 very large measure according to what 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.620
 you use in your decoration 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.480
 that is what will be very useful and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.970
 well we are also going to use a 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.670
 knife or a cutter to make the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.069
 cut and well let's see how it is done 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.160
 the process in a box completely 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.630
 empty with nothing as we will mark each 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.190
 one of the holes so they can 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.190
 make this home calibrator 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.300
 and good friends like you are going to 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.680
 have your templates done because 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.410
 you are already going to cut it from 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.790
 of the file that we are going to send 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.040
 within the description of this video 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.380
 you are going to have your cuts your 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.780
 templates and what they have to do is 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.550
 place each of them in the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.500
 respective sizes according to how 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.920
 fit the space available in the box 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.050
 to be able to mark it this is going to 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.120
 facilitate that we do not have to throw 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.580
 lose a box if we do not make a 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.770
 correct distribution the templates we 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.690
 they are going to serve a lot and apart they are going to 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.910
 serve if we want to make more 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.710
 home calibrators then what 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.470
 it's about us going 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.930
 marking each of the templates in 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.060
 the faces of the box and we can get 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.340
 the correct result right now we are going to 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.170
 see for example a possible repartition 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.610
 on each of the faces so that 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.460
 you realize more or less of 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.560
 how to do it and have the possibility of 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.700
 make a correct distribution in your 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.700
 homemade calibrator 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.199
 i 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.900
 all right 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.900
 and once we have already marked all the 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.509
 templates of our holes in the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.639
 box now it is necessary to go cutting it 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.319
 with the help of a knife or with a 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.349
 cutter I for example I'm taking a 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.330
 small serrated knife to be able 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.490
 make the cuts then let's go 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.590
 trimming each of the contours 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.719
 so that we can have our 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.819
 holes in our box then in 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:33.439
 this moment we are going to prepare ourselves to do 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.439
 the cut of each of the circles 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.190
 and good friends this is how our 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.720
 calibrator home you realize 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.970
 that is made of a very material 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.670
 easy to get is a simple box of 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.740
 ordinary cardboard and we hope that 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.270
 You liked this video because it's 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.340
 a tool that is not necessary 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.950
 wait until we have money to 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.380
 have it in a professional manner but 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.720
 with a simple box we can do it 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.310
 easily and will serve us for all 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.530
 the decorations that we make 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.890
 so we hope you liked it

 you this was a video over 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.220
 amusement color decoration with 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.670
 balloons and more and see you until the
