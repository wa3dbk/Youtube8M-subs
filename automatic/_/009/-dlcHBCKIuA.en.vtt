00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
kind of surprised me that I I don't
think<00:01:43.229> many<00:01:43.590> people<00:01:43.649> even<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.189> about<00:01:44.460> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
think many people even think about I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.359 
think many people even think about I
always<00:01:44.790> carry<00:01:45.119> an<00:01:45.329> emergency<00:01:45.630> set<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.409> five

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
always carry an emergency set of five

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.830 
always carry an emergency set of five
business<00:01:47.909> cards<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.360> keep<00:01:48.540> them<00:01:48.630> this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
business cards and I keep them this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.830 
business cards and I keep them this
little<00:01:49.259> black<00:01:49.619> pouch<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:51.180> protect<00:01:51.570> them<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
little black pouch to protect them to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.719 
little black pouch to protect them to
keep<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.110> meal<00:01:52.320> from<00:01:52.560> getting<00:01:52.829> rough<00:01:52.979> edges<00:01:53.189> but

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
keep a meal from getting rough edges but

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.370 
keep a meal from getting rough edges but
I<00:01:53.790> always<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.240> keep<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.659> five<00:01:54.930> cards<00:01:55.350> in

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
I always just keep about five cards in

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.840 
I always just keep about five cards in
there<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> go<00:01:55.890> through<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.280> replenish

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
there and I go through and I replenish

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.850 
there and I go through and I replenish
that<00:01:56.880> whenever<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.479> needs<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.380> my<00:01:58.649> whole

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that whenever it needs it but my whole

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.249 
that whenever it needs it but my whole
reasoning<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.850> never<00:02:00.119> know<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
reasoning is that you never know and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.600 
reasoning is that you never know and
when<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.530> go<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.740> networking<00:02:02.100> events<00:02:02.280> I'm

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
when I go to networking events I'm

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.219 
when I go to networking events I'm
always<00:02:02.850> wearing<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.180> sports<00:02:03.450> jacket<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.200> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
always wearing a sports jacket so I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.530 
always wearing a sports jacket so I
actually<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.649> keep<00:02:04.890> business<00:02:05.310> cards<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.759> one<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
actually I keep business cards in one of

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
actually I keep business cards in one of
my<00:02:06.659> inside<00:02:07.079> pocket<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.590> I've<00:02:07.710> always<00:02:07.860> got

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
my inside pocket so I've always got

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
my inside pocket so I've always got
backup<00:02:08.489> business<00:02:08.789> cards<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.720> find

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
backup business cards there but I find

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.199 
backup business cards there but I find
that<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:11.220> many<00:02:11.340> times<00:02:11.459> you're<00:02:11.819> going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> meet

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
that so many times you're going to meet

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.350 
that so many times you're going to meet
somebody<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.840> never

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.300 
guess he didn't try to define those but
the<00:03:40.720> other<00:03:40.870> 5%<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.590> time<00:03:41.739> I've<00:03:41.920> got<00:03:42.100> other
