00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
all possible we've left ourselves a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
all possible we've left ourselves a
little<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.440> battle<00:01:02.160> at<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.489> moment<00:01:02.699> in

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
little bit of a battle at this moment in

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
little bit of a battle at this moment in
time<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.480> position<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.049> we're<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.409> but

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
time with the position that we're in but

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
time with the position that we're in but
there<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.339> still<00:01:05.430> 35<00:01:06.030> games<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
there are still 35 games to go so that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.770 
there are still 35 games to go so that
still<00:01:08.220> gives<00:01:08.400> us<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.850> realistic<00:01:09.540> opportunity

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
still gives us a realistic opportunity

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.190 
still gives us a realistic opportunity
of<00:01:10.560> getting<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> shake-up<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.330> you've<00:01:13.170> got

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
of getting in the shake-up so you've got

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.870 
of getting in the shake-up so you've got
be<00:01:13.470> until<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.799> must<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.280> promoted<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
be until you must be promoted this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.499 
be until you must be promoted this
season<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.990> either<00:01:16.290> d<00:01:16.560> Valley<00:01:16.799> under<00:01:17.509> yes

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
season because either d Valley under yes

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.440 
season because either d Valley under yes
he<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.320> he<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:20.240> realistic<00:01:21.240> enough

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
he is but I think he is realistic enough

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
he is but I think he is realistic enough
to<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.990> position<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.560> were<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:22.979> this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
to see the position that were in at this

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.609 
to see the position that were in at this
moment<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.640> time<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.439> get<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
moment in time and if we can get a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.899 
moment in time and if we can get a
top-six<00:01:26.280> finish<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.720> will<00:01:27.840> be

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
top-six finish I think that will be

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
top-six finish I think that will be
realistic<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.659> would<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.960> an<00:01:31.020> achievement

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
realistic and it would be an achievement

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.859 
realistic and it would be an achievement
and<00:01:31.829> from<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.159> situation<00:01:32.420> who<00:01:33.420> knows<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and from that situation who knows you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.270 
and from that situation who knows you
can<00:01:34.020> still<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> Premier<00:01:34.890> League<00:01:34.920> from

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
can still get in the Premier League from

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.760 
can still get in the Premier League from
those<00:01:35.460> playoffs<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.689> use<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> prior<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.590> get

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
those playoffs we use the prior to get

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.920 
those playoffs we use the prior to get
the<00:01:37.920> call<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> certain<00:01:42.119> extent<00:01:42.600> yes

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the call from it to a certain extent yes

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.569 
the call from it to a certain extent yes
but<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:44.060> think<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> league<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.689> manager

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
but I think as a league one manager

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.440 
but I think as a league one manager
you're<00:01:47.579> always<00:01:47.759> looking<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.390> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you're always looking for that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.660 
you're always looking for that
opportunity<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.619> about<00:01:49.770> opportunities

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
opportunity and it's about opportunities

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.120 
opportunity and it's about opportunities
and<00:01:51.020> obviously<00:01:52.020> when<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.380> opportunity<00:01:52.649> came

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and obviously when this opportunity came

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.789 
and obviously when this opportunity came
along<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.909> thought<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.399> excellent<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.670> a

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
along I thought it was a excellent one a

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
along I thought it was a excellent one a
club<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:58.979> huge<00:01:59.310> potential<00:01:59.729> going<00:02:00.689> forward

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
club with huge potential going forward

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.450 
club with huge potential going forward
and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.860> felt<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.250> I'd<00:02:03.090> done<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> miles<00:02:03.689> you

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
and I felt as if I'd done the miles you

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.000 
and I felt as if I'd done the miles you
got<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> very<00:02:05.729> decent<00:02:05.969> chap

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
got a very decent chap

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.950 
got a very decent chap
in<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.370> lower<00:02:07.550> divisions<00:02:08.150> what<00:02:08.570> difference

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
in the lower divisions what difference

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.510 
in the lower divisions what difference
do<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:09.320> think<00:02:09.770> you'll<00:02:09.979> find<00:02:10.280> them

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
do you think you'll find them

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.240 
do you think you'll find them

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
that point of view I think I've got a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.060 
that point of view I think I've got a

lot to bring to the table in terms of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.790 
lot to bring to the table in terms of

the 650 games that are probably done now

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.130 
the 650 games that are probably done now
and<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.640> never<00:02:40.850> stop<00:02:41.270> learning<00:02:41.300> really<00:02:41.990> do

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
and you never stop learning really do

you<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:43.370> we're<00:02:43.970> all<00:02:44.150> learning<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:44.930> think

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
you and we're all learning and I think

you and we're all learning and I think
I've<00:02:45.770> picked<00:02:46.130> up<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.400> lot<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.700> good<00:02:46.730> things<00:02:47.030> from

I've picked up a lot of good things from
different<00:02:47.390> people<00:02:48.020> that<00:02:48.170> I've<00:02:48.290> worked<00:02:48.440> with

different people that I've worked with

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.860 
different people that I've worked with
over<00:02:48.710> my<00:02:49.130> time<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.580> football<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.150> obviously

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
over my time in football and obviously

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.370 
over my time in football and obviously
I've<00:02:51.020> got<00:02:51.200> my<00:02:51.350> own<00:02:51.500> way<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.770> doing<00:02:52.040> things<00:02:52.190> now

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
I've got my own way of doing things now

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.210 
I've got my own way of doing things now
do<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.470> feel<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:54.830> will<00:02:55.250> win<00:02:55.850> over<00:02:56.300> scale<00:02:57.220> of

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
do you feel you will win over scale of

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.770 
do you feel you will win over scale of
course<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.730> think<00:02:58.940> that's<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.209> same<00:02:59.420> at<00:02:59.630> any

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
course I think that's the same at any

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.440 
course I think that's the same at any
football<00:03:00.170> club<00:03:00.440> when<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:01.250> go<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.760> the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
football club when you go in and the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.480 
football club when you go in and the
only<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.870> only<00:03:03.110> thing<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.740> will<00:03:03.860> do<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.310> is

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
only the only thing that will do that is

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.760 
only the only thing that will do that is
performance<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.720> winning<00:03:06.380> football

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
performance and and winning football

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.920 
performance and and winning football
matches<00:03:07.690> what<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:08.810> your<00:03:08.990> style<00:03:09.320> as<00:03:10.780> what<00:03:11.780> is

I think we scored I think we've second

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.220 
I think we scored I think we've second
highest<00:04:05.150> goal<00:04:05.330> scorer<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.750> something<00:04:06.080> like

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
highest goal scorer is something like
