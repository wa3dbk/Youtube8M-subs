wouldn't recommend taking your Vita in
and<00:01:36.130> out<00:01:36.250> if<00:01:36.460> you're<00:01:36.610> going<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.910> put<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.150> in

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.590 
and out if you're going to put it in
leave<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.600> in<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:39.430> if<00:01:39.670> you're<00:01:39.820> going<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.120> keep

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
it out leave it out because I took mine

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.120 
it out leave it out because I took mine
out<00:01:48.729> only<00:01:49.360> like<00:01:49.720> four<00:01:50.140> times<00:01:50.290> maybe<00:01:50.650> maybe

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
out only like four times maybe maybe

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.280 
out only like four times maybe maybe
more<00:01:51.460> but<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.700> don't<00:01:51.880> think<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.690> this

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
more but I don't think so and this

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.219 
more but I don't think so and this
starts<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.040> like<00:01:54.369> come<00:01:54.759> off<00:01:54.910> of<00:01:55.150> here<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
starts to like come off of here and

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.010 
starts to like come off of here and
they're<00:01:56.380> like<00:01:56.530> clicks<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:01.240> can<00:02:01.420> still

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
they're like clicks but so you can still

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.710 
they're like clicks but so you can still
have<00:02:02.050> access<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.680> your<00:02:03.060> charger<00:02:04.060> port<00:02:04.360> and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
have access to your charger port and

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:15.990 
have access to your charger port and
headphones<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.420> your<00:02:14.070> game<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.880> I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
headphones and your game and I

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.660 
headphones and your game and I
don't<00:02:16.090> know<00:02:16.360> what<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:18.010> whether<00:02:18.370> fun

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
don't know what this is but whether fun

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.789 
don't know what this is but whether fun
sticks<00:02:18.970> out<00:02:19.209> it's<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.570> little<00:02:19.810> bit<00:02:19.989> harder<00:02:20.769> to

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
sticks out it's a little bit harder to

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.449 
sticks out it's a little bit harder to
get<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.549> but<00:02:21.850> luckily<00:02:22.780> there's<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:24.100> and

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
get to it but luckily there's this and

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.180 
get to it but luckily there's this and
it<00:02:24.580> pulls<00:02:25.030> out<00:02:25.299> so<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.530> still<00:02:26.769> get<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.070> to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
it pulls out so you can still get it to

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.850 
it pulls out so you can still get it to
it<00:02:27.340> pretty<00:02:27.519> good<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:31.769> you're<00:02:32.769> not

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
it pretty good and then this you're not

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.610 
it pretty good and then this you're not
even<00:02:33.220> sure<00:02:33.400> what<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:36.450> so

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.559 

if<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.760> hear<00:02:41.970> something<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:43.080> weird<00:02:43.520> voice

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
if you hear something like a weird voice

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.430 
if you hear something like a weird voice
noise<00:02:45.569> thing<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.319> probably<00:02:46.560> my<00:02:46.920> sister<00:02:48.440> but

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
noise thing it's probably my sister but

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.820 
noise thing it's probably my sister but
yeah<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.670> comes<00:02:51.239> off<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.290> has<00:02:52.410> access<00:02:52.800> to

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
yeah it this comes off so has access to
