00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
of two inches I know the name is really

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.539 
of two inches I know the name is really
aggressive<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> name<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.799> showing<00:01:53.009> three

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
aggressive the name is showing three

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.480 
aggressive the name is showing three
inches<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.180> rain<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.409> more<00:01:55.799> for<00:01:56.040> Birmingham

inches of rain or more for Birmingham

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.760

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
but the GFS is not as wet so I think one

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.410 
but the GFS is not as wet so I think one
to<00:01:58.890> two<00:01:59.070> inches<00:01:59.100> sounds<00:01:59.610> pretty<00:01:59.790> good<00:01:59.969> here<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
to two inches sounds pretty good here in

have adjusted the risk areas southward
that's<00:02:21.630> good<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.020> us<00:02:23.090> basically<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.120> risk

that's good for us basically that risk

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
even farther south but the really

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.650 
even farther south but the really
significant<00:02:35.370> threat<00:02:35.550> will<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.540> that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
significant threat will be and that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.210 
significant threat will be and that

City<00:02:42.710> so<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:43.740> think<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> northern<00:02:44.730> half<00:02:44.850> of

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
City so I think for the northern half of

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.760 
City so I think for the northern half of
this<00:02:45.060> day<00:02:45.210> just<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.480> lot<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.690> rain<00:02:46.080> with<00:02:46.530> this

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
this day just a lot of rain with this

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.010 
this day just a lot of rain with this
and<00:02:47.340> any<00:02:47.640> severe<00:02:48.060> weather<00:02:48.090> should<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.540> closer

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
and any severe weather should be closer

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.780 
and any severe weather should be closer
to<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.410> Gulf<00:02:49.620> Coast<00:02:49.950> where<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.670> better

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
to the Gulf Coast where the better

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.310 
to the Gulf Coast where the better
instability<00:02:51.540> will<00:02:51.690> be<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.960> then<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.140> day

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
instability will be and then on day

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.040 
instability will be and then on day

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
if this is right now look a Sunday

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.300 
if this is right now look a Sunday
morning<00:04:30.360> at<00:04:30.630> six<00:04:30.660> o'clock<00:04:30.960> this<00:04:31.680> run<00:04:31.980> still

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
morning at six o'clock this run still

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.540 
morning at six o'clock this run still
has<00:04:32.490> some<00:04:33.210> heavier<00:04:33.480> rain<00:04:33.570> falling<00:04:34.200> here<00:04:34.550> and

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
has some heavier rain falling here and

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.940 
has some heavier rain falling here and
really<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.020> GFS<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.230> RPM<00:04:37.710> they're<00:04:37.830> all

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
really the GFS the RPM they're all

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.890 
really the GFS the RPM they're all
slower<00:04:38.370> so<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:38.700> think<00:04:38.760> would<00:04:38.970> have<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.210> have<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
slower so I think would have to have the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.630 
slower so I think would have to have the
chance<00:04:40.140> of<00:04:40.290> rain<00:04:40.500> lingering<00:04:41.040> into<00:04:41.250> Sunday

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
chance of rain lingering into Sunday

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.160 
chance of rain lingering into Sunday
morning<00:04:42.000> at<00:04:42.120> least<00:04:42.300> maybe<00:04:42.480> until<00:04:42.840> mid-morning

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
morning at least maybe until mid-morning

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.710 
morning at least maybe until mid-morning
and<00:04:43.440> look<00:04:43.560> at<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.710> snow<00:04:43.770> over<00:04:44.190> Tennessee<00:04:44.720> will

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
and look at the snow over Tennessee will

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.240 
and look at the snow over Tennessee will
go<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.870> noon<00:04:46.140> Sunday<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.740> this<00:04:46.890> is<00:04:47.010> even

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
go to noon Sunday and this is even

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.010 
go to noon Sunday and this is even
suggesting<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.880> chance<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.270> snow<00:04:48.390> flakes<00:04:48.780> maybe

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
suggesting a chance of snow flakes maybe

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.080 
suggesting a chance of snow flakes maybe
over<00:04:49.650> extreme<00:04:50.070> North<00:04:50.280> Alabama<00:04:50.550> around<00:04:51.030> the
