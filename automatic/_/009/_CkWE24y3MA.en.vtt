bacterias grow too but not really the
fungi<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.320> really<00:02:10.470> needs<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.770> develop

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
fungi is what really needs to develop

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.600 
fungi is what really needs to develop
bacterias<00:02:11.730> grow<00:02:12.450> easily<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.680> yeah<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.400> cook

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
bacterias grow easily so yeah and I cook

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.810 
bacterias grow easily so yeah and I cook
it<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:14.820> here<00:02:15.000> for<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.270> month<00:02:16.610> let<00:02:17.610> all<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
it out here for a month let all the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.340 
it out here for a month let all the
nutrients<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> thing<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.050> don't<00:02:19.140> want

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
nutrients do the thing you don't want

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.020 
nutrients do the thing you don't want
you<00:02:19.830> know<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.100> nutrients<00:02:20.489> breaking<00:02:20.820> down

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
you know the nutrients breaking down

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.790 
you know the nutrients breaking down
sometimes<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:21.930> nutrient<00:02:22.380> locked<00:02:22.590> up

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
sometimes you can get nutrient locked up

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.220 
sometimes you can get nutrient locked up
and<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.970> other<00:02:24.120> times<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.720> get<00:02:24.810> nutrient

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
and on other times you can get nutrient

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.750 
and on other times you can get nutrient
burn<00:02:25.380> from<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.769> nutrients<00:02:26.100> being<00:02:26.310> too<00:02:26.519> hot

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
burn from the nutrients being too hot

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.979 
burn from the nutrients being too hot
and<00:02:26.940> releasing<00:02:27.390> too<00:02:27.510> fast

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
and releasing too fast

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.199 
and releasing too fast
so<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:28.620> let<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:28.800> cook<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.280> take<00:02:29.760> care<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.060> both

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
so we let it cook you take care of both

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.509 
so we let it cook you take care of both
those<00:02:30.390> problems<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.170> yeah<00:02:31.860> since<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.190> here<00:02:32.370> for

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
og cush is and the Recon and some of the

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.699 
og cush is and the Recon and some of the
blueberry<00:02:38.760> Trinity's<00:02:39.150> there<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.140> exact

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
blueberry Trinity's there in this exact

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.699 
blueberry Trinity's there in this exact
same<00:02:40.860> soil<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.459> didn't<00:02:41.640> put<00:02:41.880> any<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
same soil but I didn't put any of the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.650 
same soil but I didn't put any of the
granular<00:02:43.709> nutrients<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.519> there<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:45.060> live

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
granular nutrients in there I just live

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.259 
granular nutrients in there I just live
lead-up<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.590> 707<00:02:47.040> with<00:02:47.489> some<00:02:47.700> humus<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
lead-up the 707 with some humus and

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.500 
lead-up the 707 with some humus and
castings<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.260> earth<00:02:49.890> worm<00:02:50.100> compost<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:51.360> yeah

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
castings and earth worm compost so yeah

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.020 
castings and earth worm compost so yeah
this<00:02:51.900> soil<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.320> gonna<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> lot<00:02:52.739> stronger<00:02:53.070> and

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
this soil is gonna be a lot stronger and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.100 
this soil is gonna be a lot stronger and
really<00:02:54.120> push<00:02:54.420> them<00:02:54.600> into<00:02:54.690> flowering<00:02:54.959> like

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
you can change it up a little bit for

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.150 
you can change it up a little bit for
your<00:03:15.510> genetics<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.410> know<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.590> don't<00:03:16.860> have<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
your genetics you know you don't have to

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.460 
your genetics you know you don't have to
put<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:17.910> exactly<00:03:18.360> everything<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.810> put<00:03:19.019> in<00:03:19.170> but
