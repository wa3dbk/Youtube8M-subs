00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.139
 how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.480
 Occasion I bring you how to make a cake 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.360
 of condensed milk that I hope you 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.840
 like and well let's start with the 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.080
 ingredients we will occupy 5 eggs 2 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.059
 butter sticks a spoonful of 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.720
 powder to bake the spoon that I occupy 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.720
 is this 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:39.040
 two cups of wheat flour 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.780
 a condensed milk 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.830
 and some evaporated milk 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.420
 approximately is a quarter of let's 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.720
 to do is to preheat our 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.720
 oven 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.600
 and we're going to flour and grease our 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.740
 mold so that it is ready at the time of 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.350
 that our cake is already 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.210
 as a next step we are going to soften 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.260
 our butter for it we're going to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.870
 take to the microwave oven is 10 to 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.090
 15 seconds 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.340
 so that it is manageable as 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.130
 next step we will add in the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.530
 flour 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.620
 previously sifted we will add the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.940
 tablespoon 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.940
 of baking powder 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.860
 and we are going to mix them and we are going to reserve 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.330
 this mix since we perform the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.550
 butter is going to look like this 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.170
 Now let's move on to the next step 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.430
 next step is to take our milk 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.430
 condensed in a bowl 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.999
 and then we will add the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.109
 butter that we already have previously 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.799
 softened 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.799
 and we are going to beat 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.560
 once we incorporate 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.229
 butter and condensed milk 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.280
 let's add the eggs one by one 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.280
 and we will continue to beat 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.470
 incorporated we are going to add little by little 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.480
 our flour that we had already 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.550
 previously with the oven to the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.550
 Baking powder for baking 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.750
 little by little until it 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.019
 perfectly incorporate all 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.019
 ingredients 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.200
 and once it has been incorporated into 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.590
 this way we are going to also add the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.870
 quarter cup of evaporated milk 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.050
 and we are going to mix perfectly all 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.300
 the ingredients 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.640
 well once we have the mixture it 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.620
 go this way and it's ready and 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.620
 Now you have to take it to the mold that 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.230
 we had previously floured and with 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.910
 butter so we can take it to 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.590
 bake well and since we place it now 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.080
 if in the mold now we are going to 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.160
 take to bake 20 to 25 minutes to 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.920
 350 degrees so let's wait and see 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.430
 also and since the bread came out and this one 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.770
 decorate with a little cream of that 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.230
 they sell to decorate cakes and 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.060
 strawberries and I stay this way then I 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.310
