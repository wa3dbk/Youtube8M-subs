00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 bild we are back at the start and we 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.820
 Show yourself today as you your mini 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.210
 Potato Cannon improved to show 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.350
 just as we have such a gastank 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.180
 to tinker or what does we make tinker 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.439
 take it from a bar lighter and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.920
 Build it on the one just holds it directly 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.789
 so if he can do a nail 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:35.460
 and the mini potato gun and what 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:41.399
 at the front shortly under the barrel a go on 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.860
 We'll press the magazine a little bit again 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.050
 get out and take one for example 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.690
 Shish kebab around the hole 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.289
 enlarge 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:56.210
 the hole must be so big that this 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:02.219
 Nice part also his bar lighter 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 through fits so that too a bit 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.409
 push it far that is the looks then 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.450
 like this 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.799
 maybe a little bit further there 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.970
 then something needed that for you 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:21.330
 does not hurt so much 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:23.400
 then you take such a rubber hose the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.380
 Should also be in a bar lighter inside 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:34.100
 be there and put this on this 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.360
 whole should look like this 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.060
 and then he takes in smaller ones 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.060
 Rubber hose also available 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.890
 should be and put him in the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.720
 Greater so that holds an airtight 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.649
 connections then you take that 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.479
 second rubber hose cuts that 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.670
 other end of hose straight and 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.750
 there is the bigger one again 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.750
 rubber hose over it 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:19.310
 taken a little bit further 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:23.360
 then you put this end on the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.910
 gas and push the hose so far 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.520
 in the bigger that he is right in front 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.130
 This opening is the two things 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.250
 Now you've got it together 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.470
 the hot glue gun and stick this one 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.950
 on 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.290
 So this part so that no gas 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.250
 can escape and give you valuable power 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.400
 lost is really nice 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.260
 so that airtight is now correct 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:02.420
 nice high so that's not part 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:05.660
 may slip is so wonderful now 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.520
 hip wait again he him 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.310
 have been waiting and your glue 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.580
 cured is take the gas tank 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.420
 and we glue that down here now 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.570
 different pipe then just take it 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.980
 again the hot glue gun makes beautiful 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:31.900
 glue on autogas tank only times so 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.900
 a bit so nice in the middle 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:44.900
 first so that you have to know 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:50.780
 pushes the whole just that should also 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:54.260
 Bit of what looks like then glued 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.420
 you still a little at it 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.420
 the pages that is right firmly 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.570
 wonderful the whole looks like this 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:21.590
 that's the way it fits 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.960
 functional but with it the whole 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.890
 looks a bit more beautiful 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.350
 Let's shorten the hose 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.740
 Just do it again 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.750
 off and the shares from watching how long the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.920
 have to be 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.470
 then cut the hose on the hose 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.510
 right length for a bit longer white 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.800
 never what comes 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.290
 So you should just a little bit more 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.980
 what can cut off then we are stuck 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:55.000
 they go back up a bit and so on 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.000
 plug it in again 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:05.900
 wonderful then we come to a test 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.910
 this object is that of myself 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.710
 So there are still almost there how to 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.290
 such a long lever from one 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.000
 Shashlik skewer you can also 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.910
 easily build yourself by the 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.070
 on the other lever sticks and old one 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.940
 Riflescope Let's see there is 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.500
 maybe even a video for the test 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.460
 just open up the whole one stop 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.310
 ball in as usual again 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.370
 then operate properly 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.190
 we the lever for as 45 seconds had 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.680
 try out 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:44.620
 23 45 and then 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.600
 and nav whole works but also with 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.130
 de or data center, he found 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.810
 just sprayed in so very briefly 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.770
 dior bit and then pulls the trigger 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.280
 or he does it again 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:01.090
 little air comes in and pushes that 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.030
 also has great taste I hope that 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.760
