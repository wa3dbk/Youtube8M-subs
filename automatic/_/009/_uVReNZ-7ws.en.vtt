stand with the wheel portion right and
align<00:01:31.609> with<00:01:31.639> this<00:01:31.909> pulley<00:01:32.389> right<00:01:32.719> here<00:01:34.810> so

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.749 

right<00:01:39.409> back<00:01:39.709> the<00:01:39.859> locks<00:01:40.069> off<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.340> little<00:01:40.609> bit

keep<00:01:53.210> an<00:01:53.360> eye<00:01:53.510> on<00:01:54.290> this<00:01:54.590> alignment<00:01:55.070> right<00:01:55.190> here

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
keep an eye on this alignment right here

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.170 
keep an eye on this alignment right here
making<00:01:57.860> sure<00:01:58.070> this<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.430> right<00:01:58.730> now<00:01:58.910> it's<00:01:59.060> too

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
making sure this is right now it's too

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.540 
making sure this is right now it's too
far<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.420> way<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.140> I'm<00:02:00.230> going<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.440> give<00:02:00.590> a

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
far that way so I'm going to give a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.170 
far that way so I'm going to give a
couple<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.420> turns<00:02:02.690> with<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.200> side<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:05.000> I'm

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
couple of turns with this side and I'm

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.240 
couple of turns with this side and I'm
looking<00:02:05.450> over<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.720> with<00:02:05.810> my<00:02:05.990> my<00:02:06.530> eye<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.070> can

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
looking over it with my my eye so I can

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.000 
looking over it with my my eye so I can
see<00:02:07.660> I'm<00:02:08.660> still<00:02:09.080> too<00:02:09.290> far<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.500> way<00:02:09.680> so<00:02:09.830> I'm

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
see I'm still too far that way so I'm

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.330 
see I'm still too far that way so I'm
going<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.190> loosen<00:02:10.400> this<00:02:10.670> one<00:02:10.730> a<00:02:11.180> little<00:02:11.540> bit

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
going to loosen this one a little bit

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.800 
going to loosen this one a little bit
tighten<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:15.820> there<00:02:16.820> we<00:02:17.000> go<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.480> now<00:02:17.630> it's

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
tighten this one there we go so now it's

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.770 
tighten this one there we go so now it's
aligned<00:02:18.520> now<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.610> put<00:02:19.790> your<00:02:19.820> locks<00:02:20.120> off<00:02:20.360> just

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
aligned now you put your locks off just

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.320 
aligned now you put your locks off just
