00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
there if you look closely it actually

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.670 
there if you look closely it actually
looks<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.010> has<00:00:50.220> glitter<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.680> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
looks like it has glitter on it and the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.520 
looks like it has glitter on it and the
