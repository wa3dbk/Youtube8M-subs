 a cisa thp turbo high pressure embossed 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:12.570
 308 indicates the rear of the novelty of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 the engine hood 16 16 valves with the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.660
 public and direct injection 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 fruit of the partnership of aps when mw 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.410
 the turbocharged engines represents the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.660
 immediate future 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.140
 who has more power and consumes less 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.019
 fuel exhausted from where the system 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.059
 if the direct connection that is and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.370
 direct fuel injection system 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.890
 is played directly in the camera 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.489
 then it's a one-day engine. 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.140
 you need a low comparison as well 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.460
 high in order to have an income 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.070
 best 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 in the case of the peugeot 308 the turbo version 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 thp serves to further consolidate 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.190
 image of a winning model 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.160
 market representativeness until hp is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.170
 a top-of-the-line configuration that together 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.840
 with its beautiful features 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.430
 internal finishing and more 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.320
 that showcase role of a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.080
 modernity to the model line 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.630
 French thanks to the good dose of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.170
 equipment and to the competent 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.020
 thp engine mechanic is a combination that 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.900
 allows less gas consumption and a 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.659
 extra dose of vitality and averages and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.750
 high rotations capable of claiming any 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.780
 addicted to cars before being 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.900
 sportsmanship the turbo today is a great 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.210
 ally of fuel consumption play 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.400
 directly into the combustion chamber year 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.320
 passes through collectors already plays directly 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.270
 to ii where it has a power gain as well 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.600
 higher than other engines 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.090
 the chp pushes 408 as if it were a 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.880
 light hatch giving the sensation to the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.350
 drivers of at least one year of 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.290
 2.0 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.649
 The 408 griffe is equipped with the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.700
 Efficient 1.6 Injection Turbo Booster 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.570
 direct 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.210
 the thp also exquisite team 508 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.569
 automatic transmission linked to 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.970
 the luxury sedan comes full of technology and 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.630
 equipment 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.500
 as a good sport the weight rcz brings 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.840
 under the hood the efficient 1.6 thp engine that 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.520
 guarantees ripped and resumed 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.710
 nervous speed 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.140
 just press the accelerator to 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.200
 feel the power of the wire 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.810
 the citroen ds3 takes advantage of its appeal 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.320
 very gently and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.370
 agility in trading and uses a 1.6 thp 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.850
 with the same calibration as I see 3008 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.740
 400 and another to the engineering of these cars 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.380
 ensures that the performance of this engine 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.600
 should be in the development of several 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.240
 components for the purpose of reducing 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.490
 friction generating savings 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.490
 fuel and very low emission of 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.400
 pollutants in the atmosphere is already an engine 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.930
 the euro5 pollution standard as well 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.880
 developed with louis - wants that well 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.410
 engine to learn those standards. 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:15.470
 pump is piloted fuel pump 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.360
 piloted water pump and one 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.330
 that where they have practically no 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.760
 off friction of the moving parts of it 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.000
 internal is practically nothing so he 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.850
 engine and high technology also 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.580
 engines and hp allows fast accelerations 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.170
 with final speed and agility 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.140
 in the resumes 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.980
 especially in the event of overruns 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.980
 on the road 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.870
