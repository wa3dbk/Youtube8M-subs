00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.570
 hello in this tutorial I'll teach you to 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.309
 make these mini paper hearts that 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.870
 you can use them to accompany and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.269
 decorate your gifts in this valentine 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.690
 if you want to learn how to make them chÃ©cate 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.690
 this video 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.199
 for this tutorial we are going to occupy a 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.650
 sheet size letter of the color you want 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:28.009
 a rule a scissors and why not a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.009
 pencil 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
 we start by taking the sheet and we put the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.030
 rule at the top let's do 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.500
 marks every two centimeters in this 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.940
 occasion I nothing else I will do until 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.710
 the six centimeters because I will not do 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.570
 so many hearts even though you can 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.239
 follow along the entire sheet 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.340
 we take the rule to the bottom and 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.940
 we repeat that same procedure for 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.940
 that side 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.320
 then join each part of brands with one 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.450
 straight line 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.870
 and cut the leftover strips with your 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.870
 scissors 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.870
 that yes we must have strips of 2 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.240
 centimeters thick we are going to work 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.800
 with one of these to start what 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.750
 We will be divided into three parts 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.550
 same but this time I 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.100
 I recommend that we look at them for more 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.350
 precision so let's position the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.350
 rule there and we're going to make a mark to 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.810
 the 9.5 centimeters 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.620
 then we take the right end of the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.160
 pull towards that brand 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.660
 and we mark very well the fold then 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.130
 we do the same for the extreme 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.470
 left but instead of taking it to the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.320
 mark we make it to the extreme right of 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.670
 this way as for is in the video 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.530
 come to extend it you should realize 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.990
 that we have our strip divided into 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.939
 three parts 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.009
 now with our scissors we are going to 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.430
 cut over the marks that are now 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.310
 folds 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.650
 having these resulting strips we are going to 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.710
 work with one of these what we will do 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.020
 will be to take the lower right tip that 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.899
 is this to take to the top 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.840
 what we will do is have a way of 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.360
 triangle 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.360
 Once there we mark the fold very well 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.110
 we take that same triangle as 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.420
 reference and what we will do 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.530
 bend it inwards do not forget 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.530
 mark the fold well 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.130
 we do the same as the previous time 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.700
 we take the triangle and bend it towards 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.099
 in 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.400
 remember do not forget to mark well the 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.400
 fold 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.660
 and basically that's all we have 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.240
 to do go bending the triangle towards 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.290
 in does this same process up 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.290
 end with the strip 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.439
 and in total we should have this a 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.209
 triangle and a tab this tab we 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.980
 it's going to be useful now, look at what 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.980
 next what we will do is make 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.959
 diagonal cuts on that tab to 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.630
 to be able to make almost our triangle 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.360
 can close well 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.570
 then we fold this tab towards 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.570
 in 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.470
 we have to notice that in the extreme 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.830
 right is to say on the diagonal no haiga 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.200
 leftovers if it's like that cuts the unfolded 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.330
 in the tab and note that at the same time 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.709
 a little abrupt the triangle will give you 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.230
 mind that it looks like a small 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.840
 little bag that is where I am here 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.030
 as to nip the flange nail 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.130
 we have left, we are going to put it in that 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.460
 sachet making sure that it is what 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.920
 more tense possible 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.360
 and this is our base figure a triangle 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.670
 turn it and with the nail of your thumb 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.560
 push in when you do this 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.250
 you will realize that we have a way of 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:01.140
 hubei and that's how it is here I turn to you 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.140
 repeat the procedure but slow 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.969
 ready we have the base figure now 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.310
 rotate it and now here comes the most 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:15.640
 important at the tips of our 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.560
 way and we're going to treat them later with 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.289
 our scissors are going to cut in shape 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.230
 of half a circle so that we can do 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.600
 that our heart has form 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.180
 and ready and have your first corazoncito 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.430
 of paper and that's how it should be seen 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.810
 put it aside and repeat this same 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.310
 procedure for the amount of 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.310
 hearts you want to make 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.120
 if you like you can make several colors 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.530
 like the ones I just did for 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.530
 can insert them in a little 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.780
