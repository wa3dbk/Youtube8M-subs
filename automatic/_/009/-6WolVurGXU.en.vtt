that<00:01:07.689> way<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.409> best<00:01:08.710> thing<00:01:09.009> about

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
that way the best thing about

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.960 
that way the best thing about
paragliding<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.600> adventure<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.670> play<00:01:12.670> with

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
paragliding the adventure the play with

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.929 
paragliding the adventure the play with
the<00:01:13.180> gravity<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.750> forces<00:01:14.649> a<00:01:15.040> long-distance

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
the gravity the forces a long-distance

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.690 
the gravity the forces a long-distance
ride<00:01:16.509> or<00:01:16.900> some<00:01:17.350> acro<00:01:17.740> moves<00:01:17.979> it's<00:01:18.220> it's<00:01:18.520> a

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
ride or some acro moves it's it's a

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.330 
ride or some acro moves it's it's a
little<00:01:18.820> bit<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.270> everything<00:01:19.659> if<00:01:20.620> I<00:01:20.860> wasn't<00:01:21.100> a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
little bit of everything if I wasn't a

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.110 
little bit of everything if I wasn't a
paraglider<00:01:21.880> pilot<00:01:22.540> I<00:01:22.780> would<00:01:23.229> be<00:01:23.380> an<00:01:23.440> astronaut

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
paraglider pilot I would be an astronaut

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.930 
paraglider pilot I would be an astronaut
would<00:01:25.120> be<00:01:25.300> nice<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.659> fly<00:01:25.870> that<00:01:26.110> high<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.380> see

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
would be nice to fly that high to see

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.390 
would be nice to fly that high to see
the<00:01:27.940> earth<00:01:28.120> from<00:01:28.450> outside<00:01:28.810> see<00:01:29.620> how<00:01:29.799> little<00:01:30.010> we

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
the earth from outside see how little we

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.120 
the earth from outside see how little we
are<00:01:30.520> in<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.880> big<00:01:31.090> universe<00:01:31.690> my<00:01:32.650> favorite

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
are in the big universe my favorite

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.060 
are in the big universe my favorite
trick<00:01:33.430> it's<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.970> connection<00:01:34.360> trick<00:01:35.200> between<00:01:35.740> a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
trick it's a connection trick between a

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.789 
trick it's a connection trick between a
Mesa<00:01:37.060> flip<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.780> helicopter<00:01:38.440> two

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
Mesa flip and the helicopter two

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.580 
Mesa flip and the helicopter two
different<00:01:39.310> movements<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:41.049> other<00:01:41.200> one<00:01:41.440> is

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
different movements and the other one is

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.500 
different movements and the other one is
probably<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:42.280> infinity<00:01:42.820> tumbling<00:01:43.299> which

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
probably the infinity tumbling which

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.320 
probably the infinity tumbling which
where<00:01:44.290> we<00:01:44.440> pass<00:01:44.740> over<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.760> middle<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.119> the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
where we pass over the middle of the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.630 
where we pass over the middle of the
glider<00:01:46.770> multiple<00:01:47.770> times<00:01:48.040> it's<00:01:48.400> quite

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
glider multiple times it's quite

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.420 
glider multiple times it's quite
powerful<00:01:48.940> in<00:01:49.600> synchro<00:01:50.409> flying<00:01:50.710> I<00:01:50.860> love<00:01:51.159> that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
powerful in synchro flying I love that

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.660 
powerful in synchro flying I love that
there<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.360> partner<00:01:52.990> in<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.409> air<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.920> I

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
there is a partner in the air and I

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.030 
there is a partner in the air and I
really<00:01:54.970> have<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.330> breathe<00:01:55.630> together<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.770> feel

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
really have to breathe together to feel

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.240 
really have to breathe together to feel
each<00:01:57.189> other<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.810> have<00:01:58.960> an<00:01:59.080> exact<00:01:59.470> plan<00:01:59.650> how

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
each other and to have an exact plan how

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.300 
each other and to have an exact plan how
to

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.310 
to
from<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.670> choreography<00:02:02.360> probably<00:02:03.200> my

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
from the choreography probably my

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.020 
from the choreography probably my
favorite<00:02:03.770> sing<00:02:04.070> for<00:02:04.280> trick<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.670> doing<00:02:05.000> a

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
favorite sing for trick is doing a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.550 
favorite sing for trick is doing a
mirror<00:02:05.659> spiral<00:02:06.350> like<00:02:07.310> both<00:02:07.820> pilots<00:02:08.560> spiraling

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
mirror spiral like both pilots spiraling

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.110 
mirror spiral like both pilots spiraling
to<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.860> same<00:02:10.099> direction<00:02:10.429> but<00:02:10.700> on<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
to the same direction but on the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.360 
to the same direction but on the
opposite<00:02:11.510> side<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.020> we<00:02:12.770> can<00:02:12.950> get<00:02:13.130> really

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
opposite side and we can get really

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.750 
opposite side and we can get really
close<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.910> each<00:02:13.970> other<00:02:14.180> at<00:02:14.810> super<00:02:15.620> high

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
close to each other at super high

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.630 
close to each other at super high
sinking<00:02:16.760> speed<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.300> 20<00:02:17.840> meter<00:02:18.830> per<00:02:19.160> second

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
sinking speed like 20 meter per second

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.080 
sinking speed like 20 meter per second
we<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:19.819> even<00:02:20.120> touch<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.660> gliders<00:02:21.110> and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
we can even touch the gliders and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.880
