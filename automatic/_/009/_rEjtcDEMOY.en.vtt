00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
 We'll dab it dry and right out

 The serving will be the whole thing 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.340
 with rosemary and lemon bit 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.289
 garlic still comes with the marinade 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.390
 turn and then we push them 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.380
 you're the one with red onions now 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.720
 ingredients and I'm preparing this now 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.610
 meat first and then but then 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.869
 I have a little something already 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.340
 I have prepared the knob hole 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.380
 played this is a garlic solo 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.660
 is quite practical because he has a lot 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.280
 garlic without a lot of frozen then have 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.929
 we have a bio lemon here 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.759
 So then need 8 x we need 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.700
 the skin is a little bit off the skin 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.170
 and of the juice we are the red ones 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 onion though just that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.250
 piece we just cut out ours 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.590
 Skewer and I start now that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.630
 i just put the rosemary sugar here 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.630
 just look for the needles down so 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.349
 if that's enough for you and there 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:21.920
 everyone went through a few knives and made 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.920
 a little smaller next 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:32.329
 and there we are rubbing live from the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.329
 lemon the bowl calmly neat 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:46.919
 a lemon installations in the area 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:03:08.159
 drama because we are therefore easy 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:03:12.739
 could express a tablespoon and then 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.739
 but she is still solo 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:30.300
 Next comes the finely chopped one 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:32.780
 rosemary and then you would want it all 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.780
 through 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.750
 and that's the marinade for 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.720
 our long not the next chance 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.350
 and now we are cutting ourselves 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.350
 nice pieces of it 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.769
 welcome 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.769
 at the start 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.380
 to the spit and here are all 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.709
 grow for a few hours and the 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.060
 then you just run the spit 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.989
 then comes a piece of the red 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.760
 onion and another piece of land that 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.410
 then reaches a chance small fine 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.350
 PortiÃ¶nchen thereby close of 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.250
 put together and then it goes on 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.780
 I still have the marine one now 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.380
 bit spiced with pepper and salt 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:35.790
 they're gonna spit on them now 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:38.460
 The skewers are now deleted 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.410
 brushed and banal is now 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.389
 of course, all this solid 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.889
 I still wanted ingredients 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.150
 only the taste of the liquid 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.430
 that's why on the 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.630
 Grated garlic that would be necessary 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.650
 if we had used it fully 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.940
 that has been too much 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.560
 that's why just the 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.940
 taste of two beach come that 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.169
 We have now released the meat 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.880
 marinate for half an hour now 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.400
 put that in the refrigerator and so long 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.210
 then comes on the handle the last 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.340
 for half an hour in the refrigerator 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.560
 You can already marinate in the office 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.560
 pre-heated direct heat 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.580
 So we are our skewer the 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:20.150
 come now simply directly on the 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.910
 grill and that the lamb is 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.030
 It does not take long 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:29.080
 two minutes from each side longer 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.080
 should not need it 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.970
 not in any case ever 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.970
 delicious I can confirm confirm 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.510

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.710
 After two minutes, I'll do it once 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.710

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.980

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.120
