00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 last week or leave actors katie 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:14.370
 you are we are not at one 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:16.560
 little hairspray Blesdijke but free 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:23.850
 little changes I already had the feeling of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.710
 Today it happened and go train 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 it had given me a one for 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.660
 game so I had a good one for it 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.990
 profession 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.060
 [Music] 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.060
 [Applause] 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.030
 [Music] 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:50.260
 yes yes he said that i am everywhere too 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.059
 settle 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.530
 so I do feel out of further 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.530
 but to sit 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.670
 worked long before and then dreamed 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.670
 film so they have this beautiful state 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.100
 [Music] 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.200
 [Applause] 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 [Music] 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.130
 immersion is with you 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.870
 [Music] 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:29.680
 Yes 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:33.940
 which extends inward to the cross and 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.430
 then you hear the ball shoot the brilliant 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.700
 in 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.500
 [Music] 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.969
 a competition with not too many chances 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.929
 so we already have two nice goals 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:48.340
 considering I think for yourself that you just 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.200
 everything can prove to keep 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.520
 and you know what you can and from the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.960
 quality going player 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.759
 these are only one show on Friday 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.990
 how long have lived here 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.810
 yes it is of course from an early age 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.000
 that you are busy but you feel like 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.540
 you get closer one 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.199
 never happened today 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.970
 [Music] 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.039
 [Applause] 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.340
 Yes 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.230
 have lasted but yes that is in front 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.420
 one would rather miss it a bit and 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.299
 then you behind me 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.670
 try it off the turn but laugh ball 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.200
 with any luck we have 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.980
 anyway i am lucky enough 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.720
 had today i can imitate 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.329
 I think that is important to see 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.340
 float that you just keep doing your thing 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.370
 so, in any case, still further condition 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.859
 steps we make you just psg it 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.600
 first to get it and from there 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:49.330
 oh shit okay 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.450
 [Music] 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.450
 Yes 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.000
