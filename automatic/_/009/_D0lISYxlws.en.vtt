cs6000i sewing machine again this will
be<00:00:07.589> my<00:00:07.740> first<00:00:08.059> attempt<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.330> wind<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.960> bobbin

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
be my first attempt to wind a bobbin

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.600 
be my first attempt to wind a bobbin
with<00:00:12.480> sewing<00:00:12.750> machines<00:00:13.110> they<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:14.009> thread

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
with sewing machines they have to thread

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.960 
with sewing machines they have to thread
sources<00:00:15.289> and<00:00:16.289> there's<00:00:17.220> one<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.640> goes<00:00:17.789> down

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
sources and there's one that goes down

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.730 
sources and there's one that goes down
in<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.500> area<00:00:19.500> here<00:00:20.180> they<00:00:21.180> use<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.480> bobbin<00:00:22.050> put

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
in this area here they use a bobbin put

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.620 
in this area here they use a bobbin put
some<00:00:22.920> thread<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.210> stick<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> down

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
some thread on it and stick it down

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.019 
some thread on it and stick it down
there<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.539> all<00:00:28.470> machines<00:00:29.010> are<00:00:29.250> designed<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
there so all machines are designed to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.310 
there so all machines are designed to
wind<00:00:30.689> some<00:00:31.679> thread<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.840> I'll<00:00:34.140> show

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
wind some thread on here and I'll show

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.319 
wind some thread on here and I'll show
you<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.489> like<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.520> said<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:36.030> first

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
you that like I said it's my first

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.119 
you that like I said it's my first
attempt<00:00:37.050> ever<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> we'll<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.450> goes

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
attempt ever so we'll see how it goes

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.840

is<00:00:44.969> where<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> put<00:00:45.239> your<00:00:45.420> thread<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> pull

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
is where you put your thread get to pull

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.130 
is where you put your thread get to pull
it<00:00:46.350> out<00:00:46.440> locks<00:00:47.430> into<00:00:48.030> place<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.960> want

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it out locks into place and you want

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.040 
it out locks into place and you want
your<00:00:52.320> thread<00:00:52.949> line<00:00:53.300> from<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> instructions

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
your thread line from the instructions

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.630 
your thread line from the instructions
on<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.500> side<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:58.590> wrap<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.800> around<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.370> pre

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
on this side you wrap it around the pre

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.109 
on this side you wrap it around the pre
tension<00:01:00.829> loop<00:01:01.829> over<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:05.970> you've

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
tension loop over here so then you've

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.789 
tension loop over here so then you've
got<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.360> thread<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.000> want<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.650> put<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
got your thread and you want to put the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.940 
got your thread and you want to put the
thread<00:01:14.240> from<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> inside<00:01:15.869> through<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.860> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
thread from the inside through one of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.660 
thread from the inside through one of
the<00:01:17.040> bobbin<00:01:17.369> holes

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.790 

so<00:01:23.670> we've<00:01:23.850> got<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:25.310> I'll<00:01:26.310> leave<00:01:26.520> some<00:01:26.730> extra

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
so we've got that I'll leave some extra

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.570 
so we've got that I'll leave some extra
as<00:01:28.800> we'll<00:01:29.550> see<00:01:29.910> later<00:01:29.940> what<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> does<00:01:31.490> here's<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
as we'll see later what it does here's a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.790 
as we'll see later what it does here's a
little<00:01:33.150> match<00:01:33.300> on<00:01:34.080> your<00:01:34.380> bobbin<00:01:35.300> winder<00:01:36.800> there

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
little match on your bobbin winder there

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.420 
little match on your bobbin winder there
is<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.070> also<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.430> notch<00:01:38.730> on<00:01:39.120> your<00:01:39.450> bobbin<00:01:40.370> so<00:01:41.370> you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
is it also a notch on your bobbin so you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.870 
is it also a notch on your bobbin so you
can<00:01:41.580> line<00:01:41.730> those<00:01:41.940> up<00:01:43.700> locks<00:01:44.700> into<00:01:44.910> place<00:01:46.880> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
can line those up locks into place and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.230 
can line those up locks into place and
you<00:01:48.000> push<00:01:48.300> this<00:01:48.510> entire<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:49.350> over<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you push this entire thing over so that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.030 
you push this entire thing over so that
means<00:01:54.480> the<00:01:55.200> machine<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.710> set<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:57.860> wind<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
means the machine is set up to wind a

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.980 
means the machine is set up to wind a
bobbin<00:02:00.650> instead<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:01.800> just<00:02:01.980> running<00:02:02.280> itself<00:02:02.990> so

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
bobbin instead of just running itself so

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.700 
bobbin instead of just running itself so
you're<00:02:04.050> gonna<00:02:04.170> hold<00:02:04.380> onto<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.770> string<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
you're gonna hold onto this string and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.920 
you're gonna hold onto this string and
then<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.250> press<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:09.119> turn<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.510> machine

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
then you just press you turn the machine

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.030 
then you just press you turn the machine
on<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.290> course<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:13.170> I'm<00:02:13.230> gonna<00:02:13.380> hold<00:02:13.560> on<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
on of course so I'm gonna hold on to the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:30.250 
on of course so I'm gonna hold on to the
string<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.170> press<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.890> Go<00:02:17.400> button

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.760 

then<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.380> can<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.880> cut<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.349> at<00:02:34.349> this<00:02:34.410> point

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
then you can just cut this at this point

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.420 
then you can just cut this at this point
now<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.099> there's<00:02:35.520> some<00:02:36.080> thread<00:02:37.080> on<00:02:37.260> there

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.040 

probably<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.880> best<00:02:44.360> attempt<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.600> far<00:02:45.630> to

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
probably not the best attempt so far to

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.270 
probably not the best attempt so far to
do<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.770> looks<00:02:48.800> looks<00:02:49.800> like<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.130> might

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
do this but it looks looks like it might

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.830 
do this but it looks looks like it might
work<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.489> put<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.849> machine<00:02:54.300> into<00:02:54.569> full

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
work so I put the machine into full

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:16.170 
work so I put the machine into full
speed

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.340 

so<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:18.440> looks<00:03:18.680> decent<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.870> can<00:03:20.990> just<00:03:21.140> slide

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
so that looks decent you can just slide

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:32.000 
so that looks decent you can just slide
it<00:03:21.530> over

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.830 

now<00:03:32.519> what<00:03:32.670> they<00:03:32.790> show<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.150> instructions

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
now what they show in the instructions

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.190 
now what they show in the instructions
is<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.349> want<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.769> be<00:03:34.920> pretty<00:03:35.159> uniform

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
is that you want it to be pretty uniform

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.880 
is that you want it to be pretty uniform
on<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.319> bobbin<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:39.390> looks<00:03:39.629> all<00:03:40.590> right<00:03:40.860> I

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
on the bobbin that looks all right I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.140 
on the bobbin that looks all right I
think<00:03:41.900> then<00:03:42.900> I'll<00:03:43.019> just<00:03:43.610> stick<00:03:44.610> it<00:03:44.760> in<00:03:44.849> here

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
think then I'll just stick it in here

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.020 
think then I'll just stick it in here
and<00:03:45.299> then<00:03:45.420> follow<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.080> instructions<00:03:46.879> to<00:03:47.879> do

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
and then follow the instructions to do

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.299 
and then follow the instructions to do
that
