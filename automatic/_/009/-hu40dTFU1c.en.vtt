00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello here is stop by cnet and today 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.300
 take a look at the kindle 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.630
 paperworld as you can see it 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.190
 in a completely darkened room 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.330
 So we pass the lighting of the spot 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.330
 to take a closer look 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.250
 the lighting stage of the pep work 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.369
 is now only as you can see 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.140
 the display still glows lightly 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 has the purpose that you soon too 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.750
 Can operate without external light source 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.840
 or 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.610
 The lighting can be activated there 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.989
 no own button for it also otherwise 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.690
 no link that means you have to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.100
 always go over the touchscreen with it 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 you can activate the lighting or 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.300
 can make you have no external higher 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.500
 would otherwise be difficult with source 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.160
 one tap on the corresponding one 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 symbol opens the one 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.109
 Setting menu for the lighting like 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.690
 You can see it over the regulator 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.840
 the lighting quite simply in many 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.500
 adjust levels 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:11.159
 Amazon recommend levels 1 to 5 to 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.010
 6 to read the darkness that is too 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.770
 quite enough for me personally 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.950
 he prefers level 10 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.950
 the stage 12 or 13 and the dark 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.030
 to read 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:31.200
 We just open a book and how 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.259
 you can see the text is very good 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.829
 readable want you can of course also 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.530
 whole much higher 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.119
 but that is absolute 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.240
 darkness rather exhausting for the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.240
 eyes 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.590
 in the last days and weeks with a lot 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.240
 a lot about the couple chipping that 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.670
 cot been discussed 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.329
 these are discoloration which 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.469
 unevenly across the display 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.860
 this model is also affected 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.450
 but you can see that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.280
 Different lighting levels are 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.020
 at low lighting do not scale 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.509
 too much that is felt by the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.760
 reader does not operate too much 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.450
 at least 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.920
 In principle , it is recommended for me 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.310
 to pay attention when you have a children 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.990
 has provided bz and has received 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.620
 to decide for yourself 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:29.750
 until it affects the enjoyment 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.750
 I have another device here 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.100
 It is true that the lighting 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.540
 basically quite different 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.070
 although it is the same device 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.070
 you can see clear differences 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:03:00.420
 So the left device lights something 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:02.160
 brighter which setting the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.030
 readability of both devices is, however, 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.010
 despite different presentation very 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.720
 very well 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:16.920
 even in daylight but that comes in 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:19.710
 a separate video again as well 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.310
 a comparison to the eco and putin has the 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.310
 front sorry 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.569
 that only then exists 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.450
 not to say it for lighting either 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.099
 It massively improves readability 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.900
 even in daylight in the dark 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.569
 anyway she is much more even than 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.830
 a reader not if you can see on 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.870
 lower screen edge is there 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.569
 but a shadowing the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.880
 through the leds arises in the frame 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.530
 sit of the effect, however, are 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.989
 also affected the two competitors 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.890
 the corruption of the book content front 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.110
 sorry that it is design-related and leaves 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.200
 hardly avoid the current 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.519
 devices generation 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.620
 personally it does not bother me it is 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.319
 not too strong to see and especially 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.870
 in daylight you can see the effect 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.209
 not that it was already 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.209
 in this sense until the next medium
