00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 I think you are curious but you want it 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.230
 let her stay with your mom to the girl 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:16.830
 we did this this one does not touch 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:20.010
 I will shut you up 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.840
 I went to this this floral tribute to 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 radio I wanted to show this here and one 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.020
 beautiful pineapple plant then for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.309
 watering the pineapple you can use one 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.850
 spray a typical water spray 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 like this the pineapple plants become 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.090
 really very large also the flower in 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.340
 flower until you get to the point of 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.430
 become a pineapple 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.750
 then I opened this particular 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:59.760
 episode because we live the law 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.979
 where is the river but then the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.339
 our main problem is 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:09.090
 practically flies 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.810
 then this is where plants are 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.110
 carnivore to how you see the first one already 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.549
 I don't know if this black insect will succeed 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.030
 waited here is already got the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.510
 first insettino then these are here 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.860
 plants of carnivorous plants 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.440
 carnivores are not difficult to da 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.620
 put in the house and are very useful 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.070
 just for the music and the mosquitoes the 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.750
 most aggressive of all of plants is 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.990
 this one you see also brings 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.960
 the label that so many fought for that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.880
 then the mosquito sounds you see 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.110
 practically musics and mosquitoes 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.930
 they end up on the stems on the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.530
 stems here and they are thorny and the plant 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.549
 logically it feeds on the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.160
 of its mineral salts of the gods principles 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.850
 of the various mineral salts 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.090
 insects and the same thing also does this 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.459
 this water practically attracts the fly 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.230
 inside it brings it down 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.890
 practically it is therefore the fly remains 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.260
 trapped in a system like 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.480
 but this plant is a lot here 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.630
 more aggressive than this one 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.070
 but this one I had that was 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.220
 small now always remained in the 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.560
 same vase and practically resisted 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.750
 all winter we put in the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.239
 our room where the temperature that 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.790
 waved time around 25 degrees because 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.310
 who then warms up the plant 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.790
 when he thinks so just have 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.470
 small stands then grew 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.720
 totally now you are being born of it 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.600
 of the others I always remain the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.660
 I have this water tag instead 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:14.989
 bought today because unfortunately it is 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:17.329
 died then to get more time 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.670
 therefore possible to keep them by balls 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.980
 grow because these are plants that 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.410
 they come in sizes that are exaggerated 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.340
 logically you always have to change i 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.480
 vases and to make them resist is a lot 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.700
 simple 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.090
 these plants need 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.609
 continuously of water but not direct 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.030
 you in this case you don't have to either 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.930
 water the plant from here then from the 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.130
 jar n above with a spray 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.890
 you simply need to bring a 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.790
 saucer below where you will go to 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.549
 put the water you see the marked cooked 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.400
 which is left and marked look at the water 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.530
 because now I 'm changing it 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.600
 you always have to put water in this way 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.390
 always at the same level 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.980
 always add a little water 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.920
 when you see that never 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.940
 and the plant you see resists without it 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.959
 put any type of product 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.180
 then I guarantee these plants to you 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.330
 100 percent already just two of these 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.090
 plants manage to eliminate all the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.970
 house flies because they anyway 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.040
 they do smell like us then 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:36.229
 logically we don't feel human beings but 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:41.660
 attracts all kinds of insects and ticks 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.710
 fleas ants to mosquitoes 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.289
 mosques 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.000
 etcetera etc. so on 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.039
 used these plants are not 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.650
 difficult they are absolutely not 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.780
 difficult are useful without using 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:02.570
 all those sprays that are then 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:05.690
 practically a mortuary for per 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.910
 the environment and the lungs as well as already 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:15.650
 all the cigarettes the smog that we 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:20.120
 we want to show you how much you are 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:24.770
 nice then it is then we took also 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.599
 a bit of lucky plants today 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:32.720
 we took it today I went to 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:35.030
 market the lucky plants which 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.240
 these are cloverleaf plants this fair 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.030
 they reach an exaggerated size 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.860
 I already heaven but still have to go out 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.870
 because once you buy them l 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.320
 implanted in a larger vessel 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.000
 marie dies in winter 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.470
 the period grows over the period 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.350
 vernal 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.340
 but this year there has been a lot of 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.400
 problems with 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.920
 with the temperature does, however, still 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.900
 they must leave I bought 3 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.920
 these are beautiful plants that they are 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.690
 lucky plants that I would like to dedicate 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.100
 to all those who in this 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.100
 moment they are watching 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:29.720
 we are these become beautiful and great 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:31.190
 tomorrow in the expected invasion 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:43.330
 I don't want to disconnect that I want to do a 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:47.060
 unique voila to these mo logically 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.910
 tend to flood tend to open 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:54.710
 then frameworks tend to become 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:59.180
 full tend to close practically 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:01.340
 by day and open in the afternoon i 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:06.670
 I recommend they don't want an exhibition 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:11.690
 in the direct sun they don't like it either 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:14.180
 so a my shadow and this 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:18.080
 and 46 you absolutely don't have to put them 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.630
 in the sun these betray this one 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.140
 light the brightness so 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:27.070
 ok bye bye to you all happy sunday and in 

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.070
 good luck
