00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 controversial brochure on the schools of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:22.680

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:37.020
 here in this pamphlet I 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.059
 serafinomassoni I denounced even then 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.610
 because we were the infamous in 2003 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.800
 creative writing schools 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.539
 five years have passed 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.989
 meanwhile the writing schools 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.730
 creative are multiplied like 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.690

 this Anglo Pakistani novelist who 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:58.520
 says that if we 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:05.360

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:20.209
 if you enter creative writing the entry in 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.769
 English the entries in English becomes non 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.870
 more than 18 million in English therefore 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:31.250
 putting the voices in English 18 million 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:38.989

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:42.319
 French and German and then also from 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.220
 other parts of the world and you are not wrong 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:50.959
 to say that we are in this world of ours 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:55.099
 between 30 and 40 million schools of 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:59.599

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:01.760
 writing schools that arrive in Italy 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.870
 it seems that now it seems that schools 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.959
 of creative writing are 11 thousand i 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.739
 friars it is as if there were one in each 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.299
 common one in each municipality when one does not 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.940
 knows what to do 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:21.170
 opens a creative writing school but 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.690
 let's see what he says to the correspondent 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.660
 guido old saints our good 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.549
 Pakistani corner novelist hanif 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:36.350
 kureishi says that in quotes between 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:39.889
 quotes the students make cano keys 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.750
 to become successful authors and not yes 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:47.380
 manages to convince them that an illusion 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:55.130
 somehow using the word 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:58.190
 creating creative we deceive them among 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.420
 quotes we deceive but it does not end 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.150
 here second years also c 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.340
 university courses of courses 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.290
 university 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.760
 creative writing is the new 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.910
 psychiatric hospitals are the new ones 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.449
 psychiatric hospitals 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:24.270
 then the creative writing courses 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:29.620
 are the new psychiatric hospitals where 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:32.380
 we deceive the internees where we deceive 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:38.639
 internet interned 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:42.700
 this is to say so complete 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:47.979
 the various videos that I have already dedicated to 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:52.030
 issue is particularly dedicated to 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:54.340
 our novelist Alessandro Baricco that 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.370
 opened a writing school 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.830
 creative in turin or writing 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.630
 there is another name but the purpose is the 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.949
 same school 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:10.780
 in Turin the holden school and what time now 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:15.210
 has become wrote a one doll 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.580
 so a book that comes out in files for 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.220
 I think the de agostini is entitled 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.830
 write comes out in files and is the 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.539
 daily the republic that sells it 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.770
 every week at newsstands 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:31.660
 I don't know if these files have 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.639
 already ceased to be published it is not 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.539
 I know however it is a sensational initiative 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:40.630
 that started a few months ago here 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.479
 we continue to deceive young people with 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.120
 creative writing schools 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:49.180
 this is a great shame at last 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.130
 my voice is now supported by 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.250
 authority of this great 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.590
 great global novelist who 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.550
 we know little in Italy for the 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.880
 novel the buddha of the suburbs and loved ones 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.370
 friends 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.210
 stay away from the schools of 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.849
 creative writing and we say that there 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.610
 have already taught to write in 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.610
 five years of elementary school 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.900
 in the three years of lower secondary school 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.449
 in the five years of middle school 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.060
 superior and then for those who did the 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:24.689
 humanities faculties in the four or five 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:28.530
 years of university studies and already in the 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.629
 high school already studying at university yes 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.389
 he studies as he wrote yesterday's dance 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:35.069
 as the Petrarch wrote as like 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.620
 wrote Alessandro Manzoni as 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:40.050
 he wrote shakespeare and how they wrote i 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.879
 various institutes 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.770
 which in their day certainly not 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:46.680
 they had creative writing schools 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:50.029
 this too is a good one too 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.810
 big business and everything is done in the name 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:56.430
 of human solidarity because yes 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.969
 wants to do good 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:02.580

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:06.719
 courses creative writing schools 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:11.159

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:20.279
 creative writing schools evening dinner o
