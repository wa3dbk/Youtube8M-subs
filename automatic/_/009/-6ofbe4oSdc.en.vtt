00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello, how are you people? 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.819
 I missed and I know you guys to me good 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.649
 you do not, but I do, I know 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.690
 that there is nothing new here back but 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.969
 guess what is new exact my 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.969
 calzones so true the intro here is 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.220
 is inspired by our favorite series 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.739
 the simulators although I am the only 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.540
 I see her all my good friends 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.950
 Well, this blog is going to risk me 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.750
 go to remove because I'm going to rape 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.550
 many rights I'm not going to use 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.769
 sexually of them but I'm going to 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.750
 break the rules 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.910
 of this video from commercials those 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.070
 things that you do not see because you already change him 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.560
 channel when they start if that and there 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.810
 different commercials from wipes 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.570
 with wings from toilet paper from 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.450
 detergents for whatever announce whether 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.500
 I sell you this cap more or if it serves to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.490
 put on ships or cover your mouth like 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.860
 seriously this can sell any 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.670
 thing but well let's do something that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.259
 It will be great 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.180
 next they will see a commercial 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.700
 original and how we did it 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.350
 I hope you like it and here goes to the first 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.940
 commercial is from the brand power e 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.259
 that is, fart with that brand only 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.729
 threw in the water everywhere but that 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.640
 they even have in the mouth doing the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.140
 sport a bon moves but was cast in 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.210
 water throughout the body except in the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.670
 mouth here a parenthesis was editing 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.550
 the video that is 5 o'clock in the morning and not 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.170
 I have not slept at all 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:54.560
 in your look and I noticed something I looked 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.930
 40 spots of paoletti none comes out 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.460
 spills the dread of in the body in the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.560
 shirt or did they make me some 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.180
 idiot or I'm an idiot and now I 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.860
 they made it look like an idiot but in 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.890
 end let's follow the true athletes 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.800
 they take power but we are not 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.320
 true sportsmen we only take the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.050
 neat pub we look good mop and 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.790
 we exercise at night or if you shoot 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.720
 ts power of the face 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.090
 power port and emits glasses to our no 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.550
 is tecate forgiveness other commercial honor 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.710
 It is a product that is used to cure 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.190
 blows and there has to come out a little face 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:35.450
 screaming 1 second parenthesis because 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.030
 nobody has a commercial of 1 nobody 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.010
 they are all parodies or pages so 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.320
 let's continue like this without the commercial of honor 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.410
 it does not matter here more or less like 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.410
 is 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.189
 this is a brand of toilet paper 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.170
 these two partners who lie down in a 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.209
 strip of paper and the paper says it is 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.920
 super tough that bears can and 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.599
 us that as we are a little more 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.250
 thin that bears good my friends 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.049
 I'm not good or we decide 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.680
 to lie down paper try it here is 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.680
 our result 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.780
 7 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.170
 little friends now follow something for the 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.400
 women the female towels that's 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.020
 discrimination because there are towels 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.510
 female I never heard towels 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.550
 male well we finally discussed that 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.050
 there is a commercial that they say that all 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.420
 they are in their days but they bring that 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.250
 wipe and this wipe is not filled 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.080
 I do not know what or just know that those wipes 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.670
 they always fill them with jimson 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.380
 because they do not do that they can not 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.390
 throwing him in samui on his nails 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.010
 and here more or less as it is those 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.540
 commercials guess who of us 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.130
 is in subtle and also of all and we 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.130
 We feel that comfortable because you know 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.150
 who of the two is in his days but 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.070
 it turns out that both but with the new 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.810
 cotec salitas with varnish that no longer 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.500
 we will be in our days but 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.500
 we just have one 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.109
 marked foundations 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.810
 but what to check the paper 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.040
