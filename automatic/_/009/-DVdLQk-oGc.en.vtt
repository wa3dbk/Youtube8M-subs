and<00:00:40.460> what<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:41.120> did<00:00:41.360> was<00:00:41.540> I<00:00:41.690> just<00:00:41.750> cut<00:00:42.110> it<00:00:42.200> off<00:00:42.380> and

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
and what I did was I just cut it off and

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.970 
and what I did was I just cut it off and
then<00:00:43.390> I<00:00:44.390> used<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:46.300> hot<00:00:47.300> poker<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.980> melted

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
then I used a hot poker and melted

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.279 
then I used a hot poker and melted
through<00:00:49.250> two<00:00:49.489> holes<00:00:49.519> in<00:00:50.120> behind<00:00:50.929> this<00:00:51.109> here

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
through two holes in behind this here

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.770 
through two holes in behind this here
which<00:00:51.530> you<00:00:51.620> can't<00:00:51.829> see<00:00:51.920> right<00:00:52.070> now<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:52.780> that's

which you can't see right now and that's

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.220 
which you can't see right now and that's
what<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:53.989> lashed<00:00:54.350> in<00:00:54.620> my<00:00:55.480> hair<00:00:56.480> for<00:00:56.510> three<00:00:56.960> and
