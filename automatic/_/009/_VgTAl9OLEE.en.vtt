00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
is right now on medium heat and that's

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.950 
is right now on medium heat and that's
exactly<00:01:51.740> how<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.860> we're<00:01:52.190> gonna<00:01:52.280> keep<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.960> and

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
exactly how a we're gonna keep it and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.690 
exactly how a we're gonna keep it and
all<00:01:54.110> we're<00:01:54.260> gonna<00:01:54.380> do<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.770> just<00:01:55.190> keep<00:01:55.430> stirring

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
all we're gonna do is just keep stirring

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.610 
all we're gonna do is just keep stirring
it<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.180> with<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.600> heat<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.020> sugar<00:01:57.050> is<00:01:57.440> going

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
it and with the heat the sugar is going

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.590 
it and with the heat the sugar is going
to<00:01:57.680> start<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.980> melt<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:58.370> when<00:01:59.150> it<00:01:59.240> does<00:01:59.390> it'll

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
to start to melt and when it does it'll

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.770 
to start to melt and when it does it'll
coat<00:01:59.870> the<00:02:00.050> almonds<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:01.760> process<00:02:01.970> does<00:02:02.540> to

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
coat the almonds so this process does to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.980 
coat the almonds so this process does to
the

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.170 
the
it<00:02:03.170> melts<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:03.500> sugar<00:02:03.799> as<00:02:04.040> well<00:02:04.070> as<00:02:04.640> toast<00:02:04.970> the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
it melts the sugar as well as toast the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.310 
it melts the sugar as well as toast the
almonds<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:05.720> want<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.899> make<00:02:05.990> sure<00:02:06.140> you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
almonds so you want to make sure you

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.109 
almonds so you want to make sure you
stir<00:02:06.560> continuously<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.610> almonds<00:02:07.970> get

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
stir continuously so the almonds get

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.199 
stir continuously so the almonds get
toasted<00:02:08.569> evenly<00:02:09.399> now<00:02:10.399> as<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.610> sugars<00:02:10.910> getting

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
toasted evenly now as the sugars getting

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.699 
toasted evenly now as the sugars getting
hot<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.390> can<00:02:11.660> see<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.050> starts<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.530> melt

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
hot you can see that it starts to melt

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.150 
hot you can see that it starts to melt
and<00:02:13.520> becomes<00:02:14.330> liquid<00:02:14.920> now<00:02:15.920> we're<00:02:16.010> going<00:02:16.099> to

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
and becomes liquid now we're going to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.180 
and becomes liquid now we're going to
keep<00:02:16.280> stirring<00:02:17.560> now<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.650> course<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.010> more

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
keep stirring now of course the more

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.610 
keep stirring now of course the more
sugar<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.550> use<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.569> more<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.989> will<00:02:21.170> coat<00:02:21.410> to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
sugar you use the more it will coat to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:34.690 
sugar you use the more it will coat to
the<00:02:21.650> ominous<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:33.650> now<00:02:33.769> we<00:02:33.830> see<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.280> illness<00:02:34.489> is

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
out and some of these almonds are going

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.880 
out and some of these almonds are going
to<00:02:43.940> stick<00:02:44.120> together<00:02:44.269> into<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.840> clump<00:02:45.140> but<00:02:45.709> once

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
to stick together into a clump but once

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.320 
to stick together into a clump but once
it<00:02:46.040> cools<00:02:46.220> down<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.459> can<00:02:46.760> always<00:02:46.880> break<00:02:47.180> them

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
it cools down you can always break them

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.660 
it cools down you can always break them
apart
