00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.150
 children 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.699
 Get up early to work, you need to 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.240
 face chaos in public transport 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.360

 Good and old bakery work place 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.540
 You're there, and you feel different. 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.660

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.579

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.489

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.010
 most of your time standing when you sit 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.379
 has only a small old bank but 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.469
 joaquim soares the bakery owner does not 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.420
 likes to see your status including boto 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.210
 poor is to work doing the function 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.090
 From others 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.260
 but he can not claim his salary 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.540
 depends on this bakery but currently the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.090
 things are not going very well 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.670
 development comes the debts 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.810
 increase and joaquim needs to start 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.000
 cut employees cut off from here 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.850
 But I used it, it's safe. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.890
 joaquim called him and gave the good news 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.780
 also said that his work would 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 two hours a day 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.579
 Saturday and Sunday and would do 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.619
 pasta baking breads and stirring 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.979
 cutting machines you've always found 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.290
 complicated but he is happy was not 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.909
 dismissed and in the end that's what matters 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.420
 Is not it 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.530
 when I would start tomorrow without even 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.250
 having a training without knowing if it would be 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.250
 fit 1 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:05.940
 and there went his ze in the boil of the first 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.380
 day of work without knowing where 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.460
 begin 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.630
 without knowing how to operate with much work 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.350
 to do 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.790
 could your cef take care of everything 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.790
 This must have hurt.
