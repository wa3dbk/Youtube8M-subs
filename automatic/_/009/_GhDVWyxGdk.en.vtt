00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 one of the most basic properties 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:10.080
 it is the ceiling and ceiling insulation too 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.099
 here said that the ceiling is insulated 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.019
 expanded clay 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.809
 in fact, expanded clay is normal 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.230
 the substance is just foamed clay 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.930
 but the fact is that bricks are usually made 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.910
 from quality clay and for expanded clay 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
 clay is suitable as if any 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.460
 and just manufacturers sometimes take 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.550
 poor clay in which there is still 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.350
 other components and that's just the case 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.010
 if expanded clay is made of such 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.040
 poor quality clay then it can 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 meet gases up to radon but 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.000
 if expanded clay is made on normal 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.079
 factory on the brick of the same clay from 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.110
 which make benign 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.719
 full brick is quite normal 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.820
 environmentally friendly material and here's 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.109
 the village master offered to fall asleep 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:02.030
 expanded clay here is the ceiling space 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.409
 here also the attic space 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.920
 They said that he expanded clay there on the bayonet 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.960
 shovels 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.630
 well really why then you mixed with 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.930
 sawdust that's what I think is done 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.810
 wrong because in the steam room 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.270
 a large amount of steam but at the end 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.420
 ends passes through the ceiling and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.030
 rises in the attic layer of insulation and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.040
 that's where steam just makes negative 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.150
 he starts things 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.579
 moisten sawdust and sawdust improve their 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.220
 thermal conductivity that is if there were 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.549
 just us ipadian claydite then it was 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.369
 would be better because the filings being 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:49.549
 helping from steam they start better 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.549
 conduct heat and insulate worse
