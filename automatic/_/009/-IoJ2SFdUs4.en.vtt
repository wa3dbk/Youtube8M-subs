00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.549
 most recently we are there or creating 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.830
 updated version of android and this one 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.110
 wonderful moment came we waited 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.440
 thanks to the cooperation of us play and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.590
 google world saw a new sweet version 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.529
 android 4 4 kitkat which now 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.270
 available to all nexus stanzas given 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.269
 update in our opinion is 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.180
 quite controversial for the first time nexus device 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.279
 got different versions of the update 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.869
 many features that are available on nexus 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.070
 five 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.770
 unrealized damaging device 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.180
 This experience is more typical for the gadget 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.030
 on ios platform 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.860
 but don't try the angle for more 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.719
 adequate assessment of the new platform 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.090
 recommend you install hidden 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.219
 this version of the launcher that we saw 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 in the new nexus 5 links for it 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.390
 downloads are in the description under 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.250
 video after launch settings 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.539
 it is necessary to check the box opposite 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.850

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.280
 from dating with updated google us 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.460
 now this is the last desktop left 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.650
 as earlier spotlight melted it became 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.200
 a bit more functional it 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.520
 there was one interesting feature 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.369
 if in voice search settings 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.470
 choose english we will appear 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.299
 the ability to use voice to run 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.240
 Search team ok google 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.259
 as well as on command okay jarvis m as in 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.009
 iron man ok google 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.009
 robert douni junior 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:40.619
 as you see it fulfills your request 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.979
 absolutely no touch of name 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.540
 device disappeared tab view to 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.670
 Now to install the widget you need 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.550
 make a long tap on the screen after 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.100
 what to install you are interested in here 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.110
 You can also install and wallpaper in principle 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.690
 the situation has not actually changed 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.670
 installation of wallpaper is similar 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:05.009
 Oke of the previous version completely redraw 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.220
 interface like this is the color of the panel icons 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.970
 notification changed from blue to white 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.830
 the navigation bar now has 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.160
 transparent substrate that will create 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.840
 the impression that the screen has become larger 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.480
 quick on racks can now turn on 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.840
 or turn off location display 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.239
 device from the lock screen disappeared 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.489
 Widget enable them can be settings 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.540
 also in the settings we see a new item 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.180
 stamp 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.970
 This feature allows you to print photos and 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.000
 documents wirelessly using only 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.739
 your android device is another funny 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.739
 feature are tetra 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.049
 if we talk about the program then change 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.390
 Got an embedded fingal messenger 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.519
 now it replaces the application itself 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.260
 better reshaped interviews and 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.269
 lots of funny emoticons 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.269
 it became much more convenient to use it 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.489
 also redrawn the clock application 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:15.879
 changed alarm function 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:18.069
 which became much more beautiful in the end 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.290
 we have quite controversial but very 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.959
 interesting and functional updates 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.549
 systems left to wait for the moment when 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.190
 most manufacturers 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.190
 strip your devices android kitkat
