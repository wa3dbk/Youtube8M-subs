00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.179 
lean that it's a good idea to drizzle
the<00:01:59.640> ribs<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> stick<00:02:00.619> with<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> little<00:02:02.009> bit<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the ribs on a stick with a little bit of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.920 
the ribs on a stick with a little bit of
olive<00:02:02.579> oil<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.240> don't<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.570> dried<00:02:03.899> out

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
olive oil so they don't get dried out

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.109 
olive oil so they don't get dried out
and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.189> season<00:02:05.490> them<00:02:05.850> with

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
and then I like to season them with

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.900 
and then I like to season them with
kosher<00:02:06.630> salt<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.439> pepper<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.580> by<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.729> way

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
kosher salt and pepper and by the way

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.240 
kosher salt and pepper and by the way
