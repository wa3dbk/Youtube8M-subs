three shapes that I have

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.630 
three shapes that I have
they<00:03:11.750> are<00:03:12.050> extremely<00:03:12.850> creamy<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.270> pigmented

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
they are extremely creamy and pigmented

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.699 
they are extremely creamy and pigmented
they<00:03:16.640> do<00:03:16.910> glide<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.390> easily<00:03:17.660> on<00:03:18.230> your<00:03:18.260> lips

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
they do glide on easily on your lips

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.520 
they do glide on easily on your lips
also<00:03:21.709> all<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.430> packaging<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.420> they<00:03:24.110> come<00:03:24.350> in

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
also all the packaging that they come in

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.580 
also all the packaging that they come in
this<00:03:24.680> is<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.920> recent<00:03:25.130> packaging<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:27.290> think

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
this is a recent packaging that I think

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.710 
this is a recent packaging that I think
I<00:03:27.680> will<00:03:27.860> fail<00:03:28.130> or<00:03:28.430> has<00:03:28.940> changed<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.510> packaging

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
I will fail or has changed the packaging

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.780 
I will fail or has changed the packaging
so<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.350> is<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.590> packaging<00:03:31.130> it's<00:03:31.610> like<00:03:31.760> a

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
so this is the packaging it's like a

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.650 
so this is the packaging it's like a
click<00:03:32.150> pen<00:03:32.570> on<00:03:33.190> packaging<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:34.850> this<00:03:35.360> is<00:03:35.510> the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
click pen on packaging so this is the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.690 
click pen on packaging so this is the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.680 
bullets in it and just push it in like
that<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.860> closes<00:03:42.860> don't<00:03:43.700> you<00:03:43.820> want<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.180> when

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690

you want to open it to again click that

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.160 
you want to open it to again click that

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
and then pull it out so this I would say

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.780 
and then pull it out so this I would say
is<00:03:51.440> not<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.980> very<00:03:53.769> travel<00:03:54.769> friendly<00:03:55.280> packaging

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
is not a very travel friendly packaging

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.789 
is not a very travel friendly packaging
because<00:03:56.360> sometimes<00:03:56.780> what<00:03:57.019> happens<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.440> even

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
because sometimes what happens is even

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.789 
because sometimes what happens is even
though<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.010> might<00:03:58.970> just<00:03:59.180> close<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.720> click<00:04:00.650> it

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
though I might just close it click it

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.190 
though I might just close it click it
shut<00:04:01.130> press<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.090> button<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.510> then<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:02.870> put<00:04:03.110> it

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
shut press the button and then I put it

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.890 
shut press the button and then I put it
in<00:04:03.320> my<00:04:03.470> bag<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:03.920> just<00:04:04.130> opens<00:04:04.489> up<00:04:04.670> on<00:04:04.940> it

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
in my bag and it just opens up on it

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.699 
in my bag and it just opens up on it
so<00:04:06.709> I<00:04:06.739> do<00:04:06.950> not<00:04:07.160> like<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.670> packaging<00:04:08.709> because

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709
