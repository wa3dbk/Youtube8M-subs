00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
hello this is a KJ got skilled in and I

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.330 
hello this is a KJ got skilled in and I
have<00:00:04.350> an<00:00:04.500> update<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:04.950> my<00:00:05.310> chain<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.850> guess<00:00:06.980> so<00:00:07.980> um

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
have an update on my chain I guess so um

on July 15 I showed you that I got Diana
and<00:00:13.980> then<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.610> little<00:00:15.059> after<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.929> think

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
and then a little after that I think

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.490 
and then a little after that I think
about<00:00:16.560> I'll<00:00:17.250> say<00:00:17.550> two<00:00:17.609> weeks<00:00:18.180> ago<00:00:18.420> or<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.410> week

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
about I'll say two weeks ago or a week

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.670 
about I'll say two weeks ago or a week
ago<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.130> got<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.640> new<00:00:20.880> filter<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.689> used<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.380> have

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
ago I got a new filter I used to have

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.160 
ago I got a new filter I used to have
right<00:00:23.580> there<00:00:23.789> like<00:00:24.060> where<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> plant<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.900> it

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
right there like where the plant is it

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.000 
right there like where the plant is it
used<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.680> covering<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.250> whisper<00:00:26.970> 40<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.010> felt

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
used to be covering a whisper 40 I felt

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.250 
used to be covering a whisper 40 I felt
up<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.880> realized<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.599> isn't<00:00:31.080> enough

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
up but I realized that isn't enough

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.910 
up but I realized that isn't enough
since<00:00:31.890> now<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.520> two<00:00:33.180> turtles<00:00:34.020> too<00:00:34.320> lovely

since now I have two turtles too lovely

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.610 
since now I have two turtles too lovely
turtles<00:00:35.309> idea<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> got<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.989> fluval

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
turtles idea so that I got the fluval

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.860 
turtles idea so that I got the fluval
305<00:00:38.460> canister<00:00:39.090> filter<00:00:40.070> if<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.520> look<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.660> can

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
305 canister filter if you look you can

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.709 
305 canister filter if you look you can
see<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.670> text<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.030> dirty<00:00:45.480> right<00:00:45.690> now

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
see on the the text just dirty right now

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
see on the the text just dirty right now
because<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.320> were<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.649> fitting<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.430> it's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
because they were just fitting so it's

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.670 
because they were just fitting so it's
still<00:00:48.059> cleaning<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:50.960> move<00:00:51.960> move<00:00:52.379> move

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
still cleaning but the move move move

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.970 
still cleaning but the move move move
okay<00:00:53.190> i'll<00:00:53.879> go<00:00:54.120> from<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.350> see<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
okay i'll go from this you can see the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.330 
okay i'll go from this you can see the
output<00:00:56.579> um<00:00:57.469> nozzle<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> right<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.100> that's

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
output um nozzle is right there that's

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.420 
output um nozzle is right there that's
and<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.030> has<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:01.079> um<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:02.399> think<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.449> output<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
and it has it's um I think the output is

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.850 
and it has it's um I think the output is
240<00:01:05.630> gallons<00:01:06.630> per<00:01:07.080> hour<00:01:07.170> i<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:09.439> input<00:01:10.439> no

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
240 gallons per hour i think input no

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.859 
240 gallons per hour i think input no
switches<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.549> think<00:01:12.020> 180<00:01:13.020> m<00:01:13.500> gallons<00:01:14.250> per<00:01:14.460> hour

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
switches I think 180 m gallons per hour

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.539 
switches I think 180 m gallons per hour
and<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.310> nice

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and it's it's just a really really nice

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.020 
and it's it's just a really really nice
filter<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.299> show<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:19.100> inside<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.430> cabinet

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
filter if I show you inside the cabinet

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.870 
filter if I show you inside the cabinet
here<00:01:21.740> this<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> actual<00:01:23.520> filter

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
here this is what the actual filter

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.810 
here this is what the actual filter
looks<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:25.909> now<00:01:26.909> inside<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.659> filter<00:01:28.439> come

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
looks like now inside this filter come

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.420 
looks like now inside this filter come
on<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.540> first<00:01:30.840> layer<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.530> um<00:01:32.329> this<00:01:33.329> white

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
on the first layer it's um this white

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.969 
on the first layer it's um this white
bacteria<00:01:35.430> I'm<00:01:35.869> removal<00:01:36.869> stuff<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
bacteria I'm removal stuff and on the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.280 
bacteria I'm removal stuff and on the
second<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:39.030> half<00:01:39.930> carbon<00:01:40.650> half<00:01:40.979> um<00:01:42.290> that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
second it's half carbon half um that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.960 
second it's half carbon half um that
white<00:01:43.680> back<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.159> their<00:01:44.369> stuff<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
white back to their stuff and on the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.780 
white back to their stuff and on the
very<00:01:45.119> bottom<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:45.990> carbon<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
very bottom it's all carbon and the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.760 
very bottom it's all carbon and the
thing<00:01:48.000> about<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.470> three

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
thing about which is so it's three

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.380 
thing about which is so it's three
layers<00:01:50.009> hence<00:01:50.689> fluval<00:01:51.860> 305<00:01:53.030> but<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.240> nice

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
layers hence fluval 305 but it's a nice

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.240 
layers hence fluval 305 but it's a nice
filter<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.049> doesn't<00:01:55.409> take<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.590> too<00:01:55.950> much

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
filter and it doesn't take up too much

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.420 
filter and it doesn't take up too much
room<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.909> i<00:01:57.270> figured<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.810> also<00:01:58.110> um<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:59.100> little

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
room and i figured it's also um a little

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
room and i figured it's also um a little
um<00:01:59.790> i<00:02:00.210> would<00:02:00.420> recommend<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:00.990> book<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
um i would recommend this book to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.410 
um i would recommend this book to
because<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.189> ear<00:02:02.399> I'm<00:02:02.640> filters<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
because the ear I'm filters with the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.080 
because the ear I'm filters with the
same<00:02:03.600> power<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.380> are<00:02:04.680> three<00:02:05.579> hundred

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
same power as this are three hundred

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.119 
same power as this are three hundred
dollars<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.320> three<00:02:07.740> hundred

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
dollars and this is not three hundred

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.430 
dollars and this is not three hundred
dollars<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.000> actually<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.629> much<00:02:10.140> better

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
dollars this is actually a much better

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.350 
dollars this is actually a much better
deal<00:02:10.770> than<00:02:10.830> those<00:02:11.280> filters<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.540> think<00:02:12.870> it's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
deal than those filters and I think it's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.180 
deal than those filters and I think it's
it<00:02:13.690> may<00:02:13.840> even<00:02:13.870> do<00:02:14.260> better<00:02:14.470> than<00:02:14.740> those<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.980> a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
it may even do better than those of a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.980 
it may even do better than those of a
very<00:02:15.400> heavy<00:02:15.730> duty<00:02:16.240> filter<00:02:17.230> made<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.590> Germany

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
very heavy duty filter made in Germany

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.390 
very heavy duty filter made in Germany
like<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.110> said<00:02:20.290> before<00:02:20.410> it's<00:02:20.740> not<00:02:20.830> too<00:02:21.160> big<00:02:21.340> it's

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
like I said before it's not too big it's

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.740 
like I said before it's not too big it's
