it's a great way to let the horses burn
off<00:01:06.150> some<00:01:06.390> steam<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.440> them<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
off some steam to get them out on the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
off some steam to get them out on the
lunge<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.480> good<00:01:09.720> walk<00:01:09.990> trot<00:01:10.260> and

with<00:01:24.829> suppleness<00:01:25.829> with<00:01:26.430> balance<00:01:27.110> which

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
with suppleness with balance which

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.179 
with suppleness with balance which
basically<00:01:29.130> increases<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> horses<00:01:31.189> basic

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
basically increases the horses basic

the horse whilst you're on the floor
sometimes<00:01:37.500> when<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:37.770> riding<00:01:37.950> our<00:01:38.280> horses

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
sometimes when we're riding our horses

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.819 
sometimes when we're riding our horses
all<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.759> time<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.079> chance<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.649> take

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
all the time it's a good chance to take

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.249 
all the time it's a good chance to take
a<00:01:40.860> step<00:01:41.159> back<00:01:41.430> into<00:01:41.969> view<00:01:42.210> our<00:01:42.390> horses<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a step back into view our horses and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.230 
a step back into view our horses and
seeing<00:01:43.799> how<00:01:43.979> they're<00:01:44.159> working<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:45.119> could

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
seeing how they're working you could

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.469 
seeing how they're working you could
also<00:01:45.390> test<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.259> they're<00:01:46.469> found<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
also test to see if they're found and

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.319 
also test to see if they're found and
maybe<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.680> saddle<00:01:50.130> didn't<00:01:50.909> fit<00:01:51.149> or

maybe if you your saddle didn't fit or

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
maybe if you your saddle didn't fit or
your<00:01:51.479> saddle<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:51.960> being<00:01:52.229> repaired

your saddle was being repaired

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
your saddle was being repaired
it's<00:01:53.219> also<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.549> good<00:01:53.700> way<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:54.030> exercising<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
it's also a good way of exercising the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.480 
it's also a good way of exercising the
horses<00:01:55.170> without<00:01:55.259> actually<00:01:55.860> having<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.250> ride

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
horses without actually having to ride
