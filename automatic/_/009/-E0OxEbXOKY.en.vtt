 If I do not win, I'll take it anywhere 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.240
 of my subscribers and they bet 46,900 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.269
 for now, bets are already accepted 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.219
 because it 's a weird microphone fact 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.809
 It's worth when you give it to the volume and it goes down 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.290
 well here a little but it does not matter 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.000

 We are 10 people worth 5 eyes 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.930
 I do not think it will be first but good 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.820
 it was overtaking me run out of it 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.850
 that I'm supported and I'm overtaken by 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.430
 here we are going to see is worth you here let me 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.380

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.979
 ok I'm going quarter here one falls 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.440
 fact that everything is hit 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.100
 are all google 2 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.470
 here it's okay I 'm going fifth fifth fifth 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.450
 position so that in correspondence with 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.110
 the triumph is not bad person does not 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.800
 leave 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.980
 over here I'm in fifth position over here 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.890
 one remains a Balearic player go from the 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.890
 week of Athens is worth it here 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.429
 the stoplights fall worth quarter 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.680
 position here is worth now has to 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:15.470
 come god god or chose the point 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.080
 I have the point and I'm going from 0 to the point and 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.440
 I'm going third so be careful 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.470
 that I can stay in by position as 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.730
 says by position or site polbo depends 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.430
 from a rather strange name after I 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.870
 they say fury is worth more and in English 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.940
 but if I say it of pronouns I know 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.540
 how it is said perfectly 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.270
 I studied at harvard harvard hahaha 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.690
 in harvard and you know you 're worth we're going to 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.240
 avenge third position is worth the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.700
 first it takes me quite advantage 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.230
 first it takes me a lot of advantage but 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.610
 the second one I have here in front and 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.100
 being second among ten people me 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.980
 I think it's pretty good, 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:00.940
 come with the slipstream it's worth now it comes 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.940
 here something more or as little 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.850
 okay come on I got it right I've 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.550
 I picked it well I chose it quite well 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.560
 back to the fingers let's hope that 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.430
 this is the first subscriber that goes 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.439
 winning 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.359
 have a little bit of failure because the 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.040
 true that they are going to butt with the cope what 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.670
 we have there in front 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.719
 with a point from the front fury a 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.380
 bit crazy crazy crazy okay here 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:34.450
 as a valentine and in front of me 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.490
 as courageous and you in front of miracle of 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.960
 how it's worth we're going now fury 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.790
 you can on the straight we had a good time 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.360
 good good good good well good here 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.220
 well I'm going in second position and now I do not 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.120
 damn damn stick to scare 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.730
 with me to the navel 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.590
 It's worth little stick, it's not possible 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.610
 thrusts can not be run like that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.380
 pushing it between us impossible 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.180
 because what we do is a career 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.260
 Aguadilla a career attic in the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.480
 that none of us will win because 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.280
 cities or so it would be a race 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.350
 that would not be clean we have to do 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.720
 a clean career is worth 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.150
 look you see now you fall and I fall 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.010
 I say the triangle because we are not going 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.390
 to be able to leave and then I'm going to leave 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.030
 before you because you gave before 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.530
 triangle that supposedly 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.310
 supposedly I'm going second perfect 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.290
 Look see other times bid well perfect and 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.940
 he does not leave me if they do not leave me I will not be able to 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.130
 and the first one in the night goes a lot 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.230
 Advantage brings us many advantages 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.800
 guarantees 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.580
 ok let's go here we go there 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.160
 drunk a crazy is worth here 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.010
 well fine very well 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.520
 well now another looping has to come 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.450
 Here it is worth a little further 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.290
 to the right now to the right 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.610
 the truth that I'm doing a good 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.560

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.070

 or for or for or for or for me 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.080
 OK, here we are going to see 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.100
 over here we can not continue we can not 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.800

 well good good instead of winning 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.400
