00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hi everyone, many of you asked me 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.799
 to talk about related issues 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.559
 to the summer season that hit i 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.630
 our dogs our cats will start at 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.839
 then a series of videos where I will discuss 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 some issues I did in the past 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.140
 a video that you will see appear in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.779
 overlay on solar dermatitis 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.920
 who can then devolve incarcerate are 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.510
 cell in white cats if you want 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 click directly on the video in 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.899
 network overlay brought to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.960
 video and of course that too does 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.050
 part of the summer issues in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.800
 this video I want to tell you about the delle 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.649
 abrasions of the foot pads of the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.680
 our dogs that happen very often 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.090
 when the owner takes a walk 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.500
 your dog during the summer 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.050
 on the asphalt on our roads in the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 our cities are very problematic 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.450
 frequent because very often it occurs 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.420
 forget that the paw in exchange for a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.530
 cat is nothing but a foot one 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.479
 our hand so it is true that they are 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.270
 a little more resistant than ours 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.729
 for our hands, however, try to walk 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.500
 on the asphalt three in the afternoon 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:29.280
 these days and you will see how hot it is 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.220
 and how hot they are then feet are the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.400
 our dogs are obviously not made 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.630
 they are not robots and therefore hearing the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.270
 same temperature and therefore very often 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.890
 after a walk they form their own 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.700
 from abrasions on the foot pads 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.100
 and in cases 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.990
 also gifts also come to bleed 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.329
 these foot pads 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.880
 so obviously be careful 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.450
 you have to try to avoid the extra hours 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.630
 hot 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.189
 this is a suggestion 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.200
 trivial that technically everyone 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.619
 they should know but it is not always so 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.410
 discounted however I want to add also 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.780
 another thing if you try at 8am 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.640
 9 at night to try to hear again 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.459
 the asphalt you will see that the asphalt still 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.709
 very very hot so mine 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.890
 advice is possibly to do 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.780
 walk the dogs early in the morning 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.099
 because in short all night he has 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.010
 certainly the asphalt cooled a little 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:34.130
 I would completely avoid the walk 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.890
 in the street I would bring the dog directly 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.769
 on a stage on the ground of land or 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.720
 grass where they are much cooler for 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.140
 avoid these abrasions but I understand 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.880
 that for large dogs a little a 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.500
 more complicated though for dogs than 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.599
 small and medium size and terena 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.230
 walk in the streets 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:57.500
 I repeat if you really want to make it do the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.920
 early morning maybe in the evening 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.690
 at 9 o'clock thinking the sun no longer beats 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.720
 so it's less hot because the asphalt 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.050
 still very hot 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.360
 this we say is a suggestion though 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.240
 let's say when the abrasions come 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.860
 what to do then surely in 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.440
 trade there are creams 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.140
 however, contact your vets 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.350
 trust and ask for the best first 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.970
 that they advise you to soothe let's say 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.220
 these abrasions and avoid obviously 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.080
 that then on these forecasts can be 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.100
 also create infections 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.180
 another advice are those of 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.520
 try to wet your feet I will have to 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.520
 short walks to look for 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.270
 cool feet that have walked 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.959
 on these hot coals the asphalt 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.530
 in the iii and summer another council 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:00.440
 they are the ones to wear shoes 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.680
 eventually even if I repeat first 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.140
 you get to make the wearing of 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.150
 shoes let's say just avoid it 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.040
 walk on the asphalt I would take them to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.620
 panic however there are on the market for the 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.340
 shoes that obviously are like le 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.600
 so our shoes don't create 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.220
 abrasions 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.799
 I repeat, be very careful because 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.440
 they repeat a trivial thing to say though 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.760
 even today you can see lots of dogs 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.020
 who are walking 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.480
 in summer it is actually 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.820
 when the asphalt reach of the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.100
 really very high temperatures is like 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.350
 walking on hot coals also for 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.280
 the dogs that seem to have feet 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.230
 very resistant another thing to 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.970
 conclude this video is to 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.320
 obviously we are talking about the 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.990
 then abrasions created by the asphalt 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.210
 obviously there is a medical history there 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.730
 reports that the dog has walked are 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.740
 asphalt on a very hot surface 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.290
 because obviously that's not all 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.000
 abrasions obviously correspond to 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.440
 there is also this kind of problem 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.770
 more complicated problems like 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.080
 eventually the wall units they can give 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.000
 of abrasions and injuries then 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.580
 even more simply than bearings 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.770
 in me that an abrasion of the bearings e 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.550
 to force something to contact one 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.320
 sunburn 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.080
 obviously in this case we are 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.570
 talking about the classic walk that 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.520
 you do it during the summer time you come back 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.710
 from the walk 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.190
 the dog comes into the house and you see that 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.560
 just hurt your feet and looking 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.690
 when you look at the paw, you see these 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.210
 abrasions these injuries 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.120
 here in that case there is obviously one 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.760
 quite simple diagnosis and yes 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.729
 use normal creams that 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.219
 portray the 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.020
 the paw they obviously allow of 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.749
 avoid worsening the situation is 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.650
 also remove the painful component 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:58.270
 of an abrasion 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.409
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.409
 see you next time
