00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
but if you zoom out you don't really

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.220 
but if you zoom out you don't really
notice<00:03:31.700> it

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
notice it

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.479 
notice it
see<00:03:33.519> but<00:03:35.320> I'm<00:03:36.320> going<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.590> keep<00:03:36.769> trying<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.250> get

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
see but I'm going to keep trying to get

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.640 
see but I'm going to keep trying to get
it<00:03:37.640> even<00:03:38.120> there<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:41.120> course<00:03:41.390> because<00:03:42.320> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
it even there of course because the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.700 
it even there of course because the
Klimas<00:03:43.070> actually<00:03:43.459> don't<00:03:43.670> make<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.940> good<00:03:44.120> job

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.500 

so<00:03:51.710> keep<00:03:51.980> going<00:03:52.190> forever<00:03:52.400> though<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:53.330> know
