00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
options you can only take one and if you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.110 
options you can only take one and if you
were<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> say<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.980> don't<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.370> you'd<00:00:56.969> be

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
were to say you don't know you'd be

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.639 
were to say you don't know you'd be
correct<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> thing<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.109> for

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
correct because the thing is for

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.740 
correct because the thing is for
comparing<00:00:59.129> apples<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.609> oranges<00:00:59.730> what<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.539> want

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
comparing apples to oranges what we want

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.380 
comparing apples to oranges what we want
to<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.379> want<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> convert<00:01:02.190> them<00:01:02.340> both<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to do is we want to convert them both to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.630 
to do is we want to convert them both to
apples<00:01:03.840> see<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:04.650> Apple<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> bigger<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
apples see which Apple is bigger and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.539 
apples see which Apple is bigger and
then<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.090> course<00:01:06.119> choose<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.380> bigger<00:01:07.619> Apple

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
then of course choose the bigger Apple

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
then of course choose the bigger Apple
how<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.240> gonna<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.720> well<00:01:10.020> with

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
how are we gonna do this well with

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.640 
how are we gonna do this well with
interest<00:01:11.070> rates<00:01:11.570> let's<00:01:12.570> say<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.290> added

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
interest rates let's say if we added

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.130 
interest rates let's say if we added
additional<00:01:13.770> information<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.820> 5%<00:01:16.400> interest<00:01:18.140> at

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
additional information of 5% interest at

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
additional information of 5% interest at
a<00:01:19.200> bank<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.650> course<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.490> high<00:01:21.119> at

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
a bank of course this is really high at

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.609 
a bank of course this is really high at
the<00:01:21.390> moment<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:21.810> interest<00:01:22.229> rates<00:01:22.350> are

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the moment because interest rates are

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
the moment because interest rates are
low<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.189> we're<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.520> gonna<00:01:23.640> use<00:01:23.850> 5%<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
low but we're just gonna use 5% in this

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.370 
low but we're just gonna use 5% in this
example<00:01:25.670> well<00:01:26.670> we're<00:01:26.970> gonna<00:01:27.119> take<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> $100

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
example well we're gonna take the $100

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.340 
example well we're gonna take the $100
and<00:01:28.710> we're<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> invest<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:31.079> one

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and we're going to invest it for one

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.710 
and we're going to invest it for one
year<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.329> mathematically<00:01:33.329> it'll<00:01:33.540> look

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
year and mathematically it'll look

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
year and mathematically it'll look
something<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.680> we're<00:01:35.400> gonna<00:01:35.520> take<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
something like this we're gonna take the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.410 
something like this we're gonna take the
$100<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.079> then<00:01:38.070> we're<00:01:38.280> gonna<00:01:38.369> multiply<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:39.030> by

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
$100 and then we're gonna multiply it by

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.980 
$100 and then we're gonna multiply it by
1<00:01:39.869> plus<00:01:40.939> 0.05<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.240> I'll<00:01:42.329> explain<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
1 plus 0.05 and I'll explain what you

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.870 
1 plus 0.05 and I'll explain what you
what<00:01:43.380> each<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.799> these<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
what each of these are so this is the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.679 
what each of these are so this is the
present<00:01:45.450> value<00:01:45.680> amount<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.689> one

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
present value amount of what we have one

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.010 
present value amount of what we have one
is<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.229> our<00:01:49.409> initial<00:01:50.090> investment<00:01:51.090> because

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
is just our initial investment because

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.830 
is just our initial investment because
of<00:01:52.140> course<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.920> use<00:01:53.420> 0.05<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.750> would

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
of course if we just use 0.05 it would

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.569 
of course if we just use 0.05 it would
only<00:01:54.960> give<00:01:55.259> us<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> interest<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.159> want<00:01:56.369> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
only give us the interest we want to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.780 
only give us the interest we want to
have<00:01:56.880> our<00:01:57.119> initial<00:01:58.110> capital<00:01:58.829> plus<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
have our initial capital plus the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
have our initial capital plus the
interest<00:02:00.270> back<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:03.469> initial<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
interest back so this is the initial and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.910 
interest back so this is the initial and
this<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.909> interest<00:02:06.570> portion<00:02:07.380> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
this is the interest portion and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.430 
this is the interest portion and
together<00:02:08.599> that's<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> give<00:02:10.020> us<00:02:10.229> our

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
together that's going to give us our

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.559 
together that's going to give us our
future<00:02:11.190> value<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:11.970> compare

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
future value so we can compare

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.270 
future value so we can compare
apples<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.200> apples<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.010> multiplying<00:02:14.519> 100<00:02:15.120> by

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
apples to apples so multiplying 100 by

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.720 
apples to apples so multiplying 100 by
1.05<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.819> going<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.329> yield<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:19.519> hundred<00:02:20.519> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
1.05 is going to yield a hundred and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.759 
1.05 is going to yield a hundred and
five<00:02:21.090> dollars<00:02:21.329> so<00:02:21.659> of<00:02:21.749> course<00:02:21.930> now<00:02:22.499> that<00:02:22.530> we

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
five dollars so of course now that we

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.289 
five dollars so of course now that we
can<00:02:22.920> compare<00:02:23.249> apples<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.639> apples<00:02:23.730> we<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.180> see

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
can compare apples to apples we can see

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.539 
can compare apples to apples we can see
that<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.659> is<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.349> bigger<00:02:25.530> Apple<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.400> we're

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
that this is the bigger Apple and we're

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.869 
that this is the bigger Apple and we're
going<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.879> choose<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.209> or<00:02:28.400> $100<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.639> the

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
going to choose that or $100 in the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.959 
going to choose that or $100 in the
present<00:02:30.389> day<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.750> course<00:02:31.469> and<00:02:32.189> I<00:02:32.670> should<00:02:32.819> also

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
present day of course and I should also

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.270 
present day of course and I should also
say<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.689> the<00:02:33.840> time<00:02:34.079> value<00:02:34.439> of<00:02:34.469> money<00:02:34.560> concept

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
say that the time value of money concept

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.339 
say that the time value of money concept
helps<00:02:35.909> us<00:02:36.000> determine<00:02:36.359> what<00:02:36.719> a<00:02:36.780> cash<00:02:37.019> flow<00:02:37.200> is

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
helps us determine what a cash flow is

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.979 
helps us determine what a cash flow is
worth<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:38.040> either<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.459> present<00:02:38.879> day<00:02:39.030> which<00:02:39.870> I

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
worth in either the present day which I

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.780 
worth in either the present day which I
have<00:02:40.169> here<00:02:40.650> or<00:02:41.519> at<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.510> future<00:02:43.109> date<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.099> in<00:02:44.340> this

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
have here or at a future date so in this

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.780 
have here or at a future date so in this
scenario<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.540> actually<00:02:45.840> looked<00:02:46.169> at

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
scenario we actually looked at

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.550 
scenario we actually looked at
converting<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.969> to<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.180> future<00:02:48.629> date<00:02:49.049> to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
converting it to a future date to

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.470 
converting it to a future date to
compare<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.129> two<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:50.939> if<00:02:51.030> we<00:02:51.120> wanted<00:02:51.419> to

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
compare the two what if we wanted to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.319 
compare the two what if we wanted to
look<00:02:52.019> at<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.530> present<00:02:53.040> date<00:02:53.219> well<00:02:54.030> we're

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
look at the present date well we're

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.379 
look at the present date well we're
gonna<00:02:54.419> take<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.319> $100<00:02:56.189> let<00:02:56.730> me<00:02:56.909> just<00:02:57.090> get<00:02:57.209> rid

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
gonna take the $100 let me just get rid

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.890 
gonna take the $100 let me just get rid
of<00:02:57.449> this<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.889> I<00:02:59.250> can<00:03:00.090> draw<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.419> arrow<00:03:00.659> going

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
of this so I can draw the arrow going

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.629 
of this so I can draw the arrow going
the<00:03:01.079> other<00:03:01.109> way<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.980> what<00:03:02.129> if<00:03:02.219> we<00:03:02.310> wanted<00:03:02.579> to

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
the other way so what if we wanted to

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.670 
the other way so what if we wanted to
actually<00:03:02.969> have<00:03:04.099> $100<00:03:05.959> go<00:03:06.959> back<00:03:07.199> in<00:03:07.379> time<00:03:07.560> to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
actually have $100 go back in time to

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.280 
actually have $100 go back in time to
see<00:03:07.889> how<00:03:08.099> much<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.549> would<00:03:09.030> essentially<00:03:09.540> be

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
see how much this would essentially be

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.640 
see how much this would essentially be
worth<00:03:10.859> in<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.219> present<00:03:11.730> date<00:03:12.169> well<00:03:13.169> now<00:03:13.500> that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
worth in the present date well now that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.640 
worth in the present date well now that
we<00:03:13.739> know<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.010> future<00:03:14.250> value<00:03:14.879> because<00:03:15.750> we're

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
we know the future value because we're

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.099 
we know the future value because we're
in<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.829> future<00:03:16.949> technically<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:18.840> gonna<00:03:18.930> be

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
in the future technically it's gonna be

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.439 
in the future technically it's gonna be
$100<00:03:20.009> and<00:03:20.400> our<00:03:21.150> 1<00:03:21.509> plus<00:03:22.819> 0.05<00:03:23.819> is<00:03:24.209> going<00:03:24.389> to

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
$100 and our 1 plus 0.05 is going to

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.119 
$100 and our 1 plus 0.05 is going to
stay<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.750> same<00:03:24.780> since<00:03:25.199> the<00:03:25.379> rate<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.769> same

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
stay the same since the rate is the same

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.929 
stay the same since the rate is the same
and<00:03:26.370> also<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.329> initial<00:03:28.079> capital<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.489> same

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
and also the initial capital is the same

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.009 
and also the initial capital is the same
and<00:03:31.159> what<00:03:32.159> we<00:03:32.280> don't<00:03:32.489> know<00:03:32.729> is<00:03:32.939> the<00:03:33.569> present

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
and what we don't know is the present

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.170 
and what we don't know is the present
value<00:03:34.349> so<00:03:34.620> how<00:03:35.609> are<00:03:35.699> we<00:03:35.819> gonna<00:03:35.909> actually

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
value so how are we gonna actually

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.539 
value so how are we gonna actually
isolate<00:03:37.139> for<00:03:37.349> PV<00:03:37.739> well<00:03:38.009> we're<00:03:38.189> going<00:03:38.400> to

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
isolate for PV well we're going to

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.319 
isolate for PV well we're going to
divide<00:03:38.939> 100<00:03:39.840> by<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.790> bracketed<00:03:41.790> amount<00:03:42.150> so

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
divide 100 by this bracketed amount so

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.280 
divide 100 by this bracketed amount so
it's<00:03:42.479> gonna<00:03:42.569> look<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.870> PV<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.650> equal<00:03:43.759> to<00:03:45.290> 100

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
it's gonna look like PV is equal to 100

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.809 
it's gonna look like PV is equal to 100
dollars<00:03:46.560> divided<00:03:47.129> by<00:03:47.250> 1<00:03:48.090> plus<00:03:48.680> 0.05<00:03:49.819> and

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
dollars divided by 1 plus 0.05 and

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.490 
dollars divided by 1 plus 0.05 and
that's<00:03:51.120> actually<00:03:51.629> going<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.989> yield<00:03:54.500> ninety

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
that's actually going to yield ninety

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.249 
that's actually going to yield ninety
five<00:03:55.709> dollars<00:03:56.009> and<00:03:56.519> twenty<00:03:57.389> four<00:03:57.629> cents<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.079> in

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:58.259 
five dollars and twenty four cents so in

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.649 
five dollars and twenty four cents so in
the<00:03:58.379> second<00:03:58.829> scenario<00:03:58.949> we<00:03:59.729> converted<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.419> to

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
the second scenario we converted it to

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.610 
the second scenario we converted it to
the<00:04:01.500> present<00:04:02.189> day<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.479> we<00:04:03.659> can<00:04:03.810> also<00:04:03.959> see<00:04:04.379> that

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
the present day and we can also see that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.080 
the present day and we can also see that
even<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.430> present<00:04:05.790> day<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:07.889> $100<00:04:08.669> right

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
even in the present day the $100 right

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.959 
even in the present day the $100 right
now<00:04:09.329> makes<00:04:09.780> more<00:04:10.049> sense<00:04:10.349> than<00:04:10.439> taking<00:04:10.859> $100<00:04:11.789> a

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:11.969 
now makes more sense than taking $100 a

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:13.670 
now makes more sense than taking $100 a
year<00:04:12.209> from<00:04:12.329> now<00:04:12.419> so<00:04:12.719> in<00:04:12.780> both<00:04:12.930> scenarios<00:04:13.229> it's

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
year from now so in both scenarios it's

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.360 
year from now so in both scenarios it's
going<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:14.039> prove<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.729> exact<00:04:15.449> same<00:04:16.139> thing<00:04:16.919> so

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
going to prove the exact same thing so

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.999 
going to prove the exact same thing so
to<00:04:18.060> kind<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.019> summarize<00:04:19.079> everything<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.979> just

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
to kind of summarize everything I just

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.069 
to kind of summarize everything I just
wanted<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.519> show<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:20.760> we've<00:04:21.180> learned<00:04:21.840> two

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
wanted to show that we've learned two

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.990 
wanted to show that we've learned two
equations<00:04:22.740> in<00:04:23.039> this

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
equations in this

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.760 
equations in this
in<00:04:24.450> this<00:04:24.540> tutorial<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.200> first<00:04:25.260> one<00:04:25.740> is<00:04:26.040> that

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
in this tutorial the first one is that

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.340 
in this tutorial the first one is that
future<00:04:28.770> value<00:04:29.160> is<00:04:29.190> equal<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.870> present

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
future value is equal to the present

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.950 
future value is equal to the present
value<00:04:31.610> times<00:04:32.610> 1<00:04:33.000> plus<00:04:33.360> R<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.190> power<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.960> the

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
value times 1 plus R to the power of the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.660 
value times 1 plus R to the power of the
number<00:04:37.140> of<00:04:37.470> years<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.250> we<00:04:38.340> haven't<00:04:38.490> really

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
number of years and we haven't really

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.910 
number of years and we haven't really
covered<00:04:39.210> time<00:04:39.510> yet<00:04:39.780> but<00:04:39.810> we<00:04:40.140> will<00:04:40.380> cover<00:04:40.680> this

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
covered time yet but we will cover this

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.570 
covered time yet but we will cover this
part<00:04:41.250> in<00:04:41.870> following<00:04:42.870> tutorials<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.070> don't

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
part in following tutorials so don't

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.370 
part in following tutorials so don't
worry<00:04:44.760> about<00:04:44.850> that<00:04:45.120> part<00:04:45.300> right<00:04:45.570> now<00:04:45.810> the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
worry about that part right now the

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.710 
worry about that part right now the
second<00:04:46.800> one<00:04:46.920> is<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.940> present<00:04:48.390> value<00:04:48.690> is

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
second one is that the present value is

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.270 
second one is that the present value is
equal<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:50.220> future<00:04:50.610> value<00:04:51.260> divided<00:04:52.260> by<00:04:52.410> 1

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
equal to the future value divided by 1

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.390 
equal to the future value divided by 1
plus<00:04:54.090> R<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.170> course<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.590> T<00:04:55.830> will<00:04:56.010> show<00:04:56.250> up

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
plus R and of course the T will show up

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.520 
plus R and of course the T will show up
there<00:04:56.580> again<00:04:57.450> but<00:04:57.780> don't<00:04:57.930> worry<00:04:58.080> about<00:04:58.350> that

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
there again but don't worry about that

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.190 
there again but don't worry about that
for<00:04:58.680> now<00:04:58.980> as<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.580> haven't<00:04:59.940> yet<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.450> explain<00:05:00.960> that

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
for now as I haven't yet to explain that

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.580 
for now as I haven't yet to explain that
and<00:05:01.950> you<00:05:02.610> can<00:05:02.760> clearly<00:05:03.030> see<00:05:03.420> that<00:05:03.600> these<00:05:04.230> two

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
and you can clearly see that these two

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.900 
and you can clearly see that these two
even<00:05:04.830> though<00:05:04.890> they're<00:05:05.100> different<00:05:05.220> equations

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
even though they're different equations

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.490 
even though they're different equations
they're<00:05:06.480> both<00:05:06.780> just<00:05:07.730> manipulated<00:05:09.260> from<00:05:10.260> the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
they're both just manipulated from the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.240 
they're both just manipulated from the
same<00:05:10.910> variables<00:05:12.200> so<00:05:13.200> if<00:05:13.320> we<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.770> understand

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
same variables so if we you understand

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.360 
same variables so if we you understand
the<00:05:14.400> time<00:05:14.610> value<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:14.970> money<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.660> how<00:05:16.560> we're

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
the time value of money and how we're

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.520 
the time value of money and how we're
trying<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.940> convert<00:05:18.510> it<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.020> present<00:05:19.440> day

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
trying to convert it to the present day

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.670 
trying to convert it to the present day
or<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.800> future<00:05:20.070> day<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.610> compare<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.840> I'll

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
or the future day to compare and I'll

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.409 
or the future day to compare and I'll
see<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:22.919> guys<00:05:23.010> in<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.310> next<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:23.640> where<00:05:24.120> we'll

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
see you guys in the next one where we'll

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.110 
see you guys in the next one where we'll
actually<00:05:24.840> be<00:05:25.140> talking<00:05:25.560> about<00:05:25.800> or<00:05:26.610> probably

actually be talking about or probably
more<00:05:27.210> examples<00:05:27.660> from<00:05:27.750> time<00:05:27.990> value<00:05:28.320> of<00:05:28.350> money

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
more examples from time value of money

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.710 
more examples from time value of money
