would go on my pocket and I never come
out<00:05:07.650> I<00:05:07.830> just<00:05:08.040> switch<00:05:08.280> it<00:05:08.310> on<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.550> leave<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.270> I

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
out I just switch it on and leave it I

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.680 
out I just switch it on and leave it I
reckon<00:05:10.710> I'll<00:05:11.100> check<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.460> battery<00:05:11.850> one<00:05:12.480> of<00:05:12.600> it

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
reckon I'll check the battery one of it

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.340 
reckon I'll check the battery one of it
gives<00:05:12.990> us<00:05:13.080> battery<00:05:13.500> status<00:05:13.890> here<00:05:15.350> it's

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
gives us battery status here it's

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.750 
gives us battery status here it's
probably<00:05:16.530> maybe<00:05:16.800> four<00:05:17.100> or<00:05:17.130> five<00:05:17.310> hours<00:05:17.340> that

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
probably maybe four or five hours that

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.160 
probably maybe four or five hours that
expect<00:05:18.180> from<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:20.840> that's<00:05:21.840> very<00:05:22.080> interesting

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170
