this<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.619> gonna<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:05.009> nearly<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.610> job<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
this is gonna do nearly the job of the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.770 
this is gonna do nearly the job of the
slightly<00:02:07.140> smaller<00:02:07.500> style<00:02:07.890> blades<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:09.569> grip

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
slightly smaller style blades the grip

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.650 
slightly smaller style blades the grip
on<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> one<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.590> polypropylene

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
on this one and get polypropylene

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.190 
on this one and get polypropylene
has<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.460> quasi<00:02:14.460> wood<00:02:15.120> texture<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:16.080> you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
has that quasi wood texture to it if you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.620 
has that quasi wood texture to it if you
can<00:02:16.350> see<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.680> there<00:02:17.010> no<00:02:17.640> lanyard<00:02:18.120> hull<00:02:18.300> which

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
can see that there no lanyard hull which

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.060 
can see that there no lanyard hull which
i<00:02:18.750> think<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> bit<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> hit<00:02:19.470> against<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.950> I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
i think is a bit of a hit against it I

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.010 
i think is a bit of a hit against it I
just<00:02:20.670> like<00:02:20.880> having<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.210> lanyard<00:02:21.390> hole<00:02:21.540> whether

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
just like having a lanyard hole whether

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
just like having a lanyard hole whether
I<00:02:22.080> use<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.440> or<00:02:22.500> not<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.920> option<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.400> nice<00:02:25.040> will

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
I use it or not the option is nice will

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.770 
I use it or not the option is nice will
hollow<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.670> out<00:02:26.730> ditches<00:02:27.210> on<00:02:27.330> either<00:02:27.450> side

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
hollow it out ditches on either side

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
hollow it out ditches on either side
again<00:02:28.200> for<00:02:28.530> skinning<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.550> backside<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.030> your

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
again for skinning the backside of your

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.720 
again for skinning the backside of your
hands<00:02:30.390> are<00:02:30.540> gonna<00:02:31.160> fingers<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.310> whatnot<00:02:32.610> are

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
hands are gonna fingers and whatnot are

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.180 
hands are gonna fingers and whatnot are
gonna<00:02:32.820> lay<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.810> fairly<00:02:34.470> well<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.920> think

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
gonna lay in that fairly well I think

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.860 
gonna lay in that fairly well I think
that<00:02:35.370> works<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:35.730> fine<00:02:36.090> for<00:02:36.150> skinning<00:02:36.750> is

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
that works just fine for skinning is

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.980 
that works just fine for skinning is
general<00:02:37.590> intended<00:02:37.950> purpose<00:02:38.540> using<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.690> magnet
