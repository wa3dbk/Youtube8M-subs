00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
this bolt holding it all tightly now

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.530 
this bolt holding it all tightly now
after<00:00:40.980> every<00:00:41.160> use<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.879> when<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.120> buy<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> new

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
after every use and when you buy a new

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.770 
after every use and when you buy a new
washer<00:00:43.219> there's<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.309> lot<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> lot<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.940> compressed

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
washer there's a lot a lot of compressed

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.380 
washer there's a lot a lot of compressed
air<00:00:46.020> inside<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.710> pump<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> got<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
air inside the pump and if you got the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.950 
air inside the pump and if you got the
bolt<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.250> tightly<00:00:50.960> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
bolt on really really tightly the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.580 
bolt on really really tightly the
plastic<00:00:52.530> tends<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.809> bend<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.320> within

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
plastic tends to bend like this within

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.799 
plastic tends to bend like this within
the<00:00:55.860> pump<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:57.000> that's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.270> bad<00:00:57.480> thing

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the pump and that's a bad thing

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.889 
the pump and that's a bad thing
because<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> lot<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.890> air<00:00:59.190> can<00:01:00.090> come<00:01:00.270> through<00:01:00.690> on

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
because a lot of air can come through on

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.139 
because a lot of air can come through on
the<00:01:01.050> side<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.399> won't<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.670> able<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.940> pump

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the side and you won't be able to pump

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.140 
the side and you won't be able to pump
as<00:01:03.359> much<00:01:03.390> bait<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> scene<00:01:05.150> another

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
as much bait out of the scene another

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.230 
as much bait out of the scene another
thing<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> after<00:01:06.840> every<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.820> people<00:01:08.820> tend<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
thing is after every use people tend to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.130 
thing is after every use people tend to
forget<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:10.110> release<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.549> bolt<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> must

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
forget to release the bolt now you must

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.950 
forget to release the bolt now you must
release<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> bolt<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.460> way<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> water<00:01:15.060> can

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
release the bolt that way the water can

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.700 
release the bolt that way the water can
get<00:01:16.080> back<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.560> its<00:01:16.710> original<00:01:16.830> form<00:01:18.590> once<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
get back to its original form once you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.760 
get back to its original form once you
get<00:01:19.860> home<00:01:20.100> use<00:01:21.060> fresh<00:01:21.420> water<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.350> clean<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
the washer all the time I've introduced

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.789 
the washer all the time I've introduced
he<00:01:32.400> eats<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.909> outside<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> washer<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
he eats the outside of the washer and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.980 
he eats the outside of the washer and
that's<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:35.939> bad<00:01:36.360> thing

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and what happens there's not an equal

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.649 
and what happens there's not an equal
amount<00:01:40.530> equal<00:01:41.430> circumference<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
amount equal circumference of the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.560 
amount equal circumference of the
washing<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> pump<00:01:43.439> pumping<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.970> sucks<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
washing the pump pumping it sucks in a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.080 
washing the pump pumping it sucks in a
lot<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> air<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.380> you'll<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.189> really<00:01:47.549> really

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
lot of air and you'll be really really

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.149 
lot of air and you'll be really really
pointed<00:01:48.720> when<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.079> can't<00:01:49.350> pump<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.770> any<00:01:49.920> bait

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
pointed when you can't pump out any bait

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.230 
pointed when you can't pump out any bait
and<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:51.630> main<00:01:51.840> thing<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.610> if<00:01:53.610> you've<00:01:53.790> got<00:01:53.880> how

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and the main thing is if you've got how

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.780 
and the main thing is if you've got how
to<00:01:54.299> proceed<00:01:54.810> components<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.579> need<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to proceed components in all you need to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.990 
to proceed components in all you need to
do<00:01:58.219> let's<00:01:59.219> keep<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.610> handle<00:02:00.079> down

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
do let's keep the handle down

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.950 
do let's keep the handle down
so<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.690> can<00:02:02.870> see<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.350> interest<00:02:03.860> cabling<00:02:04.960> get

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
so you can see the interest cabling get

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:21.660 
so you can see the interest cabling get
the<00:02:06.110> steel<00:02:06.350> cap<00:02:08.200> put<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.290> in<00:02:09.380> nice<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.830> slow

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.030 

then<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.790> put<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.120> washer<00:02:23.650> with<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.680> steel

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
then you put the washer with the steel

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:37.020 
then you put the washer with the steel
cap<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:30.910> then<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.150> on<00:02:32.390> top<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.760> bolt

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.490 

now<00:02:38.030> when<00:02:38.180> you're<00:02:38.300> bolting<00:02:38.510> when<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.350> re

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
now when you're bolting when you re
