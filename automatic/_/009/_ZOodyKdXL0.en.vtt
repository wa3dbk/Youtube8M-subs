00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.220
 the americans we are pope are obama 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.370
 happy too alfred as I am pleased 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.009
 me in any case and I have something in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.010
 bavaria the key is that this 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.880
 that that would also be possible in Bavaria 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:25.949
 obama directly obama the usa around actually 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.340
 a party system about flights and to 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.340
 put 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.690
 then this one of these cigarettes is madness 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.750
 Great so I think that the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.520
 would look like the Bavarian obama 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:46.580
 or yes we can still understand here 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.110
 but both are already my next 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.519
 guest a genuine wiener and he 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.160
 understands it elegantly between theater and 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.660
 satire to change where we have something from 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.710
 Last brought from the satire 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.519
 ammann is not me second 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.989
 for the international understanding between 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.860
 Austrian and German 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.860
 Alfred Dorfer 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.210
 yes I was long abroad come back 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.840
 Reading the newspaper elections in Bavaria always 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:28.080
 large 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:28.080
 since when in such young democracies 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.770
 arise then so several 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:41.150
 splinter groups like these csu and and 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.880
 This class of ten percent is allowed for 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.600
 the free voters 90 for the club and 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.060
 But it's a start 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.530
 has congratulated very well done and 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.420
 Then you know what I've been doing for a long time 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.940
 For some demand it 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.490
 edmund stoiber back you know that is 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.490
 who does not jealous with the iq 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.080
 so just above the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.350
 room temperature and always with this 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.720
 head movement and those in austria have 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.459
 even with a head movement our 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.350
 army minister a conscientious objector 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.150
 the lord he became minister 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.150
 it's like if the beckstein 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.410
 Minister of Science and this phase 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.209
 two years ago at cruise that has 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.090
 but then he became a federal army 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.090
 Defiant and says we're going to Chad 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.090
 where is it in the desert 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:46.769
 since then certainly the Austrian 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.299
 Federal Army World Peace with 160 man 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:55.780
 trained by the border assignment at the 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:59.640
 Burgenland Hungarian border 160 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.640
 fighting machines from burgenland 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.830
 secure a patrol strength of 6 in 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:13.160
 six words to the border between 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.160
 sudan and chad it at 2000 kilometers 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.220
 that means every 300 km there is 51 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.480
 or 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.519
 or he is minister with this 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.629
 you move the older spectators 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:44.010
 Maybe that's what you have 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:45.299
 dogs given the car the battery is supposed to 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.659
 we are great and that's why I would 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.359
 say 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.299
 come to us we take something 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.000
 tenth state 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.170
 yes we take problem there are many 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.379
 matches the first time the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.139
 We had a readiness for corruption 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.730
 Finally a good football club and you 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.069
 would not have all the money in the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.109
 former east butter and I ask 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:12.060
 me if this east is former where 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:18.060
 the east is now the must 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.949
 poland again fear no money 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.989
 my east and mens they see something 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.990
 is coming out saxony is urech in 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.479
 the pisa study we build one because so 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.180
 as then the Romans opposed dibaba and 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.280
 the north can do their talk shows 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.139
 make the great theme come to life 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.400
 me back i love that yes it is 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.210
 difficult to distinguish if 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.210
 even the smallest 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.729
 and that's why they come to us 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:49.919
 You can also have two liters of beer 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.349
 I'm driving my car to wolf homberg 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.519
 Three measures are still in progress 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:59.869
 Only three times we show you 

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:02.610
 a new drink friends it's called wine 

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:04.289
 the post no two liters are enough though 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.589
 glasow so come to us i have one 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.589
 good feeling 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:17.149
 So sing it as a high-tech country 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:17.149
 Austria that was not so in the past 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.570
 what have you got what we do not have 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.800
 different ones know that earlier 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.800
 to do it again 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.690
 yes it has you through this heat 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:49.420
 this is our new government that the 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:53.140
 This Ã¶vp is the cdu when cutting 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:55.870
 and this liberal coalition 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:02.190
 from the far right to the very Catholic 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:04.660
 make these ex chefs or a party 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.790
 that they did that and 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.350
 Now we have one in front 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.400
 mirror stands and you have too 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.140
 bad conscience because you're on 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.930
 Germany purely demand one pulls one 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:18.610
 show aware that older and very many 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.600
 Children on the street is a happy one 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.600
 theme you give me 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.780
 By the way , that's what we're talking about 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.120
 that Angela Merkel with her old 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.120
 dresses makes attracts them
