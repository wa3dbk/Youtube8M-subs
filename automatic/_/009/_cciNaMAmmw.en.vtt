let's<00:01:36.810> take<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> loop<00:01:37.290> what's<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.950> here

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
let's take a loop what's going on here

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.600 
let's take a loop what's going on here
so<00:01:39.090> I've<00:01:39.329> built<00:01:39.540> two<00:01:39.810> identical<00:01:40.500> bases<00:01:40.890> level

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so I've built two identical bases level

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.639 
so I've built two identical bases level
one<00:01:41.820> gonna<00:01:42.030> race<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> top<00:01:42.810> level<00:01:43.320> four

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
one gonna race on the top level four

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.200 
one gonna race on the top level four
gonna<00:01:43.860> race<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> bottom<00:01:44.579> track<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
gonna race on the bottom track and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
gonna race on the bottom track and
they're<00:01:45.720> about<00:01:45.840> ten<00:01:46.259> seconds<00:01:46.680> away<00:01:46.799> from<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
they're about ten seconds away from the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.060 
they're about ten seconds away from the
start<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:48.240> let's<00:01:48.570> go<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.200> guys<00:01:49.470> let's<00:01:49.500> get

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
start so let's go for it guys let's get

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.149 
start so let's go for it guys let's get
a<00:01:50.130> compound<00:01:50.970> down<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.720> let's<00:01:52.439> go<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.950> -

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
a compound down and let's go for it -

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.260 
a compound down and let's go for it -
five<00:01:53.520> four<00:01:54.450> three<00:01:55.100> two<00:01:56.100> one

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
five four three two one
