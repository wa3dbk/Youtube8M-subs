going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> talk<00:00:04.770> about<00:00:04.920> how<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.220> can<00:00:05.430> survive

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
going to talk about how you can survive

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.030 
going to talk about how you can survive
your<00:00:05.970> first<00:00:06.000> year<00:00:06.569> as<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.960> teacher<00:00:07.200> I've<00:00:07.799> got

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
your first year as a teacher I've got

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.129 
your first year as a teacher I've got
some<00:00:08.220> points<00:00:08.610> here<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.660> course<00:00:09.690> there's<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
some points here and of course there's a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.020 
some points here and of course there's a
lot<00:00:10.260> more<00:00:10.500> than<00:00:11.040> just<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.519> but<00:00:11.790> these<00:00:11.969> are

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
lot more than just this but these are

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.459 
lot more than just this but these are
the<00:00:12.179> most<00:00:12.389> important<00:00:12.870> points<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.200> need<00:00:13.410> to

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the most important points you need to

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.129 
the most important points you need to
think<00:00:13.769> about<00:00:13.860> as<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.790> first-year<00:00:15.179> teacher<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
think about as a first-year teacher to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.080 
think about as a first-year teacher to
survive<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:17.160> first<00:00:17.460> year<00:00:17.730> because<00:00:17.910> there's

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
survive that first year because there's

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.570 
survive that first year because there's
a<00:00:18.150> lot<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.449> traps<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.260> fall<00:00:19.470> into<00:00:19.859> so

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
a lot of traps that you can fall into so

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.769 
a lot of traps that you can fall into so
let's<00:00:20.850> look<00:00:21.000> at<00:00:21.210> number<00:00:21.240> one

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
let's look at number one

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.259 
let's look at number one
what<00:00:22.380> are<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.859> teaching<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.670> need<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.029> know

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
what are you teaching you need to know

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.599 
what are you teaching you need to know
what<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> benchmarks<00:00:25.380> are<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:25.980> your<00:00:26.099> subject

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
what the benchmarks are for your subject

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.630 
what the benchmarks are for your subject
from<00:00:26.820> your<00:00:27.449> state<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.109> Missouri<00:00:28.560> where<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.279> am

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
from your state in Missouri where I am

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
from your state in Missouri where I am
there<00:00:29.880> called<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.300> gles<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> Glee's

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
there called the gles or the Glee's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.860 
there called the gles or the Glee's
which<00:00:32.099> are<00:00:32.279> grade<00:00:32.520> level<00:00:32.880> expectations<00:00:33.210> you

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
which are grade level expectations you

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.510 
which are grade level expectations you
need<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.290> them<00:00:34.500> backwards<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.130> forwards

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
need to know them backwards and forwards

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.360 
need to know them backwards and forwards
and<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:36.210> need<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.660> able<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.530> tie<00:00:37.920> your

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and you need to be able to tie your

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.000 
and you need to be able to tie your
Glee's<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.210> benchmarks<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.079> every<00:00:40.530> lesson

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
Glee's or benchmarks to every lesson

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.779 
Glee's or benchmarks to every lesson
that<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.280> teach<00:00:41.809> how<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.260> teach<00:00:43.789> I'm

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
that you teach how do you teach I'm

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.910 
that you teach how do you teach I'm
telling<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.390> use<00:00:45.570> lecture<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.770> you're

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
telling you to use lecture now you're

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.830 
telling you to use lecture now you're
saying<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> yourself<00:00:47.370> wait<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> second<00:00:48.390> I've

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
saying to yourself wait a second I've

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
saying to yourself wait a second I've
been<00:00:49.140> told<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> cooperative<00:00:50.039> learning<00:00:50.219> is

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
been told the cooperative learning is

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250 
been told the cooperative learning is
way<00:00:50.760> more<00:00:50.969> effective<00:00:51.090> than<00:00:51.600> lecture<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.230> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
way more effective than lecture and that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.600 
way more effective than lecture and that
is<00:00:52.949> correct

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
is correct

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.369 
is correct
when<00:00:53.969> cooperative<00:00:54.600> learning<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.140> done

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
when cooperative learning is done

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.189 
when cooperative learning is done
properly<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.940> way<00:00:57.149> better<00:00:57.390> than<00:00:57.870> lecture

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
properly it is way better than lecture

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.250 
properly it is way better than lecture
however<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.609> probably<00:01:00.120> were<00:01:00.359> not<00:01:00.570> trained<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
however you probably were not trained to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.709 
however you probably were not trained to
do<00:01:01.500> cooperative<00:01:02.100> learning<00:01:02.250> correctly<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
do cooperative learning correctly you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
do cooperative learning correctly you
are<00:01:03.870> doing<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.470> known<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.890> group<00:01:05.640> work

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
are doing what is known as group work

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.170 
are doing what is known as group work
and<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.500> actually<00:01:08.040> less<00:01:08.340> effective<00:01:08.970> than

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and that is actually less effective than

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.539 
and that is actually less effective than
lecture<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.229> don't<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.560> into<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:10.830> first<00:01:11.159> year

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
lecture so don't go into your first year

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.190 
lecture so don't go into your first year
thinking<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.119> you're<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.570> teach<00:01:12.840> kids

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
thinking that you're going to teach kids

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
thinking that you're going to teach kids
using<00:01:13.560> cooperative<00:01:14.159> learning<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:15.150> it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
using cooperative learning because it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.109 
using cooperative learning because it
will<00:01:15.570> fail<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.740> will<00:01:16.920> look<00:01:17.100> bad<00:01:17.369> just

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
will fail and you will look bad just

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
will fail and you will look bad just
stick<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.780> basics<00:01:19.290> use<00:01:19.860> lecture<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
stick with the basics use lecture and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
stick with the basics use lecture and
then<00:01:21.330> sign<00:01:21.780> up<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.740> cooperative

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
then sign up to get some cooperative

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.200 
then sign up to get some cooperative
learning<00:01:23.369> training

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
learning training

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.420

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
what do you do when students don't learn

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
what do you do when students don't learn
you<00:01:34.650> need<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> system<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
you need to have a system of

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.390 
you need to have a system of
interventions<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.810> place<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.650> help<00:01:37.799> students
