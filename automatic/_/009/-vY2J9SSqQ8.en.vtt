00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
we're doing a knockdown texture and the

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.469 
we're doing a knockdown texture and the
manufacturer<00:00:41.289> gun<00:00:41.589> go<00:00:42.430> blood<00:00:42.699> suggest<00:00:43.180> use<00:00:43.449> a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479 
manufacturer gun go blood suggest use a

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.149 
manufacturer gun go blood suggest use a
3/8<00:00:44.109> inch<00:00:44.729> aperture<00:00:45.729> opening<00:00:46.179> at<00:00:46.659> around

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
3/8 inch aperture opening at around

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.729 
3/8 inch aperture opening at around
sixty<00:00:48.159> pounds<00:00:48.789> of<00:00:49.860> pressure<00:00:51.089> so<00:00:52.089> you<00:00:52.210> just

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
sixty pounds of pressure so you just

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.060 
sixty pounds of pressure so you just
came<00:00:53.739> into<00:00:54.010> mixing<00:00:54.489> this<00:00:54.699> again<00:00:55.680> he<00:00:56.680> says<00:00:56.920> it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
came into mixing this again he says it

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.849 
came into mixing this again he says it
takes<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.430> good<00:00:57.579> ten<00:00:57.969> minutes<00:00:58.000> for<00:00:58.809> it<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:59.140> set

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
takes a good ten minutes for it to set

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.090 
takes a good ten minutes for it to set
up<00:01:00.039> to<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:00.339> proper<00:01:00.760> consistency<00:01:01.180> after<00:01:01.659> he's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
up to the proper consistency after he's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.910 
up to the proper consistency after he's
started<00:01:03.100> mixing<00:01:03.280> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
started mixing it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.940 
started mixing it
so<00:01:05.920> he<00:01:06.310> started<00:01:06.729> mixing<00:01:07.119> it<00:01:07.289> let<00:01:08.289> it<00:01:08.319> sit<00:01:08.440> five

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
so he started mixing it let it sit five

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.529 
so he started mixing it let it sit five
minutes<00:01:09.369> he's<00:01:09.520> mix<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:09.850> again<00:01:09.970> he's<00:01:10.299> going<00:01:10.479> to

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
minutes he's mix it again he's going to

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.870 
minutes he's mix it again he's going to
let<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:10.750> sit<00:01:10.899> another<00:01:11.140> five<00:01:11.409> minutes<00:01:11.679> or<00:01:11.890> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.419 

here's<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.030> consistency<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.869> want<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.220> see

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
here's the consistency you want and see

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.990 
here's the consistency you want and see
how<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:18.640> pours<00:01:18.970> in<00:01:19.179> there<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.610> probably<00:01:21.819> a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
how it pours in there so probably a

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:43.179 
how it pours in there so probably a
little<00:01:22.209> on<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.450> thick<00:01:22.659> side

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.870 

knocking<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> down<00:01:47.570> for<00:01:49.340> inconsistencies<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
knocking it down for inconsistencies and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.570 
knocking it down for inconsistencies and
the<00:01:51.299> wall<00:01:51.710> what<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:53.729> would<00:01:55.130> cause<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.369> have

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
the wall what that would cause it have

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.160 
the wall what that would cause it have
any<00:01:56.729> flat<00:01:57.030> spots<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.630> you're<00:01:57.750> knocking<00:01:58.080> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
any flat spots when you're knocking it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.830 
any flat spots when you're knocking it
down<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> don't<00:01:58.860> want<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.040> press<00:01:59.220> too<00:01:59.250> hard

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
down so you don't want to press too hard

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.560 
down so you don't want to press too hard
and<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> pay<00:02:01.530> attention<00:02:01.560> that

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to the wall surface you're working with

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
to the wall surface you're working with
this<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.789> different<00:02:06.180> angles

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
this one is going to different angles

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:17.150 
this one is going to different angles
tonight<00:02:10.009> avoid<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> new<00:02:11.250> possibility<00:02:15.830> bed<00:02:16.830> flat

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
tonight avoid a new possibility bed flat
