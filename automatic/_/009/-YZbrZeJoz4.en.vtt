works and I'll bottom layer here we've
got<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.760> cave<00:00:57.800> I've<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.070> drawn<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.980> hide

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
got a cave I've just drawn and I hide

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.440 
got a cave I've just drawn and I hide
that<00:01:03.379> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> next<00:01:04.680> layer<00:01:04.949> we've<00:01:05.790> got<00:01:06.060> my

that on the next layer we've got my

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.070 
that on the next layer we've got my
walking<00:01:06.750> man<00:01:07.080> symbol

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.620 

so<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.070> double-click<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.730> that<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.600> see

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so if I double-click on that you can see

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.360 
so if I double-click on that you can see
that<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.230> just<00:01:13.550> two<00:01:14.550> keyframes<00:01:15.110> lasting

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
that it's just two keyframes lasting

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.490 
that it's just two keyframes lasting
five<00:01:17.370> frames<00:01:17.640> each

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.660 

just<00:01:22.160> two<00:01:22.370> little<00:01:22.670> drawings<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.990> him<00:01:24.980> wobbling

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670

just two little drawings of him wobbling
his<00:01:25.790> arms<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.180> legs<00:01:26.300> hurt<00:01:26.660> looks<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:26.990> bit<00:01:27.020> like

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
his arms and legs hurt looks a bit like

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.460 
his arms and legs hurt looks a bit like
he<00:01:27.500> walks<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.430> that's<00:01:28.580> just<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.480> same<00:01:29.690> as<00:01:30.050> the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
he walks so that's just the same as the

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.580 
he walks so that's just the same as the
looping<00:01:30.890> face<00:01:31.580> symbol<00:01:32.080> we<00:01:33.080> did<00:01:33.290> in<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.470> previous

looping face symbol we did in a previous

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.780 
looping face symbol we did in a previous
lesson<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:35.210> one<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.860> if<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:40.040> click<00:01:40.250> on<00:01:40.460> scene

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
lesson that one so if I click on scene

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.300 
lesson that one so if I click on scene
we'll<00:01:41.090> go<00:01:41.210> back<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.600> scene<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:42.740> can

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
we'll go back to the scene and I can

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.620 
we'll go back to the scene and I can
hide<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.420> layer<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.840> above<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:46.630> what

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
hide that layer and above that what

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.660 
hide that layer and above that what
we've<00:01:47.780> got<00:01:49.270> well<00:01:50.270> mark<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.750> is<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.620> kind<00:01:52.550> of

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
we've got well mark it is a kind of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.969 
we've got well mark it is a kind of
green<00:01:53.410> fill<00:01:54.410> it's<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.490> green<00:01:55.790> mass<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.740> what

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
green fill it's a green mass and what

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.350 
green fill it's a green mass and what
that<00:01:58.240> green<00:01:59.240> mass<00:01:59.570> does<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.350> tells<00:02:00.619> flash

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
that green mass does is it tells flash

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.150 
that green mass does is it tells flash
where<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.390> want<00:02:02.900> it<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.200> show<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.710> man<00:02:03.920> and

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
where I want it to show the man and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.870 
where I want it to show the man and
where<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.240> don't<00:02:05.300> want<00:02:05.690> it<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.110> show<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.470> map<00:02:06.880> so

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
where I don't want it to show the map so

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.749 
where I don't want it to show the map so
you<00:02:08.179> can<00:02:08.420> see<00:02:08.570> this<00:02:08.959> white<00:02:09.259> space<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:10.429> can<00:02:10.580> see

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
you can see this white space you can see

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.020 
you can see this white space you can see
that's<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.600> stage<00:02:12.070> but<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.160> doesn't<00:02:13.520> have<00:02:13.700> any

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
that's the stage but it doesn't have any

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.660 
that's the stage but it doesn't have any
green<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:15.560> what<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.010> says<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.400> flash

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
green in it so what that says to flash

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.960 
green in it so what that says to flash
is<00:02:17.200> don't<00:02:18.200> show<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.530> Mun<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.100> area<00:02:19.550> where

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.699 
this area where it is green so to make
that<00:02:28.519> clear<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.150> think<00:02:29.570> what<00:02:29.870> I'll<00:02:29.989> do<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.470> I'll

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
that clear I think what I'll do is I'll

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.640 
that clear I think what I'll do is I'll
go<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.239> symbol<00:02:32.630> we<00:02:33.230> made<00:02:33.500> earlier<00:02:35.530> for<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
go to the symbol we made earlier for the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.970 
go to the symbol we made earlier for the
face

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.009 

and<00:02:39.180> I'll<00:02:40.440> reconstruct<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.800> whole<00:02:41.890> thing<00:02:43.019> so

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
and I'll reconstruct the whole thing so

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.440 
and I'll reconstruct the whole thing so
I<00:02:44.349> think<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.280> bit<00:02:45.430> bigger<00:02:45.700> at<00:02:45.909> the<00:02:45.940> end<00:02:46.150> so

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
I think it's a bit bigger at the end so

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.660 
I think it's a bit bigger at the end so
I<00:02:46.480> might<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:46.750> scooch<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.290> down<00:02:47.470> with<00:02:48.310> free

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
I might just scooch it down with free

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.550 
I might just scooch it down with free
transform<00:02:49.150> tools<00:02:49.390> over<00:02:49.870> here<00:02:53.129> so<00:02:54.129> got<00:02:54.580> simple

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
transform tools over here so got simple

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.240 
transform tools over here so got simple
just<00:02:56.560> tweening<00:02:57.099> from<00:02:57.819> left<00:02:58.599> to<00:02:58.660> right<00:02:59.129> if<00:03:00.129> you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
just tweening from left to right if you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.979 
just tweening from left to right if you
don't<00:03:00.370> understand<00:03:00.819> any<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.269> check<00:03:01.840> out

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
don't understand any of this check out

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.550 
don't understand any of this check out
my<00:03:02.170> earlier<00:03:02.500> lessons<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.870> all<00:03:05.049> explained

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560

my earlier lessons it's all explained
I've<00:03:06.010> colored<00:03:06.819> it<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> bit<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.989> can<00:03:11.170> see

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
I've colored it in a bit so you can see

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.259 
I've colored it in a bit so you can see
it's<00:03:11.530> blue<00:03:11.739> instead<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.930> transparent<00:03:15.269> and

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
it's blue instead of transparent and

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.789 
it's blue instead of transparent and
what<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.540> need<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.720> do<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.049> I<00:03:17.079> need<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.319> draw<00:03:17.560> Cape

what I need to do is I need to draw Cape
so<00:03:18.280> I'll<00:03:18.549> lock<00:03:18.760> this<00:03:18.940> layer<00:03:19.000> by<00:03:19.420> clicking<00:03:19.780> here

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
so I'll lock this layer by clicking here

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.270 
so I'll lock this layer by clicking here
ok<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.069> new<00:03:21.310> layer<00:03:21.519> by<00:03:21.760> clicking<00:03:21.790> here<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.920> I'll

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
ok a new layer by clicking here and I'll

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.990 
ok a new layer by clicking here and I'll

and I'm going to choose a gray and for

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.990 
and I'm going to choose a gray and for
the<00:03:56.090> interior<00:03:56.629> I'm<00:03:56.780> gonna<00:03:56.959> choose<00:03:57.200> dark<00:03:57.470> gray

okay<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.480> that's<00:04:00.080> a<00:04:00.140> pretty<00:04:00.349> simple<00:04:00.620> cave<00:04:00.980> I'm

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
okay so that's a pretty simple cave I'm

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.369 
okay so that's a pretty simple cave I'm
sure<00:04:01.459> even<00:04:02.120> if<00:04:02.209> you've<00:04:02.360> only<00:04:02.450> got<00:04:02.629> rudimentary

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
sure even if you've only got rudimentary

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.830 
sure even if you've only got rudimentary
drawing<00:04:04.280> skills<00:04:04.610> you<00:04:04.819> can<00:04:05.060> probably<00:04:05.569> manage

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
drawing skills you can probably manage

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.589 
drawing skills you can probably manage
that<00:04:06.549> you<00:04:07.549> can<00:04:07.670> see<00:04:07.819> that<00:04:08.000> our<00:04:08.090> face<00:04:08.299> just

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
that you can see that our face just

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.539 
that you can see that our face just
disappears<00:04:09.319> behind<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.709> cave<00:04:09.980> which<00:04:10.220> is<00:04:10.340> what

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
disappears behind the cave which is what

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.280 
disappears behind the cave which is what
we<00:04:10.700> want<00:04:10.909> so<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.269> need<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.629> drag<00:04:11.810> our<00:04:12.049> cave

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
we want so we need to drag our cave

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.069 
we want so we need to drag our cave
layer<00:04:12.500> underneath<00:04:12.980> content<00:04:13.940> layer<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.840> now<00:04:14.900> if

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
layer underneath content layer so now if

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.050 
layer underneath content layer so now if
we<00:04:15.140> played<00:04:15.409> through<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:16.070> can<00:04:16.280> see<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.850> our

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
we played through you can see that our

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.099 
we played through you can see that our
face<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:18.199> above<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.739> cave<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.810> make<00:04:20.959> it

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
face is above the cave so to make it

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.330 
face is above the cave so to make it
look<00:04:21.229> like<00:04:21.410> it's<00:04:21.620> actually<00:04:21.739> disappearing

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
look like it's actually disappearing

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.850 
look like it's actually disappearing
into<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.760> cave<00:04:23.060> we<00:04:23.900> need<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.169> create<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.650> mask

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
into the cave we need to create a mask

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.480 
into the cave we need to create a mask
layer<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.880> let's<00:04:26.030> do<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.300> now<00:04:27.010> by<00:04:28.010> quick

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
layer so let's do that now by quick

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.140 
layer so let's do that now by quick
aren't<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.090> here<00:04:30.190> we<00:04:31.190> get<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.520> new<00:04:31.940> layer

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
aren't you a here we get a new layer

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.340 
aren't you a here we get a new layer
called<00:04:32.330> layer<00:04:32.539> three<00:04:32.810> I'm<00:04:32.960> going<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.169> drag

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
called layer three I'm going to drag

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.409 
called layer three I'm going to drag
that<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.710> top<00:04:33.919> I'm<00:04:34.729> gonna<00:04:34.970> double<00:04:35.300> click

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
that to the top I'm gonna double click

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.860 
that to the top I'm gonna double click
on<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:35.930> rename<00:04:36.199> it<00:04:36.410> mask<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:41.360> in<00:04:41.660> that

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
on it and rename it mask so in that

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.930 
on it and rename it mask so in that
layer<00:04:42.080> we<00:04:42.350> need<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.710> draw<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.310> term<00:04:43.699> that<00:04:43.880> I

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
layer we need to draw the term that I

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.219 
layer we need to draw the term that I
was<00:04:44.060> talking<00:04:44.210> about<00:04:44.360> before<00:04:46.900> which<00:04:47.900> tells

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
was talking about before which tells

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
it'll open up the layer properties you

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
it'll open up the layer properties you
can<00:05:31.490> select<00:05:31.789> a<00:05:31.880> mask

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
can select a mask

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.800 
can select a mask
pretty<00:05:33.350> simple<00:05:33.729> so<00:05:34.729> now<00:05:34.910> I'll<00:05:35.120> go<00:05:35.330> kind<00:05:35.750> of

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
pretty simple so now I'll go kind of

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.540 
pretty simple so now I'll go kind of
green

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
green

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.189 
green
but<00:05:37.550> at<00:05:37.639> the<00:05:37.729> moment<00:05:37.759> it<00:05:38.270> still<00:05:38.630> won't<00:05:38.750> act<00:05:39.020> as

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
but at the moment it still won't act as

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.230 
but at the moment it still won't act as
a<00:05:39.259> mask<00:05:39.500> because<00:05:39.800> we<00:05:40.310> need<00:05:40.490> to<00:05:40.669> nest<00:05:40.970> our

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
a mask because we need to nest our

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.290 
a mask because we need to nest our
content<00:05:41.780> in<00:05:42.380> that<00:05:42.650> layer<00:05:42.889> so<00:05:43.460> click<00:05:44.030> on<00:05:44.150> that

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
content in that layer so click on that

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.230 
content in that layer so click on that
layer<00:05:44.830> just<00:05:45.830> like<00:05:45.949> with<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:46.669> motion<00:05:47.030> guide

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
layer just like with the motion guide

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.930 
layer just like with the motion guide
just<00:05:47.660> pull<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.680> up<00:05:48.770> onto<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.370> mask<00:05:49.610> you<00:05:49.759> can

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
just pull it up onto the mask you can

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.600 
just pull it up onto the mask you can
see<00:05:50.180> it's<00:05:50.690> a<00:05:50.750> little<00:05:50.870> circle<00:05:51.440> in<00:05:51.500> our<00:05:51.650> line<00:05:51.860> and

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
see it's a little circle in our line and

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.909 
see it's a little circle in our line and
it'll<00:05:52.880> make<00:05:53.030> our<00:05:53.150> content<00:05:53.600> layer<00:05:54.080> go<00:05:54.350> green<00:05:54.650> as

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
it'll make our content layer go green as

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.850 
it'll make our content layer go green as
well<00:05:55.240> now<00:05:56.240> it<00:05:56.690> still<00:05:56.990> won't<00:05:57.470> look<00:05:57.800> right

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
well now it still won't look right

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.750 
well now it still won't look right
because<00:05:58.580> me<00:05:59.389> to<00:05:59.570> lock<00:05:59.870> both<00:06:00.229> these<00:06:01.010> layers<00:06:01.280> to

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
because me to lock both these layers to

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.840 
because me to lock both these layers to
make<00:06:01.910> it<00:06:02.060> work<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.240> can<00:06:02.600> see<00:06:02.810> our<00:06:03.260> mask

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
make it work you can see our mask

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.840 
make it work you can see our mask
disappears<00:06:04.850> but<00:06:05.810> now<00:06:05.930> if<00:06:06.050> we<00:06:06.110> play<00:06:06.350> it<00:06:06.410> through

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
disappears but now if we play it through

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.029 
disappears but now if we play it through
you<00:06:07.850> can<00:06:08.030> see<00:06:08.240> our<00:06:08.330> face<00:06:08.770> disappear<00:06:09.770> into<00:06:09.919> the

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
you can see our face disappear into the

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:15.930 
you can see our face disappear into the
cave<00:06:12.160> obviously<00:06:13.160> you<00:06:14.060> can<00:06:14.240> see<00:06:14.419> here<00:06:14.720> it's<00:06:14.990> not

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
cave obviously you can see here it's not

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.510 
cave obviously you can see here it's not
entirely<00:06:16.940> accurate<00:06:17.270> but<00:06:18.260> that's<00:06:19.010> something

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
entirely accurate but that's something

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.020 
entirely accurate but that's something
that<00:06:19.789> you<00:06:19.910> can<00:06:20.090> alter<00:06:20.680> by<00:06:21.910> unlocking<00:06:22.910> your

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
that you can alter by unlocking your

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.379 
that you can alter by unlocking your
mask<00:06:23.240> layer<00:06:23.830> you<00:06:24.830> click<00:06:25.039> on<00:06:25.280> this<00:06:25.789> symbol<00:06:26.000> here

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
mask layer you click on this symbol here

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.779 
mask layer you click on this symbol here
or<00:06:26.599> may<00:06:26.750> go<00:06:26.990> into<00:06:27.110> outline<00:06:27.500> mode<00:06:27.710> you<00:06:28.430> can<00:06:28.610> just

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
or may go into outline mode you can just

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:35.320 
or may go into outline mode you can just
refine<00:06:29.180> that<00:06:29.389> by<00:06:29.660> using<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:31.310> lasso<00:06:31.699> tool<00:06:34.330> and

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
refine that by using the lasso tool and

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.890 
refine that by using the lasso tool and
shaving<00:06:35.750> bits<00:06:35.960> off

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
shaving bits off

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.970 
shaving bits off
so<00:06:37.530> I<00:06:38.750> want<00:06:39.750> to<00:06:39.840> cut<00:06:40.140> that<00:06:40.290> out

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
so I want to cut that out

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:49.250 
so I want to cut that out
but<00:06:41.730> you<00:06:41.820> could<00:06:41.970> use<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.300> eraser

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.720 

now<00:06:49.860> if<00:06:50.220> we<00:06:50.490> lock<00:06:50.820> it<00:06:50.970> again<00:06:51.650> look

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.970 

yeah<00:06:55.360> it's<00:06:55.900> looking<00:06:56.020> a<00:06:56.290> bit<00:06:56.440> better<00:06:56.620> but

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
yeah it's looking a bit better but

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.350 
yeah it's looking a bit better but
obviously<00:06:57.430> you<00:06:57.550> can<00:06:57.730> tinker<00:06:58.060> with<00:06:58.180> that

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
obviously you can tinker with that

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.340 
obviously you can tinker with that
yourself<00:06:58.620> and<00:06:59.620> make<00:06:59.860> it<00:07:00.010> look<00:07:00.130> how<00:07:00.340> you<00:07:00.400> want

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
yourself and make it look how you want

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.810 
yourself and make it look how you want
okay<00:07:02.380> that's<00:07:02.650> hard<00:07:02.830> to<00:07:02.860> do<00:07:03.010> masks<00:07:03.430> I'll<00:07:03.640> see

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
okay that's hard to do masks I'll see

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.820 
okay that's hard to do masks I'll see
you<00:07:03.940> in<00:07:04.030> the<00:07:04.120> next<00:07:04.360> lesson<00:07:04.540> hey<00:07:05.320> if<00:07:05.620> you've
