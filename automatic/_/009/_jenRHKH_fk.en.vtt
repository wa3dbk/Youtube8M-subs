00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.719
 take a pen or similar and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.240
 hold him to the side of yours 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.740
 nostrils so you can start the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.199
 highest point and the end of yours 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.270
 find out exactly eyebrow 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:32.309
 he shows me the whole thing again 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:36.440
 and I agree with that about as 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.440
 First, I know all the way up 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.710
 and then cuts the hairs the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.050
 longer than the top knew of mine 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.050
 Eyebrow are off with the scissors 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.950
 I just shrugged the hairs off the bottom 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.229
 the eyebrow is I would advise you 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.500
 because not very bushy here 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.490
 eyebrows where you really have it 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.650
 some have not been there 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.490
 belong to them that just because they last 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.800
 the way they are 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.800
 I generally only dab below 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.840
 I keep on wincing until you get that 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.479
 result like and snappy under the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.940
 Eyebrow just got to know without 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.210
 that some fairy tales are there for you 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.210
 do not belong 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.530
 Finally, I still braids between the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.880
 Eyebrows the hairs away again 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.000
 but they are also superfluous 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.790
 you do not take away too much of it 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.260
 that the eyebrows are still too short here 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.370
 I would put the eyebrows back in hers 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.370
 original shape back 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.800
 with the essential designer in the color 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.590
 I'm drawing my own blonde 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.870
 eyebrows after in small speaking 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.470
 movements thus the result is on 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.470
 most natural 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.770
 so that there are no hard strokes or 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.160
 I can see the whole line 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.160
 through again 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.430
 normally I leave it now 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.650
 but since I want to show here how the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.750
 really perfect eyebrows get done 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.920
 I am now taking a one brush 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.190
 bevelled and a light brown 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.100
 eye shadow 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.650
 this is from the album sad by patrice 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.780
 and I'll take that over again 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.850
 eyebrows after but only takes a lot 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.550
 little eye shadow because otherwise the 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.110
 Eyebrows are way too dark 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.230
 focuses most of the color 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.150
 the highest point your eyebrow 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.820
 Here I take a creamy 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.090
 concealer of hendrix with a very 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.160
 precise little brush and see it 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.520
 I the contours of the eyebrow again 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.520
 to 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.150
 Through this trick , the eyebrows look 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.370
 simply again much perfect from this 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.810
 all the little hairs you have now 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.540
 maybe not with the tweezers too 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.310
 Gets caught and covered 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.880
 the eyebrow just stings a lot 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.880
 more in the eye 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.620
 The best thing to do is blind you 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.849
 the finger so that does not soft 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.849
 edges are visible 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.290
 yes, that was me too 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.970
 Hope you liked the tutorial and 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.620

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.430

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.380
