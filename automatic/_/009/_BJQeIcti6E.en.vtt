at<00:00:37.899> times<00:00:38.199> particularly<00:00:38.890> after<00:00:39.190> Robbo<00:00:39.579> had

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
scored you could have might have should

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.469 
scored you could have might have should
have<00:00:41.769> and<00:00:42.129> that<00:00:42.579> second<00:00:42.940> goal<00:00:43.059> wouldn't<00:00:43.329> quite

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.709 
I felt first off we you know deservedly
in<00:00:47.409> front<00:00:47.679> and<00:00:47.829> what<00:00:48.159> a<00:00:48.190> better<00:00:48.399> side<00:00:48.719> second

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
in front and what a better side second

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.029 
in front and what a better side second
half<00:00:49.839> swing<00:00:50.260> then<00:00:50.379> came<00:00:50.559> back<00:00:50.589> at<00:00:50.889> it's<00:00:51.010> very

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
half swing then came back at it's very

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.489 
half swing then came back at it's very
strongly<00:00:51.579> and<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.989> know<00:00:53.079> I<00:00:53.109> was<00:00:53.350> always

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
strongly and you know I was always

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.229 
strongly and you know I was always
thinking<00:00:53.739> maybe<00:00:54.100> we<00:00:54.339> needed<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.699> second<00:00:55.059> goal

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.299 
thinking maybe we needed the second goal
we're<00:00:55.839> probably<00:00:56.260> looking<00:00:56.649> at<00:00:56.859> the<00:00:57.010> second

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
we're probably looking at the second

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.709 
we're probably looking at the second
half<00:00:57.459> despite<00:00:58.059> not<00:00:58.209> having<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:58.420> lot<00:00:58.539> of<00:00:58.600> the

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
half despite not having a lot of the

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.539 
half despite not having a lot of the
play<00:00:58.899> we<00:00:59.469> had<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.649> better<00:00:59.829> chances<00:01:00.309> on<00:01:00.459> the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
play we had the better chances on the

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:01.860 
play we had the better chances on the
break<00:01:00.760> but<00:01:00.999> you<00:01:01.209> know<00:01:01.299> I'm<00:01:01.389> pleased<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.690> say
