00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
way this works is this is the mascara

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.219 
way this works is this is the mascara
and<00:02:02.050> these<00:02:02.440> are<00:02:02.849> the<00:02:03.849> lash<00:02:04.360> extension<00:02:04.599> fibers

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
and these are the lash extension fibers

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.919 
and these are the lash extension fibers
in<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.679> smaller<00:02:05.979> tube<00:02:06.399> your<00:02:07.000> first<00:02:07.300> point<00:02:07.599> to

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
in a smaller tube your first point to

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.070 
in a smaller tube your first point to
apply<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.289> quarter

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
apply a quarter

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.930 
apply a quarter
yeah<00:02:09.260> then<00:02:10.100> you're<00:02:10.250> gonna<00:02:10.400> follow<00:02:10.640> up<00:02:10.910> with

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
yeah then you're gonna follow up with

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.670 
yeah then you're gonna follow up with
some<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.510> fibers<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.140> that's<00:02:12.410> really

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
some of the fibers and that's really

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.950 
some of the fibers and that's really
what's<00:02:13.010> going<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.370> build<00:02:13.970> up<00:02:14.150> your<00:02:14.300> lashes<00:02:14.540> and

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
what's going to build up your lashes and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.020 
what's going to build up your lashes and
make<00:02:15.080> them<00:02:15.230> thicker<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.770> then<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.580> are<00:02:16.820> going

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
make them thicker and then you are going

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.060 
make them thicker and then you are going
to<00:02:17.120> once<00:02:17.420> again<00:02:17.540> applying<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.230> sky<00:02:18.470> over<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
to once again applying the sky over the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.770 
to once again applying the sky over the
fibers<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.790> that's<00:02:20.000> going<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.270> just<00:02:20.390> cover<00:02:20.660> up

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
fibers and that's going to just cover up

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.150 
fibers and that's going to just cover up
the<00:02:20.900> fibers<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.470> just<00:02:21.680> give<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:21.950> that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
the fibers and just give you that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.790 
the fibers and just give you that
dramatic<00:02:22.910> look<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.320> what<00:02:24.440> I'm<00:02:24.530> going

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800

mascara<00:03:07.950> nothing<00:03:08.670> special<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.300> far<00:03:09.570> I'm<00:03:10.200> going

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
mascara nothing special so far I'm going

mascara nothing special so far I'm going
to<00:03:10.830> apply<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.550> lash<00:03:12.090> extension<00:03:12.270> fiber<00:03:13.170> which

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
to apply the lash extension fiber which

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.850 
to apply the lash extension fiber which
is<00:03:13.820> step<00:03:14.820> 2<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.240> this<00:03:15.420> whole<00:03:15.630> process<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.740> this

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
is step 2 of this whole process so this

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.800 
is step 2 of this whole process so this
is<00:03:17.040> what<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.640> lash<00:03:17.910> extension<00:03:18.120> fibers<00:03:18.510> look

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
is what the lash extension fibers look

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.750 
is what the lash extension fibers look
like<00:03:18.990> they're<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.410> like<00:03:19.560> white<00:03:19.950> cotton

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.100 
because you don't want the mascara to
dry<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:58.820> then<00:05:59.090> go<00:05:59.120> back<00:05:59.480> with<00:05:59.660> this<00:05:59.780> and<00:05:59.960> not

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
dry and then go back with this and not

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.690 
dry and then go back with this and not
stick<00:06:00.440> enough<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.160> I<00:06:01.190> would<00:06:01.370> say<00:06:01.490> if<00:06:01.610> you're

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
stick enough so I would say if you're

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.790 
stick enough so I would say if you're
new<00:06:02.360> to<00:06:02.570> using<00:06:02.750> this<00:06:03.020> type<00:06:03.200> of<00:06:03.350> product<00:06:03.680> like

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
new to using this type of product like

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.950 
new to using this type of product like
the<00:06:03.950> fiber<00:06:04.190> lash<00:06:04.430> extension<00:06:04.970> dupe<00:06:05.450> one<00:06:05.690> eye<00:06:05.720> at

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
the fiber lash extension dupe one eye at

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.250 
the fiber lash extension dupe one eye at
a<00:06:05.990> time<00:06:06.400> like<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.880> top<00:06:08.090> lashes<00:06:08.390> first<00:06:08.750> then

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
a time like the top lashes first then

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.660 
a time like the top lashes first then
this<00:06:09.470> eye<00:06:09.650> and<00:06:09.890> then<00:06:10.010> maybe<00:06:10.190> do<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.520> lower

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
this eye and then maybe do the lower

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.580 
this eye and then maybe do the lower
lashes<00:06:10.940> but<00:06:11.630> yeah<00:06:11.750> take<00:06:11.990> your<00:06:12.110> time<00:06:12.290> with<00:06:12.470> this

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
lashes but yeah take your time with this

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.230 
lashes but yeah take your time with this
so<00:06:12.710> that

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
so that

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.120 
so that
and<00:06:13.630> you<00:06:13.690> don't<00:06:13.870> get<00:06:13.990> like<00:06:14.080> fibers<00:06:14.710> everywhere

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
and you don't get like fibers everywhere

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.550 
and you don't get like fibers everywhere
so<00:06:15.789> what<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.300> recommend<00:06:16.479> the<00:06:16.780> two<00:06:16.930> fates<00:06:17.139> better

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
so what I recommend the two fates better

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.529 
so what I recommend the two fates better
than<00:06:17.710> false<00:06:17.889> lashes<00:06:18.160> extreme<00:06:18.789> yes<00:06:19.330> I

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539
