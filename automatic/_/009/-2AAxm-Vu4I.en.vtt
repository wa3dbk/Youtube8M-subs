00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.750
 hello and welcome to a strong rebound could do it today for this 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.560
 new animated series that hate you text you go we talked a little bit about the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.109
 city ​​believes further east in the case of volkswagen ag because it's true the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.369
 things I usually start with when I was kid and kate 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.480
 do not break the case for everyone you can of course men and women 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.500
 at the end of your mac app the young people of the ferraudière the point of being 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.040
 so why are they about to launch in a bearish move 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.750
 part of the year and a fight not let them get trapped but mostly 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.480
 to give US bank liquidity 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.150
 so of course this is done through so to the young woman is very 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.600
 clear my case it can be a park in nice caen parquet will not be so 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.740
 present to the legislative 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.840
 to find out if your ticket and usually it's a party so 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.100
 why he is targeted by two suicide bombings at the elysée that goes with 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.550
 the judge erred under bilateral agreements with m 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.900
 Alain Lapointe also pointed gilles fashioned with shell 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.980
 accuracy be so high at 119 points 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.860
 under the heat we have for example the traffic is down from less 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.910
 here I am just using it from that 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.450
 and I do not believe in rich painting either 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480
 which will not be 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.140
 what to question 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.020
 I am interested 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.020
 of course the testimony of a contractor 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.770
 the money from simply summarize not the eyelid intervener remains to say 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.950
 that I stayed on the eyelid 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.850
 on the other hand what is always very good to do to bring the same 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.710
 way 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.229
 it's a master and if she wants to tell the truth 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.990
 henri parent 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.770
 So here is 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.250
 eric besson 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.760
 for me they have right now so I'm very preliminary 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.359
 I do not continue to store the vel satis dax 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.539
 these sums must have the same rights 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.539
 there is a moment when that 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.679
 a sweetness that is the immediate recovery 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.599
 and could be a man fooled the people with the east will be finished his 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.010
 sentence 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.390
 it will be good for uefa will make sense 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.649
 while no one is walking 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:35.620
 so if I really sing my country wake that civil south 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.000
 this is the recipe for its part ford and general motors 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.189
 there was a small 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.290
 and if we really love until the elders we really 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.589
 what these places 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.770
 if we have to go to the word given until the day 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.840
 no for me the shot a term should simply 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.270
 to be surpassed hervé light little people as we see here 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.880
 the mobile eyelid ton that is to say, power will be a tiny bit of 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.199
 them 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.079
 in any case 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.439
 it does not exceed a hollow 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.969
 here 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.969
 I do not want to be firm rest 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.019
 myself I want to be able to inform three artists have done for me I 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.979
 design quite 13 dead 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.709
 scrum and you'll see that I told you already started to take everything 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.149
 its meaning a car and it's over - stay there at this place 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.870
 that I'm still going though if she actually 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.060
 he really hurt his sapping work in the end I tend not to 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.689
 to be weird but m 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.230
 m if you follow so break your head at this adventure 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.939
 of yesterday based on metal 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.589
 % knowing that the next step will be the external crucible 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.439
 but with a gap in the end we will make sense and kate 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.980
 the Senate is about to highlight necessarily that 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.139
 the glass part 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.509
 it is run by the given shot of light but actually to afp if 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.780
 you want to take place 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.319
 he had an absent look for three games and wages for example in 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.059
 the accident 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.469
 of course nothing prevents you from taking a thing of rather that of 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.050
 afps do not forget that it's ok 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.569
 before closing the points 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.129
 no you told me everything I had to say about with 10 term points 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:20.389
 from the entire list 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.389
 she went through that otherwise it could hurt really in the 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.590
 kitchen see what I'm talking about 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.370
 album 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.600
 do not take any office laurent white less than 10 years of work with 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.490
 other colors 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.830
 at the table we have all these services to make extremely weird 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.580
 on the eve of the parade 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.180
 superb would be more and more often in the calm 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.720
 all his internet property 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.940
 he knows I will use sorhaindo etc 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.059
 the tragedy is similar 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.949
 what's in a kind of white that broke 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.430
 it's very good to do it we invite for jean-michel delage work this 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.610
 perfect here is a I'll leave you on his beating to add soon 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.800
