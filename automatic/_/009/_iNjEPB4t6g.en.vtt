share<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:44.850> whatever<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.810> top<00:01:45.990> or

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
share or whatever on the top or

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.789 
share or whatever on the top or
somewhere<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.970> but<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.420> pretty<00:01:48.960> much<00:01:49.049> my

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
somewhere up here but I pretty much my

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
somewhere up here but I pretty much my
thinking<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> video<00:01:50.909> can't<00:01:51.210> stand<00:01:51.509> on

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
thinking is if the video can't stand on

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
thinking is if the video can't stand on
its<00:01:51.810> own<00:01:51.899> two<00:01:52.110> feet<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.460> doesn't<00:01:53.850> own

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
its own two feet if it if it doesn't own

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.840 
its own two feet if it if it doesn't own
likes<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.960> its<00:01:55.229> own<00:01:55.409> then<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.369> not<00:01:56.490> worthy<00:01:56.700> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
likes on its own then it's not worthy of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.130 
likes on its own then it's not worthy of
like<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.990> don't<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.350> say<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> bit<00:01:58.890> um
