boarding it up with kind of windows as
my<00:02:13.290> thought<00:02:13.530> behind<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.700> first<00:02:14.910> clip<00:02:15.120> is

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
my thought behind it this first clip is

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.050 
my thought behind it this first clip is
a<00:02:15.470> courthouse<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.489> think<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.790> could<00:02:17.910> be<00:02:17.970> a

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
a courthouse and I think that could be a

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.150 
a courthouse and I think that could be a
potential<00:02:18.810> safe<00:02:19.170> house<00:02:19.410> especially<00:02:19.830> with<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
potential safe house especially with the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.690 
potential safe house especially with the
tower<00:02:20.840> um<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.620> next<00:02:22.890> clip<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:23.310> are<00:02:23.340> going<00:02:23.459> to
