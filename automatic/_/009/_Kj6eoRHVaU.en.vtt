there's<00:00:54.149> people<00:00:54.300> out<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.539> though<00:00:54.870> who<00:00:55.140> they

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
there's people out there though who they

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.439 
there's people out there though who they
don't<00:00:56.010> use<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.579> lay<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.149> or

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
don't use it they just lay it out or

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.790 
don't use it they just lay it out or
they<00:00:57.600> fold<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.079> nicely<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> looks

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
they fold it up nicely and it looks

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.889

really<00:00:59.100> nice<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.579> mean<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.329> necessary

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
