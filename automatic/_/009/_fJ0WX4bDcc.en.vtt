00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
overthrown but I'll show you how we do

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.640 
overthrown but I'll show you how we do
it<00:00:28.189> essentially<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.310> use<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:30.109> loader<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> push

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it essentially we use the loader to push

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.900 
it essentially we use the loader to push
the<00:00:31.830> brush<00:00:32.040> down<00:00:32.399> run<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> over<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:34.910> use

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the brush down run it over and then use

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.049 
the brush down run it over and then use
the<00:00:36.090> brush<00:00:36.239> mower<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.309> really<00:00:38.309> run<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> over

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.940 

not<00:00:42.059> elegant<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> works<00:00:42.960> works<00:00:43.710> pretty

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
not elegant but it works works pretty

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.860 
not elegant but it works works pretty
good<00:00:44.899> you<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:45.930> see<00:00:46.289> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
refitted

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.020

and

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.100 

really<00:01:20.510> up<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.900> past<00:01:21.730> but<00:01:22.730> what<00:01:22.940> we<00:01:23.060> do<00:01:23.240> in

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
really up to the past but what we do in

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.190 
really up to the past but what we do in
mowing<00:01:25.890> our<00:01:26.040> property<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:26.960> clearing<00:01:27.960> brush

mowing our property and clearing brush

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080 
mowing our property and clearing brush
and<00:01:28.260> stuff<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.520> works<00:01:29.760> well

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and stuff like that it really works well

00:01:30.090 --> 00:02:07.330 
and stuff like that it really works well
does<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.680> trick

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:44.839 

no<00:02:08.340> stairs<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.060> far

00:02:44.849 --> 00:03:05.690 

a<00:02:44.879> couple

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:27.000 

some<00:03:06.240> days<00:03:06.450> wait<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.990> go<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.500> way

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.479 

there's<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.730> pallbearer<00:03:28.650> okay<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.040> runs<00:03:30.310> the

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
there's a pallbearer okay the runs the

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:38.790 
there's a pallbearer okay the runs the
run<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:30.730> marker<00:03:31.209> fall<00:03:31.450> over

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.390 

once<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.580> still<00:03:39.850> found<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.390> those<00:03:40.750> big<00:03:41.050> ole

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.140 

huh<00:03:45.599> down

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:04.099 

there<00:03:53.150> we<00:03:53.360> go

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.910 

happiness<00:04:05.109> unstoppable

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
happiness unstoppable

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.270 
happiness unstoppable
I<00:04:08.099> mean<00:04:08.610> once<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:08.910> get<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.180> going<00:04:09.209> it's

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
I mean once you get it going it's

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.300 
I mean once you get it going it's
awfully<00:04:11.280> tough<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.790> stop<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.780> tractor<00:04:13.349> you

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
awfully tough to stop that tractor you

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.509 
awfully tough to stop that tractor you
get<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.610> in<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.819> right<00:04:14.970> gear<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.450> uh<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:17.400> know

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
get it in the right gear and uh you know

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.979 
get it in the right gear and uh you know
keep<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.880> RPMs<00:04:18.419> around<00:04:18.870> 2,200<00:04:19.680> it's<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:21.060> it's

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
keep the RPMs around 2,200 it's a it's

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.400 
keep the RPMs around 2,200 it's a it's
very<00:04:22.139> very<00:04:22.530> tough<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.919> start<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:24.810> may<00:04:24.990> spend<00:04:25.290> a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
very very tough to start you may spend a

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.830 
very very tough to start you may spend a
wheel<00:04:25.590> once<00:04:25.860> in<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.040> while<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:27.120> can<00:04:27.270> lock<00:04:27.690> the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
wheel once in a while you can lock the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.629 
wheel once in a while you can lock the
differential<00:04:28.230> on<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:28.710> phantom<00:04:29.130> it'll<00:04:29.400> just

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
differential on that phantom it'll just

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.629 
differential on that phantom it'll just
dry<00:04:30.120> long<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.810> just<00:04:30.960> go<00:04:31.169> enough<00:04:31.830> never<00:04:32.130> needed

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
dry long and just go enough never needed

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.659 
dry long and just go enough never needed
another<00:04:33.600> which<00:04:34.100> put<00:04:35.100> four<00:04:35.280> wheel<00:04:35.430> drive<00:04:35.639> on

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
another which put four wheel drive on

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.950 
another which put four wheel drive on
that<00:04:35.880> tractor<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.810> just<00:04:37.110> just<00:04:37.680> go

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.249 

let's<00:04:40.530> see<00:04:40.710> how<00:04:40.860> he<00:04:40.919> handles<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.639> up<00:04:42.080> pick<00:04:43.080> it

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
let's see how he handles that up pick it

00:04:43.259 --> 00:05:43.400 
let's see how he handles that up pick it
up<00:04:43.350> there

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.930 

there<00:05:44.410> we<00:05:44.560> go<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:46.060> done<00:05:46.360> it<00:05:47.430> look<00:05:48.430> at<00:05:48.550> that

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
there we go that done it look at that

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.600 
there we go that done it look at that
now<00:05:49.270> what<00:05:50.050> we<00:05:50.170> got<00:05:50.290> to<00:05:50.380> do<00:05:50.500> is<00:05:50.620> run<00:05:50.830> over<00:05:51.010> one

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
now what we got to do is run over one

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.460 
now what we got to do is run over one
more<00:05:51.730> times<00:05:52.030> but<00:05:52.510> the<00:05:52.630> big<00:05:52.780> stuff<00:05:53.050> is<00:05:53.230> knocked

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
more times but the big stuff is knocked

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.140 
more times but the big stuff is knocked
