00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
built for almost every device so that

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.679

and if you can have found with it and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.599 
and if you can have found with it and
that<00:00:24.990> trigger<00:00:25.289> them<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.070> won't<00:00:26.460> show<00:00:26.580> you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
that trigger them I won't show you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.960 
that trigger them I won't show you
because<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.449> uses<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:28.310> check<00:00:29.310> rod<00:00:29.519> features

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
because it uses some check rod features

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.780 
because it uses some check rod features
so<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> Tegra<00:00:31.050> 3<00:00:31.080> cpu<00:00:31.980> from<00:00:32.309> nvidia

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
so there is a Tegra 3 cpu from nvidia

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.819 
so there is a Tegra 3 cpu from nvidia
and<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.180> tablet<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.930> uses<00:00:34.320> some<00:00:34.469> special

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and this tablet and uses some special

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.590 
and this tablet and uses some special
effects<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.340> i<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> show<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
effects and i just want to show you the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.139 
effects and i just want to show you the
performance<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.680> game<00:00:37.890> let's<00:00:38.850> start<00:00:39.000> with

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
performance in the game let's start with

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.459 
performance in the game let's start with
Angry<00:00:39.480> Birds<00:00:44.660> until<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.170> standard

Angry Birds until just the standard
loading<00:00:46.829> speed<00:00:51.289> limit<00:00:52.289> down<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.590> volume<00:00:52.920> so

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
loading speed limit down in volume so

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.400 
loading speed limit down in volume so
that<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.579> still<00:00:53.820> hear<00:00:53.969> me<00:00:56.989> alright<00:00:57.989> so

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that you can still hear me alright so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.209 
that you can still hear me alright so
here's<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.250> course<00:00:59.460> performance<00:01:00.000> um<00:01:01.219> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
here's of course performance um of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.650 
here's of course performance um of
course<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.699> kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> performance<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.510> in

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
course just kind of performance and in

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179 
course just kind of performance and in
this<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.170> game<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.589> played<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.949> almost

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
this this game can be played on almost

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.899 
this this game can be played on almost
any<00:01:06.500> android<00:01:07.500> device<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.310> last<00:01:08.580> years

any android device from the last years

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.160 
any android device from the last years
and<00:01:09.570> since<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.020> built<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.710> purpose

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
coming for now I think the test we do

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.200 
coming for now I think the test we do
something<00:01:48.890> with<00:01:49.010> my<00:01:49.130> fingers<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:50.060> game

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
something with my fingers and the game

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.990 
something with my fingers and the game
is<00:01:50.330> performing<00:01:50.750> very<00:01:50.990> well<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:52.100> there<00:01:52.550> is<00:01:52.670> no

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
is performing very well so there is no

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.760 
is performing very well so there is no
problem<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.480> that<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:54.970> get<00:01:55.970> back<00:01:56.000> from<00:01:56.330> here

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
problem in that and get back from here

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.940 
problem in that and get back from here
yes<00:01:58.540> quit<00:01:59.540> alright<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.440> can<00:02:00.620> see<00:02:00.740> the

yes quit alright so you can see the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.650 
yes quit alright so you can see the
standard<00:02:01.400> performance<00:02:01.880> now<00:02:02.120> let's<00:02:02.330> go<00:02:02.450> into

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
standard performance now let's go into

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.360 
standard performance now let's go into
dead<00:02:02.810> trigger<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.710> game<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:06.980> can<00:02:07.130> see<00:02:07.160> in

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
the bottom this games AG requires

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.930 
the bottom this games AG requires
additional<00:02:14.470> performance<00:02:18.010> ok<00:02:19.010> i<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.610> want<00:02:19.910> to

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
additional performance ok i just want to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.330 
additional performance ok i just want to
show<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.150> some<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:21.470> two<00:02:21.650> minutes<00:02:21.830> it's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
show you some and just two minutes it's

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.300 
show you some and just two minutes it's
some<00:02:22.520> seconds<00:02:22.850> of<00:02:22.940> scenes<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:24.160> then<00:02:25.160> of

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
some seconds of scenes and then of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
some seconds of scenes and then of
course<00:02:25.370> take<00:02:25.790> some<00:02:26.030> more<00:02:26.150> time<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.750> load<00:02:26.900> that

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
course take some more time to load that

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.650 
not the strongest to be honest and
that's<00:03:42.990> why<00:03:43.260> gaming<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.660> entertainment
