00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.370
 to the devices and look at us 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.509
 little bit because here we have them 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.799
 namely already and you see it is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.400
 already a good size difference 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.480
 that he is out now it's up to and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.640
 I have already briefly in the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 I had to say in advance 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.210
 I thought that's the big thing 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.160
 Actually aid has also 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.390
 just a bit better sex though 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.699
 I am both here in the hand 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.080
 I have to say that honestly 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.949
 small feels shocking , of course 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 valuable 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.899
 it is also a corner thin and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.690
 whole corner easier and I could 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.910
 Imagine that apple user actually 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.280
 rather this device will be preferred here 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.829
 Apple users are in principle only times 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.559
 who got used to the four inch devices and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.239
 steve jobs were very high too 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.489
 Everything is conditioned about 4 inches 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.379
 completely meaningless, meaningless and free 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.000
 now apple has followed suit and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.469
 brought out weeks for large devices 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.820
 but well I say we come now 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.120
 Just a little bit around the device 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.640
 around 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.140
 here below the fingerprint in principle 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.180
 as always 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.979
 I see all this here why we have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.689
 of course no insurance 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.250
 the back is really beautiful 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.470
 and somebody know each other 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.900
 Apple symbol also changed that is 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.299
 now somehow insurance finished 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.240
 The camera of the garden is very light 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.000
 out the double led flash was now 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.540
 In comparison, we have made the round 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.549
 camera from the big on it too minimal 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.329
 bigger , no wonder here 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.619
 namely an optical one 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.570
 an image stabilizer 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.520
 who reduces something at the small something 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 there would be people saying that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.450
 we have the iphone at the big one here 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 6 and at the small the iphone 6 - 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.430
 because actually actually says missing 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.750
 a few a few spex and I watch 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.870
 now after the resolution 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.670
 So I am also objective and 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.280
 I try at least in the approach completely 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.830
 honestly the little one actually looks 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.310
 not really and sharper than that 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.410
 large with the small one much lower 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.010
 resolution display has to be the big one 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.570
 a full hd display does not do the little thing 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.440
 Now let's go for a bit 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.240
 The page around here is on the button 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.280
 page wandered like we did 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.530
 actually already knew and up 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.420
 the other side we have the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.770
 volume rocker as always with apple 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.959
 Everything worked very nice and again 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.250
 in small buttons around here quickly 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.720
 to make soundless so overall I am 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.250
 of course, that's a great pity now 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.709
 we do not care about them here 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.120
 devices come but does not matter 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.170
 but now we have her in the short 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.370
 hand and not just say 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.370
 I like that so far really good
