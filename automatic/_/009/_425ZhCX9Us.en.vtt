with dry skin if you have oily skin it's

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.940 
with dry skin if you have oily skin it's
fine<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.900> go<00:02:57.020> ahead<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.350> use<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.500> right<00:02:57.650> after

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
fine to go ahead and use it right after

I use it before on my cheeks and then I
can<00:03:05.870> moisturize<00:03:06.260> after<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:06.800> it<00:03:06.920> doesn't

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
can moisturize after so it doesn't

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.810
