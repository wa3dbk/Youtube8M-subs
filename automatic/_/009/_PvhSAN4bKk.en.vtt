00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.279
 yes people welcome to this 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.580
 That's what it should be, yes, yes 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.230
 be a third special and you will 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.770
 already on the terminal and in the title 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.020
 can read sorry sorry for mine too 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.820
 its out because unfortunately today no 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.530
 real special is actually came 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.670
 but did not prepare everything before 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.410
 worked out I know what to say 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.059
 was prepared you know all the time 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.730
 a dennis trainer jus no idea 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.920
 Herbert 3000 and he wanted me 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.579
 actually do one 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.079
 barren for 100 km that 100 track a 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.579
 bit for you but unfortunately 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.960
 For private reasons, I do not here 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.579
 Maybe he will call that 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.930
 At some point call what I do not believe 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.040
 because in his place I would have that 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.850
 not done that is honest 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.100
 did not say anything 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.420
 definitely has some private reasons 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.829
 I also have everything full 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.159
 understanding that he did not do that 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.040
 would have to plant I have to say who 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.049
 That's right, that's shit like that 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.640
 I say the fortieth he just has 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.079
 I had his reasons 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.060
 of course I accepted 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.290
 that you also do not know the reason 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.399
 if you would know the would you 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.159
 probably anyway say yes 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.299
 accepted that please so i got that 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.350
 little I have no moment I wanted 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.729
 actually and how they are in freestyle 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.890
 But then there would be such a football 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.420
 shit come out and there I have 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.830
 no bus and has to look for beats and yes 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.540
 no idea and then at some point 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.799
 shoot on it so it is such a 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.479
 right feet but just very nice 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.220
 what to write and then without me and 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.960
 but as people I have it not wanna 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.270

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.470
 coccyx heja door or something comes out 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.640

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.910
