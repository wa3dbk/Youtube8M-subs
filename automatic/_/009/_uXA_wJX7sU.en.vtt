00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
see around the graphics actually look

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.390 
see around the graphics actually look
very<00:01:29.159> good<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.990> really<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.220> mean

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
very good and I really like them I mean

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.940 
very good and I really like them I mean
I<00:01:33.000> can't<00:01:33.689> turn<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.140> full<00:01:34.409> because<00:01:34.680> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
I can't turn them on full because I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.679 
I can't turn them on full because I
don't<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.549> well<00:01:35.759> optimized<00:01:36.329> but

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
don't think it's very well optimized but

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.840 
don't think it's very well optimized but
it<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.530> lags<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.280> computer

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
it really lags out my computer

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.270 
it really lags out my computer
and<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.930> had<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.200> turn<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.650> high<00:01:41.830> quality

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
and I had to turn like the high quality

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.399 
and I had to turn like the high quality
water<00:01:42.460> off<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.240> stuff<00:01:43.570> on<00:01:43.720> down<00:01:43.930> but<00:01:44.170> I've<00:01:44.229> got

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
water off and stuff on down but I've got

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.490 
water off and stuff on down but I've got
them<00:01:44.500> pretty<00:01:44.680> high<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:46.320> even<00:01:47.320> though<00:01:47.409> I've

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
them pretty high and even though I've

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.560 
them pretty high and even though I've
got<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.650> pretty<00:01:47.920> good<00:01:48.070> graphics<00:01:48.520> card<00:01:48.820> but<00:01:49.300> it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
got a pretty good graphics card but it

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.469 
got a pretty good graphics card but it
still<00:01:49.810> looks<00:01:50.020> really<00:01:50.140> good

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
still looks really good

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.010 
still looks really good
also<00:01:52.770> yeah<00:01:54.100> there's<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.690> different<00:01:55.690> types<00:01:55.869> of

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
also yeah there's a different types of

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.170 
also yeah there's a different types of
control<00:01:56.440> methods<00:01:57.040> for<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.490> I'm<00:01:57.729> using<00:01:58.000> the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
control methods for this I'm using the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.990 
control methods for this I'm using the
arcade<00:01:58.690> one<00:01:58.960> with<00:01:59.110> an<00:01:59.229> Xbox<00:01:59.590> controller

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.320 

basically<00:02:04.000> ah<00:02:05.159> okay<00:02:06.159> wow<00:02:06.400> that's<00:02:07.000> like<00:02:07.180> you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
basically ah okay wow that's like you

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.900 
basically ah okay wow that's like you
know<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.890> partly<00:02:09.160> books<00:02:09.369> I'm<00:02:09.520> recording

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
know it's partly books I'm recording

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.150 
know it's partly books I'm recording
with<00:02:09.940> fraps<00:02:10.060> as<00:02:10.600> well<00:02:10.780> Langer's<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.260> out<00:02:11.380> but

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
with fraps as well Langer's it out but

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.080 
with fraps as well Langer's it out but
I'm<00:02:12.580> using<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.120> arcade<00:02:14.020> simulation<00:02:14.739> mode

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I'm using the arcade simulation mode

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.410 
I'm using the arcade simulation mode
which<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.620> much<00:02:17.620> easier<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.400> control<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:19.330> not

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
which is much easier to control it's not

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.420 
which is much easier to control it's not
like<00:02:19.780> properly<00:02:20.230> flying<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.739> plane<00:02:20.890> but<00:02:21.310> it's

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
like properly flying a plane but it's

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.070 
like properly flying a plane but it's
much<00:02:21.580> easier<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.030> turn<00:02:22.269> but<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.600> can't<00:02:22.870> do

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
much easier to turn but you can't do

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.100 
much easier to turn but you can't do
like<00:02:23.290> barrel<00:02:23.620> rolls<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.130> stuff<00:02:24.959> but<00:02:25.959> there's

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
like barrel rolls and stuff but there's

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.860 
like barrel rolls and stuff but there's
also<00:02:26.290> another<00:02:26.440> control<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.239> kind<00:02:28.780> of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
also another control so that kind of

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.220 
also another control so that kind of
uses<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.380> called<00:02:29.830> amp<00:02:30.540> simulation<00:02:31.540> mode<00:02:31.750> and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
uses that called amp simulation mode and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.790 
uses that called amp simulation mode and
that's<00:02:32.530> actually<00:02:32.800> very<00:02:33.220> difficult<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:34.120> use<00:02:34.390> I

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
that's actually very difficult to use I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.509 
that's actually very difficult to use I
find<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:36.250> basically<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.880> flying<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.360> plane

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
find is basically like flying a plane

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.790 
find is basically like flying a plane
properly<00:02:39.550> well<00:02:40.360> more<00:02:41.019> like<00:02:41.290> flying<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.680> plane

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
properly well more like flying a plane

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.670 
properly well more like flying a plane
properly<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.150> use<00:02:43.660> our<00:02:43.840> caveman<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.470> think

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
properly so I use our caveman I think

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.550 
properly so I use our caveman I think
most<00:02:44.860> people<00:02:45.010> will<00:02:45.310> who<00:02:45.549> use<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.910> game<00:02:46.560> but

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
most people will who use this game but

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.770 
most people will who use this game but
the<00:02:48.130> game<00:02:48.250> also<00:02:48.400> supports<00:02:48.610> like<00:02:49.060> joysticks

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the game also supports like joysticks

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.699 
the game also supports like joysticks
and<00:02:49.900> such<00:02:50.110> like

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
and such like

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.530 
and such like
so<00:02:51.040> yeah<00:02:51.250> it's<00:02:51.459> that's<00:02:51.730> that's<00:02:51.970> quite<00:02:52.180> good<00:02:52.420> in

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
so yeah it's that's that's quite good in

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.229 
so yeah it's that's that's quite good in
that<00:02:52.660> respect<00:02:54.150> yeah<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:57.579> aiming<00:02:58.120> I

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
that respect yeah and the aiming I

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.640 
that respect yeah and the aiming I
really<00:02:58.510> like<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.750> aiming<00:02:59.110> on<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.320> game<00:02:59.500> as

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
really like the aiming on the game as

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.729 
really like the aiming on the game as
well<00:02:59.799> there's<00:03:00.040> kind<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.310> these<00:03:01.320> red<00:03:02.320> things

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
well there's kind of these red things

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.259 
well there's kind of these red things
that<00:03:02.980> appear<00:03:03.280> where<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.790> tells<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.120> how<00:03:04.209> to

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
that appear where it tells you how to

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.090 
that appear where it tells you how to
shoot<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.930> get<00:03:05.049> down<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.410> that's<00:03:05.590> fairly<00:03:05.950> easy

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
shoot to get down so that's fairly easy

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.449 
shoot to get down so that's fairly easy
really<00:03:06.790> again<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.570> much<00:03:08.560> more<00:03:08.829> difficult<00:03:09.340> to

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
really again it's much more difficult to

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.790 
really again it's much more difficult to
aim<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.170> like

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
aim and like

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.130 
aim and like
in<00:03:13.420> simulation<00:03:14.420> mode<00:03:14.660> but<00:03:15.080> yeah<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:17.330> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
in simulation mode but yeah and the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.240 
in simulation mode but yeah and the
gameplay<00:03:18.380> is<00:03:18.950> actually<00:03:19.400> really<00:03:19.880> fun<00:03:21.250> there's

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
gameplay is actually really fun there's

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.520 
gameplay is actually really fun there's
lots<00:03:22.520> of<00:03:22.670> different<00:03:23.030> maps<00:03:23.270> there's<00:03:23.870> this<00:03:24.200> this

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
lots of different maps there's this this

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.610 
lots of different maps there's this this
is<00:03:24.710> Pearl<00:03:24.980> Harbor<00:03:25.520> and<00:03:25.700> like<00:03:26.450> for<00:03:26.990> example<00:03:27.410> on

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
is Pearl Harbor and like for example on

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.800 
is Pearl Harbor and like for example on
this<00:03:27.890> level<00:03:28.130> your<00:03:28.730> object<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.270> never<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.690> like

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
this level your object is never to like

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.450 
this level your object is never to like
get<00:03:30.050> all<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.410> planes<00:03:30.680> it's<00:03:31.010> just<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.340> like

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
get all the planes it's just to like

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.640 
get all the planes it's just to like
shoot<00:03:31.820> as<00:03:31.910> many<00:03:32.090> down<00:03:32.390> as<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.930> really<00:03:33.350> and

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
shoot as many down as you can really and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.990 
shoot as many down as you can really and
I'm<00:03:33.770> playing<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.100> easier<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.490> moments<00:03:34.850> I'm<00:03:34.940> a

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
I'm playing on easier the moments I'm a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.110 
I'm playing on easier the moments I'm a
bit<00:03:35.180> crap<00:03:35.450> at<00:03:35.600> it<00:03:35.720> but<00:03:36.940> you've<00:03:37.940> got<00:03:38.090> a

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
bit crap at it but you've got a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.570 
bit crap at it but you've got a
different<00:03:38.300> kind<00:03:38.870> of<00:03:39.160> objectives<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.250> got<00:03:40.400> to

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
different kind of objectives you got to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.460 
different kind of objectives you got to
do<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.030> love<00:03:41.210> the<00:03:41.360> way<00:03:41.510> everything's<00:03:42.290> very

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
do and I love the way everything's very

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.740 
do and I love the way everything's very
realistic<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.430> love<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.700> way<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.940> planes<00:03:44.270> for

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
realistic I love the way the planes for

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.500 
realistic I love the way the planes for
when<00:03:44.990> you<00:03:45.110> shot<00:03:45.380> them<00:03:45.500> down<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.880> aiming<00:03:47.300> for

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
when you shot them down the aiming for

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.360 
when you shot them down the aiming for
bombs<00:03:47.780> if<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.230> want<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.440> drop<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.650> bomb<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:49.160> very

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
good you see that on the ground and then

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.230 
good you see that on the ground and then
there's<00:03:51.680> also<00:03:51.860> like<00:03:52.250> if<00:03:52.490> you<00:03:52.640> with<00:03:52.940> certain

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
there's also like if you with certain

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.180 
there's also like if you with certain
bombs<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:53.660> can<00:03:53.810> press<00:03:54.140> a<00:03:54.440> button<00:03:54.830> and<00:03:55.100> it

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
bombs you can press a button and it

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.100 
bombs you can press a button and it
gives<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.880> like<00:03:56.060> an<00:03:56.210> aiming<00:03:56.630> thing<00:03:56.840> for<00:03:57.050> the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
gives you like an aiming thing for the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.680 
gives you like an aiming thing for the
bomb<00:03:57.320> so<00:03:58.010> that's<00:03:58.190> all<00:03:58.400> very<00:03:58.550> good<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:59.210> really

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
bomb so that's all very good I really

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.550 
bomb so that's all very good I really
enjoy<00:04:00.020> it<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.380> think<00:04:00.590> it's<00:04:00.710> really<00:04:00.890> fun<00:04:01.780> yeah

there<00:04:04.070> are<00:04:04.220> however<00:04:04.430> like<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.820> few<00:04:05.030> problems

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
there are however like a few problems

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.910 
there are however like a few problems
with<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.750> was<00:04:06.020> playing<00:04:06.260> one<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:06.500> the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
with that I was playing one of the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.230 
with that I was playing one of the
campaign<00:04:07.580> maps<00:04:07.820> where<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.060> had<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.420> use<00:04:08.630> them

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
campaign maps where you had to use them

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.600 
campaign maps where you had to use them
you<00:04:11.240> have<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.600> use<00:04:11.920> torpedoes<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.190> shoot<00:04:13.370> down

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
you have to use torpedoes to shoot down

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.390 
you have to use torpedoes to shoot down
some<00:04:13.820> boats<00:04:14.090> which<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:15.170> sounds<00:04:15.740> very<00:04:15.860> fun<00:04:16.220> and

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
some boats which is sounds very fun and

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.280 
some boats which is sounds very fun and
they<00:04:16.549> are<00:04:16.580> very<00:04:16.910> fun<00:04:17.120> really<00:04:17.359> but<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:17.989> took<00:04:18.109> me

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
they are very fun really but it took me

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.240 
they are very fun really but it took me
ages<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:19.190> figure<00:04:19.520> out<00:04:20.650> how<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.709> use<00:04:22.070> the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
ages to figure out how to use the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.580 
ages to figure out how to use the
torpedoes<00:04:22.960> because<00:04:23.960> I<00:04:24.200> thought<00:04:24.470> you<00:04:24.560> just

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
torpedoes because I thought you just

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.830 
torpedoes because I thought you just
fire<00:04:24.950> torpedoes<00:04:25.610> like<00:04:25.850> on<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.090> water<00:04:26.300> and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
fire torpedoes like on the water and

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.480 
fire torpedoes like on the water and
they<00:04:27.170> could<00:04:27.410> go<00:04:27.560> in

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
they could go in

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.550 
they could go in
then<00:04:29.060> hit<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.389> boat<00:04:29.599> but<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.870> was<00:04:30.289> more

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
then hit the boat but it was more

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.839 
then hit the boat but it was more
difficult<00:04:30.770> than<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.340> thought<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:31.699> would<00:04:31.789> be

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
difficult than you thought it would be

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.240 
difficult than you thought it would be
there<00:04:32.150> are<00:04:32.240> very<00:04:32.449> long<00:04:32.660> range<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.199> know<00:04:33.410> but<00:04:34.220> I

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
there are very long range you know but I

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.620 
there are very long range you know but I
got<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:34.520> hang<00:04:34.669> of<00:04:34.789> it<00:04:34.849> in<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.030> end<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.240> then<00:04:35.389> I

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
got a hang of it in the end and then I

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.969 
got a hang of it in the end and then I
did<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.960> was<00:04:36.080> very<00:04:36.289> fun<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.650> sex<00:04:37.009> like<00:04:37.220> also<00:04:38.180> am

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
did it was very fun and sex like also am

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.409 
did it was very fun and sex like also am
it<00:04:39.979> kind<00:04:40.190> of<00:04:40.250> plays<00:04:40.490> with<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.789> SAP<00:04:41.090> if<00:04:41.270> you

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
it kind of plays with the SAP if you

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.170 
it kind of plays with the SAP if you
look<00:04:41.599> at<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.810> bottom<00:04:42.169> there<00:04:43.130> you've<00:04:44.120> got

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
look at the bottom there you've got

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.089 
look at the bottom there you've got
loads<00:04:44.630> of<00:04:44.840> different<00:04:44.990> planes<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.770> basically

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
loads of different planes and basically

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.150 
loads of different planes and basically
if<00:04:46.310> one<00:04:46.490> plane<00:04:46.849> runs<00:04:47.180> out<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.360> ammo<00:04:47.949> you<00:04:48.949> are

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
if one plane runs out of ammo you are

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.860 
if one plane runs out of ammo you are
you<00:04:49.490> can<00:04:49.699> press<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.060> button<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.539> it<00:04:50.630> switches

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
you can press the button and it switches

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.390 
you can press the button and it switches
to<00:04:51.020> next<00:04:51.380> plane<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.740> other<00:04:51.770> plane<00:04:52.190> goes

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
to next plane and the other plane goes

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.460 
to next plane and the other plane goes
and<00:04:52.580> refuel<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:53.990> suchlike<00:04:55.389> which<00:04:56.389> is<00:04:56.599> which

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
and refuel and suchlike which is which

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.200 
and refuel and suchlike which is which
is<00:04:57.500> really<00:04:57.949> realistic<00:04:58.430> as<00:04:58.550> well<00:04:58.580> when<00:04:58.940> one

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
is really realistic as well when one

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.749 
is really realistic as well when one
gets<00:04:59.389> shot<00:04:59.690> down<00:04:59.979> you<00:05:00.979> get<00:05:01.130> shot<00:05:01.400> down<00:05:01.550> you

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
gets shot down you get shot down you

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.879 
gets shot down you get shot down you
can't<00:05:02.000> play<00:05:02.240> as<00:05:02.419> him<00:05:02.599> again<00:05:02.930> for<00:05:03.110> example<00:05:03.740> one

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
can't play as him again for example one

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.149 
can't play as him again for example one
I<00:05:04.159> think<00:05:04.520> that<00:05:04.639> that<00:05:04.880> really<00:05:05.180> adds<00:05:05.330> kind<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:05.840> a

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
I think that that really adds kind of a

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.710 
I think that that really adds kind of a
lot<00:05:07.159> of<00:05:07.190> realism<00:05:07.699> to<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.030> game<00:05:08.300> I<00:05:08.449> don't<00:05:08.539> even

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
lot of realism to the game I don't even

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.909 
lot of realism to the game I don't even
know<00:05:08.930> what<00:05:09.080> I'm<00:05:09.169> meant<00:05:09.289> to<00:05:09.380> be<00:05:09.500> doing<00:05:09.650> there<00:05:09.889> I

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
know what I'm meant to be doing there I

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.680 
know what I'm meant to be doing there I
think<00:05:10.130> I'm<00:05:10.310> I'm<00:05:10.580> not<00:05:10.759> protecting<00:05:11.060> those<00:05:11.419> good

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
think I'm I'm not protecting those good

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.219 
think I'm I'm not protecting those good
idea<00:05:12.819> so<00:05:13.819> yeah<00:05:13.970> it's<00:05:14.599> very<00:05:14.659> fun<00:05:14.990> in<00:05:15.080> that

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
idea so yeah it's very fun in that

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.110 
idea so yeah it's very fun in that
respect<00:05:15.590> there's<00:05:15.740> also<00:05:15.860> like<00:05:16.159> a<00:05:16.220> few<00:05:16.610> as<00:05:17.060> I

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
respect there's also like a few as I

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.809 
respect there's also like a few as I
said<00:05:17.449> optimisation<00:05:18.349> I<00:05:18.440> think<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:19.009> graphics

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
said optimisation I think the graphics

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.100 
said optimisation I think the graphics
are<00:05:20.650> fantastic<00:05:22.389> in<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:23.659> respect<00:05:24.020> that

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
are fantastic in the respect that

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.499 
are fantastic in the respect that
they've<00:05:24.259> run<00:05:24.470> on<00:05:24.710> very<00:05:24.919> low<00:05:25.280> range<00:05:25.699> computers

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
they've run on very low range computers

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.649 
they've run on very low range computers
I<00:05:27.139> try<00:05:27.830> to<00:05:27.889> distort<00:05:28.159> my<00:05:28.370> friends<00:05:28.699> laptop<00:05:29.300> it

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
I try to distort my friends laptop it

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.140 
I try to distort my friends laptop it
crashed<00:05:30.530> all<00:05:30.889> the<00:05:31.130> time<00:05:31.370> when<00:05:31.520> we<00:05:31.639> start<00:05:31.880> up<00:05:32.000> it

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
crashed all the time when we start up it

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.640 
crashed all the time when we start up it
hasn't<00:05:32.389> crashed<00:05:32.570> on<00:05:32.780> mine<00:05:32.960> actually<00:05:33.409> but<00:05:33.590> it

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
hasn't crashed on mine actually but it

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.839 
hasn't crashed on mine actually but it
did<00:05:33.800> on<00:05:33.830> his<00:05:34.130> and<00:05:34.340> he's<00:05:34.460> got<00:05:34.639> very<00:05:34.789> good

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
did on his and he's got very good

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.029 
did on his and he's got very good
laptops<00:05:35.419> though<00:05:35.630> there's<00:05:36.530> a<00:05:36.620> few<00:05:36.860> problems

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
laptops though there's a few problems

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.709 
laptops though there's a few problems
but<00:05:37.280> overall<00:05:37.820> I<00:05:37.880> think<00:05:37.969> it's<00:05:38.210> a<00:05:38.300> really<00:05:38.509> fun

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:38.719 
but overall I think it's a really fun

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.719 
but overall I think it's a really fun
game<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:39.199> think<00:05:39.380> you<00:05:39.440> should<00:05:39.590> give<00:05:39.919> it<00:05:40.009> a<00:05:40.039> go<00:05:40.219> go

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
game I think you should give it a go go

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.860 
game I think you should give it a go go
by<00:05:40.940> ever<00:05:41.419> know<00:05:41.930> if<00:05:41.990> it's<00:05:42.110> quite<00:05:42.380> worth<00:05:42.650> 20<00:05:43.009> to<00:05:43.870> 1
