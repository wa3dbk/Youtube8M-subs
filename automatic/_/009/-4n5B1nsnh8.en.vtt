00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
bad situation then the last one was a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.069 
bad situation then the last one was a
rocket<00:01:28.369> launcher<00:01:28.789> I<00:01:29.030> came<00:01:29.659> in<00:01:29.780> handy<00:01:29.929> because

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
rocket launcher I came in handy because

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.080 
rocket launcher I came in handy because
as<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.469> progresses<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.130> gets<00:01:31.280> harder<00:01:31.610> that's

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
as it progresses and gets harder that's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.389 
as it progresses and gets harder that's

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.529 
good or bad way it just it didn't feel
like<00:01:43.220> COD<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.729> did<00:01:43.819> it<00:01:43.909> for<00:01:44.030> like<00:01:44.119> battlefield

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
like COD it did it for like battlefield

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.240 
like COD it did it for like battlefield
and<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:45.170> did<00:01:45.289> it's<00:01:45.409> like<00:01:45.530> destiny<00:01:45.979> felt<00:01:46.159> like

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
and it did it's like destiny felt like

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.949 
and it did it's like destiny felt like
its<00:01:46.369> own<00:01:46.460> game<00:01:46.670> absolutely<00:01:47.569> it<00:01:47.630> was<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:47.869> much

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
its own game absolutely it was so much

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.139 
its own game absolutely it was so much
fun<00:01:48.020> i<00:01:48.530> would<00:01:49.130> say<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.610> felt<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:49.970> everything

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
fun i would say it felt like everything

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.580 
fun i would say it felt like everything
was<00:01:50.270> hip<00:01:50.479> fire<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:50.990> i<00:01:51.049> saw<00:01:51.229> that<00:01:51.380> in<00:01:51.530> a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
was hip fire and i saw that in a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.719 
was hip fire and i saw that in a
multiple<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.979> trial<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:52.490> looks<00:01:52.610> like

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
multiple a trial is like it looks like

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.070 
multiple a trial is like it looks like
everyone's<00:01:53.030> hip<00:01:53.149> find<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:53.539> really<00:01:53.720> no<00:01:53.840> need<00:01:53.959> to

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
everyone's hip find is really no need to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.440 
everyone's hip find is really no need to
aim<00:01:54.170> down<00:01:54.319> sight<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.429> for<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.640> most<00:01:55.759> part<00:01:55.939> you

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
aim down sight so for the most part you

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.419 
aim down sight so for the most part you
could<00:01:56.599> kill<00:01:57.140> enemies<00:01:57.500> from<00:01:57.619> far<00:01:57.860> away<00:01:57.890> just<00:01:58.310> by

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
could kill enemies from far away just by

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.070 
could kill enemies from far away just by
hip<00:01:58.580> firing<00:01:58.849> the<00:01:59.000> way<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.569> reticle<00:01:59.869> works

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
hip firing the way the reticle works

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.139 
hip firing the way the reticle works
what<00:02:00.740> else<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:00.979> there<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.849> we<00:02:01.970> were<00:02:02.060> on

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
what else is there so we were on

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.550 
what else is there so we were on
Tatooine<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.659> then<00:02:02.929> it<00:02:03.049> starts<00:02:03.319> off<00:02:03.409> with

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
Tatooine and then it starts off with

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.080 
Tatooine and then it starts off with
just<00:02:03.740> like<00:02:03.860> your<00:02:04.009> regular<00:02:04.130> waves<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.819> enemies

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
just like your regular waves of enemies

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.699 
just like your regular waves of enemies
coming<00:02:05.299> after<00:02:05.569> you<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:05.689> then<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.289> objectives

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
coming after you and then the objectives

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.740 
coming after you and then the objectives
start<00:02:06.890> coming<00:02:07.099> around<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.670> then<00:02:07.789> yeah<00:02:08.450> you

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
start coming around and then yeah you

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.839 
start coming around and then yeah you
have<00:02:08.840> multiple<00:02:09.019> lives<00:02:09.530> or<00:02:10.099> I<00:02:10.130> think<00:02:10.549> you<00:02:10.670> can

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
have multiple lives or I think you can

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.809 
have multiple lives or I think you can
wait<00:02:11.030> for<00:02:11.060> your<00:02:11.599> co-op<00:02:12.530> member<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.220> finish<00:02:13.670> off

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
wait for your co-op member to finish off

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.830 
wait for your co-op member to finish off
the<00:02:13.940> wave<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.329> then<00:02:14.420> come<00:02:14.660> back

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
the wave and then come back

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.050 
the wave and then come back
that<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.709> map<00:02:17.190> was<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.580> lower<00:02:17.730> side<00:02:17.940> of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
that the map was in the lower side of

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.220 
that the map was in the lower side of
the<00:02:18.120> screen<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.569> felt<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:18.840> destiny

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
the screen and it felt like destiny
