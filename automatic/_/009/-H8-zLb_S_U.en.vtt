obviously<00:00:32.430> gone<00:00:32.640> down<00:00:32.850> 71<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:33.809> he's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
obviously gone down 71 just because he's

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.810

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
moved away from a striker but because of

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630
