00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.650
 when evaluating the whole package 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.810
 second to fall 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.930
 Andrei was looking for a video on the Internet but 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.589
 about unpacked video reviews 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.439
 but we have very few of them so far 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.899
 so to help you decide to make your 

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.999
 own video review 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.309
 today it will only be unpacking 

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:25.309
 further, of course, there will be a full video of eyes 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.980
 what are you interested in ipat 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.810
 just write no comments 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 affecting the full view 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.260
 let's start unpacking 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
 remake strip merike 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.070
 still found the source 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.810
 London 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.580
 so I figured out parking 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.710
 look at the box 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.920
 white model 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.890
 Naturally if you take black 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.170
 approach will be black 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.270
 model 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.110
 left caliphate 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 bottom change apple 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
 so with 10 16 gigabytes 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.460
 I don't need more anymore of course if he has a man 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.340
 like to watch the video 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.580
 the house needs to be taken more recall that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.850
 they 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.510
 all four 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.510
 poet's book 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.220
 or in spain 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.360
 I am a man therefore what 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.610
 Sasha prices at the opening of the Internet 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.670
 I will spend a lot more money 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 very good on myself 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.900
 took plastic 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.740
 open the box 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.740
 ah pad the second 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.349
 packing cost 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.409
 first shchenii 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.799
 much thinner 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.489
 first pair 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.489
 recall that it is exactly 33 percent 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.279
 so take off 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.019
 postpone until you remember see 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.019
 that part of the box 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.559

 charging 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.719
 Americans of course x 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.079
 set aside 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.439
 so on the front side 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.439
 we have a camera for a freestyle disco 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.740
 cube tons 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.059

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.029
 she preserved it for who came to us 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:06.029
 roll over 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.209

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 login unconnected successfully 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.319

 much more of course 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.210
 inevitably dangerous 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.389
 very fast 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.770
 in general, like all devices 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.219
 training 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.729
 impractical in this regard 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.340
