00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
button but it just doesn't work because

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.549 
button but it just doesn't work because
your<00:00:38.790> app<00:00:38.940> switcher<00:00:39.420> pops<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.960> when<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.379> try

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
to do that but you also don't want to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.600 
to do that but you also don't want to
substitute<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:43.950> apps<00:00:44.250> which<00:00:44.460> are

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
substitute your apps which are

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
substitute your apps which are
completely<00:00:45.000> because<00:00:45.570> you're<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.870> able<00:00:46.140> in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
any sort of way to close any of these

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.170 
any sort of way to close any of these
applications<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.010> try<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> hold<00:00:50.670> down<00:00:50.940> on

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
applications I can try to hold down on

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
applications I can try to hold down on
them<00:00:51.449> nothing<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.110> happen<00:00:52.140> no<00:00:52.710> jiggling<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
them nothing will happen no jiggling it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.459 
them nothing will happen no jiggling it
will<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.670> open<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.210> application<00:00:55.020> which

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
will just open up that application which

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.380 
will just open up that application which
I've<00:00:55.680> tapped<00:00:55.980> down<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.460> let's<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.120> ahead<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
I've tapped down on let's go ahead and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270 
I've tapped down on let's go ahead and
use<00:00:57.510> our<00:00:57.629> activator<00:00:58.079> action<00:00:58.440> once<00:00:58.649> again<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
use our activator action once again and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.889 
use our activator action once again and
you'll<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.510> scroll<00:01:00.840> through

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you'll see that we can scroll through

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
you'll see that we can scroll through
all<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.590> our<00:01:01.739> most<00:01:02.010> recently<00:01:02.670> opened

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
all of our most recently opened

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.140 
all of our most recently opened
applications<00:01:03.809> which<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:04.920> awesome<00:01:05.159> but

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
applications which is pretty awesome but

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
applications which is pretty awesome but
it<00:01:06.450> doesn't<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.439> all<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.100> features<00:01:08.460> of

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it doesn't have all of the features of

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.460 
it doesn't have all of the features of
the<00:01:08.970> app<00:01:09.150> switcher<00:01:09.630> which<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:10.110> sucks

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the app switcher which really sucks

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.130 
the app switcher which really sucks
because<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> nice-looking<00:01:12.140> substitute

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
because it is a nice-looking substitute

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
because it is a nice-looking substitute
for<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> app<00:01:13.680> switcher<00:01:13.979> let's<00:01:14.640> go<00:01:14.790> ahead<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
for the app switcher let's go ahead and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
Board settings all you can do is enable

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
Board settings all you can do is enable
it<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.659> disable<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.770> also<00:01:22.920> set

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it or disable it and you can also set

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.880 
it or disable it and you can also set
the<00:01:23.520> activation<00:01:24.270> method<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.229> once

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the activation method right there once

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.160 
the activation method right there once
again<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.369> would<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:27.000> cool<00:01:27.330> app<00:01:27.630> switcher

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
again this would be a cool app switcher

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.859 
again this would be a cool app switcher
if<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:29.040> able<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.520> close<00:01:29.759> applications<00:01:30.540> as

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
if it was able to close applications as

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.620 
if it was able to close applications as
well<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.500> allow<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.820> substitute<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
well as allow it to substitute the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.179 
well as allow it to substitute the
double<00:01:33.900> tap<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.229> home<00:01:34.409> button<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.070> app

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
double tap the home button for the app

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.760 
double tap the home button for the app
switcher<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.479> doesn't<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.350> those<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
switcher but it doesn't for those of you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
switcher but it doesn't for those of you
who<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.040> still<00:01:38.310> interested<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> tweak

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
