with a PB 2000 and playing a TDM

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.099 
with a PB 2000 and playing a TDM
obviously<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.350> derail<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.250> i<00:00:24.019> actually<00:00:25.019> went

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
obviously on derail and i actually went

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.080 
obviously on derail and i actually went
through<00:00:25.289> all<00:00:25.529> my<00:00:25.740> old<00:00:25.769> videos<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.609> i<00:00:26.910> have

through all my old videos and i have

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.009

never posted any match on derail before
and<00:00:31.700> I<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.329> goes<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.840> show<00:00:34.020> you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.790 
and I think that just goes to show you
how<00:00:34.500> much<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.070> dislike<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.059> map<00:00:36.800> especially

the TDM based game domination is okay

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
the TDM based game domination is okay
because<00:00:40.140> there's<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.469> clear<00:00:40.770> objective<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.520> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
because there's a clear objective but in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.450 
because there's a clear objective but in
the<00:00:42.270> TDM<00:00:42.629> based<00:00:42.870> game<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.920> how<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> play

this on this match it never seems to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.530 
this on this match it never seems to

score<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.110> its<00:01:10.290> game<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.979> think<00:01:11.700> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
score there in its game that I think is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.320 
score there in its game that I think is
the<00:01:11.939> reason<00:01:12.119> why<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.750> reached<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.140> full<00:01:13.350> 7500

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
the reason why it reached a full 7500

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.230 
the reason why it reached a full 7500
but<00:01:15.330> yeah<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> standard<00:01:16.200> 66<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.280> said<00:01:17.520> and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.490 
of 40 and the minimum damage of 20 and
like<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.150> said<00:02:33.210> anytime<00:02:33.510> using<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.990> sound<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.440> you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
like I said anytime using a sound so you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.850 
like I said anytime using a sound so you
can<00:02:34.680> always<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.580> assumed<00:02:35.880> minimum<00:02:36.270> damage

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
can always I just assumed minimum damage

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.610 
can always I just assumed minimum damage
don't<00:02:37.860> really<00:02:38.250> downside<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:40.530> have

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
don't really downside to it is you have

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.410 
don't really downside to it is you have
limit<00:02:40.950> amount<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.280> ammo<00:02:41.430> which<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.880> reasonable

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
limit amount of ammo which is reasonable

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.760 
limit amount of ammo which is reasonable
because<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:42.960> supposed<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.290> submachine

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
because it's supposed to be submachine

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.220 
because it's supposed to be submachine
gun<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.240> started<00:02:45.240> supposed<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.720> be<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> secondary

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
gun I started supposed to be a secondary

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.690 
gun I started supposed to be a secondary
weapon<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.860> shouldn't<00:02:47.100> be<00:02:47.160> using<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.580> like

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
weapon so you shouldn't be using it like

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.990 
weapon so you shouldn't be using it like
I<00:02:47.880> am<00:02:48.060> as<00:02:48.720> your<00:02:48.960> primary<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:50.580> has<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> pretty

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
I am as your primary and it has a pretty

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.230 
I am as your primary and it has a pretty
small<00:02:51.480> clip<00:02:51.780> size<00:02:51.990> at<00:02:52.320> 20<00:02:52.680> rounds<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.520> when

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
small clip size at 20 rounds and when

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.580 
small clip size at 20 rounds and when
you<00:02:54.330> especially<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.720> you're<00:02:54.810> using<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:55.290> sound

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
you especially if you're using a sound

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.810 
you especially if you're using a sound
so<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.100> means<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.430> probably<00:02:56.580> owe<00:02:56.730> me

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
so that means you probably owe me

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.540 
so that means you probably owe me
anything<00:02:57.000> about<00:02:57.180> half<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.750> clip<00:02:57.990> or

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
anything about half the clip or

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.770 
anything about half the clip or
sometimes<00:02:59.550> even<00:02:59.670> three<00:02:59.790> quarters<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.540> clip

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
sometimes even three quarters of a clip

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.470 
sometimes even three quarters of a clip
before<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.140> kick<00:03:01.290> down<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> guy<00:03:02.150> but<00:03:03.150> overall

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
before you kick down a guy but overall

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.090 
before you kick down a guy but overall
it's<00:03:03.720> still<00:03:03.960> pretty<00:03:04.080> decent<00:03:04.500> as<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> secondary

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
it's still pretty decent as a secondary

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.700 
it's still pretty decent as a secondary
and<00:03:05.660> what<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.050> really<00:03:07.200> like<00:03:07.440> about<00:03:07.560> it

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
and what I like it really like about it

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.220 
and what I like it really like about it
not<00:03:07.980> only<00:03:08.100> does<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.430> have<00:03:08.670> very<00:03:09.360> low<00:03:09.570> recoil<00:03:09.780> or

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
not only does it have very low recoil or

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.200 
not only does it have very low recoil or
non-existent<00:03:10.890> recoil<00:03:11.220> but<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.700> iron<00:03:11.820> sights

that<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.709> wouldn't<00:03:38.160> want<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.550> use<00:03:38.760> at<00:03:39.270> all<00:03:39.330> and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
that I wouldn't want to use at all and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.900 
that I wouldn't want to use at all and
for<00:03:40.650> some<00:03:40.800> reason<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:41.070> died<00:03:41.310> with<00:03:41.520> that<00:03:41.670> no<00:03:41.790> one

for some reason I died with that no one
would<00:03:42.090> want<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.390> pick<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.570> up<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.320> I<00:03:43.709> don't

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
would want to pick it up and I don't

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.620 
would want to pick it up and I don't
think<00:03:43.980> anyone<00:03:44.370> would<00:03:44.520> pick<00:03:44.820> up<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.090> vector<00:03:45.480> with

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630

think anyone would pick up a vector with
an<00:03:45.750> acog<00:03:46.110> site<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:47.600> that's<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.780> reasoning<00:03:49.170> for

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
an acog site so that's the reasoning for

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.340 
an acog site so that's the reasoning for
that<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:50.360> silenced<00:03:51.360> weapons<00:03:51.750> especially<00:03:52.050> if

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
that and silenced weapons especially if

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.630 
that and silenced weapons especially if
you're<00:03:52.440> just<00:03:52.560> starting<00:03:52.650> off<00:03:53.010> playing<00:03:53.400> call

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
you're just starting off playing call

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.170 
you're just starting off playing call
you<00:03:53.910> dr<00:03:54.239> r<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.170> your<00:03:55.320> best<00:03:55.470> bet<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.980> couple<00:03:56.910> times

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
you dr r is your best bet a couple times

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.350 
you dr r is your best bet a couple times
in<00:03:57.300> this<00:03:57.420> game<00:03:57.739> some<00:03:58.739> reason<00:03:58.770> use<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.090> spawn

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
in this game some reason use the spawn

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.810 
in this game some reason use the spawn
system<00:04:00.570> was<00:04:00.810> off<00:04:00.989> or<00:04:01.230> something<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.890> like

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
system was off or something and like

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.820 
system was off or something and like
that<00:04:03.660> i<00:04:03.690> think<00:04:03.750> like<00:04:04.050> three<00:04:04.260> double<00:04:04.650> kills

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
that i think like three double kills

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.020 
that i think like three double kills
this<00:04:05.010> game<00:04:05.190> or<00:04:05.340> something<00:04:05.610> like<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.760> and

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
this game or something like that and

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.360 
this game or something like that and
basically<00:04:06.450> what<00:04:06.870> happened<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.370> different

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
basically what happened is different

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.460 
basically what happened is different
either<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:09.390> other<00:04:09.600> thing<00:04:09.810> was<00:04:09.900> camping<00:04:10.350> out

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
either the other thing was camping out

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.900 
either the other thing was camping out
right<00:04:10.830> behind<00:04:10.950> me<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.310> i<00:04:11.489> was<00:04:11.580> just<00:04:11.760> in<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.880> good

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
right behind me and i was just in a good

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.540 
right behind me and i was just in a good
spot<00:04:12.330> at<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.200> right<00:04:13.320> time<00:04:13.650> or<00:04:13.680> for<00:04:14.400> some

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
spot at the right time or for some

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.839 
spot at the right time or for some
reason<00:04:14.910> they<00:04:15.030> respond<00:04:15.510> them<00:04:15.720> behind<00:04:15.989> million

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
reason they respond them behind million

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.710 
reason they respond them behind million
that's<00:04:17.849> basically<00:04:18.000> how<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.269> want<00:04:18.509> to<00:04:18.539> play<00:04:18.659> a

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
that's basically how you want to play a

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.199 
that's basically how you want to play a
silenced<00:04:19.079> weapon<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.440> wanted<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:20.370> get<00:04:20.909> deep

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
silenced weapon you wanted to get deep

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.210 
silenced weapon you wanted to get deep
into<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.629> bond<00:04:21.989> with<00:04:22.259> a<00:04:22.289> sonce<00:04:22.590> weapon<00:04:23.039> and

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
into this bond with a sonce weapon and

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.279 
into this bond with a sonce weapon and
then<00:04:23.400> unload<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.270> keep<00:04:24.389> them<00:04:24.539> trapped<00:04:24.840> there

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
then unload and keep them trapped there

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.469 
then unload and keep them trapped there
but<00:04:26.069> it's<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.310> little<00:04:26.520> bit<00:04:26.610> harder<00:04:26.940> on<00:04:27.060> derail

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
but it's a little bit harder on derail

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.200 
but it's a little bit harder on derail
because<00:04:27.900> usually<00:04:28.440> what<00:04:28.860> happens<00:04:28.889> is<00:04:29.400> once<00:04:30.060> you

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
because usually what happens is once you

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.760 
because usually what happens is once you
kill<00:04:30.389> a<00:04:30.419> guy<00:04:30.599> they<00:04:31.020> get<00:04:31.169> respond<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.740> other

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
kill a guy they get respond the other

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.409 
kill a guy they get respond the other
side<00:04:32.099> of<00:04:32.129> math<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:32.729> can<00:04:32.909> either<00:04:33.030> wait<00:04:33.300> it

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
side of math and you can either wait it

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.010 
side of math and you can either wait it
out<00:04:33.710> or<00:04:35.090> run<00:04:36.090> it<00:04:36.240> down<00:04:36.389> with<00:04:36.690> your<00:04:36.780> lightweight

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
out or run it down with your lightweight

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.290 
out or run it down with your lightweight
and<00:04:37.289> marathon<00:04:37.409> but<00:04:39.409> why<00:04:40.409> do<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:40.699> right<00:04:41.699> we

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
and marathon but why do that right we

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.450 
and marathon but why do that right we
just<00:04:42.569> kind<00:04:42.659> of<00:04:42.780> hold<00:04:42.930> down<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.229> fort

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
just kind of hold down the fort

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.589 
just kind of hold down the fort
especially<00:04:44.460> if<00:04:44.520> you're<00:04:44.639> using<00:04:44.669> a<00:04:45.030> secondary

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
especially if you're using a secondary

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.499 
especially if you're using a secondary
weapon<00:04:46.020> as<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.500> primary<00:04:46.889> weapon<00:04:47.400> which<00:04:47.699> is

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
weapon as a primary weapon which is

weapon as a primary weapon which is
something<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:49.110> also<00:04:49.259> don't<00:04:49.590> recommend<00:04:50.039> you<00:04:50.190> do

something I also don't recommend you do

something I also don't recommend you do

base situation the sea spawn or see
starting<00:05:02.159> spawn<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.550> lot<00:05:02.879> stronger<00:05:03.240> than

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449

there's no claim was being placed down
that's<00:05:27.719> usually<00:05:27.990> what<00:05:28.080> happens<00:05:28.110> in<00:05:28.500> this

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
that's usually what happens in this

enemies like to hold out this building

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.149 
enemies like to hold out this building
with<00:05:42.750> claymores<00:05:43.169> and<00:05:43.440> just<00:05:43.560> basically<00:05:43.710> can't

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
with claymores and just basically can't

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.790 
with claymores and just basically can't
the<00:05:44.340> entire<00:05:44.580> time<00:05:45.110> if<00:05:46.110> you're<00:05:46.289> playing<00:05:46.469> more

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
the entire time if you're playing more

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.540 
the entire time if you're playing more
defensive<00:05:47.370> style<00:05:47.580> then<00:05:48.090> I<00:05:48.509> would<00:05:49.520> guess<00:05:50.520> that

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
defensive style then I would guess that

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.700 
defensive style then I would guess that
works<00:05:50.940> that<00:05:51.389> would<00:05:51.509> work<00:05:51.659> it's<00:05:51.930> a<00:05:52.050> pretty

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
works that would work it's a pretty

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.249 
works that would work it's a pretty
solid<00:05:52.979> strategy<00:05:53.310> but<00:05:54.090> just<00:05:54.389> be<00:05:54.509> wary<00:05:54.690> of<00:05:54.930> the

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
solid strategy but just be wary of the

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.110 
solid strategy but just be wary of the
lightweight<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:55.860> marathon<00:05:56.039> people<00:05:56.729> who<00:05:56.940> will

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
lightweight and marathon people who will

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.170 
lightweight and marathon people who will
just<00:05:57.719> run<00:05:57.930> right<00:05:58.289> by<00:05:58.469> your<00:05:58.650> claymores<00:05:59.099> and<00:05:59.460> set

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
just run right by your claymores and set

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.140 
just run right by your claymores and set
them<00:06:00.330> off<00:06:00.449> so<00:06:00.719> keep<00:06:01.500> your<00:06:01.620> ears<00:06:01.740> open<00:06:01.979> and<00:06:02.490> if

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
them off so keep your ears open and if

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.399 
them off so keep your ears open and if
you<00:06:03.210> obviously<00:06:03.539> if<00:06:03.629> you're<00:06:03.719> using<00:06:03.870> claymores

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
you obviously if you're using claymores

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:06.800 
you obviously if you're using claymores
then<00:06:04.529> you<00:06:05.400> should<00:06:05.580> have<00:06:05.610> scavenger<00:06:06.449> just<00:06:06.690> so

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
then you should have scavenger just so

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.350 
then you should have scavenger just so
you<00:06:06.870> can<00:06:07.050> continuously<00:06:07.620> replace<00:06:08.279> them<00:06:08.580> if<00:06:08.759> you

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
you can continuously replace them if you

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.010 
you can continuously replace them if you
want<00:06:09.539> to<00:06:09.659> play<00:06:09.840> a<00:06:09.870> more<00:06:10.610> free<00:06:11.610> roam<00:06:11.819> style<00:06:12.240> now

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.300 
like always on any type of maps state to
the<00:06:15.240> other<00:06:15.270> side<00:06:15.539> don't<00:06:15.840> do<00:06:16.020> what<00:06:16.139> I'm<00:06:16.229> doing

the other side don't do what I'm doing

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.909 
the other side don't do what I'm doing
like<00:06:17.310> me<00:06:17.550> this<00:06:18.449> guy's<00:06:18.659> Brian<00:06:19.560> down<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.770> middle

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
like me this guy's Brian down the middle

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.499 
like me this guy's Brian down the middle
don't<00:06:20.400> reason<00:06:20.639> I'm<00:06:20.879> right<00:06:21.060> now<00:06:21.180> in<00:06:21.210> the<00:06:21.360> middle

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
don't reason I'm right now in the middle

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.360 
don't reason I'm right now in the middle
right<00:06:21.599> now<00:06:21.810> is<00:06:21.930> because<00:06:22.080> i<00:06:22.259> have<00:06:22.680> a<00:06:22.710> harrier<00:06:23.219> in

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
right now is because i have a harrier in

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.860 
right now is because i have a harrier in
the<00:06:23.490> air<00:06:23.610> or<00:06:24.210> pave<00:06:24.990> low

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
the air or pave low

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.520 
the air or pave low
so<00:06:26.710> the<00:06:27.310> game<00:06:27.430> is<00:06:27.460> about<00:06:27.610> to<00:06:27.700> wrap<00:06:27.940> up<00:06:27.970> here<00:06:28.530> I

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
so the game is about to wrap up here I

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.760 
so the game is about to wrap up here I
think<00:06:30.040> the<00:06:30.190> final<00:06:30.370> score<00:06:30.790> is<00:06:31.060> 39<00:06:31.930> and<00:06:32.170> five<00:06:32.410> and

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
think the final score is 39 and five and

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.700 
think the final score is 39 and five and
a<00:06:33.340> team<00:06:33.580> deathmatch<00:06:33.970> game<00:06:34.300> that<00:06:34.900> goes<00:06:35.140> only<00:06:35.500> up

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710
