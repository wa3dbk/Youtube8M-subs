00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.029
 hello to everyone then how back in 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.309
 kitchen from interned of my kitchen 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.800
 so tonight I decided on petals 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.380
 nuggets as you saw from the title 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.599
 which is something my children 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.610
 they devour very easy to do is right 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.020
 an elementary thing because it doesn't go there 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.420
 pretty much anything to anyone sees 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.449
 the institution are recipes that are found 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.850
 quietly online for which or them 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.800
 simply pounded I put myself under one 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.590
 of the sites from which I took them but 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.649
 there are many such recipes 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.390
 precisely on the internet and I say another 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.700
 what will you think second time I do them 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.800
 so I will tell you how it should be 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.600
 recipe is how I found myself at 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.469
 another time and then we say the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.480
 changes I make this time is 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.489
 one more thing if the rice station of 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.800
 I will prepare these dimensions when 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.079
 typical of nuggets however made a 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.879
 little more closer can be 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.489
 also very suitable for an aperitif 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.079
 or just to be spiluccare so if one 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.350
 wants to make an aperitif or something 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.210
 kind because they are really good e.co 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.119
 very little valley and above all they are 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.490
 made with precisely the things we choose 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.459
 we will now show you the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.599
 ingredients and I'll tell you a little 

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:23.360
 changes then the recipe says 200 g 

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:25.099
 of chicken without skin that sandro then a 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.030
 remove these in your own but 

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:29.990
 resign 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.100
 in the bimby half teaspoon of garlic 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.340
 granular or a clove of garlic 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:41.380
 fresh two slices of white bread without the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.009
 crust around 60 g of fresh cheese 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.820
 spreadable type 60 grams of milk then 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.899
 a little bit of salt and then instead I was 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.540
 to learn 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.149
 so here I already use this this 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.490
 prepared with new leaves a 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.179
 thin thin and very thin crust 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.030
 golden 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:05.810
 otherwise use the classic pan pan 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.810
 carrÃ¨ and the egg to learn 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.729
 then I tell you the other time not 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.610
 done exclusively using the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.350
 chicken, however, a little more than duets 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.989
 I used about three ounces like dinners here 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.670
 this time it's about three ounces because 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.739
 a clove of garlic on two ounces e 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.530
 really so much already anyway 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.780
 tight because you hear a lot though up 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.630
 duets and in my opinion is exaggerated of 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.340
 salemi used a half spoon 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.739
 more or less 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.440
 the other time I had then used the 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.720
 bread in the box is only a little bit 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.790
 of milk 30 grams of milk 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.190
 this because I had no cheese 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.560
 spreadable is a need to soften 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.840
 somehow the compound though 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.459
 according to me oil of oil yes 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.200
 goodnight of the granular broth 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.780
 I think the same would be fine 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.340
 of the broth behind where they are such 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.410
 what what you have a little bit 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.959
 would also be very good 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.900
 so then this time I have instead 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.910
 decided to use there to make it like 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.190
 it should be done but I wo n't put 60 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.340
 g of philadelphia even if there is more 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.340
 I'll only get you 40 g here 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.360
 minimum e 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.489
 with 40 grams of milk and I'll see if it's more 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.019
 or less good the other time we say 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.700
 that these in my opinion are ingredients 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.129
 additional because I tell you the other time 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.410
 not the used ones and they are all very good 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.390
 same then we say that these are 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.269
 additional ingredients if you want 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.580
 you can put it and if not in my opinion 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.230
 they can also be omitted however vi 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.760
 I will say how they came then this time 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.340
 then we proceed with the executions 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.670
 I use the bimby but obviously can 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.829
 a normal mixer could be used 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:04:00.900
 then here we are then we start with the 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:04:04.379
 put the neck and the garlic and I put 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:09.120
 about so wait so here is salt 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:14.670
 a vehicle, however, is not seen as a means 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:18.989
 spoon then salt goes to me now and 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:22.940
 let go of the dinghy for five 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.940
 second speed 7 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.020
 this is the result of this first 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.740
 chopped 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:44.090
 at this point we add hunger 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:49.779
 cut into small pieces the cheese is given 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.779
 let's make a little piece of bread 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:05:01.629
 and who knows if I put myself before weight 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:05.659
 a little bit of milk but at this point yes 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:15.669
 required to send a few seconds there 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:15.669
 I also say how many 10 seconds speed 7 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:24.830
 here is this is the compound that comes 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:29.449
 with this I will make some little balls i 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.830
 nuggets then I'll put rebounds and robbie 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.110
 I put photos once I have them 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.959
 facts that I breaded and even once 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.319
 which are that they are cold and bon 

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:41.379
 super fast very good and good 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.379
 appetite
