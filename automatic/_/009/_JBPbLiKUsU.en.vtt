00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello and welcome tsum new 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.260
 give video that would be more professional 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.870
 at least try that on the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.330
 city ​​history and that's because I like you 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.369
 Introduce my new car today 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.820
 after finally getting fucked 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:26.220
 and here it is but he is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.439
 over on the different computers 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.439
 rediscovered times 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.559
 Maybe not on the video right now 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.930
 One hundred percent that's right 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.100
 beautiful white but a bit 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.629
 Dirty from the weekend is so then 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.509
 Let's come to the next one to water 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.070
 lets the rims 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:13.630
 So those are the 19 inch rims 280 has 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.500
 the next difference is then the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:25.960
 but a little larger rear spoiler then 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:27.729
 of course, on a black one 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.770
 Mirror caps where I have to say that 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.899
 simply a matter of taste 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 my absolute highlight is it now 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.740
 Not 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.530
 So they would have quiet in car paint 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.790
 can and that's it already 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.159
 with the outward appearances 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.770
 otherwise he is outwardly the same as 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.380
 the predecessor, of course, five-door 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.579
 especially fully enter the house 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.189
 but even a something here before 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.649
 you notice that you only have a nice one 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.229
 difference on the video now so 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.259
 really not really he does not have any 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.860
 chrome applications was something for me 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.540
 I say compromise so I think 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.509
 with chrome applications still 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.600
 just how should you say 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.100
 more contrast friendly i would 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.519
 its now time friendly 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.329
 So then you have around here applications 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.590
 how to get that one here and of course 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.780
 also 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.959
 the next difference to the predecessor 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.750
 Of course, that's where I dsg off now 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.090
 I secretly already 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.400
 previously said yes the next one has 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.140
 then dsg again now he is still a 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.040
 a little faster than it actually is 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.040
 was planned 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.580
 otherwise what else does he have now ? 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:54.310
 had at had t is this eternal 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:03:05.170
 and then it is not bad though 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:05.170
 I get somehow manages now 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.860
 then we have one more 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:15.549
 the track maintenance assistant is up here in the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:22.190
 left bitter will not make it 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:24.799
 So that then turn on and off acc 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.000
 then works completely independently 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.600
 So there I go again 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.340
 separately on it 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.959
 otherwise it's roughly the same thing now 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.510
 i also had good before that now 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.540
 still digital radio and the rear 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.489
 airbags and by the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.299
 Track Keepers is all up here 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.180
 a little bit bigger so this whole 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.519
 area where the camera is in was 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.040
 not so big it has now 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.680
 got a bit bigger 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.440
 otherwise it is up to the 15 ps more 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.250
 and of course the larger rims etc 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.859
 The same way I had fire 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.690
 currently the feeling I would like now 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.849
 but not yet big 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.209
 judge that he needs more again 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.349
 could hold and dsg could lie too 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.000
 because he is not so 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.519
 one hundred percent retracted 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.590
 So far I could enjoy my old fun 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.510
 driving as you told her how is there 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.410
 now on dsg and not on that 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.710
 retracted 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.440
 So I know at eight 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.910
 I still have some seven left 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.979
 can not make it to the 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.780
 are are larger wider tires 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.170
 but ten millimeters more 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.770
 yes, that was the worst thing 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.430
 Overview the other day was then still separate 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.820
 to the digital radio acc tracking assistant 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.130
 the coming separate again videos 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.389
 and otherwise you wish all the best 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.389
 you hear from each other
