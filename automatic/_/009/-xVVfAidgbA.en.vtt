00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.599
 some of them I'm dessert and good here 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.970
 I bring the interest of idea modes is 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.890
 say that the interest that is for the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.199
 people who like to make easter here 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.150
 you are those little things this is bullshit 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.470
 they already tell you everything at the beginning of 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.539
 put a sign of what needs to be done 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.150
 and everything and where are the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.920
 objects and as you see has done nothing and 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.780
 well first of all we'll have to 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.610
 transform who we will have to 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.710
 put in live zoster mode and we will have 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.860
 that get the key as you know there 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.379
 there are two locations of the keys and 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.149
 good because it 's another one we 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.160
 transformed into causal 3 light modes 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.980
 and good next step is equal all 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.260
 the steps are going to be with the staff mode 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.899
 airlines and we would have to go down in the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.390
 chairlift and we would have to paste 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.460
 many squashes to the counter this if 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.649
 we hit him when we hit him we'll open 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.089
 the door that is closed and we will close 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.490
 which is open so we will have 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.350
 have to keep it there so he can catch 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.600
 the object and can leave later and not 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.550
 is closed the next step will be 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.260
 here on the stairs of these there are 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.380
 round good on the downhill 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.570
 and we will have to open the counter with the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.660
 key and then another other colleague is had 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.280
 what to convert in the way to like and 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.920
 we are going down little by little as you see 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.510
 coming out three numbers and these numbers 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.570
 are the ones that we will have to put down in 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.450
 the counter hitting electricity from 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.520
 this and well we're going to stick there 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.430
 gatillazos until the number is put 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.800
 What we want 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.240
 and once we have it, it will go down 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.680
 little by little the elevator and we will have to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.540
 go for the piece that we will have to 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 open the door with the key we open it 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.220
 and we will have the piece 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.539
 well the next object we will have to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.390
 go to the chairlift again and we have 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.369
 to go to the right where the door is 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.039
 this and once we enter as you will see 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.019
 there will be some transformers like that with 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.180
 colored lights and we'll have to 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.670
 hit those two and then we'll have to 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.709
 enter through the portal and go to the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.019
 left we 'll see another transformer 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.790
 we give it to him and this will be now 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.170
 we will have to go for the object that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.410
 will be in this part is the door that 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.640
 there is electrified and nothing we take the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.549
 object that is already already open to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.019
 the door we take it and it's already good in 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.569
 the next step we will have to go where 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.370
 is the washing machine and you will have to 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.860
 transform another partner in the mode 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.260
 this afterlife and we'll have to give the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.060
 counter a couple of times and we were 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.890
 activate the washing machine once it is 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.590
 activated we give it to start and we 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.450
 began to come quite zombies and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.160
 good here we will have to go holding 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.349
 send zombies until the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.130
 washing machine and he will leave us the suit that is 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.130
 another object that there 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.730
 once we have the four 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.410
 objects 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.260
 we will have to go to the top where 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.350
 is the daiquiri and we put on again 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.440
 mode and good throw to live by 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.330
 here through the door this and then we will go 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.000
 already up we give you a 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.940
 a couple of cramps there is to the counter and 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.890
 We will open the door and good when 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.500
 we have the door open we come all 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.650
 and we put the four objects that we have 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.650
 already 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.650
 and good once we have put the 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.930
 four objects we turn down 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.230
 where is the daiquiri and we collect the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.740
 last this is better to leave this for the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.140
 Finally , because you have to do least one 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.050
 way and it 's good as you see what 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.660
 we ride the whole plane and we 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.840
 we can upload it will let us go up as 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.580
 I say it's very easy the easter is there is no 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.830
 that leave your head a lot more than anything 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.320
 is that they explain everything to you and good as 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.650
 You see I did the interest with dual times and 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.990
 big boss and nothing here you see how the plane 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.990
 it goes flying and now it crashes 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.880
 against the bridge we will fall down and we 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.190
 they leave the 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.290
 they will leave us where the paca pans and 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.540
 nothing else starting from her if we want 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.790
 back we have to catch it we have 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.310
 what to put in the electric chairs and 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.490
 nothing we return to the beginning of the whole we 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.770
 re encouraged and that's it then you can 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.600
 continue let's say with a little bit with the 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.570
 interest for others to give us 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.220
 achievements that will come to us as a few 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.220
 gas cans that we will have them 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.810
 to put on the plane and we can go back to 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.960
 go down so I think you can only 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.460
 come three times to improve weapons and nothing 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.370
 more I hope you liked the video 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.660
 that you vote, I like it and that you comment and 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.660
 nothing more until the next 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.530
 now
