00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
power on my cord that I'm gonna plug

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.859 
power on my cord that I'm gonna plug
into<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.409> wall<00:01:36.670> right<00:01:37.670> here<00:01:37.880> is<00:01:38.420> going<00:01:38.750> to

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
into the wall right here is going to

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.800 
into the wall right here is going to
pins<00:01:39.439> number<00:01:39.890> one<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.619> three<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:43.659> then<00:01:44.659> right

pins number one and three and then right
now<00:01:44.990> I'm<00:01:45.110> going<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.320> put<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.680> defrost<00:01:46.130> timer

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
now I'm going to put the defrost timer

00:01:46.630 --> 00:02:00.550 
now I'm going to put the defrost timer
in<00:01:47.630> defrost<00:01:58.210> now<00:01:59.210> it's<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.509> defrost<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.380> when<00:02:00.500> I

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
in defrost now it's in defrost so when I

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.440 
in defrost now it's in defrost so when I
plug<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.890> cord<00:02:01.159> in<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.939> lights<00:02:02.180> gonna<00:02:02.360> come

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
plug this cord in the lights gonna come

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.020 
plug this cord in the lights gonna come
on<00:02:02.719> because<00:02:03.020> it's<00:02:03.170> sending<00:02:03.729> power<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:05.000> I

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
on because it's sending power that I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.270 
on because it's sending power that I
have<00:02:05.180> connected<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.719> one<00:02:05.899> pin<00:02:06.860> number<00:02:07.130> one

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
have connected to one pin number one

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.389 
have connected to one pin number one
right<00:02:07.490> here<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:09.290> it's<00:02:09.590> gonna<00:02:09.709> connect<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.280> to

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
right here and it's gonna connect it to

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.430 
right here and it's gonna connect it to
number<00:02:10.640> two<00:02:10.820> which<00:02:11.629> number<00:02:11.900> two<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.379> that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
number two which number two is that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.979

to<00:02:41.830> advance<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.340> out<00:02:42.490> of<00:02:42.610> defrost<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:44.640> little

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
to advance it out of defrost a little

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.670 
to advance it out of defrost a little
turn<00:02:45.820> here

defrost systems off and the fan and the
compressor<00:02:57.299> are<00:02:57.659> on<00:02:59.930> now<00:03:00.930> basically<00:03:01.140> it's

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
compressor are on now basically it's

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.280 
compressor are on now basically it's
gonna<00:03:01.620> run<00:03:01.769> like<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.069> for<00:03:02.280> 10<00:03:02.430> hours<00:03:03.290> cycling

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
gonna run like this for 10 hours cycling

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.320 
gonna run like this for 10 hours cycling
on<00:03:04.439> and<00:03:04.469> off<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.859> keep<00:03:05.040> temperature

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
on and off the keep temperature

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.480 
on and off the keep temperature
and<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:07.020> it's<00:03:07.470> gonna<00:03:07.680> come<00:03:07.860> back<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:08.310> 30

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
and then it's gonna come back to that 30

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.820 
and then it's gonna come back to that 30
minute<00:03:08.760> window<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.090> where<00:03:10.080> power<00:03:10.290> goes<00:03:10.410> from

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
minute window to where power goes from

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.350

pin<00:03:11.010> number<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.430> back<00:03:11.910> over<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.210> pin<00:03:12.330> number

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
pin number one back over to pin number

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
pin number one back over to pin number
two<00:03:13.460> now<00:03:14.460> you<00:03:14.520> can<00:03:14.730> also<00:03:14.880> test<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.750> timer<00:03:16.020> I

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
two now you can also test the timer I

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.320 
two now you can also test the timer I
mean<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.190> timer<00:03:17.400> has<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.640> little<00:03:17.850> motor<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.240> it

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
mean the timer has a little motor in it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.440 
mean the timer has a little motor in it
so<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.810> could<00:03:19.080> test<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:20.240> when<00:03:21.240> you<00:03:21.330> have

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
so you could test it with when you have

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.440 
so you could test it with when you have
it<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.600> defrost<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:23.060> circuit<00:03:24.060> between

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
it in defrost you have a circuit between

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.660 
it in defrost you have a circuit between
1<00:03:25.440> &amp;<00:03:25.590> 2<00:03:27.080> it'll<00:03:28.080> show<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> closed<00:03:28.530> circuit<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.580> we

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
1 &amp; 2 it'll show a closed circuit and we

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.860 
1 &amp; 2 it'll show a closed circuit and we
take<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:29.940> out<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.210> frost<00:03:30.510> that's<00:03:30.660> gonna

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
take it out of the frost that's gonna

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.830 
take it out of the frost that's gonna
show<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.110> closed<00:03:31.380> circuit<00:03:31.740> between<00:03:31.860> 1<00:03:32.580> &amp;<00:03:32.730> 4<00:03:32.910> and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
show a closed circuit between 1 &amp; 4 and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.800 
show a closed circuit between 1 &amp; 4 and
that<00:03:33.930> tells<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.320> this<00:03:35.120> when<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.270> plugged<00:03:36.570> in

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
that tells you this when it's plugged in

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.750 
that tells you this when it's plugged in
both<00:03:37.500> those<00:03:37.650> will<00:03:37.920> get<00:03:38.070> power<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:38.520> it's<00:03:38.640> not

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
both those will get power but it's not

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.250 
both those will get power but it's not
going<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.970> actually<00:03:39.390> tell<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.750> if<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.990> timer

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
going to actually tell you if the timer

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.100 
going to actually tell you if the timer
is<00:03:40.650> turning<00:03:41.490> or<00:03:41.580> not<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.210> easiest<00:03:42.600> way<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.870> do

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
is turning or not the easiest way to do

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.130 
is turning or not the easiest way to do
that<00:03:43.260> really<00:03:43.530> would<00:03:43.800> be<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.690> make<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.720> mark<00:03:45.990> when

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
that really would be to make a mark when

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.590 
that really would be to make a mark when
your<00:03:46.290> timer<00:03:47.270> connect<00:03:48.270> powers<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.810> pin<00:03:49.050> 1<00:03:49.890> &amp;<00:03:50.460> 3

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
your timer connect powers to pin 1 &amp; 3

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.470 
your timer connect powers to pin 1 &amp; 3
plug<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.500> let<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.740> timer<00:03:53.070> advance

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
plug it in and let that timer advance

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.460 
plug it in and let that timer advance
and<00:03:54.480> make<00:03:54.630> sure<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.870> goes<00:03:54.990> more<00:03:55.260> than<00:03:55.320> a

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
and make sure it goes more than a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.780 
and make sure it goes more than a
quarter<00:03:55.740> turn<00:03:55.890> if<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.190> goes<00:03:56.340> through<00:03:56.640> the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
quarter turn if it goes through the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
visual now I did putting in defrost with

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.160 
visual now I did putting in defrost with
a<00:04:07.920> light<00:04:08.100> on<00:04:08.250> let<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.670> go<00:04:08.850> for<00:04:09.060> 32<00:04:09.720> minutes<00:04:09.930> is

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
a light on let it go for 32 minutes is

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.699 
a light on let it go for 32 minutes is
what<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.470> took<00:04:10.650> for<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.910> light<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:13.260> go<00:04:13.470> out<00:04:13.560> in

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
what it took for the light to go out in

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.760 
what it took for the light to go out in
the<00:04:13.770> fan<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.040> come<00:04:14.160> on

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
the fan to come on

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:26.960 
the fan to come on
so<00:04:16.770> we're<00:04:16.890> gonna<00:04:17.010> simulate<00:04:17.250> ten<00:04:17.700> hours<00:04:18.000> here

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.990 

so<00:04:44.540> now<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.720> defrost<00:04:45.110> system<00:04:45.259> is<00:04:45.530> on<00:04:45.729> and<00:04:46.729> the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
so now the defrost system is on and the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.390 
so now the defrost system is on and the
compressor<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.720> fan<00:04:47.960> are<00:04:48.380> off<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:49.160> it'll

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
compressor and the fan are off and it'll

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.969 
compressor and the fan are off and it'll
be<00:04:49.550> like<00:04:49.699> that<00:04:49.880> for<00:04:50.030> 30<00:04:50.120> minutes<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.800> that's

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
be like that for 30 minutes and that's

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.310 
be like that for 30 minutes and that's
basically<00:04:52.400> how<00:04:52.490> it<00:04:52.669> works<00:04:52.960> all<00:04:53.960> right<00:04:54.020> so

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
basically how it works all right so

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.879 
basically how it works all right so
there<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:54.530> go

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
there you go

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.830 
there you go
that's<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.400> little<00:04:55.550> bit<00:04:55.729> about<00:04:55.910> how<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.389> defrost

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
that's a little bit about how a defrost

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.659 
that's a little bit about how a defrost
timer<00:04:56.900> works<00:04:57.289> in<00:04:57.500> your<00:04:57.620> refrigerator<00:04:57.830> I<00:04:58.340> hope

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
timer works in your refrigerator I hope

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.520 
timer works in your refrigerator I hope
that<00:04:58.850> visual<00:04:59.240> has<00:04:59.870> made<00:05:00.080> it<00:05:00.169> a<00:05:00.229> little<00:05:00.380> bit

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
that visual has made it a little bit

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.930 
that visual has made it a little bit
easier<00:05:00.949> for<00:05:01.009> you<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.250> understand<00:05:01.699> how<00:05:01.820> the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
easier for you to understand how the

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.840 
easier for you to understand how the
power<00:05:02.210> connects<00:05:03.139> between<00:05:03.440> 1<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.860> 2<00:05:04.009> and<00:05:04.370> then

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
power connects between 1 and 2 and then

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.629 
power connects between 1 and 2 and then
from<00:05:05.060> 1<00:05:05.270> 4<00:05:06.130> depending<00:05:07.130> on<00:05:07.250> whether<00:05:07.400> it's<00:05:07.550> in

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
from 1 4 depending on whether it's in

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.820 
from 1 4 depending on whether it's in
defrost<00:05:08.060> or<00:05:08.240> whether<00:05:08.840> it's<00:05:09.020> calling<00:05:09.229> for<00:05:09.410> cold

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
defrost or whether it's calling for cold

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.950 
defrost or whether it's calling for cold
and<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:11.030> fan<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.419> compressor<00:05:11.810> are

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
and the fan of the compressor are

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
and the fan of the compressor are
cycling<00:05:12.350> on<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:12.500> off<00:05:12.680> as<00:05:13.070> they<00:05:13.280> should

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.870 

every<00:05:18.980> time<00:05:19.160> I<00:05:19.250> try<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.430> say<00:05:19.550> something
