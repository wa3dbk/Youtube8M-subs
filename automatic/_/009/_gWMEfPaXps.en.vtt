00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everyone with you rs they cost aha this 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.150
 privata territory specifically for T-shirts 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.110
 in. son step 1 prescribe team van 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.599
 for wooden ax 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.020
 Step 2 select the first button with the left button. 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.380
 point and right click the second point 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.039
 our privat step 3 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 expanding with our expansion team 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.250
 region 20 blocks up allowed and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.620
 also 20 blocks down and you can 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.899
 embroider to somewhere in the 10 blocks back 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.140
 also for 10 in general where you look yes and 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.570
 decide your friend do what your heart desires 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.370
 I take from me 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 further we register the command site for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.180
 to find out the size of our selection in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.410
 this case 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.329
 occupies already 56 thousand blocks but it is not 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.629
 only a lot because we have a limit 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.090
 100,000 for one crooked then as follows 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.359
 step is to create privat 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.010
 rg klein and the name let's say art is not 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.680
 began to further remove this grid to us 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.260
 just enough to fill a whole 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.270
 and if you suddenly forgot your boundaries 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.750
 privat being in it can write 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.659
 pgs or he will reappear well and sat down 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.119
 Of course, to add the image again 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.640
 our friend in our region Sergey from 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:33.420
 mimbar artanis hill admit pancake king of 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.220
 why not find out information about our 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.000
 region using the rgr pho command 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.500
 being in it or rain pho being 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.759
 but no matter where rg is 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.159
 enforce they trunk flags pvp well in general 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.000
 here everything is clear participants owners 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.750
 and so on like a true hardcore 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.040
 minecraft building our home from the land and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.860
 rejoice in the fact that we now have 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.329
 places where we can wait out the night of us 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.310
 no one will kill because we put it everywhere 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.979
 chests because privately chests are not 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.739
 limited in the region just remember that 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.880
 chests won't turn outside 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.940
 your private 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.790
 please, what if you want 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.920
 build pvp arena pvp also need to somehow 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.170
 enable all pretty simple rik flag 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.780
 name of your region and pvp 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.780
 if you want to disable vp again 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.020
 same thing with the postscript given all 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.510
 very simple just such regions can 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.220
 simultaneously create when but if you donâ€™t 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.690
 need one of these you can just take 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.540
 and remove it let's say 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.360
 rgd years and time they st hills go 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.870
 lock in a new why not why 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.870
 why not no yes because yes yes 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.300
 so what on this our guide is suitable 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.980
 The end of the private created although already deleted 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.870
 it doesn't matter you learn to interrupt it 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.150
 so you could not before remember that 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.460
 animals need to hide far away 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.460
 so that they are not killed thanks
