00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.240
 hello everyone today we are going to prepare 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.459
 torrijas well I want to prepare 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.769
 because the week starts jump 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:12.129
 we approach the holiday dates so 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.809
 what it touches is to make all laughs that the 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.070
 bread you can use whichever you want the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.600
 that you like most is the group of your 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.150
 basically I'm going to 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.029
 teach the bread egb or wise here we have 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.199
 a bread looks like bimbo bread but not that 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.390
 is a type candeal bread and bread me 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.039
 I made rye bread , so let's go 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.259
 to start that we're going to work 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.120
 super rich toasts and to make 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.660
 our torrijas the ingredients that 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.660
 we will need 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.699
 advice if you are going to use a plan that 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.010
 torrijas you know that you must have what 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.930
 delayed two or three days before so that 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.210
 the bread is compacted and easier 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.769
 work the torrija let's kill what 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.579
 first thing we're going to do we're going to 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.030
 toss a cinnamon stick a few husks 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.790
 of orange a few lemon peels 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.589
 we will also put half a glass of water 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.119
 because you put half a glass of water or 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.280
 because how are we going to take the milk to 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.950
 boil with this half glass of water 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.119
 we avoid evaporating it for 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.440
 keep more or less the same amount 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:18.260
 of milk we will also put 150 sugar 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.690
 grams of sugar for one liter of milk 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.100
 to boil we are serving our milk 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.930
 so that it is scented with the nasa and the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.150
 lemon and in the meantime let's put the 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.040
 oil with fire to the very minimum 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.320
 soft so that the pan and the oil 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.580
 they go taking temperature and when 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.650
 We want to work with her only 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.170
 we have to give it a little blow 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.690
 called the oil that we are going to put is of 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.760
 sunflower we want a soft oil for 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.590
 respect the flavor of the torrijas what 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.180
 we are going to do in phases the first thing that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.320
 let's do is submerge all the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.120
 slices that we have cut in milk like this 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.580
 let's leave all the torrijas 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.080
 submerged and meanwhile let's go 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.700
 beating the egg 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.620
 Once the egg is beaten us 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.870
 we reserve and we will check that the 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.850
 crust be tender date and when we see 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.010
 that are at the point what we will have 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.650
 what to do is take them out carefully to 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.119
 leave them in a fountain that they go to 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.830
 sitting down the milk they are finishing 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.270
 discover this last droplet so that 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.670
 we can handle them but that way we'll go 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.080
 placing the french toast interspersed 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.640
 that do not pile up all on one side 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.440
 but with affection we are getting 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.150
 distributed so that the weight does not chaser at 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.130
 below once we have them 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.830
 all outside let's start to spend more 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.660
 for flour so let's pass the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.760
 torrijas for flour round and round 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.140
 free without pringing a lot 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.120
 in this way we drain the flour that 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.130
 more now and once we have all 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.959
 we will go to the flour-coated torrijas 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.720
 placing in a tray all 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.900
 prepared in flours people do not pass 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.670
 for flour the torrijas but if you fry 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.800
 a whisk you're going to rebozar with 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.380
 egg so they pass it through flour before 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.840
 for torrijas the same happens if 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.310
 you want to retain moisture close the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.750
 pores of the torrija and that your torrijas 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.000
 be very juicy and the egg that does not 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.850
 drain the best is to pass it through flour 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.610
 very little is a clear plan and we're leaving 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.890
 to go through the egg in this way a 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.150
 to one and we leave them in a fountain 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.830
 and once we have all the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.850
 torrijas submerged in egg and 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.500
 we have put in the source for 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.990
 drain, start frying the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.940
 we will put an egg shell in the 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.980
 oil because the eggshell attracts 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.780
 the dirt that is floating and so we 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.730
 can last longer oil and let's go 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.590
 seeing them with the strong oil we are going to 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.780
 give you oil glass people have to 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.580
 be that between the torrija and that txapote 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.290
 with joy that you do not say 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.740
 How strong are you? 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.740
 how it has to be 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.489
 let's move on to make our candy 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.750
 for torrijas is very simple in 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.599
 this case I 'm not going to use fear 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.239
 I'm going to use sugar water and lemon 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.549
 how would you pick a glass of sugar 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.260
 I'll fill them up, I want to throw in 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.930
 the saucepan after 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.819
 I will put a little finger of water so that the 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.540
 sugar do not burn us and I'll put a 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.579
 trickle of lemon 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.250
 You can flavor this same candy 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.870
 with herbs with cinnamon with experiences 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.060
 with whatever you want but I in 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.409
 I'm going to leave it pure and we're going 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.870
 to put on fire to make caramel 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.110
 is already beginning to smell candy 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.290
 and this is 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.880
 what we look for candy rubies what 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.980
 we have ready we have our 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.070
 prepared candy we are going to put something 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.420
 well for that candy to be released for 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.070
 make it a syrup to be a 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.780
 caramel sauce that will be the one 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.430
 will cover our torrijas and they will be 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.410
 juicy we'll wait for it to cool 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.600
 so as not to damage them with the candy so 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.580
 hot let's prepare a cream 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.640
 thyme to accompany the torrijas 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.010
 we will add 300 grams of milk 20 grams 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.370
 of medicine 20 grams of sugar and one 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.370
 yolk 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.020
 and we put a little milk 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.000
 we have prepared this and we are going to 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.650
 reserve for when the milk is 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.960
 prepared that we're going to heat it up and 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.820
 let's infuse the thyme we'll put 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.780
 our thyme and let's let the 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.610
 thyme leave its aroma in milk 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.290
 our thyme infused and we have 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.580
 already mixed with the yolk and now that 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.080
 we have done the temperature exchange 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.200
 we are going to raise it again so that 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.080
 thicken 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.820
 here we have our thyme cream 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.890
