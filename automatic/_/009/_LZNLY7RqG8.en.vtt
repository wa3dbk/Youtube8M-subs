00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.990
 hello how are you, because today I'm here with 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.710
 this video tutorial which is a tutorial 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.720
 that the 12 rams that I'm sure that 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.730
 you will like them or have seen them in 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.210
 photos in the videos of many girls 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.310
 studio photos and in this one is your 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.100
 circumference like that in the eyes after 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.050
 of the youtubers videos here they go 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.989
 to CÃ³rdoba as they are called ours 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.910
 lamps but they are very expensive up 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.550
 two thousand pesos I have seen 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.290
 Y 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.210
 well then in these moments of 90 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.730
 and then I gave myself the task of making a 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.860
 lamp that 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.840
 I will replace this type of and I will not 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.910
 Take more choro please see 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.860
 If I am and the best, the best of life 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.960
 is that 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.380
 you will not spend or kill 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.980
 this magic that is also 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.710
 on your screens 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.650
 please 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.510
 in the tutorial you will like super 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.510
 economic super father results 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.790
 nice, well 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.100
 good and what we will need to 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.060
 make our lamps are only 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:28.790
 three things 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:31.910
 say a big carton and accounts for 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.060
 we are that they are Christmas these are 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.370
 the ones that I'm going to be using and 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.460
 it's just what they're going 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.350
 so good hands to work and good 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.890
 now for what I'm going to do is going to 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.320
 consist of 18 centimeters d 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.520
 as I do not have a compass what I'm going to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.520
 do is position 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.130
 the tool that helps to serve 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.760
 compass that is a thread I will position it 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.420
 at a point 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.120
 and there I marked him 18 centimeters then 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:12.950
 this is going to turn 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.950
 and it will serve me as if it were a compass 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.720
 I have the one that is going to be marked 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.140
 they looked but obviously it has a thickness 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.349
 these from that I'm going to take him around 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.860
 of 6 millimeters I want to have my rule 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.030
 my black made by my six centimeters 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.560
 sorry 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.560
 I'm going to go through all my 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.660
 my circumferences 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.940
 6 centimeters 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.670
 and now we have our two 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.069
 marked circumferences then there are 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.069
 to proceed to cut back 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.060
 but now what we are going to do is take 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.390
 our 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.730
 circulated our hoop and with the help of a 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.010
 I'm going to help with this screw 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.950
 to make the rolls where they will enter 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.610
 my lights in this case my lights have 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.890
 120 little pieces 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.900
 so I'm going to be doing 120 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.900
 holes distributed throughout the length 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.280
 and now I'm going to introduce every little bit 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.280
 for each hole 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.870
 and well I finished doing all the 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.600
 holes and put all the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.920
 little bit then that's how it is 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.160
 and then now what follows is 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.720
 try it and let's see how it looks and 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.880
 good in these moments is when I'm 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.580
 checking how this lamp looks 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.169
 made by and I like a lot like 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.169
 I'm watching to see the monkey 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.770
 it looks really good as you can see it 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.470
 see everything in the circumference the 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.080
 difference that I was looking for that is 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.849
 being all my source of light 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.020
 the light that man is now going to 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.020
 check because in the I'm going to remove 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.430
 can not know what 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.590
 to history and I see myself in the shadows 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:04.100
 so you see the room without anything 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.100
 light and now I'll put the lamp 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.370
 although also the ability 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.770
 d 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.040
 to provide this light that are 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.160
 watching you 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.760
 there you see the back 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.250
 of obviously the more closer yola 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.870
 the lamp to the same finger more illuminated 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.180
 among more outputs plus front 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.490
 far can or less illuminated 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.569
 incredible incredible and I have to 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.190
 say that you eat a little color 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:42.310
 I want another light let's go 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.210
 we shine that's obvious today as 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.160
 Well that's it 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.690
