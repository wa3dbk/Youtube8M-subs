00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.599
 hello today we will cook duck 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.740
 a special recipe for duck black in beer 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.770
 means first a little about 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.160
 cooking duck duck is considered 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.149
 generally not a dietary dish and a dish 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.940
 quite difficult cooking 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:37.040
 often it turns out it's all solid 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.170
 because it needs to be cooked special 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.950
 some way it turns out 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.130
 fatty 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.700
 and that's all because let's say a duck 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.790
 cook in the oven bake it there let's say 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.880
 foil for several hours and as a result 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.880
 anyway we get the wrong result 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.920
 I would like to get that is to say, we 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:04.100
 the oven hour is pretty hard bird and 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.840
 so it is not all like that 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.570
 a small digression and now 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.090
 directly to the recipe means one 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.090
 cooking we take either one whole 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.040
 either a duck or a ready-made chicken leg 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.220
 which are usually sold in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.950
 hypermarkets or supermarkets if 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.409
 so you cook the whole duck you can 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.200
 if she is a little cook it whole 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.710
 if you are making chicken legs then they are like 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.970
 rule already made and prepared 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.580
 that is, if we allow for a whole duck there 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.330
 maybe remnants of some feathers and so 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.100
 further and 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.000
 and of course it must be good 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.630
 Peel off process then thighs with us 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.760
 sold already processed 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.159
 means pre- defrosting them 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.439
 again looked at everything so that they were 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.939
 we have good quality 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.990
 processed, we can earlier in 2-3 hours 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.820
 marinate this duck mixture 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.010
 french mustard is such a grain 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.379
 and mayonnaise if you want dishes by 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.069
 savory and you can just mix dried 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:17.450
 Herbs are right there like oregano parsley and 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:20.950
 there is some kind of bottom for chicken and salt 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.200
 and put in a fridge for a couple of hours 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.709
 pics should be noted chicken legs is 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.440
 the most delicious most delicious part of the most 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.830
 mrs that because let's say 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.769
 duck wing from breast is enough 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.400
 bony unlike chicken and meat 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.930
 ducks are dark so for cooking us 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.989
 need a bottle of dark beer well with 100 pairs 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.700
 bid us and so on 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.610
 somewhere a bottle of 0705 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.000
 it depends on the size of your duck 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.489
 participants and you further need prunes 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.489
 about 300 grams and you need a few 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.670
 apples apples are nice to take 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.519
 Antonovka acidic varieties but if you are 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:14.030
 will not find any season let it take 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:15.640
 any other apples next stage 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.700
 cooking duck 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.370
 it means chicken legs are stuffed with prunes and 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.730
 whole duck if we let cook 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.739
 or you chopped it portions means 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.579
 stuffed with prune remaining 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.690
 prunes 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.100
 we laid it on top laid it in 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.049
 that is, for manufacturing for 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.940
 cooking ducks take special 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:42.170
 dishes and friday apples cut into pieces 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.180
 in small lobules and 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:50.170
 it means beer is always ready here too 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.870
 so the next stage of cooking duck 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.829
 diced or sliced apples 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.859
 we put in the participant and fill utyatnitsa 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.400
 up to the top beer here you can throw a little 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.420
 salt and spices to taste at the tank pepper 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.030
 peas, bay leaf let's 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:16.609
 then we put our utyatnitsa oven 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:19.489
 it's somewhere in the second regiment from the bottom 180 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.310
 degrees and in the oven 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.830
 we make a duck at least one and a half 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.900
 hours to softness maybe even two 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.740
 hours depending on the size and quality 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.740
 your skirt 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.260
 so our duck stew in the oven and 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.990
 now we calmly wait somewhere 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:46.150
 one and a half to two hours, and so our duck is ready 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.790
 open but first got the oven 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:54.460
 oh what flavor all ready chicken legs 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.440
 the most perfect soft ones that is very 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.870
 soft, that is probably meat will be 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.250
 to separate from the bones 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.479
 naturally we do not do this duck anymore 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.000
 first and all very tasty 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:12.419
 with you cooked very tasty and 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.419
 soft duck all the success
