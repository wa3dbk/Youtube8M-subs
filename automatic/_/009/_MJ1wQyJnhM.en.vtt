00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.830
 we show what's here today because the map 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.630
 in duke front and back the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.000
 brake pads change you need to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.369
 almost only two tools and thirties 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.760
 talks key supports pull 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.860
 That's it 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.350
 so first we show you how it is one 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.970
 Vorderachse goes first and foremost 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:33.610
 you remove the fuse sprint and 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.610
 so that the 30s tops key the bolt 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.870
 Make sure that the fuse neither 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:53.410
 you do not jump away these and 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.410
 Put her aside 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.970
 after that, both can already do so 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.500
 brake pads from the saddle goal if the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.120
 you can clamp through brake pads 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.590
 Lightly shake the pistons a little 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.760
 they should reset little by doing so 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.760
 have the meat removed 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.030
 after the slip has removed 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.159
 her just a commercial one 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.130
 help to take the pipe wrench and the pistons 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.390
 push back until stop 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.909
 make sure you use the caliper 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.770
 not necessarily damaged and above all 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.750
 The pistons are not too scratched 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.850
 otherwise that would make you leaky 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.619
 You should also be aware of it 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.960
 Pay attention that when pressing back one 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.240
 Pistons other pistons from the saddle 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.009
 can be pushed out so fits 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.880
 so that none of those guys will play you 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.110
 just slip out of the saddle 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.789
 then you can just the brake pads 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.259
 reinsert after pressing back 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.340
 The brake pads should be light 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.899
 let it work again 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.420
 pay attention to the right direction of the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.550
 brake pads when the occupancy 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.899
 then release it from the caliper 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.269
 this is because the footprint 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.860
 Mostly dirty they are cleansed 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.290
 best with a file or with one 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.700
 sharp screwdriver after net 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.540
 maybe with a small suitcase 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.700
 now fits easily bolts and mistakes we 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.110
 use 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.180
 Incidentally, the error is there that the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.290
 brake pads in normal rides at 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.290
 braking operations I shut up 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.890
 holzen completely push 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:02.190
 and tighten up that the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:12.810
 mistake really is not right 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:13.890
 is now strained as argued the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:20.040
 backup just sprint again 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.150
 insert and finished now comes the 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.459
 absolutely most important step 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.870
 you should then the brake lever on 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.610
 pull each case until they come back 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.560
 felt a brake pressure that would not be 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.019
 the first time someone with his 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.739
 Bike starts and the next best wall 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.060
 takes along because the brakes has failed 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.360
 butts have to come back again 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.560
 be put into their top position like that 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.420
 now show you how it is at the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.650
 the rear axle is also easy here 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.650
 Remove fuse lockers 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.750
 simply said 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.700
 It does not have to express a bolt 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.900
 be screwed 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:11.090
 under circumstances must be a hammer too 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.439
 Help to take the documents already 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.310
 push back slightly so they let themselves 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.140
 easier to remove 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.430
 besides, the pistons are not anymore 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.430
 to push back so far 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.130
 Now the documents can be easily removed 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.130
 become 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.980
 pay attention that when inserting the 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.960
 new slip the above attached error 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.650
 Unfortunately you can not see them 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.580
 has slipped to insert the first 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.280
 You can go to 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.690
 Already use backup bolts 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.370
 then just the second brake pad 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.660
 insert and the safety bolt 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.660
 completely push through 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.050
 then you just have to do the backup 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.639
 lock in the holes provided 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.639
 stuck and done 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.730
 now also pumping at the 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.230
 Foot brake the documents back in their 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.230
 bring home position back
