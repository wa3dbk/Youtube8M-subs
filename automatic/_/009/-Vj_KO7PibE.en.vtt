00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
gently down the pit lane so when you're

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.939 
gently down the pit lane so when you're
not<00:00:21.420> using<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.869> clutch<00:00:22.050> left<00:00:22.380> foot<00:00:22.529> goes<00:00:22.680> down

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
not using the clutch left foot goes down

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.460 
not using the clutch left foot goes down
on<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> foot<00:00:23.340> rest<00:00:23.519> down<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.269> them

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
on the foot rest down but it's on them

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.380 
on the foot rest down but it's on them
so<00:00:25.490> okay<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> quick<00:00:26.939> look<00:00:26.970> over<00:00:27.180> your

shoulder
so<00:00:29.530> it's<00:00:29.680> slightly<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.250> right<00:00:30.340> we'll<00:00:30.730> go

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
so it's slightly to the right we'll go

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.090 
so it's slightly to the right we'll go
to<00:00:30.940> the<00:00:31.150> left<00:00:31.390> hand<00:00:31.600> side<00:00:31.690> of<00:00:32.020> this<00:00:32.110> cone<00:00:32.410> and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
to the left hand side of this cone and

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.870 
to the left hand side of this cone and
set<00:00:34.140> give<00:00:35.140> clear<00:00:35.410> stay<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.310> your<00:00:36.490> left<00:00:36.550> side

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
set give clear stay to your left side

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.110 
set give clear stay to your left side
squeezing<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.480> power<00:00:37.690> increase<00:00:38.200> away<00:00:38.470> you<00:00:38.530> go

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
squeezing the power increase away you go

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.400 
squeezing the power increase away you go
said<00:00:40.120> let's<00:00:40.300> go

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.140 

okay<00:00:44.950> go<00:00:45.130> full<00:00:45.340> power<00:00:45.370> see<00:00:45.790> what<00:00:45.910> it's<00:00:46.030> like

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
okay go full power see what it's like

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.200 
okay go full power see what it's like
right

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.970 

become<00:00:50.719> going<00:00:51.079> keep<00:00:51.950> on<00:00:52.100> going

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
become going keep on going

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.130 
become going keep on going
release<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.760> power<00:00:54.940> on<00:00:55.270> break<00:00:55.510> fairly<00:00:55.930> firm

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
release the power on break fairly firm

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.620 
release the power on break fairly firm
so<00:00:56.350> you<00:00:56.440> know<00:00:56.530> it's<00:00:56.680> like<00:00:56.890> drop<00:00:57.220> down<00:00:57.430> off<00:00:58.420> the
