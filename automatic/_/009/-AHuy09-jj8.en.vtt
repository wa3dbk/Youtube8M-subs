be on their side on this is kind of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.100 
be on their side on this is kind of
weird<00:02:12.370> because<00:02:13.240> obvious

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
weird because obvious

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.840 
weird because obvious
kakashi<00:02:14.440> didn't<00:02:14.740> use<00:02:14.830> mangekyo<00:02:15.160> until<00:02:15.730> she

kakashi didn't use mangekyo until she

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.910 
kakashi didn't use mangekyo until she
couldn't<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.690> he<00:02:16.720> if<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.410> liked<00:02:17.620> at<00:02:17.770> this

point<00:02:18.220> what<00:02:18.400> took<00:02:18.550> him<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:18.730> long<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.060> use<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.540> I

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
point what took him so long to use it I

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.290 
point what took him so long to use it I
could<00:02:20.650> use<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.950> against<00:02:21.160> Abu<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.520> guess<00:02:21.850> you

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
could use it against Abu I guess you

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.580 
could use it against Abu I guess you
know<00:02:22.390> did<00:02:22.600> he<00:02:22.660> not<00:02:22.810> know<00:02:22.960> about<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.410> up<00:02:23.500> until

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
know did he not know about it up until

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.020 
know did he not know about it up until
that<00:02:23.860> point<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.220> just<00:02:24.250> seemed<00:02:24.520> kind<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.820> weird

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that point it just seemed kind of weird

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.180 
that point it just seemed kind of weird
i<00:02:25.270> will<00:02:25.750> give<00:02:25.960> kishimoto<00:02:26.470> time<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.860> explain

i will give kishimoto time to explain

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.890 
i will give kishimoto time to explain
this<00:02:27.430> but<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.850> just<00:02:27.970> seems<00:02:28.180> really<00:02:28.450> weird<00:02:28.690> to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
this but it just seems really weird to

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.990 
this but it just seems really weird to
me<00:02:29.050> why<00:02:29.230> he<00:02:29.380> wouldn't<00:02:29.620> use<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.280> up<00:02:30.550> until<00:02:30.850> that

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
me why he wouldn't use it up until that

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.790 
me why he wouldn't use it up until that
point<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.360> your<00:02:31.510> Putin's<00:02:31.840> but<00:02:32.140> that's<00:02:32.500> that's

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
point is your Putin's but that's that's

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.100 
point is your Putin's but that's that's
just<00:02:33.040> me<00:02:33.190> personally<00:02:33.670> but<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.690> i<00:02:34.780> said<00:02:34.810> but

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
just me personally but like i said but

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
just me personally but like i said but
after<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.440> they<00:02:35.590> both<00:02:35.770> unlocked<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
after that they both unlocked the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.460 
after that they both unlocked the
mangekyo<00:02:36.610> kakashi<00:02:37.030> passes<00:02:37.510> out<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.900> i<00:02:38.260> think

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
mangekyo kakashi passes out and i think

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.380 
mangekyo kakashi passes out and i think
he<00:02:38.530> passed<00:02:38.770> up<00:02:38.980> personally<00:02:39.490> because<00:02:39.610> he's<00:02:40.209> not

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
he passed up personally because he's not

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.150 
he passed up personally because he's not

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
a hoochie ha that make it wouldn't make

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.590 
a hoochie ha that make it wouldn't make
a<00:02:42.220> lot<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.430> sense<00:02:42.580> or<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.120> could<00:02:43.270> just<00:02:43.300> been

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
a lot of sense or you could just been

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.050 
a lot of sense or you could just been
tired<00:02:43.840> from<00:02:44.290> his<00:02:44.410> fights<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.340> mist<00:02:45.580> who

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
tired from his fights with the mist who

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.970 
tired from his fights with the mist who
knows<00:02:46.240> either<00:02:46.720> way<00:02:46.930> he<00:02:47.110> passed<00:02:47.350> out<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.800> he's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
knows either way he passed out and he's

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.280 
knows either way he passed out and he's
pretty<00:02:48.640> much<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:49.120> know<00:02:49.240> done<00:02:49.900> with<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.140> for

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
pretty much you know done with it for

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.990 
pretty much you know done with it for
the<00:02:50.320> chapter<00:02:50.680> at<00:02:50.800> least<00:02:50.980> after<00:02:51.490> that<00:02:51.790> we<00:02:51.880> see

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the chapter at least after that we see

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.150 
the chapter at least after that we see
obito<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.510> he<00:02:52.570> just<00:02:52.750> screams<00:02:53.410> as<00:02:53.770> loud<00:02:53.800> as<00:02:54.130> you

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
obito and he just screams as loud as you

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.820 
obito and he just screams as loud as you
can<00:02:54.250> he<00:02:54.610> goes<00:02:54.760> full-on<00:02:55.090> rage<00:02:55.600> mode<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.200> after

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
can he goes full-on rage mode and after

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.320 
can he goes full-on rage mode and after
this<00:02:56.950> point<00:02:57.250> i<00:02:57.370> think<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.700> obito<00:02:57.940> lost

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
this point i think that obito lost

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.240 
this point i think that obito lost
control<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.410> spouse<00:02:59.620> who<00:03:00.100> took

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
control and that the spouse who took

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.949 
control and that the spouse who took
over<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.090> reason<00:03:01.330> why<00:03:01.420> i<00:03:01.450> believe<00:03:01.750> that

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
over and the reason why i believe that

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.080 
over and the reason why i believe that
is<00:03:02.140> because<00:03:02.650> there<00:03:02.770> was<00:03:02.860> text<00:03:03.250> as<00:03:03.400> soon<00:03:03.820> as<00:03:03.970> he

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
is because there was text as soon as he

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.820 
is because there was text as soon as he
screamed<00:03:04.420> out<00:03:04.570> when<00:03:04.870> in<00:03:05.080> rage<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.560> said

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
screamed out when in rage that said

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.710 
screamed out when in rage that said
where<00:03:06.100> am<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:06.940> assume<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:07.510> was<00:03:07.630> all

they<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.209> phase<00:03:19.450> right<00:03:19.720> through<00:03:19.959> him<00:03:20.110> so

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
they just phase right through him so

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.740 
they just phase right through him so
right<00:03:20.590> after<00:03:20.830> he<00:03:21.519> unlocks<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.970> mangekyo<00:03:22.510> he

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
right after he unlocks the mangekyo he

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.630 
right after he unlocks the mangekyo he
knows<00:03:22.930> knows<00:03:23.410> coming<00:03:23.769> right<00:03:24.010> off<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.220> bat<00:03:24.400> and

knows knows coming right off the bat and
that<00:03:24.700> just<00:03:25.299> seems<00:03:25.480> kind<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.780> odd<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.140> me

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
that just seems kind of odd to me

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.949 
that just seems kind of odd to me
personally<00:03:26.500> um<00:03:27.120> yeah<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.150> just<00:03:28.330> don't<00:03:28.660> know<00:03:28.750> it

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
personally um yeah I just don't know it

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.509 
personally um yeah I just don't know it
just<00:03:29.019> seems<00:03:29.170> like<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.470> kashi<00:03:29.769> learn<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.280> learned

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
just seems like a kashi learn I learned

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.910 
just seems like a kashi learn I learned
his<00:03:30.790> can<00:03:30.910> waste<00:03:31.060> too<00:03:31.299> late<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.720> obito<00:03:32.500> learned

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
his can waste too late and obito learned

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.039 
his can waste too late and obito learned
his<00:03:33.130> kamui<00:03:33.430> too<00:03:33.640> early<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.360> just<00:03:34.720> seemed<00:03:34.900> too

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
his kamui too early it just seemed too

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.780 
his kamui too early it just seemed too
convenient<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.830> regard<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.400> my<00:03:36.549> opinion

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
convenient in that regard in my opinion

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.789 
convenient in that regard in my opinion
that<00:03:37.360> he<00:03:37.450> learned<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:37.810> easily<00:03:38.170> but<00:03:38.530> that's

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
that he learned it so easily but that's

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.560 
that he learned it so easily but that's
just<00:03:38.890> my<00:03:39.070> opinion<00:03:39.100> I<00:03:39.640> don't<00:03:39.940> know<00:03:40.030> smiles<00:03:40.360> at

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
just my opinion I don't know smiles at

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.670 
just my opinion I don't know smiles at
you<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.720> don't<00:03:40.810> see<00:03:40.989> how<00:03:41.080> spirals<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.530> you

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
you I don't see how spirals that you

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.930 
you I don't see how spirals that you
could<00:03:41.799> have<00:03:41.890> held<00:03:42.070> him<00:03:42.130> in<00:03:42.280> that<00:03:42.430> regard<00:03:42.760> but

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
could have held him in that regard but

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.600 
could have held him in that regard but
that's<00:03:43.690> just<00:03:43.870> my<00:03:44.049> personal<00:03:44.530> little<00:03:44.709> gripe<00:03:45.010> but

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
that's just my personal little gripe but

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.789 
that's just my personal little gripe but
after<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.150> big<00:03:46.450> miss<00:03:46.780> ninja<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.290> confronts

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
the fact that written general was a spy

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.019

think that Rin was a spy personally it

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.019 
think that Rin was a spy personally it
really<00:05:08.259> seems<00:05:08.529> based<00:05:08.800> on<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.219> conversations

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:10.029 
really seems based on the conversations

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:11.820 
really seems based on the conversations
they<00:05:10.180> had<00:05:10.210> in<00:05:10.479> this<00:05:10.599> chapter<00:05:10.870> that<00:05:11.169> Rin<00:05:11.800> is

know I'm in hell and I don't know if
it's<00:06:32.169> hell<00:06:32.349> I<00:06:32.620> don't<00:06:33.159> know<00:06:33.219> what<00:06:33.430> his<00:06:33.729> person

it's hell I don't know what his person
that<00:06:34.210> I<00:06:34.300> think<00:06:34.569> that<00:06:34.779> this<00:06:35.139> is<00:06:35.319> the<00:06:35.409> other

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
that I think that this is the other

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.019 
that I think that this is the other
dimension<00:06:35.770> that<00:06:36.130> people<00:06:36.399> are<00:06:36.490> taken<00:06:36.789> to<00:06:36.819> with

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:37.029 
dimension that people are taken to with

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.329 
dimension that people are taken to with
kamui<00:06:37.389> this<00:06:37.870> is<00:06:38.050> the<00:06:38.139> other<00:06:38.469> dimension<00:06:38.680> so

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:39.339 
kamui this is the other dimension so

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:41.170 
kamui this is the other dimension so
that's<00:06:39.699> what<00:06:39.819> I<00:06:39.849> personally<00:06:40.330> think

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
that's what I personally think

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.969 
that's what I personally think
it<00:06:41.330> would<00:06:41.449> make<00:06:41.630> sense<00:06:41.660> but<00:06:42.259> that's<00:06:42.530> just<00:06:42.800> my

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
it would make sense but that's just my

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.189 
it would make sense but that's just my
personal<00:06:43.340> opinion<00:06:43.400> be<00:06:44.030> sure<00:06:44.210> to<00:06:44.360> correct<00:06:45.080> me

if<00:06:45.289> I'm<00:06:45.440> wrong<00:06:45.470> about<00:06:45.860> that<00:06:45.919> that's<00:06:46.789> what<00:06:46.970> I

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
if I'm wrong about that that's what I

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.210 
if I'm wrong about that that's what I
think<00:06:47.090> anyway<00:06:47.389> but<00:06:48.199> it<00:06:48.380> really<00:06:48.590> was<00:06:49.039> just

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220 
think anyway but it really was just

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.650 
think anyway but it really was just
ridiculously<00:06:49.729> brutal<00:06:50.120> at<00:06:50.270> the<00:06:50.419> end<00:06:50.539> of<00:06:50.570> the
