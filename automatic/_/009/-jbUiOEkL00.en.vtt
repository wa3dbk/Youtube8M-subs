00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.470
 I welcome you to a new video 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.950
 From the row the best protein in the world 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.750
 Today I'll take a look at him 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.880
 audi a1 rain 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.650
 It is a very special protein bar 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.460
 The manufacturer himself does not really have 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.150
 a lot of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.800
 in the offer and that is why this company 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.840
 Generally we are relatively unknown 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.350
 but this rule is really very much 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.230
 popular and look again at 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.679
 first up here is directly on 28 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.870
 protein no trans fats 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:37.070
 flavor -crimi vanilla and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.079
 caramel sounds first quite well 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.360
 in total, it is 85 grams total mass 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.820
 and from the values ​​you can do that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 In addition, table and parallel draw 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.930
 I have been playing in the zealous lately 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.570
 test had a closer look at the values 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.840
 So you can tell that the bar 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.789
 Has 370 kilocalories of calorific value 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.869
 I believe exactly as much as that 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:11.970
 supreme rule protein and yes a little more 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.320
 fat for less carbohydrates and 28 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.170
 protein also lies roughly in the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.560
 region of the primate I believe 30 grams 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.880
 protein per bar 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.840
 otherwise I will be the one now 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.610
 unpack and you present it 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.439
 Unpacked looks the rule then like this 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.200
 and that, of course, as the first in 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.180
 Eye stick is the white one 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.979
 Most chocolate coated rule 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.850
 are he with dark chocolate 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.680
 overdrawn 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 You can also very well the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.470
 individual must recognize 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 that is also the special thing about the bar 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.170
 he has soy nuts almost a lot 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.200
 contain and also the inner values 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.899
 actually read quite well he has 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.570
 much possible protein milk per din iso 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.270
 netka be so the protein complete 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.420
 of course, cow's milk, of course 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.530
 very good for weightlifters is very special 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.180
 before after the training 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.049
 who has now I'm mine 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.829
 Little knowledge can come from some of this 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.829
 region like this 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.409
 and yes you can get the nuts immediately 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.920
 recognize inside and have to say it 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.090
 it tastes incredibly good 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.489
 tastes very strongly of one must can 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.980
 you really think that's a protein 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.500
 Rule is more like an ordinary one 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.099
 Revier from the supermarket after the brand 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.870
 sneakers or mars yes the den 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.519
 detailed review is as always 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.650
 just below the video click on the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.480
 left subscribe me until then yours
