 Gasp incorrect 's shape you like yourself 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.750
 Well I this is a bird ginger or cream 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.580
 There is something like cats that will be brown grizzles especially 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 As size 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.990
 Slightly longer than a 9 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.380
 It is about a little soft 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380
 O planted 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.450
 Especially Gently open the Handei Deployment 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.360
 This was a step of yellow 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.330
 Have 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.150
 I told Carol Pearl is gadfly flash of pearl Toka 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
 It is Artis 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.330
 That 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.409
 I will mention the dead space 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.050
 It is such a state 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.650
 Nice was the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.650
 r 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.360
 Hey i'm going now 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.460
 Let it finish but the winding ends 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.870
 Here r Tinsel Mon 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:18.489
 It is relatively strong but it may run out, so be sure 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.489
 Coating with Aron Alpha 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.270
 I will add a little more if there is now 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.430
 And 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.580
 Ssu 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:35.020
 Let's lightly wipe it with something like this cheap cotton swab 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.630
 Because people who are being used one after another often use Aron Alpha 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.920
 You are wider please 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.970
 One by one 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.569
 Right 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.019
 If you do 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.019
 Apple 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.950
 So that before Ushirogawa 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.380
 It's just that easy 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.280
 Well then 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.280
 We Pinchushi 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.720
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.080
 You can touch 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:44.290
 Just be viewed from anywhere 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:48.000
 It's like Gezi Geji It's a so-called by-glowing so-called luscious thing 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:54.000
 There you it attention points are several 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.550
 Than so-called white or cream of such a single color pattern or such exfoliation 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.450
 It is a country 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.980
 It is a bird barrier 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.200
 Clay muscle contains such things 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.250
 If there is no such thing is attached with greedy etc. 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.250
 Using that kind of thing 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.080
 threat has use a clean mind yellow 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.680
 Two people 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.680
 Because come 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:26.670
 As much as possible the beam of lighter 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:29.320
 Hackle is up a little Para' and diagonally wearing flow Tanto this 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.860
 Throw it gracefully or fish 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.650
 It was pushed up from downwind and blown up, but the fund 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.540
 Yusurika Uni c face 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.350
 I really know reverse 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:46.940
 It breaks off quite loudly 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:51.770
 It will be quite easy to catch if you take care of only the end of the match 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:55.639
 It's slow to fit, and I'm going to bow and bow 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:59.479
 It is about hooking enough just to paste the curts Ito 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:03.409
 As we can have a pretty interesting seat, by all means 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.930
 I think it is about the corner that I keep in the box 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.169
 I lost this at number 17 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:13.820
 Usually do about No. 20 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:16.990
 No. 19 or No. 20 about the fly I think about the most easy-to-use 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.990
