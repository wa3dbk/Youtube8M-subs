headphone<00:00:29.810> you<00:00:30.109> know<00:00:30.230> input<00:00:30.560> here<00:00:30.800> on<00:00:31.010> the

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
headphone you know input here on the

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.660 
headphone you know input here on the
tablet<00:00:32.929> and<00:00:33.079> here<00:00:33.679> I<00:00:33.710> have<00:00:33.920> an<00:00:34.039> L<00:00:34.190> connector

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
tablet and here I have an L connector

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.889 
tablet and here I have an L connector
which<00:00:34.969> professionally<00:00:35.420> for<00:00:35.510> having<00:00:35.690> to<00:00:35.780> bring

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
which professionally for having to bring

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.410 
which professionally for having to bring
the<00:00:36.079> cable<00:00:36.440> around<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.159> then<00:00:37.639> bend<00:00:37.999> it<00:00:38.149> to

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
the cable around and and then bend it to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.660 
the cable around and and then bend it to
put<00:00:38.629> it<00:00:38.719> in<00:00:38.899> I<00:00:39.170> do<00:00:39.679> that<00:00:39.979> I<00:00:40.010> won't<00:00:40.249> fit<00:00:40.429> into<00:00:40.549> the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
put it in I do that I won't fit into the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.160 
put it in I do that I won't fit into the
dash<00:00:40.879> correctly<00:00:41.389> and<00:00:41.569> also<00:00:41.719> this<00:00:41.960> isn't

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
dash correctly and also this isn't

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.110 
dash correctly and also this isn't
flexible<00:00:42.409> so<00:00:42.949> it<00:00:43.399> wouldn't<00:00:43.609> be<00:00:43.670> able<00:00:43.819> to<00:00:43.909> bend

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
flexible so it wouldn't be able to bend

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.579 
flexible so it wouldn't be able to bend
like<00:00:44.239> that<00:00:44.359> anyway<00:00:44.659> so<00:00:44.719> this<00:00:44.989> L<00:00:45.199> connector

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
like that anyway so this L connector

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:46.930 
like that anyway so this L connector
will<00:00:45.739> prevent<00:00:45.979> me<00:00:46.129> for<00:00:46.280> having<00:00:46.370> to<00:00:46.519> do<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:46.729> I

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
will prevent me for having to do that I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.000 
will prevent me for having to do that I
just<00:00:47.420> bring<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.629> cable<00:00:47.989> straight<00:00:48.440> in<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:48.889> it

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
just bring the cable straight in and it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.829 
just bring the cable straight in and it
goes<00:00:49.129> straight<00:00:49.219> back<00:00:49.339> into<00:00:49.729> the<00:00:49.819> dash<00:00:50.030> on<00:00:50.719> the

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
goes straight back into the dash on the

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.959 
goes straight back into the dash on the
other<00:00:51.049> side<00:00:51.319> of<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.530> tablet<00:00:51.769> I<00:00:52.069> have<00:00:52.129> my<00:00:52.639> USB

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
other side of the tablet I have my USB

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.459 
other side of the tablet I have my USB
cable<00:00:53.420> which<00:00:53.569> really<00:00:54.019> has<00:00:54.139> nothing<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.379> do

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
cable which really has nothing to do

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.160 
cable which really has nothing to do
with<00:00:54.499> audio<00:00:54.889> but<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:55.339> have<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:55.879> connected<00:00:56.719> and

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
with audio but I have this connected and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.109 
with audio but I have this connected and
I<00:00:57.319> just<00:00:57.499> run<00:00:57.649> a<00:00:57.679> cable<00:00:57.889> straight<00:00:58.339> back<00:00:58.549> and

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.119 
I just run a cable straight back and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.299 
I just run a cable straight back and
back<00:00:59.779> through<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.079> back<00:01:00.229> and<00:01:01.039> all<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.279> way

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
back through the back and all the way

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.819 
back through the back and all the way
through<00:01:01.429> my<00:01:02.239> car<00:01:02.600> center<00:01:02.839> console<00:01:03.229> it<00:01:03.499> in<00:01:03.649> my

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
through my car center console it in my

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.859 
through my car center console it in my
just<00:01:04.100> bring<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.399> up<00:01:04.489> right<00:01:04.519> here<00:01:04.879> so<00:01:05.059> this<00:01:05.719> is

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
just bring it up right here so this is

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.899 
just bring it up right here so this is
if<00:01:06.049> I<00:01:06.170> need<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.500> charge<00:01:07.159> it<00:01:07.280> I'll<00:01:07.399> just<00:01:07.549> plug<00:01:07.789> it

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
if I need to charge it I'll just plug it

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.789 
if I need to charge it I'll just plug it
in<00:01:07.969> there<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:08.659> goes<00:01:08.840> without<00:01:08.960> charging<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:09.680> not

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
in there it goes without charging so not

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.999 
in there it goes without charging so not
to<00:01:09.920> mess<00:01:10.039> with<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.250> too<00:01:10.399> often<00:01:11.020> so<00:01:12.020> that's

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
to mess with that too often so that's

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.639 
to mess with that too often so that's
pretty<00:01:13.219> much<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.789> as<00:01:14.119> far<00:01:14.149> as<00:01:14.530> how<00:01:15.530> I'm

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
pretty much it as far as how I'm

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.620 
pretty much it as far as how I'm
connected<00:01:16.100> it's<00:01:16.490> just<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:17.060> know<00:01:17.119> just<00:01:17.179> from

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
connected it's just you know just from

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.039 
connected it's just you know just from
your<00:01:17.719> Jack<00:01:17.990> RCA<00:01:18.520> jack<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.640> RCA<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.359> I'm<00:01:20.869> going

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
your Jack RCA jack to RCA and I'm going

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.480 
your Jack RCA jack to RCA and I'm going
to<00:01:21.079> cut<00:01:21.289> right<00:01:21.469> now<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.920> show<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.369> other

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
to cut right now and show you the other

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.910 
to cut right now and show you the other
side<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.149> on<00:01:23.420> where<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.350> integration<00:01:24.799> is

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
side of this on where the integration is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.819 
side of this on where the integration is
into<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.880> mini<00:01:26.090> app<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:26.479> I<00:01:26.539> have<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.590> here's

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
into the mini app that I have so here's

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.200 
into the mini app that I have so here's
the<00:01:27.950> other<00:01:28.070> side<00:01:28.399> of<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.759> madness

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
the other side of the madness

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.730 
the other side of the madness
essentially<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:30.079> have<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.179> Jack<00:01:32.179> to<00:01:32.299> RCA<00:01:32.740> here

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
essentially I have the Jack to RCA here

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.219 
essentially I have the Jack to RCA here
goes<00:01:33.859> RCA<00:01:34.249> connections<00:01:34.880> here<00:01:35.179> and<00:01:35.359> it<00:01:36.049> just

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
goes RCA connections here and it just

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.719 
goes RCA connections here and it just
goes<00:01:36.350> back<00:01:36.740> into<00:01:37.420> my<00:01:38.979> mini<00:01:39.979> floor<00:01:40.310> app<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:40.670> I

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
goes back into my mini floor app that I

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.910 
goes back into my mini floor app that I
