00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.419
 Hello, today we will open 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.009
 parcel I would say so very 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.710
 long-suffering package 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.590
 package wrapped went to me and 23 days and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.369
 the story of this premise began somewhere else 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.210
 two months ago we asked me to order 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.739
 one smartphone is so very unusual 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.110
 but unfortunately unfortunately one seller 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.000
 did not deceive tusya paid he said there 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.860
 what will be that is while the money is back 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.230
 to here then the second seller me 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 I cheated here then 3 seller that is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.860
 some spoke the truth that is and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.170
 when asked there is no availability in 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.210
 stock it is good not ordered if yes 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.280
 there is only very little come on quickly 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.550
 order because it is already running out 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.890
 Letâ€™s pay your order quickly 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.670
 in the end was not available 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.380
 here then I decided to order here here 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.229
 forest not 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.450
 Here I think it seems as if there were no such 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.159
 jokes with them 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.679
 order in them uni suddenly there is no 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.299
 ie Cove principle was not but then 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.929
 In short, the seller writes to me 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:31.340
 writes to us write not calling says that 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:31.340
 they say you know the address 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.829
 says you know well no this 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.960
 apparatus available 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.670
 so I say listen well choose January 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.799
 some other device I say yes not 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.539
 tired of me already chosen let's be 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.310
 there to cancel the order says well 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.500
 and select another device but I principle 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.000
 I have long wanted to order this 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.609
 smartphone to hell 5000 ie 4400 i 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.349
 seen a lot of reviews 5000 principle still 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.420
 as if such a complete roughly speaking 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:12.819
 Basically, I did not see the dispenser myself 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.739
 this model is interesting here because one 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.510
 of the few representatives so 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.400
 called long-livers who he 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.440
 ten lashes are presented in Chinese 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.019
 Chinese smartphone market and I really 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.030
 I wonder how real is how long 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:31.269
 he he he will live fun 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.379
 sticky yes well if 100 cat is not right 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.859
 then most likely it will be possible 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.709
 driving works on display 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.299
 so here we have that she probably probably 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.489
 see and that he is not sending a place 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.010
 smartphone dates hotel 3 thousand but again 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.019
 this 5,000 effect he didn't send two 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.609
 of the week 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.530
 for two weeks he did not send saying 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.709
 it is as if he is well, must not fail 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.200
 here is day to day it is shorter than two days 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.299
 weeks two weeks they sent and 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.500
 finally they sent finally 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.299
 after 23 days 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.290
 got a shorter historian just a tin 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:09.780
 the war is so long want to get 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:14.319
 Mini had this crooked oblique film pasted 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.000
 it's all nonsense from the statements 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.940
 producer all of us roots gorilla 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.569
 glass 3 which proactively factory 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.870
 covered up with plenochkoy well in general here 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.880
 such a smart phone in black from 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.709
 white black i decided to take black because 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.000
 whether the smartphone bought a review 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.740
 respectively then 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.820
 he will be sold well in black he 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.800
 principle should go faster here at all 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.750
 just have these smartphones which 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.540
 big batteries that is well i principle 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.820
 If you remember in a long time ago somewhere 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.720
 9 months ago, I sold my quietly 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.390
 quiet and lenovo p780 with which i walked 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.700
 half a year half a year here and I wanted 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.540
 somehow but the battery is all cool it 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.050
 it was but I missed 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.620
 performance cap what but 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.980
 open teaches about very tight opens 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.080
 the lid is generally just hard and so does 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.150
 here are two sim cards 1 micro sim 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.720
 The standard reset button is fine 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.400
 Well, we have a non-removable battery for 5000 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.900
 mile but we will test it all 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.140
 check of course there will be a full review 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.980
 on so on topic about long-livers then 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.020
 but I wanted to eat 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:28.570
 well so that when the mtk processor is already out 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.460
 6580 to make a normal phone with 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.560
 normal big batteries on 8-core 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.930
 the processor well, not the steering wheel was so hard 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.610
 I waited a long time later lenovo released from 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.560
 860 to cool machine all is well 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.330
 stylish as it were updated all cool but 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.240
 why us eighty second process and 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.080
 why are they ninety second here and when 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.350
 Appeared rest or video amanda first 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.060
 4400 then 5000 first 5000 then 4400 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.130
 and when I saw what was in it 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.290
 eight-core processor put on further 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.560
 5000 battery decided that I am very 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.470
 wanted to look at him because 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.510
 very much interested in how real he is 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.850
 will work for a long time with such 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.010
 characteristics and can he sheet 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.600
 compete with products from 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.560
 lenovo the same 700 8 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.419
 old there already with 860 you shorter 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.650
 such a tangled story leave alpha 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:26.200
 5000 finally she came to me and 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.270
 Of course I was driving I was driving a fly 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.250
 good now very well 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.760
 He worked now have a look anyway 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.000
 it starts by the way the cap 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:41.000
 Mickey under the bank is placed in the bumper and so 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:52.050
 here we should already have Russian 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:55.680
 well under the tone of work here it is flat 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.990
 everything is fine so everything has come in Russian 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.790
 factory firmware we already have 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.480
 nothing needs to be added to the language 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.820
 this is already very good so android 4 4 2 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.250
 super and so not only is 6592 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.280
 it is also worth it one more time smart 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.770
 one of the type is standard and two 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.640
 so 8 gigabytes on board memory 2 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.840
 gigabyte of RAM so firmware version 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.210
 firmware 10 for 7 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.320
 Well, the principle is not very hubs old here 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.930
 I think that I will not need to change the principle 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.030
 that's what such a smartphone interesting 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.370
 we will test it shorter 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.890
 how well what why one 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.010
 accordingly, then we will do the full 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:40.080
 full full with full review 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:44.760
 so now we will try immediately bumper 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:51.570
 parent we already have a bumper case so this 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:53.520
 still close closed not closed well 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.530
 I can say right away that the smartphone principle 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.100
 not as fat as 53 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.100
 battery 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:07.700
 Gorgeous x Velcro eyelids and appears 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.930
 here we have part of the projection screen 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:15.870
 cool yes watch probably just 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.520
 when the device will call then rather 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.590
 just here you can answer and so 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.050
 at home but we will see hopefully not 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.030
 I forget in the review it also show here 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.730
 in short , let's start testing 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:29.730
 check that so why and why and then 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.380
 draw conclusions all just on this video 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.380
 I will finish a reference on the seller 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.330
 put under the video but if you want to 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.240
 then orders or just still put 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.590
 a couple of alternative other sellers 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.230
 so that you can 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.670
 buy everything then on this i will 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.470
 say goodbye thank you so much for 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.090
 looked at the video I hope that the video you 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.740
 It was interesting if you have any 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.420
 questions on this phone that is 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.310
 smartphone 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.770
 something you would like to learn to something 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.530
 I checked in the review I write 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.330
 I will definitely try to do everything to 

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:04.020
 of course you did not forget because memory oh 

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:07.340
 memory I tell you latins everything then 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.340
 thanks again bye
