this video always I have been talking to
you<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.869> tracking<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.860> said

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
you all about tracking as I said

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.590 
you all about tracking as I said
tracking<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.610> base<00:01:35.790> when<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.060> bring<00:01:36.210> my<00:01:36.360> hands

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
tracking is base when I bring my hands

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.710 
tracking is base when I bring my hands
to<00:01:36.720> my<00:01:36.900> sides<00:01:37.170> I'll<00:01:37.740> bring<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.310> knees<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.360> little

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to my sides I'll bring my knees a little

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.060 
to my sides I'll bring my knees a little
closer<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.259> each<00:01:40.380> other<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:40.920> basically

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
closer to each other and then basically

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.700 
closer to each other and then basically
I<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.610> moved<00:01:42.000> from<00:01:42.090> position<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> position

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
I just I moved from position to position

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.960 
I just I moved from position to position
location<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.009> location<00:01:44.040> while<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
location to location while I'm in the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
location to location while I'm in the
air<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.570> whole<00:01:45.720> point<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.409> have

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
air the whole point of it like I have

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.319 
air the whole point of it like I have
said<00:01:46.829> many<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.090> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
said many of that but so it's all is so

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.210 
said many of that but so it's all is so
when<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.899> pull<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.259> parachute<00:01:49.770> people<00:01:50.130> are

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
when I do pull my parachute people are

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.499 
when I do pull my parachute people are
aware<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.790> could<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.390> way

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
aware and they could get out of the way

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.620 
aware and they could get out of the way
so<00:01:51.540> no<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.770> any<00:01:53.100> harm<00:01:53.399> whatsoever<00:01:53.670> but

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
so no one is in any harm whatsoever but

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
so no one is in any harm whatsoever but
in<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.500> guys<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.770> finally

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
in this one I think you guys can finally

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.730 
in this one I think you guys can finally
see<00:01:56.579> how<00:01:57.000> cool<00:01:57.240> tracking<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.110> you

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
see how cool tracking is because you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.889 
see how cool tracking is because you
basically<00:01:59.460> Iron<00:01:59.939> Man<00:02:00.149> Superman<00:02:00.600> when<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.750> go

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
basically Iron Man Superman when you go

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.179 
basically Iron Man Superman when you go
into<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> tracking<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:01.710> you're<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.009> flying

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
into the tracking but you're just flying

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.560 
into the tracking but you're just flying
from<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> left<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.090> wherever<00:02:03.299> you

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
