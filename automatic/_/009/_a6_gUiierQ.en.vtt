with boots yeah these sorts of these

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.930 
with boots yeah these sorts of these
sorts<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.060> skirts<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:48.370> never<00:02:49.370> used<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.700> like

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
sorts of skirts I never used to like

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.590 
sorts of skirts I never used to like
because<00:02:50.750> I'm<00:02:51.019> quite<00:02:51.260> heavy<00:02:52.120> but<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.150> think

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
because I'm quite heavy but I think

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.720 
because I'm quite heavy but I think
especially<00:02:54.170> we've<00:02:54.650> got<00:02:54.829> layers<00:02:55.040> on<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.670> you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
especially we've got layers on and you

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.220 
especially we've got layers on and you
sort<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:55.940> hide<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.360> lumps<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.720> bumps<00:02:56.780> like

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
sort of hide the lumps and bumps like

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.470 
sort of hide the lumps and bumps like
with<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.709> cardigan<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.370> think<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.030> works<00:02:59.180> quite

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480
