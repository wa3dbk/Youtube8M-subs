 Do not promise too much if I am 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.810
 claim that this week 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.080
 culinary highlight expected 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.910
 because it is joke week that is of 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.369
 start today, there are up to 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.829
 Every Thursday a delicious pizza 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.259
 but that's not enough this pizza week 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:33.170
 is continued on friday by the 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.480
 great multi core i on saturday through the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.370
 fantastic christi of American 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.980
 cook and on sunday through the 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.630
 wonderful epro of barcoo ends yet 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.910
 Today we start with the first 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.490
 basic namely how will an original 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.520
 Italian pizza dough made and 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.600
 We need a little bit of modeling for that 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.970
 sugar salt some lard 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.920
 beer yeast really no fresh throws 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.560
 Help and also no dry yeast and her 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.090
 gets bioladen in the reformhaus and also 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.519
 the larger grocers 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.710
 We also need much more 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.020
 because we prepare ten pizza right away 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.409
 So it's perfect for any party 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.370
 suitable first we go into one 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.320
 bowl and whisk is good 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.270
 and then we need a pretty big one 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.970
 bowl put in the beer yeast 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.230
 fill with a liter of water and 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.050
 that should be lukewarm 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.760
 pour in sugar and stir 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.159
 everything short for that is suitable 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.710
 whisk afterwards we go a quarter 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.930
 to protect the sea towards the salt 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.260
 above and stir everything again 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.260
 thoroughly 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.229
 now we go the second quarter of 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.479
 into the sea 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.750
 as well as lard and one 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.150
 tablespoon full of embody and now 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.450
 At least one of our hands is asked 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.460
 if we knead everything and give it 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.110
 the one by one the remaining ones 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.020
 second half of the sea into it 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.330
 always eager to pour a little 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.159
 continue to knead and process the whole 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.869
 is already so about ten minutes in 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.640
 course also take a claim 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.979
 a little bit depending on how nimble he is 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.129
 just knead the dough and the more 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.390
 Add and knead all the more 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.370
 Of course, that too changes 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.870
 consistency of the dough and if you then 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.030
 also the last rest of the sea 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.350
 have added and the dough always 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.300
 continue by kneading 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.400
 you come to a point where the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.440
 dough then lightly from the bottom and bowl 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.090
 land solves and this was our goal 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.260
 We then move a work surface and 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.330
 do not put the dough on the dough 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.430
 continue to knead the work surface and 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.710
 I have my technology in the distance 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.560
 knead a page to knead 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.110
 then turn and repeat the process 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.480
 to reform the dough to a kind of brut 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.650
 bowl over and then for 15 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.200
 to rest for a few minutes 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.910
 Now the bowl decrease again the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.400
 dough again for about ten seconds 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.350
 knead thoroughly 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.560
 the bowl back on it and this 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.610
 repeat the whole process three more times 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.010
 and that 's the dough so far 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.880
 We prepared him in ten pieces 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:16.490
 and I can halve it 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.410
 first detail ball shapes that one 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.630
 half and later the other too 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.540
 an oblong part under coach him 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.890
 in five equal parts as possible 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.600
 is a bit of judgment required 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.430
 that's why i draw this more or 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.200
 less at first with the knife 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.200
 and then it is cut up 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.460
 then the individual 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.410
 shaped dough pieces into balls 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.540
 with the second half will as well 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.920
 Proceed until you're ten in the end 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.780
 have this dough balls 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.910
 Let's go on a board or this 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.950
 similar with a distance of about 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.050
 two centimeters cover it with one 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.660
 towel and leave in a cool place 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.330
 not as you would otherwise end up with yeast dough 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.210
 for does not scare five to seven 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.040
 hours rest or go however can 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.810
 her the pastry also so portioned or 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.820
 later also shaped if you do not 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.310
 Immediately needs to enter the freezer 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.260
 then they look like that 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.630
 which we now also train to form 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.940
 come of the day and we take to it 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.130
 each a dough piece on a board 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.660
 or a work surface and shape it 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.910
 with the fingertips to a disc 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.410
 try this a bit evenly 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.160
 but that should not be 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.990
 be a problem 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.120
 and then we put a bowl on 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.400
 best one of steel either on one 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.110
 floured work surface or how I do that 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.540
 make a dishcloth here and 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.810
 put the parts on top and now 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.970
 Let's press the part 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.680
 from the middle with your hands behind 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.560
 on the outside then turn the keys 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.660
 piece and repeat the process and 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.250
 We continue this until the 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.800
 dough slice the desired size 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.510
 or hold stronger and that 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.100
 then it was already finished 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.500
 shaped dough we go to one 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.330
 workspace and can now each 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.460
 according to the recipe and which ones 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.040
 opportunities there because there this in the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.200
 next day more recipe of guidance 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.270
 By the way, the shapes come from antonio 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.730
