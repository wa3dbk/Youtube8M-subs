00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.850

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.850

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.699
 good friends this time I bring you new 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.619
 server that have opened this time them 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.810
 I bring what would be the micro server 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.150
 butler and how can you see here I already 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.650
 I have it we will quickly see them 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.230
 I'm going to leave the entire description of 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.059
 video so they can enter is 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.309
 currently what would be in its beta phase 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.469
 and so I recommend you to enter what 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.899
 which would be then with his pure my graph without 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.699
 need to enter with block launcher 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.160
 since it will create them 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.960
 now and then not now 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.510
 testing what would be then the 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.300
 normal minecraft and I played some time ago 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.100
 how many games but he still has 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.140
 pretty but pretty long what 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.000
 It would be the server, not as they can 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.980
 see here is when they enter they are going to have 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.040
 that register only give you diagonal 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.560
 register and space and then 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.540
 they will enter their password, not as you can see 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.230
 there are a few servers this game 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.300
 I was pretty 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.580
 popular in what would be minecraft of pc 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.590
 a time that quite a lot of people were 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.870
 going up and well then let's see here 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.450
 let's go into this one that has 10 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.460
 little people so that it does not get long what 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.650
 what would this video be and how can you see 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.470
 for there he is as a seer with what 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.570
 it would be minecraft of pc and then the bad 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.130
 as I was telling you, it's pretty 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.600
 but quite long what would be the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.880
 server since it is in its phase 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.280
 beta is not there as you can see from 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.250
 the start they give you a wooden sword a 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.980
 bow 4 arrow 6 loaves and what would be 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.540
 for leather armor there is not like 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.120
 can see is pretty good just 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.100
 we have to wait for them to stamp 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.170
 in what would be the game to start 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.550
 so it would be the battle not and as 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.380
 I was telling them a while ago I was 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.330
 playing but as you can see it has 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.220
 quite but quite luck what would be 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.770
 the server and these cushions are 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.870
 doing there his his way the recommend 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.350
 in this game to do so now 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.060
 so the short his wall or that they rise to 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.030
 what would be the up part of 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.430
 of this to be able to kill everyone not 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.960

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.850

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.950
 because they threw the lava because nothing 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.860

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.780
 desperation to hit because it's going away 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.069
