whole epoxy musta got deteriorated

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.609 
whole epoxy musta got deteriorated
I<00:01:13.740> guess<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> gas<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:15.960> sloshes<00:01:16.590> around

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I guess the gas when it sloshes around

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.460 
I guess the gas when it sloshes around
and<00:01:17.130> hits<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> sidewalls<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.720> epoxy<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.229> have

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and hits the sidewalls the epoxy I have

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
and hits the sidewalls the epoxy I have
underneath<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.790> turned

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
underneath there it just it turned

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.440 
underneath there it just it turned
yellow

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
yellow

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.609 
yellow
after<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.590> about<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.250> guess<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.939> year<00:01:24.509> maybe<00:01:25.350> my

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
after all about I guess a year maybe my

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
after all about I guess a year maybe my
last<00:01:25.799> video<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> put<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.689> put

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
last video when I put it on when I put

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.520 
last video when I put it on when I put
the<00:01:28.320> gas<00:01:28.500> cap<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.950> last<00:01:29.220> year<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.240> gas<00:01:30.990> cap<00:01:31.259> came

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the gas cap on last year so gas cap came

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.350 
the gas cap on last year so gas cap came
off<00:01:31.740> that's<00:01:32.220> why<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> never<00:01:32.670> throw<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:32.939> any<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
off that's why I never throw out any of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.810 
off that's why I never throw out any of
the<00:01:33.420> old<00:01:33.570> stuff<00:01:33.840> through<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> old<00:01:35.220> gas<00:01:35.460> cap

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the old stuff through on the old gas cap

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.090 
the old stuff through on the old gas cap
and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.810> continued<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.350> ride<00:01:37.560> screwing

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
the website on the internet on the

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.750 
the website on the internet on the

images and it has its own screen so
basically<00:04:52.180> if<00:04:52.750> you<00:04:52.870> did<00:04:53.050> not<00:04:53.170> know<00:04:53.230> it's<00:04:53.770> like

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
basically if you did not know it's like

basically if you did not know it's like
its<00:04:54.220> own<00:04:54.340> filter<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.480> any<00:04:55.720> of<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:55.930> debris

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
its own filter so any of the debris

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.960 
its own filter so any of the debris
that's<00:04:56.410> ever<00:04:56.620> in<00:04:56.740> there<00:04:56.920> would<00:04:57.190> never<00:04:57.370> even<00:04:57.640> go

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
that's ever in there would never even go

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.060 
that's ever in there would never even go
through<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.570> petcock<00:04:58.960> which<00:04:59.740> would<00:04:59.920> go

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
through the petcock which would go

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.650 
through the petcock which would go
through<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.760> filter<00:05:00.970> which<00:05:01.270> would<00:05:01.420> go<00:05:01.510> into

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
through the filter which would go into

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.840 
through the filter which would go into
the<00:05:01.810> carburetor<00:05:02.080> which<00:05:02.710> is<00:05:02.860> good<00:05:03.010> so<00:05:03.820> I

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
the carburetor which is good so I

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.450 
the carburetor which is good so I
changed<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.480> fuel<00:05:04.690> filter<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.920> was<00:05:06.040> like<00:05:06.190> a

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.350 
fuel goes and then this piece sat on top
of<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.020> filter<00:05:38.260> like<00:05:38.680> that<00:05:38.919> so<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:39.700> was<00:05:40.210> trying

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
of the filter like that so I was trying

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.570 
of the filter like that so I was trying
to<00:05:40.480> do<00:05:40.570> a<00:05:40.600> cutaway<00:05:40.930> model<00:05:41.410> but<00:05:42.070> it's<00:05:42.220> just<00:05:42.430> so

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
to do a cutaway model but it's just so

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.150 
to do a cutaway model but it's just so
far<00:05:42.850> gone<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.260> new<00:05:44.380> one<00:05:44.530> is<00:05:44.680> all<00:05:44.830> clear

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
far gone the the new one is all clear

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
far gone the the new one is all clear
and<00:05:46.380> you<00:05:47.380> know<00:05:47.500> that's<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:47.890> I<00:05:48.070> don't<00:05:48.250> don't<00:05:48.790> see

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
and you know that's it I don't don't see

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.200 
and you know that's it I don't don't see
anything<00:05:49.390> crazy<00:05:49.979> well<00:05:50.979> so<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.460> fuel<00:05:51.700> comes<00:05:52.000> in

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
anything crazy well so the fuel comes in

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.110 
anything crazy well so the fuel comes in
from<00:05:52.419> this<00:05:52.600> sits<00:05:52.870> under<00:05:53.260> the<00:05:53.350> tank<00:05:53.560> like<00:05:53.740> this

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.960 

and<00:05:58.120> that's<00:05:58.300> it<00:05:59.340> back<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.490> what<00:06:00.580> I<00:06:00.640> was<00:06:00.669> doing

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
and that's it back to what I was doing

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.270 
and that's it back to what I was doing
so<00:06:01.150> this<00:06:01.300> is<00:06:01.390> the<00:06:01.479> cutout<00:06:01.810> fuel<00:06:02.650> goes<00:06:02.860> into<00:06:03.160> the

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
so this is the cutout fuel goes into the

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.250 
so this is the cutout fuel goes into the
right<00:06:03.460> goes<00:06:04.060> through<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.360> filter<00:06:04.720> and<00:06:04.900> then

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
right goes through the filter and then

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.870 
right goes through the filter and then
out<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.590> middle<00:06:05.830> boot<00:06:06.100> right<00:06:06.310> it<00:06:06.460> sits<00:06:06.700> right

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
out the middle boot right it sits right

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.240 
out the middle boot right it sits right
underneath<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.330> tank<00:06:07.570> it's<00:06:08.050> all<00:06:08.229> white<00:06:08.470> it

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
underneath the tank it's all white it

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.370 
underneath the tank it's all white it
takes<00:06:09.520> two<00:06:09.729> seconds<00:06:10.150> mmm<00:06:10.810> takes<00:06:11.020> longer<00:06:11.290> to

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
takes two seconds mmm takes longer to

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.380 
takes two seconds mmm takes longer to
take<00:06:11.500> a<00:06:11.560> tank<00:06:11.770> often<00:06:12.100> install<00:06:12.400> this<00:06:12.550> so

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
take a tank often install this so

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.180 
take a tank often install this so
basically<00:06:13.510> I<00:06:13.870> never<00:06:13.960> changed<00:06:14.500> this<00:06:14.620> like<00:06:15.070> I

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
fuel filter and I'll probably never

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.720 
fuel filter and I'll probably never
change<00:06:56.320> the<00:06:56.410> fuel<00:06:56.620> filter<00:06:56.950> again<00:06:57.220> and<00:06:57.430> I<00:06:57.490> drain

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
change the fuel filter again and I drain

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.600 
change the fuel filter again and I drain
