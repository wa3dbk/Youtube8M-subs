our genetic engineer is combined the
genes<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.660> retarded<00:00:10.139> kid<00:00:10.349> with<00:00:10.980> those<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.670> a

else that don't don't worry we got a new

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.220 
else that don't don't worry we got a new
genetic<00:00:28.529> engineer<00:00:29.340> who<00:00:29.789> actually<00:00:30.240> has<00:00:30.869> at

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
genetic engineer who actually has at

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.620 
genetic engineer who actually has at
least<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:32.390> brain<00:00:33.390> cell<00:00:34.520> well<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.820> did<00:00:36.090> was

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
least one brain cell well what I did was

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.389 
least one brain cell well what I did was
these<00:00:36.899> genes<00:00:37.170> from<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.469> different<00:00:37.890> retarded

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
these genes from a different retarded

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.670 
these genes from a different retarded
kid<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.000> combine<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.230> giraffe

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
named Lucy Liu and an astronaut and we

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.959 
named Lucy Liu and an astronaut and we
now<00:00:44.700> got<00:00:45.059> space<00:00:45.989> Chuck<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:48.800> Giants

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
now got space Chuck the Giants

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.660 
now got space Chuck the Giants
he's<00:00:51.969> friendly<00:00:52.480> fluffy<00:00:53.409> and<00:00:53.679> if<00:00:54.280> you<00:00:54.429> don't
