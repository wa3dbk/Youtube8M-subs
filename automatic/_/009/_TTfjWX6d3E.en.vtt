I<00:00:00.120> just<00:00:00.659> made<00:00:00.810> two<00:00:01.020> of<00:00:01.140> them<00:00:02.060> that's<00:00:03.060> all<00:00:03.330> I

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
I just made two of them that's all I

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.809 
I just made two of them that's all I
made<00:00:03.750> I<00:00:04.080> made<00:00:04.110> two<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.650> them<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.670> other

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
made I made two of them and the other

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.839 
made I made two of them and the other
one<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.629> other<00:00:06.930> one<00:00:07.170> was<00:00:07.680> taken<00:00:08.519> by<00:00:08.670> my

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
one the other one was taken by my

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.930 
one the other one was taken by my
partner<00:00:09.300> one<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> secrets<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:11.070> getting

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
partner one of the secrets of getting

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.140 
partner one of the secrets of getting
away<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.269> doing<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:13.080> curved<00:00:14.009> shape<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.969> this

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
away with doing a curved shape like this

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.630 
away with doing a curved shape like this
I<00:00:15.360> mean<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.809> look<00:00:16.170> at<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> shape<00:00:16.710> now<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.250> it

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
I mean you look at the shape now and it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.679 
I mean you look at the shape now and it
looks<00:00:17.760> like<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> nice<00:00:18.420> curve<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.960> space<00:00:19.289> right

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
looks like a nice curve in space right

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.490 
looks like a nice curve in space right
actually<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:22.140> lies<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:23.279> plane<00:00:24.350> it's<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
actually it lies in one plane it's a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.169 
actually it lies in one plane it's a
straight<00:00:26.150> slab<00:00:27.150> piece<00:00:28.279> because<00:00:29.279> if<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.939> look

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
straight slab piece because if you look

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.920 
straight slab piece because if you look
at<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.510> at<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> certain<00:00:31.470> angle<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.300> is<00:00:33.300> an

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
at it at a certain angle it is an

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.680 
at it at a certain angle it is an
absolutely<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.829> vertical<00:00:35.309> line<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> only

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
absolutely a vertical line and the only

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.500 
absolutely a vertical line and the only
reason<00:00:37.079> why<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.469> work<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> did

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
reason why this work is because I did

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.400 
reason why this work is because I did
this<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.050> never<00:00:40.950> allow<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.790> eye<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.200> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
this I never allow your eye to see that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.240 
this I never allow your eye to see that
vertical<00:00:43.890> line<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.610> you're<00:00:44.789> constantly

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
vertical line because you're constantly

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
vertical line because you're constantly
interacting<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.460> these<00:00:47.610> other<00:00:48.020> lines<00:00:49.020> in

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
interacting with these other lines in

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
interacting with these other lines in
space<00:00:50.660> see<00:00:51.660> even<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.370> turned<00:00:55.910> this

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
space see even this like I turned this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
space see even this like I turned this
is<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> straight<00:00:57.600> piece<00:00:59.690> this<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.989> absolutely

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
is a straight piece this is absolutely

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.030 
is a straight piece this is absolutely
straight<00:01:02.660> in<00:01:03.660> him<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.350> course<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> plane

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
straight in him of course the plane

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.730 
straight in him of course the plane
where<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.939> actually<00:01:06.810> saw<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
where I can actually saw it on the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.469 
where I can actually saw it on the
bandsaw<00:01:10.460> as<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:14.479> straight

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
bandsaw as you see this is one straight

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.740 
bandsaw as you see this is one straight
line<00:01:16.250> which<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.610> when<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> point<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.630> out

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
line which you have when I point it out

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.109 
line which you have when I point it out
to<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.369> ignore<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
to you you see it if you ignore all the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.840 
to you you see it if you ignore all the
rest<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.509> them<00:01:21.710> but<00:01:22.710> would<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.250> look<00:01:23.490> at<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
rest of them but would you look at the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.270 
rest of them but would you look at the
cherammal<00:01:24.330> unity<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> never<00:01:25.229> notice<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
cherammal unity you never notice it

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.420 
cherammal unity you never notice it
however<00:01:27.439> once<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.710> would<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.920> something<00:01:29.400> like

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
however once you would do something like

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.149 
however once you would do something like
this<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:31.820> if<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.119> change<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.020> angle<00:01:34.159> at

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
this you if you change the angle at

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520 
this you if you change the angle at
which<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.700> these<00:01:36.119> two<00:01:36.390> pieces<00:01:36.600> these<00:01:37.290> two

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
which you these two pieces these two

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.620 
which you these two pieces these two
segments<00:01:38.159> intersect<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.680> change<00:01:41.630> this

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
segments intersect you will change this

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.590 
segments intersect you will change this
dimension<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.579> see<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.479> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
dimension here you can see that if I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.780 
dimension here you can see that if I
change<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.290> angle<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:47.310> way<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.380> arms<00:01:49.790> will

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
change the angle this way the arms will

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.819 
change the angle this way the arms will
go<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.509> these<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:53.009> go<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.649> only

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
go out and these will go in it can only

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.639 
go out and these will go in it can only
be<00:01:56.189> an<00:01:56.549> inch<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.600> doesn't<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.380> much

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
be an inch that doesn't have to be much

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.319 
be an inch that doesn't have to be much
and<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.939> will<00:02:00.119> make<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> difference<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:02.329> that

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and it will make a difference so that

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.260 
and it will make a difference so that
was<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.170> difference<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> two<00:02:05.130> chairs<00:02:05.430> but

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
was the difference in the two chairs but

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.440 
was the difference in the two chairs but
the<00:02:06.479> seat<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.799> back<00:02:08.250> all<00:02:08.610> destroyed<00:02:09.179> all

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the seat and the back all destroyed all

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.370 
the seat and the back all destroyed all
the<00:02:09.739> structures<00:02:10.739> of

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
the structures of

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.760 
the structures of
keep<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.530> mind<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:13.040> chair<00:02:13.520> is<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:14.240> fact

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
keep in mind a chair is in fact

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.160 
keep in mind a chair is in fact
sculpture<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.940> only<00:02:17.210> time<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.690> see<00:02:17.720> a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
sculpture you the only time you see a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.940 
sculpture you the only time you see a
chair<00:02:18.560> say<00:02:18.980> from<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.880> front<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.870> when<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.710> buy

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
chair say from the front is when you buy

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.600 
chair say from the front is when you buy
it<00:02:22.030> that's<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.300> only<00:02:23.600> time<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:25.400> is

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
it that's the only time and that is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.840 
it that's the only time and that is
usually<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.090> most<00:02:26.420> unfortunate<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:28.520> know<00:02:28.640> on

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
usually the most unfortunate you know on

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.630 
usually the most unfortunate you know on
the<00:02:29.150> view<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.630> chair<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.920> normally<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.430> see

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
the view of a chair you normally you see

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.540 
the view of a chair you normally you see
it<00:02:31.700> from<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.000> back<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.510> side<00:02:32.800> over<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.340> top

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
it from the back the side over the top

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.130
