first two towns and I'm starting to move
on<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.410> mountain<00:00:35.040> range<00:00:35.280> which<00:00:35.610> will

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
on to the mountain range which will

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.939 
on to the mountain range which will
extend<00:00:35.970> in<00:00:36.420> both<00:00:36.600> directions<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.769> way

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
extend in both directions in this way

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.910 
extend in both directions in this way
you<00:00:37.980> will<00:00:38.339> then<00:00:38.610> curve<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.089> into<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.449> volcano

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
you will then curve up into a volcano

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.460 
you will then curve up into a volcano
around<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.280> around<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.089> shore<00:00:42.330> and<00:00:42.659> on<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
around this around the shore and on this

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.740 
around this around the shore and on this
side<00:00:43.650> it'll<00:00:43.949> go<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.790> point<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.269> a<00:00:45.420> snowy

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
side it'll go up to a point of a snowy

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.170 
side it'll go up to a point of a snowy
mountain<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.549> reason<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:47.879> telling<00:00:48.000> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
mountain and the reason I'm telling you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.609 
mountain and the reason I'm telling you
this<00:00:48.330> is<00:00:48.750> because<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.260> want<00:00:49.409> to<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.589> just

this is because I want to be just
talking<00:00:50.309> about<00:00:50.339> the<00:00:50.580> future<00:00:50.790> of<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> map

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
talking about the future of the map

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.840 
talking about the future of the map
pretty<00:00:51.659> much<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.199> while<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.309> doing<00:00:53.369> that<00:00:53.580> I'm

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
pretty much and while I'm doing that I'm

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.530 
pretty much and while I'm doing that I'm
going<00:00:54.119> to<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.330> doing<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:56.540> terraforming

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
going to be doing a bit of terraforming

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.660 
going to be doing a bit of terraforming
here<00:00:58.080> and<00:00:58.650> so<00:00:59.400> I<00:00:59.699> might<00:01:00.269> get<00:01:00.659> a<00:01:00.689> little<00:01:01.019> out<00:01:01.290> of

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
here and so I might get a little out of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.979 
here and so I might get a little out of
focus<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:03.119> and<00:01:03.239> there<00:01:03.360> just<00:01:03.689> because<00:01:03.780> I'll

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
focus here and there just because I'll

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.329 
focus here and there just because I'll
be<00:01:04.049> also<00:01:04.350> working<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
be also working on this in the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.780 
be also working on this in the
background<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.890> while<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.070> doing<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
background but while I'm doing this I

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060 
background but while I'm doing this I
just<00:01:09.299> thought<00:01:09.390> I'd<00:01:09.570> talk<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> little<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.920> about

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
just thought I'd talk a little bit about

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.910 
just thought I'd talk a little bit about
this<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.049> say<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.289> guys<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.649> been

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
very very supportive of this series

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.179 
very very supportive of this series
extremely<00:01:18.240> farther<00:01:19.229> than<00:01:19.469> I<00:01:19.619> could<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.100> ever

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
extremely farther than I could have ever

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.240 
extremely farther than I could have ever
imagined<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.439> started<00:01:22.740> actually<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
imagined and this started actually is a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.190 
imagined and this started actually is a
really<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:23.789> small<00:01:23.939> series<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.020> been

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
really really small series and it's been

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.950 
really really small series and it's been
going<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.280> think<00:01:26.969> a<00:01:27.299> little<00:01:27.539> over<00:01:27.929> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
going on for I think a little over a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.349 
going on for I think a little over a
year<00:01:28.020> probably<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.740> year<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.340> three<00:01:30.179> or<00:01:30.329> four

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
year probably a year in three or four

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.410 
year probably a year in three or four
months<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:31.229> something<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:33.030> it's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
months or something like that so it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
months or something like that so it's
been<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.719> on<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.079> quite<00:01:34.109> a<00:01:34.259> while<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.679> I've

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
been going on for quite a while and I've

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.459 
been going on for quite a while and I've
still<00:01:35.939> kept<00:01:36.240> true<00:01:36.539> to<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.990> working<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
still kept true to just working on the

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.099 
still kept true to just working on the
map<00:01:37.710> without<00:01:37.920> having<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:39.030> people<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.689> help

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
map without having other people to help

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.580 
map without having other people to help
me<00:01:40.289> majorly<00:01:41.659> but<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:42.960> thing<00:01:43.170> I've<00:01:43.350> really

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
me majorly but one thing I've really

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.480 
me majorly but one thing I've really
noticed<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:45.030> map<00:01:45.240> has<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> lot<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> bugs

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
noticed is this map has a lot of bugs

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.209 
noticed is this map has a lot of bugs
mainly<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.909> redstone<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.219> very

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
mainly because it's redstone is a very

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.660 
mainly because it's redstone is a very
condensed<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.840> made<00:01:52.649> purposely<00:01:53.399> just

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
condensed and it's made purposely just

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.719 
condensed and it's made purposely just
for<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.319> to<00:01:55.380> keep<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.310> laggy

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
for you know to keep it not very laggy

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
for you know to keep it not very laggy
because<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.389> a<00:01:57.509> huge<00:01:57.780> map<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.350> tons<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
because it's a huge map with tons of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.179 
because it's a huge map with tons of
redstone<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.899> I'm<00:02:01.229> glad<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> guys<00:02:01.889> have

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
redstone so I'm glad that you guys have

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.849 
redstone so I'm glad that you guys have
been<00:02:02.219> sort<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.939> supportive<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.139> idea<00:02:04.530> and

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
probably going to have some Spurs things

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.020 
probably going to have some Spurs things
here<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.500> there<00:04:08.590> what<00:04:09.489> I'm<00:04:09.579> doing<00:04:09.820> right<00:04:09.970> now

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
here and there what I'm doing right now

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.430 
here and there what I'm doing right now
actually<00:04:10.329> is<00:04:10.630> I'm<00:04:10.750> trying<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.110> figure<00:04:11.230> out<00:04:11.350> the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
actually is I'm trying to figure out the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.090 
actually is I'm trying to figure out the
layout<00:04:11.950> of<00:04:12.220> these<00:04:12.850> tunnels<00:04:13.780> here<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.769> get<00:04:14.950> up

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
layout of these tunnels here to get up

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.979 
layout of these tunnels here to get up
you'll<00:04:15.340> have<00:04:15.519> to<00:04:15.790> instead<00:04:16.269> of<00:04:16.329> just<00:04:16.450> climbing

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
you'll have to instead of just climbing

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.300 
you'll have to instead of just climbing
it<00:04:17.049> you'll<00:04:17.350> have<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.530> go<00:04:17.769> through<00:04:17.799> these<00:04:18.250> and

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
it you'll have to go through these and

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.969 
it you'll have to go through these and
there'll<00:04:19.030> be<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.180> bit<00:04:19.390> maze-like<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:20.560> you'll

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
there'll be a bit maze-like and you'll

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.680 
there'll be a bit maze-like and you'll
have<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.190> collect<00:04:21.430> items<00:04:21.640> to<00:04:22.060> be<00:04:22.150> able<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.479> go

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
have to collect items to be able to go

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.890 
have to collect items to be able to go
up<00:04:23.020> on<00:04:23.290> to<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:24.760> next<00:04:24.970> one<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.210> whatnot<00:04:25.660> kind

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
up on to the next one and whatnot kind

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.530 
up on to the next one and whatnot kind
of<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.200> in<00:04:26.410> certain<00:04:27.280> zelda<00:04:27.700> games<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.300> stuff

obviously I've been spending all the
time<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:39.860> fixing<00:04:40.370> bugs<00:04:40.750> but<00:04:41.750> that<00:04:42.050> doesn't

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
time is fixing bugs but that doesn't

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.310 
time is fixing bugs but that doesn't
mean<00:04:42.470> there's<00:04:42.620> not<00:04:42.850> tons<00:04:43.850> more<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.690> that's
