you<00:03:45.360> will<00:03:45.510> see<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.230> K<00:03:46.680> 98<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:48.590> weaker

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
you will see that the K 98 is weaker

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.450 
you will see that the K 98 is weaker
across<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.420> entire<00:03:51.840> range<00:03:53.990> certainly<00:03:54.990> up<00:03:55.170> to

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
across the entire range certainly up to

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.150 
across the entire range certainly up to
3/4<00:03:56.460> throttle<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.210> then<00:03:57.810> possibly<00:03:58.290> equal<00:03:58.860> to

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
3/4 throttle and then possibly equal to

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.300 
3/4 throttle and then possibly equal to
the<00:03:59.940> K<00:04:00.390> 28<00:04:01.110> profile<00:04:02.010> at<00:04:02.640> full<00:04:02.970> throttle<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.950> by

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
the K 28 profile at full throttle so by

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.610 
the K 28 profile at full throttle so by
using<00:04:05.960> this<00:04:07.640> comparison<00:04:08.640> feature<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:10.350> can

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
using this comparison feature you can

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.610 
using this comparison feature you can
quickly<00:04:11.220> select<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:12.330> needle<00:04:13.230> profile<00:04:14.570> suitable

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
quickly select a needle profile suitable

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.760 
quickly select a needle profile suitable
for<00:04:16.620> your<00:04:16.860> particular<00:04:17.280> carburetor<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.390> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
engine combination as you can see the K

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.230 
engine combination as you can see the K
48<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:24.690> weaker<00:04:25.380> than<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.210> K<00:04:27.210> 28<00:04:27.870> as<00:04:28.220> idle<00:04:29.240> but

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
48 is weaker than the K 28 as idle but

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.560 
48 is weaker than the K 28 as idle but
at<00:04:30.510> around<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.590> quarter<00:04:31.830> throttle<00:04:32.520> opening<00:04:32.940> it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
at around a quarter throttle opening it

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.220 
at around a quarter throttle opening it
becomes<00:04:34.050> richer<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.120> progressively<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.480> all

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
becomes richer and progressively so all
