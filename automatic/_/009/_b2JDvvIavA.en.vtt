 Gamer Cast BR 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 From the dawn of creation, angels battle in the eternal war against the forces of darkness and corruption. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Led by the Angiris council, their unity made them an indomitable force in the defense of light and goodness. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 Auriel, Archangel of Hope. 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.000
 Malthael, Archangel of Wisdom. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Iterael, Archangel of Destiny. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.000
 Tyrael, Archangel of Justice. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.500
 And Imperius, Archangel of Bravery. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Wait for Imperius. We need to regroup our forces. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.500
 Wait? Victory is within our reach. We will move on, brother. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Devil 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.500
 Ready to face me alone, Imperius? 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 His anger makes him even more powerful. But you hide it from your brothers, do not you? 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Maybe he's afraid they'll see his true face. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 I'm not afraid of anything. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 This was his trap, Diablo. Ridiculous. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 But you're all here. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Finally we capture one of the Supreme evils. 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.000
 Imprisoning him will certainly change the tide of war in our favor. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Complete your revenge Imperius. 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.000
 Seal your victory. 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 This is not justice Brother. 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.000
 And that decision is not only yours. 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.000
 If you kill him, he'll just come back, but if he gets arrested ... 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.000
 Our enemies only deserve an eye for an eye. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Sacrilege. 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.500
 Here's your unit ... 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 The trap finally activated. 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Angels. Devils. I fear the conflict will soon reach the world of men. 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:55.000
 And then, what hope will there be when even the fury of the angels can not be quenched? 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.000
