mini<00:00:09.450> computer<00:00:09.960> case<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.679> case<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.070> made<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
mini computer case this case is made of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.640 
mini computer case this case is made of
steel<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:11.880> some<00:00:12.059> plastic<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.809> it's<00:00:13.469> got<00:00:13.620> a

nice matte finish all around the body so

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.109 
nice matte finish all around the body so
that<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.949> don't<00:00:17.100> get<00:00:17.250> fingerprints<00:00:17.910> all<00:00:18.090> over

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
that you don't get fingerprints all over

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450 
that you don't get fingerprints all over
it<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:19.560> actually<00:00:19.890> made<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.100> some<00:00:20.220> pretty

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
it and it's actually made of some pretty

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.640 
it and it's actually made of some pretty
sturdy<00:00:20.910> material<00:00:21.570> because<00:00:22.140> when<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.529> was

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
sturdy material because when I was

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.500 
sturdy material because when I was
lugging<00:00:22.949> around<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.730> actually<00:00:24.060> quite

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
lugging around it was actually quite

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.070 
lugging around it was actually quite
heavy<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.560> compact<00:00:26.099> size<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:27.080> here

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
heavy for it's a compact size and here

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.870 
heavy for it's a compact size and here
we<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.410> some<00:00:28.590> ventilation<00:00:29.220> holes<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.730> where

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
we have some ventilation holes for where

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.569 
we have some ventilation holes for where
your<00:00:30.000> front<00:00:30.300> fans<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:32.130> also<00:00:32.279> have

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
your front fans are and we also have

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.280 
your front fans are and we also have
some<00:00:32.850> ventilation<00:00:33.450> holes<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.960> side<00:00:34.020> as

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
some ventilation holes on this side as

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.940 
some ventilation holes on this side as
well<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:34.980> some<00:00:35.040> airflow<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.640> here

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
well so you do get some airflow up here

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.979 
well so you do get some airflow up here
now<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.280> measures<00:00:38.850> eight<00:00:39.239> point<00:00:39.570> two<00:00:39.660> seven

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
now it measures eight point two seven
