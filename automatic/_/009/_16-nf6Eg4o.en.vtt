00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 how about friends of youtube today I'm going to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.130
 go play green eyes the count play 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.109
 for me this is one of the best songs 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.269
 of coldplay and here I will show them 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.580
 identical to the original is a very song 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.500
 simple suitable for beginners and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.330
 you know we have video demonstration of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.039
 this side and letter of chords in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.650
 christian dotcom down here in 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.619
 information I leave the link so 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.960
 well let's start perfect what 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 first thing we 're going to do we 're going to use 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.859
 the standard tuning since we have 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.320
 our guitar perfectly tuned 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.840
 let's put the fret boss in the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.000
 second fret you know if they do not have 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 capo a pencil here and a league back 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.500
 strong strong after this we're going to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.880
 play on the second string third fret 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.250
 Y 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.670
 and let's match the sound of the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670
 first 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.710
 and this is done by loosening ok 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470
 Y 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.950
 ah 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.370
 there is now yes chicken I know how 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.370
 I make 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.680
 perfect let's start with the first 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.930
 verse we are going to use chicken se un 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.180
 side here the secret of the song is 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.510
 that always the first the first the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.520
 we leave the air we are never going to touch 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.520
 we use them after a sun 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.450
 but finger number 4 we do not touch it ok 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.590
 remember the first always on air 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.030
 after a reconversion f sharp 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:16.849
 nothing else we remove the finger coarseness 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.849
 remember the first always on air 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.510
 notice how the strumming is 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.569
 i 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.620
 practically nothing else is a tuna and 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.560
 after chucu chucu chucu chucu chucu 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.180
 chucu chucu chucu the first down breast 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.940
 I am remembered when we changed 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.910
 then you are born down up up down 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.340
 the little orange arrows indicate that 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.360
 we have to emphasize the strumming there 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.489
 little bit more ok 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.489
 check I'm going to do it very slowly 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.410
 as sidrÃ³n counts in the lesser lasts more 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.290
 the time of the succu sucu sucu sucu sucu and 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.240
 when the brown arrows appear 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.240
 we take off our finger number 3 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.640
 so now we are going to do it very 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.640
 Slow down 3 2 1 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.280
 perfect mastering the fast we have 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.710
 the whole song now if I put the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.710
 stanza 321 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.559
 we come immediately to the part of 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:45.339
 choir this one practically gives more is 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:48.589
 extra chords of an easy simple 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:51.349
 We will also use a gift out there 

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:55.789
 or vein after the number one finger 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:58.639
 we climb two frets five and 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.649
 also out there after the dow we're going to 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.900
 remove finger number one and the number 

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:04.389
 two 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.490
 and we are going to leave them to the air right now 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:12.750
 girls the changes I'm going to make of 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.750
 all shapes a little bit slower 3 2 1 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.230
 how they realized and small auctions 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.720
 nothing else this I told you and then what 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.030
 it's practically nothing 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.980
 more is to study it well anyway 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.930
 I leave the lyrics perfectly in my 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.520
 page so that they can teach it better and 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.470
 down to the demo video if still 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.480
 have any doubt you already know that if 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.550
 have doubts comment do not forget to give 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.470
