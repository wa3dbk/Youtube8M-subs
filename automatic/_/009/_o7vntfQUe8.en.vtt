new tool wall or I know I don't know
what<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.450> call<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:06.779> but<00:00:06.960> it's<00:00:07.710> back<00:00:07.919> there

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130

to<00:00:13.200> get<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.440> an<00:00:13.500> idea<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.040> inspiration

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
to get you an idea on the inspiration

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.230 
to get you an idea on the inspiration
the<00:00:15.470> countertop<00:00:16.470> was<00:00:16.740> inspired<00:00:17.190> by<00:00:18.180> this

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the countertop was inspired by this

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.410 
the countertop was inspired by this
bowling<00:00:18.660> lane<00:00:19.760> counter<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:21.029> along<00:00:21.210> this

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
bowling lane counter I got along this

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.070 
bowling lane counter I got along this
wall<00:00:21.949> and<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.490> course<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.000> workbench<00:00:24.390> it

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
wall and of course the workbench it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
wall and of course the workbench it
still<00:00:25.350> hasn't<00:00:25.619> done<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.849> don't<00:00:27.060> know

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
still hasn't done but it's I don't know

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.929 
still hasn't done but it's I don't know
it's<00:00:27.330> probably<00:00:27.510> done<00:00:28.019> enough<00:00:28.939> should

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
it's probably done enough should

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.420 
it's probably done enough should
probably<00:00:30.289> wrap<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.399> of

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
probably wrap that one up here one of

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.119 
probably wrap that one up here one of
these<00:00:32.579> days<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:36.170> good<00:00:37.170> old<00:00:37.320> hard<00:00:37.649> maple<00:00:38.540> so

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
these days but good old hard maple so

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.750 
these days but good old hard maple so
this<00:00:41.989> new<00:00:42.989> systems<00:00:43.469> built<00:00:43.860> along<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this new systems built along with the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.119 
this new systems built along with the
same<00:00:44.969> kind<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> design<00:00:47.210> with<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.829> 1/4<00:00:49.829> oak<00:00:50.270> bases

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
same kind of design with a 1/4 oak bases

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.040 
same kind of design with a 1/4 oak bases
pocket<00:00:53.129> screws<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.120> martes<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.780> tenon

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
pocket screws I know martes and tenon

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.450 
pocket screws I know martes and tenon
would<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.260> been<00:00:55.379> nice<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.920> kind<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.250> built

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
would have been nice but I kind of built

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.650 
would have been nice but I kind of built
it<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> fly<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:59.420> couldn't<00:01:00.420> plant

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it on the fly so I just couldn't plant

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.549 
it on the fly so I just couldn't plant
enough<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.320> figure<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> this

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
enough to figure all that out so this

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.719 
enough to figure all that out so this
end<00:01:04.860> has<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:05.220> lumber<00:01:05.790> storage<00:01:06.060> underneath

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
end has got lumber storage underneath

here but it's not perfect and but I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.990 
here but it's not perfect and but I
think<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.040> time<00:01:56.250> it'll<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.549> better

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
think in time it'll be better

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.660 
think in time it'll be better
I<00:01:57.210> mean<00:01:57.740> redid<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> dust<00:01:59.310> collection

today I kind of rerouted stuff up here
for<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> new<00:02:04.170> machines<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:05.729> radial<00:02:06.420> arm<00:02:06.600> saw

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
for the new machines the radial arm saw

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.059 
for the new machines the radial arm saw
dust<00:02:07.170> collection<00:02:07.500> isn't<00:02:07.940> done<00:02:08.940> yet<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:10.069> got

dust collection isn't done yet and I got

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.550 
dust collection isn't done yet and I got
some<00:02:11.250> ideas<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.599> not<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> priority<00:02:13.110> right

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
some ideas but it's not a priority right

some ideas but it's not a priority right
now<00:02:13.620> haven't<00:02:14.340> even<00:02:14.480> fired<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.810> saw<00:02:16.020> yet

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
now haven't even fired up the saw yet

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.520 
now haven't even fired up the saw yet
since<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.739> been<00:02:16.890> here<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:18.319> but<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.349> have<00:02:19.410> a

since it's been here so but I have a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.059 
since it's been here so but I have a
space<00:02:19.770> right<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:22.200> between<00:02:22.680> these<00:02:22.860> two

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
space right here in between these two

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.089 
space right here in between these two
machines<00:02:23.520> with<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> little<00:02:24.330> slide<00:02:24.569> out

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
machines with a little slide out

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.000 
machines with a little slide out
I'm<00:02:26.099> gonna<00:02:26.220> build<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.700> scrap<00:02:27.300> bin<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:28.590> fits<00:02:28.860> in

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
I'm gonna build a scrap bin that fits in

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.100 
I'm gonna build a scrap bin that fits in
that<00:02:29.040> space<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:29.879> there's<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.870> hole<00:02:31.080> right

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
that space and then there's a hole right

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.250 
that space and then there's a hole right
there<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:32.069> just<00:02:32.540> throw<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.690> scraps<00:02:33.989> in

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
there you can just throw the scraps in

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.210 
there you can just throw the scraps in
there<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.739> think<00:02:35.550> that'll<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.000> alright

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
there I think that'll be alright

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.530 
there I think that'll be alright
there's<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.280> couple<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.670> tools<00:02:38.849> slide<00:02:39.269> outs

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
there's a couple of tools slide outs

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.170 
there's a couple of tools slide outs
built<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.110> here<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:42.769> I<00:02:43.769> forgot<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.760> mention<00:02:44.879> we

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
built in here and I forgot to mention we

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.430 
built in here and I forgot to mention we
put<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:46.310> Craig<00:02:47.310> fence<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.910> here

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
put the Craig fence on here

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.460 
put the Craig fence on here
it's<00:02:49.440> pretty<00:02:49.709> nice<00:02:49.830> system<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.870> haven't<00:02:51.870> done

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
it's pretty nice system I haven't done

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.930 
it's pretty nice system I haven't done
the<00:02:52.650> rules<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.129> anything<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.730> side

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the rules or anything on this side

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.809 
the rules or anything on this side
because<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.239> haven't<00:02:54.420> quite<00:02:54.690> decided<00:02:55.819> which

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
because I haven't quite decided which

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.830 
because I haven't quite decided which
saw<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.300> want<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:58.069> reference<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.450> we'll<00:03:00.599> see

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
saw I want a reference so we'll see

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.899 
saw I want a reference so we'll see
that's<00:03:01.080> again<00:03:01.409> not<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.739> huge<00:03:02.250> priority<00:03:02.550> right

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
that's again not a huge priority right

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:10.640 
that's again not a huge priority right
now<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:04.280> then<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.400> drum<00:03:05.640> sander<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:10.170> tricky

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
now but then the drum sander is tricky

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.580 
now but then the drum sander is tricky
because<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:11.459> requires<00:03:11.909> a<00:03:12.239> sliding<00:03:12.780> table<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
because it requires a sliding table and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.240 
because it requires a sliding table and
so<00:03:14.060> basically<00:03:15.060> engineered<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.819> system<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.450> it

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
so basically engineered the system so it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.470 
so basically engineered the system so it
clears<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.300> main<00:03:21.480> table<00:03:21.810> here<00:03:23.300> this<00:03:24.300> all

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
clears the the main table here this all

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.420 
clears the the main table here this all
grinders<00:03:24.959> just<00:03:25.200> hanging<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.590> Oh<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.099> wall

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
grinders just hanging on Oh on a wall

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.350 
grinders just hanging on Oh on a wall
cleat<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.659> be<00:03:27.780> moved<00:03:28.019> but<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:29.360> then

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
cleat so it can be moved but and then

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.600 
cleat so it can be moved but and then
the<00:03:30.900> bench<00:03:31.110> itself<00:03:31.500> does<00:03:31.950> actually<00:03:32.190> wrap

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
the bench itself does actually wrap

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.380 
the bench itself does actually wrap
around<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.209> corner<00:03:34.459> picks<00:03:35.459> up<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.849> spindle

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
around the corner picks up the spindle

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.190 
around the corner picks up the spindle
sander<00:03:36.599> with<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.170> back<00:03:37.349> underneath<00:03:38.360> and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.630 

we've<00:03:43.200> got<00:03:43.349> quite<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> bit<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:43.920> storage<00:03:44.250> space

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
we've got quite a bit of storage space

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.580 
we've got quite a bit of storage space
these<00:03:45.799> those<00:03:46.799> are<00:03:46.950> kind<00:03:47.159> of<00:03:47.220> shallow<00:03:48.590> shelves

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
these those are kind of shallow shelves

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.000 
these those are kind of shallow shelves
are<00:03:50.120> not<00:03:51.120> very<00:03:51.330> tall<00:03:51.569> but<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:52.590> can<00:03:52.680> put<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> lot

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
are not very tall but you can put a lot

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.720 
are not very tall but you can put a lot
of<00:03:53.129> stuff<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.549> there<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.950> it's<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:58.730> floating

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
of stuff in there so it's just floating

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.940 
of stuff in there so it's just floating
shelves<00:04:00.560> made<00:04:01.560> out<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.799> oak<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:04.349> any<00:04:04.709> rate

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
shelves made out of oak so any rate

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.970 
shelves made out of oak so any rate
that's<00:04:05.159> it<00:04:05.400> just<00:04:05.989> just<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.110> quick<00:04:07.319> short<00:04:07.709> video

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
that's it just just a quick short video

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.809 
that's it just just a quick short video
just<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.640> document<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.420> at<00:04:09.870> one<00:04:10.049> time<00:04:10.819> this

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
just a document that at one time this

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.059 
just a document that at one time this
wasn't<00:04:12.269> totally<00:04:12.450> loaded<00:04:12.930> up<00:04:13.049> with<00:04:13.200> junk<00:04:13.470> but

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
wasn't totally loaded up with junk but

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.150 
wasn't totally loaded up with junk but
I'm<00:04:14.189> sure<00:04:14.400> that'll<00:04:14.640> change<00:04:14.909> soon<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:16.160> thanks
