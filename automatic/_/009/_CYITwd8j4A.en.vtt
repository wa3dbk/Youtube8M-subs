00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
what I wanted to do is to do a smaller

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.109 
what I wanted to do is to do a smaller
demonstration<00:00:27.349> with<00:00:28.009> our<00:00:28.189> piezo<00:00:28.669> surgery

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
demonstration with our piezo surgery

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.229 
demonstration with our piezo surgery
unit<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:29.660> as<00:00:30.439> you<00:00:30.529> can<00:00:30.679> see<00:00:30.890> here<00:00:31.160> what<00:00:31.400> uh<00:00:31.429> the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
unit and as you can see here what uh the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.790 
unit and as you can see here what uh the
way<00:00:32.360> we<00:00:32.509> set<00:00:32.689> up<00:00:32.720> this<00:00:32.900> experiment<00:00:33.350> is<00:00:33.650> on<00:00:33.769> a

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
way we set up this experiment is on a

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.720 
way we set up this experiment is on a
raw<00:00:34.190> egg<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:34.870> on<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.050> raw<00:00:36.199> egg<00:00:36.440> we've<00:00:36.650> used<00:00:37.640> a

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
raw egg and on the raw egg we've used a

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.130 
raw egg and on the raw egg we've used a
pencil<00:00:38.089> and<00:00:38.210> we've<00:00:38.390> drunk<00:00:38.540> drawn<00:00:38.839> a<00:00:38.870> circle

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
pencil and we've drunk drawn a circle

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.670 
pencil and we've drunk drawn a circle
onto<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.850> egg<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.360> goal<00:00:41.540> of<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.839> with

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
onto the egg and the goal of this with

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.470 
onto the egg and the goal of this with
our<00:00:42.860> piezo<00:00:43.220> surgery<00:00:43.760> unions<00:00:44.059> were<00:00:44.180> not<00:00:44.360> only

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
our piezo surgery unions were not only

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.170 
our piezo surgery unions were not only
outlining<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.409> tracing<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.520> pencil<00:00:46.969> mark

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
outlining and tracing that pencil mark

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.700 
outlining and tracing that pencil mark
but<00:00:47.449> what<00:00:47.570> we're<00:00:47.690> going<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:47.930> be<00:00:48.170> doing<00:00:48.440> with

but what we're going to be doing with

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.500 
but what we're going to be doing with
this<00:00:48.949> is<00:00:49.219> we're<00:00:49.850> actually<00:00:49.940> going<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.390> remove

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
this is we're actually going to remove

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.400 
this is we're actually going to remove
the<00:00:51.110> shell<00:00:51.410> from<00:00:52.190> inside<00:00:52.579> that<00:00:52.820> circle<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.480> if

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.910 
all what it's doing is it's vibrating at
at<00:02:13.489> very<00:02:13.760> very<00:02:14.000> high<00:02:14.239> rates<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:14.810> by<00:02:15.140> doing<00:02:15.709> so

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
at very very high rates and by doing so

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.970 
at very very high rates and by doing so
it's<00:02:16.250> literally<00:02:17.319> removing<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.560> shell<00:02:18.830> of

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
it's literally removing the shell of

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.149 
it's literally removing the shell of
that<00:02:19.129> egg<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.780> cool<00:02:20.989> thing<00:02:21.200> about<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.799> once

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
that egg the cool thing about it is once

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.819 
that egg the cool thing about it is once
it<00:02:22.310> contacts<00:02:23.109> things<00:02:24.109> like<00:02:24.260> nerves<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.709> blood

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
it contacts things like nerves and blood

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.430 
it contacts things like nerves and blood
vessels<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.459> in<00:02:25.969> this<00:02:26.060> situation

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
vessels and in this situation

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.040 
vessels and in this situation
membrane<00:02:28.070> of<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.310> egg<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.880> actually<00:02:29.780> will<00:02:30.020> not

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
membrane of the egg it actually will not

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.220 
membrane of the egg it actually will not
tear<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.040> membrane<00:02:31.460> no<00:02:32.330> matter<00:02:32.600> how<00:02:32.810> thin<00:02:33.110> it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
tear the membrane no matter how thin it

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.220 
tear the membrane no matter how thin it
is<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:34.250> course<00:02:34.460> as<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.820> patient<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:35.990> see

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
is of course as a patient you can see

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.400 
is of course as a patient you can see
how<00:02:36.410> beneficial<00:02:36.680> this<00:02:37.250> would<00:02:37.490> be<00:02:37.960> not<00:02:38.960> only<00:02:39.260> is

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
how beneficial this would be not only is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.100 
how beneficial this would be not only is
it<00:02:39.440> does<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.340> increase<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.850> safety<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.840> your

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
it does it increase the safety of your

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.770 
it does it increase the safety of your
surgery<00:02:42.590> but<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.400> also<00:02:43.970> improves<00:02:44.630> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
surgery but it also improves the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.580 
surgery but it also improves the
precision<00:02:45.560> for<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.280> surgeon<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.350> as<00:02:48.440> we're

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
precision for the surgeon so as we're

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.990 
precision for the surgeon so as we're
going<00:02:48.620> through<00:02:48.980> here<00:02:49.280> which<00:02:49.400> are<00:02:49.550> what<00:02:49.850> you're

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
going through here which are what you're

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.990 
going through here which are what you're
seeing<00:02:50.300> is<00:02:50.510> we're<00:02:51.110> slowly<00:02:51.530> slowly<00:02:52.040> removing

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
seeing is we're slowly slowly removing

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.440 
seeing is we're slowly slowly removing
that<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:54.320> bit<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.770> eggshell<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:56.270> that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
that that bit of eggshell in that

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.150 
that that bit of eggshell in that
circular<00:02:56.960> fashion<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.500> we<00:02:57.590> outlined<00:02:57.770> with

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
circular fashion that we outlined with

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.390 
circular fashion that we outlined with
our<00:02:58.280> pencil<00:02:59.380> as<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.440> resume<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.280> out

you're<00:03:01.610> going<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.150> able<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.390> see<00:03:02.570> that

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
you're going to be able to see that

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.320 
you're going to be able to see that
membrane<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:04.280> right<00:03:04.790> there<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.210> the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
membrane that right there is the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.790 
membrane that right there is the
membrane<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.930> egg<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.170> you're<00:03:06.500> seeing

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
membrane of the egg that you're seeing

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.360 
membrane of the egg that you're seeing
and<00:03:07.250> what<00:03:07.990> it<00:03:08.990> allows<00:03:09.260> us<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.620> do<00:03:09.800> that

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
and what it allows us to do that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.580 
and what it allows us to do that
traditional<00:03:11.300> dental<00:03:11.660> drills<00:03:11.960> and<00:03:12.200> that

similar<00:04:22.300> surgery<00:04:23.300> performed<00:04:23.600> on<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.200> on<00:04:24.500> a

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
similar surgery performed on the on a

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.620 
similar surgery performed on the on a
different<00:04:24.860> egg<00:04:25.120> utilizing<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.210> traditional

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
different egg utilizing the traditional

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.590 
different egg utilizing the traditional
drill<00:04:27.520> predictably<00:04:28.520> results<00:04:29.000> in<00:04:29.060> just<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.360> big

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
drill predictably results in just a big

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.750 
drill predictably results in just a big
hole<00:04:29.830> being<00:04:30.830> drilled<00:04:31.100> through<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.400> egg<00:04:31.580> and

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
hole being drilled through the egg and

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.060 
hole being drilled through the egg and
losing<00:04:32.360> all<00:04:32.480> of<00:04:32.510> its<00:04:32.750> contents<00:04:33.290> whereas<00:04:33.800> the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
losing all of its contents whereas the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.890 
losing all of its contents whereas the
egg<00:04:34.550> on<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:34.850> left<00:04:35.060> was<00:04:35.210> performed<00:04:35.630> with<00:04:35.720> the

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
egg on the left was performed with the

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.210 
egg on the left was performed with the
piezo<00:04:36.860> surgery<00:04:37.280> unit<00:04:37.930> so<00:04:38.930> anyway<00:04:39.860> if<00:04:40.040> you're

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
piezo surgery unit so anyway if you're

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.170 
piezo surgery unit so anyway if you're
