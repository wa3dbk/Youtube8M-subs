00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.740
 as it is and I am evian and good at 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.780
 this video I'm going to teach is worth a little something 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.190
 of the lobbies that I do daily is worth 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.020
 simply to participate 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.430
 you have to be in the believe that I have in 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.290
 the description is worth that I just 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.330
 empty whole so you can already 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.249
 Rejoin because whole lift 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.439
 so you can go joining each and every 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.880
 one of you remember the requirements 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.880
 they are simply in the crew and 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.890
 subscribe and follow me on twitter and 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.109
 Well, guys, I'm going to tell you that a 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.419
 couple of things are worth many times when 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.100
 I start lobbying you see that it stops 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.289
 stop giving money suddenly they stop 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.180
 drop bags worth that happens many times 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.399
 simply because of the connection that I have 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 ok because I have a very bad connection and 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.879
 there are times when it stops but after a while 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.070
 If you wait a little bit, then come back to 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.730
 drop the bundles of 40 thousand worth as here 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.140
 You see 40 thousand for each bundle and something else 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.879
 what I wanted to tell you is that if you 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.890
 do not take money, it 's because you're going to 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.589
 have less connection than the others 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.300
 because if you have a worse connection, it's worth 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.129
 what you are going to do is that those who have 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.440
 better connection than you because what 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.659

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.030
