00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.369
 hello welcome to a new one 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.769
 video of me another edition of the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.420
 september is and today it works 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.519
 Again I believe one of her 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.039
 favorite topics and also some left 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.309
 namely, eat and it is such a topic 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.829
 art quicktipp / inspiration or too 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.440
 mini recipe and it is about vegetables 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.420
 noodles many of you know yes it is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 just a bit in a sore 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.590
 I almost want to say trendy and you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.719
 This can be done in different techniques 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.280
 and you all know that one 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.010
 on to this long as well a spiral 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.289
 must buy schneider and yes or something 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 a whole kitchen machine I link 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.829
 you also in the bottom of the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.320
 infobox I have the spiral snow at 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.239
 Amazon bought because I unfortunately use 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.250
 he is very difficult to clean 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.379
 It is not that expensive 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.610
 also about 15 euro as I said the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.350
 link is below 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.299
 I can already recommend them though 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.549
 this really a little clean 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.229
 problem and I do not know if you guys like that 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.180
 goes like me, at least it went to me so 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.369
 I discovered that at other times 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.500
 through various books has blog 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.540
 also post by youtube so me 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.450
 I would like to noodle these vegetables immediately 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.040
 to eat this cinema because what do you do 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.250
 then clear one order at Amazon 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.620
 ordered performance 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.260
 Amazon Prime but it still takes up 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.720
 one has this part on but I believe 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.240
 almost all of you have this one 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.670
 kitchen helpers a home respect that 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.350
 is my quicktipp and with that you can 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.300
 you actually noodles vegetable immediately 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.750
 Do that and that's the thing here 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.550
 this is normal peeler and me 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.410
 does not know if he knows that but sometimes 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.360
 it is with certain foods too 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.890
 so that one depending on how the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.460
 are cut or in particular 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.649
 mold differently rather or better like 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.140
 me it's like somehow I love when 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.750
 noodles he did so he did so parts 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.710
 These long, wide noodles are still 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.229
 are very thin 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.640
 and if I order with noodles 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.430
 I always either such day of 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.140
 order tennas rather than regazzoni 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.230
 or just these very small thin ones 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.450
 noodles or spirals or so and with 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.090
 My game tailor can be just 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.130
 first make spaghetti-like noodle and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.920
 here you can with this part 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.180
 make just such nice long noodles 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.860
 and I'll show you how it works 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.890
 I think most of them really do 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.630
 a thing I believe most 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.670
 from you then really so one already 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.290
 home and if it could be in any case 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.790
 silently staging this with the parents 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.410
 every case in your drawer 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.880
 and I'll even get that 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.590
 I've usually come here too 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.780
 is from ikea what do you think i get 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.730
 also with every rewe around the corner there 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.070
 where in my page to longer stands 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.410
 he again so basic household 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.030
 hang materials that means it can 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.799

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.410

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.190
