00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.970 

and<00:04:59.420> we'll<00:04:59.660> take<00:04:59.810> a<00:04:59.840> quick<00:05:00.170> look<00:05:00.350> at<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.740> drive

summary<00:05:01.490> options<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.750> clearly<00:05:03.230> there<00:05:03.410> I

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
summary options and clearly there I

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.720 
summary options and clearly there I
thought<00:05:03.710> he<00:05:03.770> could<00:05:04.010> have<00:05:04.100> taken<00:05:04.310> a<00:05:04.490> little<00:05:04.640> bit

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
thought he could have taken a little bit

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.450 
thought he could have taken a little bit
more<00:05:05.000> risk<00:05:05.450> no<00:05:06.170> chance<00:05:06.590> dropped<00:05:07.100> for<00:05:07.370> a<00:05:07.400> loss

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
more risk no chance dropped for a loss

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.420 
more risk no chance dropped for a loss
