00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that's too much of a stretch for you

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.709 
that's too much of a stretch for you
down<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.340> first<00:00:59.550> position<00:00:59.760> move<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.629> up

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
down here in first position move it up

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.150 
down here in first position move it up
to<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> fifth<00:01:01.170> fret<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.680> frets<00:01:01.859> are<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> little

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
to the fifth fret the frets are a little

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
to the fifth fret the frets are a little
bit<00:01:02.370> closer<00:01:02.579> together<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.660> think

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
bit closer together up here I think

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.240

it'll<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> little<00:01:04.350> bit<00:01:04.439> easier<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it'll be a little bit easier for you to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.730
