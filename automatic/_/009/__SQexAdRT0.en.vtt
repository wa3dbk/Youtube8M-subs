draw<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.730> eurobasket<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.600> year<00:00:21.930> you

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
draw in the eurobasket this year you

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.929 
draw in the eurobasket this year you
know<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> three<00:00:23.070> teams<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.609> were<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.820> our

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
know the three teams that were in our

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.390 
know the three teams that were in our
group<00:00:24.180> went<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.750> finish<00:00:24.930> first<00:00:25.439> second<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.800 
group went on to finish first second and
fourth<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.279> i<00:00:29.279> think<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.210> could<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.480> done<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
fourth so i think we could have done a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.269 
fourth so i think we could have done a
lot<00:00:31.019> better<00:00:31.080> if<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.890> were<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> different

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
lot better if we were in a different

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.100 
lot better if we were in a different
group<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.149> proven<00:00:33.480> ourselves<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
group and really proven ourselves and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
which I think we are if all our players

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.910 
which I think we are if all our players
play<00:02:02.420> but<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.509> we're<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.750> given<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> wild

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
play but if we're not given the wild

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.100 
play but if we're not given the wild
card<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.579> we'll<00:02:06.450> still<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> good

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
card I think we'll still be in a good

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.910 
card I think we'll still be in a good
position<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.619> really<00:02:08.009> go<00:02:08.520> ahead<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
position to really go ahead and and

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.740 
position to really go ahead and and
compete<00:02:10.920> well<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.910> 2012<00:02:12.870> even<00:02:13.500> though

the same time yet so we think if we can
have<00:02:51.160> our<00:02:51.190> five<00:02:51.520> best<00:02:51.820> players<00:02:52.110> playing

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
together for a certain amount of time or

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.320 
together for a certain amount of time or
as<00:02:55.660> good<00:02:55.870> as<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.830> know<00:02:56.950> almost<00:02:57.610> anybody<00:02:58.150> in

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
those other nations have is it very

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.600

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
different than two playing club

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.580

basketball<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.420> international<00:03:47.019> basketball<00:03:47.200> a

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
basketball to international basketball a

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.680 
basketball to international basketball a
lot<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.860> significant<00:03:48.370> differences<00:03:48.790> well

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
maybe for our guys playing in the NBA

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.479 
maybe for our guys playing in the NBA
it's<00:03:56.200> quite<00:03:56.530> different<00:03:56.769> because<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.250> rules

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
it's quite different because the rules

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.890 
it's quite different because the rules
are<00:03:57.640> different<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.510> style<00:03:58.780> of

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
basketball is is quite different so

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.880 
basketball is is quite different so
there<00:04:01.630> is<00:04:01.660> definitely<00:04:01.780> an<00:04:02.230> adjustment<00:04:02.320> period

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
there is definitely an adjustment period

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.789 
there is definitely an adjustment period
that<00:04:03.400> may<00:04:03.549> be<00:04:03.610> a<00:04:03.700> while<00:04:03.970> or<00:04:04.269> Ben<00:04:04.450> or<00:04:04.560> pops<00:04:05.560> would

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
USA team struggles sometimes because the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.949

for<00:04:21.190> us<00:04:21.220> being<00:04:21.700> able<00:04:21.789> to<00:04:22.060> match<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.570> style<00:04:22.810> of

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
for us being able to match the style of

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.659 
for us being able to match the style of
play<00:04:23.289> that<00:04:23.530> these<00:04:23.710> other<00:04:23.890> european<00:04:24.430> teams

play that these other european teams

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.940 
play that these other european teams
have<00:04:24.970> because<00:04:25.450> it's<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:25.960> lot<00:04:26.110> more

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950
