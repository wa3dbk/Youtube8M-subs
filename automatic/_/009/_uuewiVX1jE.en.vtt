00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
good I noticed that the crane is on some

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.220 
good I noticed that the crane is on some
type<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:13.700> rail<00:01:14.180> system<00:01:14.780> here<00:01:14.960> what<00:01:15.110> is<00:01:15.200> this

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
type of rail system here what is this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.710 
type of rail system here what is this
all<00:01:15.470> about<00:01:15.500> this<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.160> a<00:01:16.250> 1600<00:01:17.150> ton<00:01:17.360> piece<00:01:17.570> of

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
all about this is a 1600 ton piece of

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.230 
all about this is a 1600 ton piece of
machinery<00:01:18.050> and<00:01:18.440> if<00:01:19.190> you<00:01:19.280> had<00:01:19.370> rubber<00:01:19.580> tires<00:01:19.880> it

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
machinery and if you had rubber tires it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.960 
machinery and if you had rubber tires it
wouldn't<00:01:20.630> work<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.460> castle<00:01:22.460> ride<00:01:22.580> on<00:01:22.730> a<00:01:22.760> rail

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
wouldn't work so a castle ride on a rail

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.420 
wouldn't work so a castle ride on a rail
just<00:01:23.240> like<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.420> train<00:01:23.810> wait<00:01:24.260> did<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.440> say<00:01:24.470> 16

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
just like a train wait did you say 16

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
just like a train wait did you say 16
what<00:01:26.110> 1600<00:01:27.110> x<00:01:27.370> 1,600<00:01:28.370> tons<00:01:28.580> yeah<00:01:29.120> you<00:01:29.270> know<00:01:29.330> i'd
