 to say that I piss nothing they all said he 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.289
 there was a break in the information 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.849
 because there was a newspaper that 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.010
 had understood nothing and who are 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.460
 incompetent 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.680

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.969

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.480
 to the soup 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.280

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.450
 that contempt that we have joined 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.450

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.150
 contratio been able to do anything 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.950

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.930
 dalo 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.250
 if for a moment I wonder if you are 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.720
 Cameroonian if you saw the same 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.119
 match us because you 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.470
 are not Cameroonians and I will talk to 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.660
 your equinox boss 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.340
 because you do not even deserve to 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.860
 work for this wonderful 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.560
 I wanted with him and I will tell you 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.209
 I'm 30 years old I've won everything in my 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.750
 career I only have the world cup 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.910
 who marks 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.100
 I won everything in the career and 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.290
 so far I'm trying to represent 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.500
 the validly africa 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.450
 Cameroon where I play and people 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.300
 as you do not deserve to exist 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.950
 it's been two years since it's been two years 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.570
 that you are attacked at claude puel I 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.140
 do not know why but I have a 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.670
 little idea 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.650
 I have a little idea about 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.390
 relationships that you maintain next to the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.860
 club so this is so being 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.840
 now things are said 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.019
 I find the process loose sir du 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.950
 luc I find the process unfair and I 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.150
 find that you are outside of 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.950
 ethics no thanks 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.730
 can we talk about a failed match 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.730
 side of Montpellier 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.160
 they are beautiful I thought 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.020
 that Gregory you had announced the 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.930
 departure of Alain Perrin and that I find it 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.900
 unacceptable it's true that the team 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.300
 for some time this book a game 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.450
 who is full says respect for the club 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.550
 for Alain for myself 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.200
 the team came one day to ask me 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.780
 question of what would happen 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.660
 I confirmed that nothing would happen 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.000
 different from the other years and since 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.040
 but it started with autumn 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.870
 then had winter and then there is 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.020
 now spring but what is it 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.330
 what is this journalism that does in 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.080
 kind of advertised things that are not 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.270
 not confirmed 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.920
 So here I come to tell you that 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.530
 on one hand you did not have the right to 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.870
 to say without that two is a little abnormal 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.150
 it is true that one Piquionne and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.820
 debate against a lot of events 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.709
 contrary and I think channel in 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.250
 his approach to the matches must keep a 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.250
 little serenity
