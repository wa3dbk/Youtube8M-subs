velocity low pressure when we set these

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:40.660 
velocity low pressure when we set these
things<00:00:24.780> up<00:00:25.020> there<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.440> a<00:00:25.470> proper<00:00:25.890> way<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.280> it

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:58.539 

we<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.879> our<00:00:42.089> spray<00:00:42.569> nozzle<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:47.210> air<00:00:48.210> pressure

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:06.140 

you<00:01:02.899> have<00:01:03.899> some<00:01:04.140> grease<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.670> little<00:01:05.909> spring

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you have some grease and a little spring

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.539 
you have some grease and a little spring
cut<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.290> we'll<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.560> set<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.890> aside<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.340> never

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
cut so we'll just set it aside we never

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.300 
cut so we'll just set it aside we never
really<00:01:08.909> use<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:10.439> grease<00:01:10.649> can<00:01:10.920> also<00:01:11.070> be

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
really use this the grease can also be

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.289 
really use this the grease can also be
used<00:01:11.579> for<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:12.090> whims<00:01:13.850> circulation<00:01:14.850> pump<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
used for your whims circulation pump the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.730 
used for your whims circulation pump the
tubing<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.780> goes<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.110> there<00:01:16.289> you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.710> use

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
tubing that goes in there you can use

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.399 
tubing that goes in there you can use
this<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.310> petroleum<00:01:17.820> jelly<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.259> set

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
this as as petroleum jelly so we can set

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.950 
this as as petroleum jelly so we can set
that<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.710> side<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:20.039> well<00:01:20.329> so<00:01:21.329> when<00:01:21.840> I'm

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that to the side as well so when I'm

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
that to the side as well so when I'm
setting<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.530> gun<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:22.950> our<00:01:23.130> process<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
setting up this gun for our process the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.179 
setting up this gun for our process the
first<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.450> I'll<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.719> is<00:01:25.049> attach<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:25.950> tube

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
first thing I'll do is attach my tube

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.310 
first thing I'll do is attach my tube
you'll<00:01:26.880> want<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> curved-in<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.109> facing

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you'll want the curved-in to be facing

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.899 
you'll want the curved-in to be facing
towards<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.799> front<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> nozzle<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.759> that

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
towards the front of the nozzle so that

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.670 
towards the front of the nozzle so that
way<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:30.299> tip<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.539> bottle<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.350> gonna<00:01:31.500> be

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
way if I tip my bottle it's gonna be

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
way if I tip my bottle it's gonna be
drawing<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.340> top<00:01:32.579> corner<00:01:33.140> with<00:01:34.140> this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
drawing from that top corner with this

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.039 
drawing from that top corner with this
tip<00:01:34.679> I<00:01:34.950> will<00:01:35.310> unscrew<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.149> little<00:01:36.450> bit<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
tip I will unscrew this a little bit and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.859 
tip I will unscrew this a little bit and
make<00:01:37.409> sure<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.950> goes<00:01:38.420> horizontal<00:01:39.420> all

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
make sure that this goes horizontal all

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
make sure that this goes horizontal all
right<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.530> way<00:01:40.679> our<00:01:40.829> spray<00:01:41.159> pattern<00:01:41.549> comes

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
right that way our spray pattern comes

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.200 
right that way our spray pattern comes
out<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.600> angle<00:01:42.810> instead<00:01:43.469> of<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:44.159> angle

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
out in this angle instead of this angle

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:54.170 
out in this angle instead of this angle
so<00:01:45.570> I'll<00:01:45.660> tighten<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.110> back<00:01:46.320> down<00:01:51.110> okay<00:01:53.180> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
so I'll tighten that back down okay and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:05.870 
so I'll tighten that back down okay and
screw<00:01:54.510> on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.690> bottom<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.080> my<00:02:02.510> tight<00:02:04.730> take<00:02:05.730> my

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
screw on the bottom of my tight take my

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.910 
screw on the bottom of my tight take my
spray<00:02:06.120> tip<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.990> way<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.290> works<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.800> has<00:02:07.830> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
spray tip the way this works it has a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.800 
spray tip the way this works it has a
little<00:02:08.220> groove<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.670> fits<00:02:08.850> into<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
little groove that it fits into so I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.230 
little groove that it fits into so I
slide<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.380> sideways<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.700> clicks<00:02:12.030> into

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
slide it in sideways and it clicks into

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.040 
slide it in sideways and it clicks into
place<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.540> all<00:02:15.540> right

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
place just like so all right

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.560 
place just like so all right
when<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.560> set<00:02:16.920> how<00:02:17.190> much<00:02:17.370> velocity<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:18.090> want<00:02:18.450> this

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
when I set how much velocity I want this

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.530 
when I set how much velocity I want this
to<00:02:18.780> come<00:02:18.930> out<00:02:19.110> if<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.280> all<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.700> way<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:21.060> like

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
to come out if it's all the way in like

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.540 
to come out if it's all the way in like
it<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.780> right<00:02:21.930> now<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.010> maximum

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
it is right now this is to the maximum

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.210 
it is right now this is to the maximum
that<00:02:23.790> way<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.270> has<00:02:24.390> more<00:02:24.720> trigger<00:02:25.140> speed<00:02:25.500> or<00:02:26.190> a

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
that way it has more trigger speed or a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.490 
that way it has more trigger speed or a
distance<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.940> they<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.180> travel<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.750> then

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
distance that they can travel and then

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.580 
distance that they can travel and then
all<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.860> way<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.630> out<00:02:30.630> position<00:02:30.959> will<00:02:31.470> be

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
all the way to the out position will be

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.190 
all the way to the out position will be
to<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.830> minimum<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.090> wanted<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.600> about<00:02:33.810> dead

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
to the minimum so I wanted it about dead

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.840 
to the minimum so I wanted it about dead
sinner's<00:02:34.709> what<00:02:34.980> I'll<00:02:35.070> do<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.400> loosen<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.910> up

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
sinner's what I'll do is loosen this up

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.300 
sinner's what I'll do is loosen this up
so<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.030> way<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:40.140> bottom<00:02:40.530> edge<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.040> gray

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
so that way the bottom edge of this gray

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.840 
so that way the bottom edge of this gray
cap<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:42.780> basically<00:02:43.320> going<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.920> be<00:02:44.040> even<00:02:44.310> with

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
cap is basically going to be even with

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.430 
cap is basically going to be even with
the<00:02:45.000> yellow<00:02:45.240> post<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.780> has<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.140> spring

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
the yellow post that has the spring

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.780 
the yellow post that has the spring
around<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.890> underneath<00:02:48.410> all<00:02:49.410> right<00:02:49.640> when<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.670> do

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
around it underneath all right when I do

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.630 
around it underneath all right when I do
use<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.660> use<00:02:51.690> two<00:02:52.230> fingers<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.310> way

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
use this I use two fingers so that way

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.150 
use this I use two fingers so that way
it<00:02:53.820> pushes<00:02:54.090> all<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.630> way<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.080> back<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.980> I

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
it pushes all the way to the back if I

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.190 
it pushes all the way to the back if I
just<00:02:56.400> do<00:02:56.580> one<00:02:56.820> finger<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.570> can<00:02:57.720> click<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.080> in

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
just do one finger you can click it in

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410 
just do one finger you can click it in
here<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.769> motor<00:02:58.980> will<00:02:59.250> activate<00:02:59.730> but<00:02:59.970> it

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
here the motor will activate but it

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.240 
here the motor will activate but it
won't<00:03:00.600> actually<00:03:00.840> spray<00:03:01.380> anything<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.070> that's

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
won't actually spray anything so that's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.670 
won't actually spray anything so that's
why<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.400> use<00:03:02.640> two<00:03:02.880> fingers<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.900> push<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.440> all

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
why I use two fingers and push it all

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.150 
why I use two fingers and push it all
the<00:03:04.709> way<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.340> button<00:03:06.590> okay<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.980> that's

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
the way to the button okay so that's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.830 
the way to the button okay so that's
setting<00:03:08.489> up<00:03:08.610> your<00:03:08.820> sprayer<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.330> next<00:03:09.720> thing

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
setting up your sprayer the next thing

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.890 
setting up your sprayer the next thing
you<00:03:09.930> would<00:03:10.080> do<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.350> take<00:03:10.500> your<00:03:10.650> pretreatment

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
you would do is take your pretreatment

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.210 
you would do is take your pretreatment
this<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.080> basically<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.680> one<00:03:13.950> liter<00:03:14.070> bottle

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
this is basically a one liter bottle

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.280 
this is basically a one liter bottle
it'll<00:03:14.970> fill<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.390> reservoir<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.989> about

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
it'll fill up the reservoir to about

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.970 
it'll fill up the reservoir to about
right<00:03:16.560> there

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
right there

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.220 
right there
you<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.640> pour<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.209> one<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.050> things

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
you just pour that in one of the things

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.660 
you just pour that in one of the things
I<00:03:19.350> do<00:03:19.410> like<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.830> do<00:03:19.980> before<00:03:20.340> adding

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
I do like to do before adding

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.670 
I do like to do before adding
pretreatment<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.390> I'll<00:03:21.630> just<00:03:21.840> shake<00:03:22.500> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
pretreatment is I'll just shake the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.960 
pretreatment is I'll just shake the
bottle<00:03:22.830> really<00:03:23.160> well<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.610> get<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.850> all

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
bottle really well to get it all

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.330 
bottle really well to get it all
agitated<00:03:24.209> back<00:03:24.780> again<00:03:25.080> same<00:03:26.010> thing<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.280> the

mornings<00:03:26.700> when<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.390> come<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.900> start

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
mornings when I come in to start

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.509 
mornings when I come in to start
pre-treating<00:03:28.620> shirts<00:03:28.920> or<00:03:29.070> run<00:03:29.220> production

I'll<00:03:30.299> take<00:03:30.510> my<00:03:30.630> sprayer<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.260> shake<00:03:31.440> it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
I'll take my sprayer and just shake it

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.280 
I'll take my sprayer and just shake it
back<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.769> forth<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.160> kind<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.459> mix<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.790> back<00:03:33.000> up

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
back and forth to kind of mix it back up

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.410 
back and forth to kind of mix it back up
all<00:03:34.290> right<00:03:35.269> what<00:03:36.269> pretreatment<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:38.420> basic

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
all right what pretreatment is is basic

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.270 
all right what pretreatment is is basic
like<00:03:39.630> salt<00:03:40.019> water<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.500> polymer<00:03:41.040> type

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
like salt water and polymer type

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.640 
like salt water and polymer type
solution<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:42.600> will<00:03:42.750> want<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.110> keep<00:03:43.410> these

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
solution you will want to keep these

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.949 
solution you will want to keep these
bottles<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.549> different<00:03:45.000> location<00:03:45.330> than<00:03:45.720> you

bottles in a different location than you
keep<00:03:46.590> your<00:03:46.739> Inc<00:03:47.209> reason<00:03:48.209> being<00:03:48.390> if<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.720> forget

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
keep your Inc reason being if you forget

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.650 
keep your Inc reason being if you forget
and<00:03:49.410> choose<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.890> wrong<00:03:50.070> bottle<00:03:50.390> say<00:03:51.390> white

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
and choose the wrong bottle say white

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.990 
and choose the wrong bottle say white
versus<00:03:52.140> pretreatment<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:53.280> pour<00:03:53.579> this<00:03:53.790> into

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
versus pretreatment you pour this into

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.580 
versus pretreatment you pour this into
your<00:03:54.180> white<00:03:54.389> ink<00:03:54.540> reservoir<00:03:54.989> you're<00:03:55.380> going<00:03:55.530> to

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
your white ink reservoir you're going to

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.309 
your white ink reservoir you're going to
have<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.739> very<00:03:56.040> expensive<00:03:56.400> repair

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
have a very expensive repair

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.530 
have a very expensive repair
let<00:03:57.860> me<00:03:57.950> show<00:03:58.129> you<00:03:58.219> what<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.459> actually<00:03:58.610> does<00:03:59.090> to

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
let me show you what it actually does to

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.449 
let me show you what it actually does to
whiting<00:04:02.680> I'll<00:04:03.680> pour<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:03.950> little<00:04:04.159> bit<00:04:04.280> here<00:04:04.430> on

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
whiting I'll pour a little bit here on

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.160 
whiting I'll pour a little bit here on
the<00:04:04.579> table<00:04:07.030> I'll<00:04:08.030> put<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> little<00:04:08.450> whiting<00:04:08.840> next

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
the table I'll put a little whiting next

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:18.780 
the table I'll put a little whiting next
to<00:04:09.290> it

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.550 

and<00:04:19.790> then<00:04:20.660> I'm<00:04:20.720> gonna<00:04:20.810> mix<00:04:21.079> these<00:04:21.320> two

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
and then I'm gonna mix these two

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.840 
and then I'm gonna mix these two
together<00:04:23.200> so<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.230> chemical<00:04:24.860> reaction<00:04:25.250> forms

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
together so a chemical reaction forms

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.510 
together so a chemical reaction forms
right<00:04:26.300> when<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.660> starts<00:04:26.960> touching<00:04:27.230> it<00:04:27.530> and

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
right when it starts touching it and

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.090 
right when it starts touching it and
what<00:04:28.790> will<00:04:28.880> happen<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.420> it<00:04:30.380> turns<00:04:30.740> into<00:04:30.950> a

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
what will happen is it turns into a

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.900 
what will happen is it turns into a
solid<00:04:32.710> when<00:04:33.710> it<00:04:33.830> comes<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.190> pretreatment<00:04:34.790> and

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
solid when it comes to pretreatment and

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.450 
solid when it comes to pretreatment and
white<00:04:35.060> ink<00:04:35.240> you<00:04:35.600> need<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.230> make<00:04:36.440> sure<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:37.220> you

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
white ink you need to make sure that you

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.900 
white ink you need to make sure that you
pretreat<00:04:38.060> at<00:04:38.210> least<00:04:38.840> 19<00:04:39.800> feet<00:04:40.100> away<00:04:40.340> from<00:04:40.550> your

the<00:04:41.720> reason<00:04:42.050> being<00:04:42.230> the<00:04:42.560> mist<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:43.280> comes<00:04:43.490> off

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
the reason being the mist that comes off

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.240 
the reason being the mist that comes off
the<00:04:43.880> sprayer<00:04:44.210> can<00:04:44.960> get<00:04:45.320> near<00:04:45.560> your<00:04:45.770> nozzle

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
the sprayer can get near your nozzle

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.180 
the sprayer can get near your nozzle
plate<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:47.300> can<00:04:47.480> cause<00:04:47.840> this<00:04:48.260> reaction<00:04:48.980> and

plate and it can cause this reaction and

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.650 
plate and it can cause this reaction and
it<00:04:49.460> would<00:04:49.640> basically<00:04:49.850> you<00:04:50.240> would<00:04:50.390> have<00:04:50.540> to

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
it would basically you would have to

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.790 
it would basically you would have to
replace<00:04:51.110> your<00:04:51.320> printhead<00:04:53.290> so<00:04:54.290> now<00:04:54.470> that<00:04:54.590> we

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
replace your printhead so now that we

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.470 
replace your printhead so now that we
have<00:04:54.830> our<00:04:55.040> pretreatment<00:04:55.760> sprayer<00:04:55.970> set<00:04:56.330> up

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
have our pretreatment sprayer set up

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.960 
have our pretreatment sprayer set up
we'll<00:04:56.900> add<00:04:56.930> our<00:04:57.140> pretreatment<00:04:57.800> in<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.220> we'll

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
we'll add our pretreatment in and we'll

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.180 
we'll add our pretreatment in and we'll
take<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.240> in<00:04:59.540> -<00:04:59.750> and<00:05:00.170> a<00:05:00.350> lot<00:05:00.530> of<00:05:00.560> people<00:05:00.950> we

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
take it in - and a lot of people we

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.700 
take it in - and a lot of people we
suggest<00:05:01.640> that<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:02.060> take<00:05:02.900> your<00:05:03.080> pretreatment

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
suggest that you take your pretreatment

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.180 
suggest that you take your pretreatment
and<00:05:03.800> do<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.190> in<00:05:04.370> a<00:05:04.490> separate<00:05:04.970> room<00:05:05.210> if<00:05:05.450> possible

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190

if you are gonna pretreat a whole bunch
of<00:05:08.810> shirts<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.260> you're<00:05:09.440> limited<00:05:10.040> on<00:05:10.190> space

to cover your machine while you're doing
the<00:05:14.540> pretreatment<00:05:14.960> process<00:05:15.169> but<00:05:15.980> if<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:16.280> do

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
the pretreatment process but if you do

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.370 
the pretreatment process but if you do
it<00:05:16.490> in<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.700> separate<00:05:17.030> room<00:05:17.210> you<00:05:17.780> can<00:05:17.990> just<00:05:18.169> do<00:05:18.260> it

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
it in a separate room you can just do it

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.760 
it in a separate room you can just do it
like<00:05:18.530> normal<00:05:19.210> you'll<00:05:20.210> also<00:05:20.390> want<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.780> create<00:05:20.930> a

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
like normal you'll also want to create a

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.370 
like normal you'll also want to create a
pretreatment<00:05:22.730> booth<00:05:23.270> of<00:05:23.510> some<00:05:23.720> sort<00:05:23.960> to<00:05:24.140> catch

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
pretreatment booth of some sort to catch

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.200 
pretreatment booth of some sort to catch
that<00:05:24.620> overspray<00:05:25.160> so<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.460> doesn't<00:05:25.760> make<00:05:25.820> a<00:05:25.880> huge

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
that overspray so it doesn't make a huge

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.540 
that overspray so it doesn't make a huge
mess
