00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hi to all but before starting 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.000
 this 3x3 I would like to do a very short 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.320
 simply announce from this 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.960
 episode onwards the three x 3 will have a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.990
 video together will have gameplay in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.529
 background while I talk a lot 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.529
 simply 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.750
 vvvvvv is a platform released for 3ds a 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.710
 May if I'm not mistaken in Europe and for 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.080
 computer a long time ago is a 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 retro style 8-bit platform air 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.980
 also the music that by the way is 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.170
 exceptional has some surprising that not 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.750
 so short a game there is such a number 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.019
 of music tracks that are all very beautiful 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.129
 if you like old fashioned music 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.020
 games and is based on two very concepts 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.479
 simple in the gameplay ie you have 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
 only two controls one move forward 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.649
 and behind the other and press a button 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.960
 to reverse the gravity on the character 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:20.580
 that you check that the captain of 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.020
 shipping is simply using these 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.649
 simple two commands you have to pass 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.960
 through different levels where you can 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.649
 die very easily and death in 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.970
 this game is not particularly 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.789
 frustrating because there are a lot of 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.830
 check point and your duty to do so 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.920
 say just passing between a check point 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.289
 and the other without dying but this 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.090
 practically makes sure that i 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.670
 Game programmers can make it 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.679
 how hard I want to commands are 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.450
 very sensitive and I think it's right 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.250
 for a game like that if you have to go 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.259
 with decision from one point to another e 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.229
 you have to do it you can't you can't 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.180
 stop at the last moment because you are 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.490
 almost sure that 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.350
 die anyway we say it is difficult but 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.320
 the difficulty is mitigated by this thing 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.060
 checkpoints the hardest things to 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.970
 if you want are the extras there are 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.180
 ex-drinks call them da 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.760
 collect and there are some that are 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.790
 ridiculous to take so you can 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.950
 waste time trying and maybe different 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.220
 hundreds of deaths that may not be different 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.880
 hundreds but still it is a 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.280
 very short game if you want if though 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.410
 go get yourself shanit ringer not 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.680
 I think you'll get over five hours of 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.970
 gameplay only in English but text 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.370
 it is not essential because it is important 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.630
 the gameplay in this game the story 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.720
 there are practically six people of a 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.520
 crew whose name begins begins 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.790
 all names begin with v for this 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.410
 to the living the title that then crashes 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.270
 there is a kind of distortion 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.530
 dimensional you have to recover i 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.989
 books of your crew that is 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.910
 find out where you are because this 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.549
 size is so strange but is one of 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.140
 those stories excuse that it is not 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.209
 fundamental and perhaps one of those things 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.570
 that holds this game is that it is 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.950
 quite expensive the 3ds shows 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.820
 even if you have the advantage of having the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.220
 map always under eye so I would say if 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.519
 you haven't picked it up on PC yet and you want it 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.810
 have the map always in view you want 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.590
 finance the creators more, take it 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.250
 for 3ds 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.670
 otherwise no these were three 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.290
 minutes 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.290
 bye bye and the next
