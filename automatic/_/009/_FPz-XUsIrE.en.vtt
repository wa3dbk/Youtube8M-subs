relative to his other blends but it's

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.369 
relative to his other blends but it's
pretty<00:00:48.460> strong<00:00:48.820> I'm<00:00:49.660> it's<00:00:49.840> well<00:00:49.989> up<00:00:50.140> there<00:00:50.320> I

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.240 

yeah<00:02:29.099> that's<00:02:29.280> better<00:02:30.830> well<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.890> thing<00:02:32.130> I've

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
yeah that's better well the thing I've

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.010 
yeah that's better well the thing I've
noticed<00:02:32.340> about<00:02:32.520> Westminster<00:02:33.209> that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
noticed about Westminster that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.360 
noticed about Westminster that
distinguishes<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.739> particularly<00:02:34.980> for<00:02:35.130> some

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
distinguishes it particularly for some

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.770 
distinguishes it particularly for some
some<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> other<00:02:35.910> blends<00:02:36.300> I've<00:02:36.450> had<00:02:36.630> is

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
some of the other blends I've had is

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.720 
some of the other blends I've had is
that<00:02:36.959> on<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.620> first<00:02:37.830> light<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.280> seems<00:02:38.459> what<00:02:38.700> I

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
that on the first light it seems what I

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.850 
that on the first light it seems what I
would<00:02:38.910> describe<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.390> bit<00:02:39.510> unruly<00:02:39.840> takes<00:02:40.739> a

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
would describe as a bit unruly takes a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.760 
would describe as a bit unruly takes a
while<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.550> flavors<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.030> meld<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.770> I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
while for the flavors to meld and I

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.890 
while for the flavors to meld and I
don't<00:02:44.280> know<00:02:44.520> what<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.300> bit<00:02:45.450> not

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
don't know what it is but it's a bit not

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.000 
don't know what it is but it's a bit not
rough<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> little<00:02:47.220> bit<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.760> little<00:02:48.209> bit<00:02:49.010> hard

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
rough but a little bit a little bit hard

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.350 
rough but a little bit a little bit hard
to<00:02:50.069> say<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.310> little<00:02:50.400> bit<00:02:50.520> edgy<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.970> begin<00:02:51.209> with

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
to say a little bit edgy to begin with

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.790 
to say a little bit edgy to begin with
and<00:02:51.569> then<00:02:51.660> very<00:02:51.870> quickly<00:02:52.050> after<00:02:52.470> about<00:02:52.560> five

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
and then very quickly after about five

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.250 
and then very quickly after about five
to<00:02:52.920> ten<00:02:53.069> minutes<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.430> really<00:02:53.459> settles<00:02:53.970> them

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.720 

it's<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.319> fairly<00:03:01.500> thick<00:03:01.800> cut<00:03:02.040> tobacco<00:03:02.220> as<00:03:02.640> you

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
it's a fairly thick cut tobacco as you

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.789 
it's a fairly thick cut tobacco as you
can<00:03:02.880> see<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.299> maybe<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.380> first<00:03:04.590> light

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
can see so maybe on the first light

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.680 
can see so maybe on the first light
you're<00:03:04.950> just<00:03:05.130> getting<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.459> few<00:03:05.670> random<00:03:05.850> leaves

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
you're just getting a few random leaves

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.660 
you're just getting a few random leaves
lit<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:07.500> early<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.220> maybe<00:03:08.400> not<00:03:08.580> have

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
lit and so early on this maybe not have

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:17.520 
lit and so early on this maybe not have
enough<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.030> burning<00:03:09.330> head<00:03:09.480> established

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.290 

tell<00:03:18.190> me<00:03:18.280> once<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.550> gets<00:03:18.700> going<00:03:18.880> it's<00:03:19.090> very

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
tell me once it gets going it's very

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.320 
tell me once it gets going it's very
good<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.980> latter<00:03:21.190> key<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.490> not<00:03:21.730> dominant<00:03:22.209> I

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
good the latter key is not dominant I

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.020 
good the latter key is not dominant I
mean<00:03:22.510> its<00:03:23.050> strong<00:03:23.380> but<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.709> doesn't<00:03:24.030> doesn't

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
mean its strong but it doesn't doesn't

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:38.059 
mean its strong but it doesn't doesn't
dominate<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.450> entire<00:03:25.690> flavor

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.520 

I've<00:03:38.519> let<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.760> get<00:03:38.970> fairly<00:03:39.299> dry<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.349> seems

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
I've let it get fairly dry and it seems

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:51.860 
I've let it get fairly dry and it seems
to<00:03:40.620> burn<00:03:40.769> really<00:03:41.040> well<00:03:41.159> that<00:03:41.340> way

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.570 

but<00:03:52.409> definitely<00:03:52.560> Orientals<00:03:53.190> there<00:03:53.400> but

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
but definitely Orientals there but

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.589 
but definitely Orientals there but
they're<00:03:53.700> not<00:03:53.730> coming<00:03:54.090> through<00:03:54.239> super

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
they're not coming through super

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.170 
they're not coming through super
strongly<00:03:58.670> maurienne<00:03:59.670> don't<00:03:59.819> have<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:00.000> very

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
strongly maurienne don't have a very

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.270 
strongly maurienne don't have a very
definite<00:04:00.510> effect<00:04:00.810> on<00:04:00.930> my<00:04:01.019> palate<00:04:01.409> and<00:04:01.620> they're

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
definite effect on my palate and they're

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.559 
definite effect on my palate and they're
not<00:04:02.340> coming<00:04:02.519> through<00:04:02.790> really<00:04:02.940> strongly<00:04:03.330> right

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
not coming through really strongly right

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.330 
not coming through really strongly right
now

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.040 

it's<00:04:09.760> a<00:04:09.790> very<00:04:09.970> well<00:04:10.120> integrated<00:04:10.330> blend<00:04:10.840> it's

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
it's a very well integrated blend it's

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.230 
it's a very well integrated blend it's
very<00:04:11.320> know<00:04:12.250> how<00:04:12.370> some<00:04:12.580> some<00:04:12.850> blends<00:04:13.180> you

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
very know how some some blends you

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.910 
very know how some some blends you
really<00:04:14.020> pick<00:04:14.200> out<00:04:14.290> all<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.560> individual

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
really pick out all the individual

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.800 
really pick out all the individual
flavors<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.820> this<00:04:15.940> one<00:04:16.150> somehow<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.600> seems

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
flavors and this one somehow it seems

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.000 
flavors and this one somehow it seems
after<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:18.010> gets<00:04:18.220> lit<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.670> established<00:04:23.010> the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
after it gets lit and established the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.580 
after it gets lit and established the
blend<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.930> almost<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.140> developed<00:04:26.470> its

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
blend is almost like it developed its

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.230 
blend is almost like it developed its
own<00:04:26.740> particular<00:04:27.040> flavor<00:04:27.520> no<00:04:27.820> particular
