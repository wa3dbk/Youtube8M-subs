00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:10.360
 [Music] 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.219
 now that we try in this video I'm going 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.139
 to teach how to make these waves that are 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.800
 very easy to do these are two months 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.560
 with the electric tubes of juan rollers 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.470
 it was these that are here is that this 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.130
 that's the field and this is the loarque 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.250
 It's big and it's very easy to do just 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.590
 the tubes are put and they are going to put 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.260
 brooches and coughs like this and you can 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.289
 leave the tubes formed the electric ones of 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.090
 20 to 30 minutes and meanwhile they can 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.280
 doing other things can put on the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.460
 makeup I really like to use these 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.620
 tubes and electric only one will be 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.239
 race when it's not going to leave because you 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.180
 you put them really fast in the morning 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.410
 you connect and heat up really fast 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.780
 that leave them in your hair while 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.300
 nights the rest while you change 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.770
 while doing your makeup and any 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.620
 thing you have to do 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.990
 and that's how it is ready the soups that are 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.170
 They are very pretty and these where they are like 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.190
 to give a lot of volume I have another video 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.650
 of how I made my waves with some 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.840
 electrical tubes that are others that are 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.729
 I'm going to put the link 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.430
 here of course to go see this video 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.930
 I hope you like it and if you would like 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.360
 see how I did it they still see this 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.950
 video the first thing they are going to do is 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.990
 they must apply a protector for the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.970
 hair this helps us protect the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.330
 hair of the heat that we are going to put 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.310
 the protector that I am using is 3m and 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.619
 you can use any protector 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.390
 that you have then they are going to use a 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.340
 brush to comb your hair and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.340
 distribute the product very well 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.110
 what they are going to do is they will grab little 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.760
 hair from the front of me 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.010
 I always like to start with the part of 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.650
 opposite there is no perfect way of how 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.390
 apply these electrical tubes then 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.010
 they will grab a loop and they will give 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.890
 Return date the hair until you arrive 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.090
 until the bottom part of larra 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.090
 very good tips 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.200
 and then what they're going to do is they're going to 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.650
 put a clamp like this to stop 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.650
 The hair 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.790
 those electric curlers take 85 seconds 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.340
 in warming up and one of the curlers 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.129
 electric has a wheel where they are 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.709
 in red color when the rollers are 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.719
 all already hot that hairline is going to 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.409
 put in white as in the picture 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.409
 who see here 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.990
 one thing that I really like to do 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.360
 is to wait for them to warm up very well 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.850
 the tubes what I do is close the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.160
 cover and I leave them there for 5 minutes 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.290
 those to your liking if you want 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.670
 do it but these electrical tubes yes 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.700
 they heat up very fast in 85 seconds 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.800
 those electric curlers of juanes are more 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.940
 fickle before they are not to leave 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.940
 very marked things 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.040
 these electric rolls normally 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.140
 less I leave from 20 to 30 minutes is very 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.360
 absolute that they want so much time 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.770
 leave to know that they are ready 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.320
 what they are going to do is be they are going to 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.600
 touch a little and if it does not feel so 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.240
 hot they can be removed but 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.490
 meanwhile wait for them to cool 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.380
 a little what they can do is make themselves 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.070
 makeup or doing other things that 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.070
 have to do 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.709
 [Music] 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.510
 I had forgotten to teach them how 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.459
 you can see the electric curlers in the part 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.680
 from behind and as you can see it is not 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.099
 perfect as less apply there is no 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.519
 paper 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.260
 dt to apply the one little thing that 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.019
 I wanted to mention is that how can 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.239
 you see me I missed one hair to be 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.099
 check the wave so that those who 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.739
 you can do you can catch them 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.360
 your pliers and use it to be used 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.360
 any hair that has been missing 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:10.610
 [Music] 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.220
 Finally, if you like, you can 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.340
 grab a brush like this to give yourself 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.400
 volume I always like to give myself 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.050
 little volume if I'm going to do it that way and 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.230
 to give that volume they just grab 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.670
 I cantito hair and they brush it like this 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.670
 pilgrimages down 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:38.340
 to 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:40.650
 [Music] 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.490
 and its fringe can only accommodate as 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.490
 you like 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.850
 if the leaves do not like to be me 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.160
 Chinese very up what can they 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.500
 to do is pass your fingers so that you 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.870
 go down a little bit another optional step is something 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.630
 that can be put is an oil that is 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.910
 as for the tips so that the hair 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:07.300
 he looks like so mistreated to give him 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:11.290
 a little bit of shine at the tips I'm 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.840
 I'm going to put only very little because that 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.669
 the waves also go down a little 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.590
 but I like it a lot because it smells in a 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.590
 circuit of a very nice brightness 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.750
 [Music] 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.100
 I hope you liked it in this 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.100
 video see you next time
