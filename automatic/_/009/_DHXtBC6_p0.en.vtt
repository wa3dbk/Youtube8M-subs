a<00:00:15.049> high-fat<00:00:16.049> diet<00:00:16.190> can<00:00:17.190> reset<00:00:17.869> metabolism<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
a high-fat diet can reset metabolism and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.759 
a high-fat diet can reset metabolism and
prevent<00:00:19.529> obesity<00:00:20.090> how<00:00:21.090> does<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.570> work

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
prevent obesity how does this work

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.070 
prevent obesity how does this work
is<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.340> amazing<00:00:23.880> how<00:00:24.060> something<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:25.019> that

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
is it amazing how something like that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.689 
is it amazing how something like that
comes<00:00:25.500> into<00:00:25.710> press<00:00:25.980> or<00:00:26.160> actually<00:00:26.490> some

comes into press or actually some
studies<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.119> were<00:00:27.330> done<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
studies that were done on this in the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.500 
studies that were done on this in the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
journal called cell metabolism that you

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 
journal called cell metabolism that you
and<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.720> reported<00:00:31.260> back<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.500> July<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.340> year

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and I reported back in July of this year

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.990 
and I reported back in July of this year
of<00:00:32.640> 2012<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:34.320> showed<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.070> fed<00:00:35.760> rats

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
of 2012 that showed that if you fed rats

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750 
of 2012 that showed that if you fed rats
a<00:00:36.559> certain<00:00:37.559> number<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> calories<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.489> allow

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
a certain number of calories but allow

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
a certain number of calories but allow
them<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.090> eat<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.750> eight<00:00:40.079> hours<00:00:40.110> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
them to eat it at just eight hours that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.220 
them to eat it at just eight hours that
they<00:00:41.280> gained<00:00:41.550> less<00:00:41.760> weight<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.020> let

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
they gained less weight then if you let

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.380 
they gained less weight then if you let
them<00:00:43.410> eat<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.710> over<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> 24-hour<00:00:44.670> period<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.270> was

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
them eat it over a 24-hour period it was

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.110 
them eat it over a 24-hour period it was
like<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.710> what<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.910> look

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
like what and what we have to do is look

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.790 
like what and what we have to do is look
at<00:00:48.270> something<00:00:48.660> called<00:00:48.690> circadian<00:00:49.260> rhythms

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
at something called circadian rhythms

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.380 
at something called circadian rhythms
which<00:00:50.010> means<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.550> are<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> rhythms<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
which means what are the rhythms of the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.930 
which means what are the rhythms of the
body<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:52.160> producing<00:00:53.160> its<00:00:53.280> hormones<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
body in producing its hormones that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.180 
body in producing its hormones that
regulate<00:00:54.239> how<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.600> burn<00:00:54.930> fat<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.230> it's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
regulate how we burn fat so it's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.920 
regulate how we burn fat so it's
important<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:56.879> how<00:00:57.059> our<00:00:57.210> adrenal<00:00:57.690> glands

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
important to know how our adrenal glands

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.380 
important to know how our adrenal glands
work<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.440> example<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.340> levels<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.879> cortisol

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
work for example the levels of cortisol

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.290 
work for example the levels of cortisol
and<00:01:00.719> levels<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.100> other<00:01:02.309> hormones<00:01:02.579> related<00:01:03.030> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and levels and other hormones related to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.000 
and levels and other hormones related to
the<00:01:03.390> adrenal<00:01:03.629> gland<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.439> high<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the adrenal gland are high in the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.289 
the adrenal gland are high in the
morning<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.549> drop<00:01:05.790> through<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> day

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
morning and they drop through the day

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.320 
morning and they drop through the day
and<00:01:06.540> they're<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> low<00:01:07.290> point<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:09.090> night

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and they're at a low point and at night

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.450 
and they're at a low point and at night
usually<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.170> hear<00:01:10.350> our<00:01:10.500> circadian<00:01:10.860> rhythms

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
usually we hear our circadian rhythms

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.630 
usually we hear our circadian rhythms
associated<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.479> sleep<00:01:12.630> mmhmm<00:01:13.530> yeah<00:01:14.369> because

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
associated with sleep mmhmm yeah because

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
associated with sleep mmhmm yeah because
we<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.090> times<00:01:15.570> when<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.990> sleep<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.380> time<00:01:16.619> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
we have times when we sleep in time so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
we have times when we sleep in time so
obviously<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.450> was<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
obviously we don't but this was kind of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.590 
obviously we don't but this was kind of
interesting<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:19.950> scheduled<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
interesting that if they scheduled the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.590 
interesting that if they scheduled the
high<00:01:22.049> fat<00:01:22.439> diet<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.119> could<00:01:24.330> lose<00:01:24.540> weight

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
high fat diet that you could lose weight

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.310 
high fat diet that you could lose weight
on<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.500> opposed<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.640> an<00:01:26.850> unscheduled<00:01:27.570> low

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
on it as opposed to an unscheduled low

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.730 
on it as opposed to an unscheduled low
fat<00:01:28.710> diet<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.119> means<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
fat diet so what that means is it if you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.660 
fat diet so what that means is it if you
feed<00:01:32.040> these<00:01:32.579> mice<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.210> rats<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> fats<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
feed these mice or rats the fats of the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.920 
feed these mice or rats the fats of the
diet<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.090> you're<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.390> give<00:01:36.570> them<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
diet that you're going to give them at a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.660 
diet that you're going to give them at a
certain<00:01:37.350> time<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.920> keep<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.460> certain

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
certain time and keep it at a certain

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.210 
certain time and keep it at a certain
time<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.689> regulated<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.650> there's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
time so that it's regulated and there's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.670 
time so that it's regulated and there's
no<00:01:41.430> snacking<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.030> between<00:01:42.390> meals<00:01:42.680> those

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
no snacking in between meals those

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.980 
no snacking in between meals those
animals<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> high<00:01:45.060> fat<00:01:45.390> diet<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
animals that have the high fat diet and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.130 
animals that have the high fat diet and
the<00:01:46.259> same<00:01:46.470> number<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> calories<00:01:47.930> didn't<00:01:48.930> have

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the same number of calories didn't have

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.990 
the same number of calories didn't have
as<00:01:49.380> much<00:01:49.619> weight<00:01:49.890> gain<00:01:50.159> as<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.610> people<00:01:50.880> were

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
as much weight gain as that people were

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.539 
as much weight gain as that people were
on<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> low-fat<00:01:51.720> diet<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.189> ate<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
on a low-fat diet if they if they ate it

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.609 
on a low-fat diet if they if they ate it
either<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.060> us<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.720> scheduled<00:01:55.380> or

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
either in us in a scheduled or

either in us in a scheduled or
unscheduled<00:01:56.460> way<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.240> only<00:01:57.509> thing<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.990> they

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
unscheduled way the only thing is they

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.200 
unscheduled way the only thing is they
didn't<00:01:58.500> tell<00:01:58.680> us<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> schedule<00:02:00.030> was

didn't tell us what the schedule was

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
didn't tell us what the schedule was
sure<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:00.930> yes<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> don't<00:02:01.469> want<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.860> what

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.340 
sure right yes I don't want to know what
the<00:02:02.159> schedule<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.640> you're<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> rabbit

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the schedule if you're a rabbit

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.649 
the schedule if you're a rabbit
we<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.370> we've<00:02:05.550> done<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.940> study<00:02:06.180> already

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
we see we've done the study already

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.210 
we see we've done the study already
which<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.350> they<00:02:07.500> published<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.009> cell

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
which is what they published in cell

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.279 
which is what they published in cell
metabolism<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:09.119> talked<00:02:09.630> about<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.080> fact

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
metabolism that talked about the fact

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.620 
metabolism that talked about the fact
that<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.280> eat<00:02:11.550> or<00:02:11.790> your<00:02:12.000> your<00:02:12.360> food

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
that if you just eat or your your food

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.000 
that if you just eat or your your food
over<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.990> certain<00:02:13.290> period<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.650> time<00:02:13.830> you're

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
over a certain period of time you're

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.230 
over a certain period of time you're
better<00:02:14.190> often<00:02:14.400> if<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.970> all<00:02:15.060> day<00:02:15.209> long

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
better often if you do it all day long

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.470 
better often if you do it all day long
so<00:02:15.750> people<00:02:16.680> who<00:02:16.830> only<00:02:17.310> eat<00:02:17.640> at<00:02:17.760> mealtime<00:02:18.300> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
so people who only eat at mealtime and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.110 
so people who only eat at mealtime and
don't<00:02:18.630> snack<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.310> probably<00:02:20.310> people<00:02:20.550> who<00:02:20.760> have

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
don't snack and probably people who have

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.540 
don't snack and probably people who have
more<00:02:21.510> fat<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.140> their<00:02:22.350> diet<00:02:22.380> than<00:02:22.890> not<00:02:23.130> if<00:02:23.370> we're

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
more fat in their diet than not if we're

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.370 
more fat in their diet than not if we're
like<00:02:23.730> rats<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.270> our<00:02:24.420> metabolism<00:02:25.080> which<00:02:25.230> we

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
like rats and our metabolism which we

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.710 
like rats and our metabolism which we
probably<00:02:25.620> are<00:02:25.980> very<00:02:26.160> similar<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:27.420> there's

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
probably are very similar then there's

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.360 
probably are very similar then there's
some<00:02:27.930> advantage<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.380> eating<00:02:28.680> fat<00:02:28.890> because<00:02:29.220> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
some advantage to eating fat because you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.770 
some advantage to eating fat because you
know<00:02:29.490> in<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.730> country<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.270> have<00:02:30.300> something

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
know in this country we have something

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.140 
know in this country we have something
called<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.050> fat<00:02:31.260> phobia<00:02:31.700> because<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.850> all<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
called a fat phobia because of all the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.940 
called a fat phobia because of all the
work<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.330> was<00:02:33.600> done<00:02:33.660> with<00:02:33.959> diet<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.350> fat<00:02:34.650> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
work that was done with diet and fat a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.560 
work that was done with diet and fat a
lot<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.490> was<00:02:35.610> done<00:02:35.790> by<00:02:35.940> dr.<00:02:36.240> Dean<00:02:36.420> Ornish

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
lot of that was done by dr. Dean Ornish

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.380 
lot of that was done by dr. Dean Ornish
and<00:02:36.959> we<00:02:37.650> got<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.010> idea<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.340> fat<00:02:38.700> was<00:02:38.940> bad<00:02:39.150> for

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
and we got the idea that fat was bad for

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.000 
and we got the idea that fat was bad for
you<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:39.630> actually<00:02:40.200> there<00:02:40.380> are<00:02:40.470> certain<00:02:40.770> fats

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
you but actually there are certain fats

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.740 
you but actually there are certain fats
that<00:02:41.190> are<00:02:41.280> terrible<00:02:41.820> for<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.390> trans

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that are terrible for you like trans

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.050 
that are terrible for you like trans
fats<00:02:43.110> but<00:02:43.800> other<00:02:44.010> fats<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.520> are<00:02:44.610> absolutely

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
fats but other fats that are absolutely

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.699 
fats but other fats that are absolutely
essential<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.750> fact<00:02:45.989> if<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.230> don't<00:02:46.320> eat<00:02:46.530> them

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
essential in fact if you don't eat them

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.699 
essential in fact if you don't eat them
you<00:02:46.860> can't<00:02:47.100> live<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:48.390> there's<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.750> rasmus's

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
you can't live so there's a rasmus's

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.680 
you can't live so there's a rasmus's
book<00:02:49.980> that's<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.550> heel<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.970> fats<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.480> kill

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
book that's the heel and fats that kill

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.110 
book that's the heel and fats that kill
right<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> essential<00:02:53.130> fatty<00:02:53.370> acids<00:02:53.940> like

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
right so the essential fatty acids like

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.600 
right so the essential fatty acids like
the<00:02:54.270> Omega<00:02:54.570> threes<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.170> sixes<00:02:55.380> our<00:02:56.190> bodies

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the Omega threes and sixes our bodies

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.150 
the Omega threes and sixes our bodies
can't<00:02:56.880> make<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.290> them<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
can't make but we have to have them to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.040 
can't make but we have to have them to
make<00:02:59.310> healthy<00:02:59.700> cell<00:02:59.940> membranes<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.900> do<00:03:01.019> a

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
make healthy cell membranes and to do a

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.840 
make healthy cell membranes and to do a
lot<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.380> other<00:03:01.620> things<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.040> are<00:03:02.160> important

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
lot of other things that are important

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.930 
lot of other things that are important
for<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.269> life<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.170> has<00:03:04.410> lower<00:03:04.940> inflammation

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
for a life that has lower inflammation

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.420 
for a life that has lower inflammation
in<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.540> according<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.590> study<00:03:07.920> they<00:03:08.370> were

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
in it according to this study they were

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.660 
in it according to this study they were
talking<00:03:08.760> about<00:03:09.060> these<00:03:09.480> fats<00:03:09.870> were<00:03:10.769> not<00:03:11.070> stored

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
talking about these fats were not stored

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.240 
talking about these fats were not stored
but<00:03:11.970> they<00:03:12.150> were<00:03:12.209> used<00:03:12.660> for<00:03:12.840> your<00:03:13.230> burn<00:03:13.620> and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
but they were used for your burn and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.100 
but they were used for your burn and
Andrea<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.910> points<00:03:15.269> out<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.660> fact<00:03:15.750> that

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
Andrea that points out to the fact that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.610 
Andrea that points out to the fact that
we<00:03:16.739> know<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.420> what<00:03:18.420> we<00:03:18.600> derive<00:03:19.019> our<00:03:19.200> energy

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
we know that what we derive our energy

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.670 
we know that what we derive our energy
from<00:03:19.920> under<00:03:20.579> normal<00:03:20.900> circumstances<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.140> fat

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
from under normal circumstances is fat

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.430 
from under normal circumstances is fat
not<00:03:22.980> carbohydrate<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.630> when<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.049> measure

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
not carbohydrate so when you measure

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.370 
not carbohydrate so when you measure
somebody's<00:03:26.120> fat<00:03:27.120> burning<00:03:27.570> capacity<00:03:27.690> and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
somebody's fat burning capacity and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.440 
somebody's fat burning capacity and
their<00:03:28.560> sugar<00:03:28.860> burning<00:03:29.280> capacity<00:03:29.450> when

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
their sugar burning capacity when

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.240 
their sugar burning capacity when
they're<00:03:30.630> at<00:03:30.780> rest<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.380> until<00:03:31.769> we<00:03:31.890> get<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.100> a

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
they're at rest and until we get to a

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.250 
they're at rest and until we get to a
place<00:03:32.430> where<00:03:32.760> we're<00:03:32.880> exercising<00:03:33.269> hard

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
place where we're exercising hard

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.680 
place where we're exercising hard
we<00:03:34.799> weren't<00:03:34.980> fat<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.910> not<00:03:36.150> till<00:03:36.360> we<00:03:36.480> get

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
we weren't fat it's not till we get

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.710 
we weren't fat it's not till we get
tired<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:38.280> when<00:03:38.519> we're<00:03:38.670> exercising<00:03:39.000> we<00:03:39.570> go

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
tired that when we're exercising we go

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.410 
tired that when we're exercising we go
into<00:03:39.870> what's<00:03:40.110> called<00:03:40.200> acidosis

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
into what's called acidosis

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.449 
into what's called acidosis
because<00:03:42.420> lactic<00:03:42.959> acidosis<00:03:43.410> because<00:03:44.280> we're

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
because lactic acidosis because we're

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.610 
because lactic acidosis because we're
learning<00:03:44.690> carbohydrate<00:03:45.690> instead<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.380> fat

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
learning carbohydrate instead of fat

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.140 
learning carbohydrate instead of fat
well<00:03:46.980> I've<00:03:47.130> noticed<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.700> when<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:47.880> eat

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
well I've noticed that when I eat

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.240 
well I've noticed that when I eat
something<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.720> carbohydrate<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.620> get<00:03:49.829> hungry

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
something this carbohydrate I get hungry

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.819 
something this carbohydrate I get hungry
a<00:03:50.579> lot<00:03:50.850> sooner<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.390> my<00:03:51.540> energy<00:03:51.840> drops<00:03:52.500> more

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
a lot sooner and my energy drops more

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.770 
a lot sooner and my energy drops more
than<00:03:53.400> if<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.610> eat<00:03:53.760> something<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.360> has<00:03:54.510> some

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
than if I eat something that has some

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.810 
than if I eat something that has some
fat<00:03:55.049> in<00:03:55.079> it<00:03:55.410> then<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.739> holds<00:03:55.920> me<00:03:56.250> over<00:03:56.579> longer

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
fat in it then it holds me over longer

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.699 
fat in it then it holds me over longer
and<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.480> may<00:03:57.630> be<00:03:57.690> part<00:03:58.079> of<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.170> reason<00:03:58.560> why

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
and that may be part of the reason why

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.680 
and that may be part of the reason why
this<00:03:58.769> is<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.940> it's<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.239> very<00:04:00.450> interesting

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
this is so so it's a very interesting

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.170 
this is so so it's a very interesting
study<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.470> was<00:04:01.709> done<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:02.549> was<00:04:02.730> published

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
study that was done it was published

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.569 
study that was done it was published
actually<00:04:03.989> by<00:04:04.170> people<00:04:04.890> at<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.220> Hebrew

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
actually by people at the Hebrew

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.880 
actually by people at the Hebrew
University<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:06.180> Jerusalem<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.350> in<00:04:07.769> the

University in Jerusalem and and in the
big<00:04:08.040> journal<00:04:08.400> called<00:04:08.579> facet<00:04:09.120> which<00:04:09.299> is<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> very

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
big journal called facet which is a very

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.990 
big journal called facet which is a very
prestigious<00:04:09.810> Journal<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.739> what<00:04:11.430> we've<00:04:11.579> got<00:04:11.610> as

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
prestigious Journal so what we've got as

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.699 
prestigious Journal so what we've got as
a<00:04:12.030> study<00:04:12.480> here<00:04:12.750> that's<00:04:12.959> important<00:04:13.470> that's

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
a study here that's important that's

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.559 
a study here that's important that's
teaching<00:04:13.980> us<00:04:14.250> something<00:04:14.609> about

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
teaching us something about

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.420 
teaching us something about
the<00:04:15.780> fact<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.109> fat<00:04:16.380> isn't<00:04:16.709> all<00:04:16.799> bad<00:04:17.010> but

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
the fact that fat isn't all bad but

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.189 
the fact that fat isn't all bad but
isn't<00:04:18.000> how<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.150> use<00:04:18.389> it<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.810> recently

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
isn't how you use it and just recently

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.830 
isn't how you use it and just recently
we<00:04:19.440> were<00:04:19.709> talking<00:04:20.070> about<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.699> step<00:04:21.180> study<00:04:21.600> that

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
we were talking about a step study that

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.689 
we were talking about a step study that
showed<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.139> coconut<00:04:22.740> oil<00:04:23.010> could<00:04:23.370> actually

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
showed that coconut oil could actually

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.810 
showed that coconut oil could actually
help<00:04:24.270> us<00:04:24.449> to<00:04:24.510> reduce<00:04:25.020> belly<00:04:25.440> fat<00:04:25.590> right<00:04:26.430> and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
help us to reduce belly fat right and

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.030 
help us to reduce belly fat right and
also<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.750> know<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.260> can<00:04:28.410> be<00:04:28.530> used<00:04:28.740> in

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
also we know that it can be used in

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.800 
also we know that it can be used in
people<00:04:29.220> who<00:04:29.580> have<00:04:29.820> Alzheimer's<00:04:30.060> disease<00:04:30.449> or

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
people who have Alzheimer's disease or

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.740 
people who have Alzheimer's disease or
other<00:04:31.139> diseases<00:04:32.100> of<00:04:32.430> energy<00:04:32.940> deficiency<00:04:33.270> in

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
other diseases of energy deficiency in

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.379 
other diseases of energy deficiency in
the<00:04:33.870> brain<00:04:34.110> if<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.919> provide<00:04:35.430> coconut<00:04:35.970> oil<00:04:36.150> and

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
the brain if you provide coconut oil and

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.450 
the brain if you provide coconut oil and
just<00:04:36.539> a<00:04:36.720> dose<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.229> a<00:04:37.380> couple<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.740> tablespoons

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
just a dose of a couple of tablespoons

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.460 
just a dose of a couple of tablespoons
three<00:04:38.789> times<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.210> day<00:04:39.240> you're<00:04:40.139> gonna<00:04:40.229> provide

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
three times a day you're gonna provide

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.779 
three times a day you're gonna provide
what<00:04:40.830> are<00:04:40.919> called<00:04:41.130> medium<00:04:41.490> chain

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
what are called medium chain

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.750 
what are called medium chain
triglycerides<00:04:42.660> which<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.139> brain<00:04:43.440> now<00:04:44.280> can

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
triglycerides which the brain now can

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.810 
triglycerides which the brain now can
use<00:04:45.030> as<00:04:45.270> energy<00:04:46.110> when<00:04:46.949> it<00:04:47.250> can't<00:04:47.580> burn

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
use as energy when it can't burn

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.480 
use as energy when it can't burn
carbohydrates<00:04:48.330> so<00:04:48.960> well<00:04:49.169> so<00:04:49.830> if<00:04:50.160> we<00:04:50.340> can

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
carbohydrates so well so if we can

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.820 
carbohydrates so well so if we can
provide<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.970> with<00:04:51.000> more<00:04:51.300> energy<00:04:51.510> then<00:04:52.440> the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
provide it with more energy then the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.710 
provide it with more energy then the
process<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.669> development<00:04:53.699> of<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.479> Brown

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
process of the development of the Brown

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.450 
process of the development of the Brown
out<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.169> electrical<00:04:55.590> Brown<00:04:55.830> out<00:04:56.039> and<00:04:56.280> the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
out the electrical Brown out and the

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.939 
out the electrical Brown out and the
chemical<00:04:56.930> deficiency<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.050> energy<00:04:58.560> in<00:04:58.830> the

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
chemical deficiency of energy in the

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.670 
chemical deficiency of energy in the
brain<00:04:59.070> cell<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.639> less<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.389> a<00:05:00.479> problem<00:05:00.660> so<00:05:01.500> now

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
brain cell is less of a problem so now

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.790 
brain cell is less of a problem so now
it<00:05:01.830> looks<00:05:01.889> like<00:05:02.280> maybe<00:05:02.570> scheduling<00:05:03.800> these

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
it looks like maybe scheduling these

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.129 
it looks like maybe scheduling these
meals<00:05:05.250> could<00:05:05.639> be<00:05:05.789> therapeutic<00:05:06.539> for<00:05:06.780> obesity

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
meals could be therapeutic for obesity

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.320 
meals could be therapeutic for obesity
you<00:05:07.800> just<00:05:08.100> need<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.430> know<00:05:08.580> what<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.970> schedule

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
you just need to know what the schedule

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.390 
you just need to know what the schedule
we're<00:05:09.960> on<00:05:10.110> schedule<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.860> mean<00:05:11.010> we<00:05:11.100> don't<00:05:11.280> need

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
we're on schedule I mean we don't need

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.070 
we're on schedule I mean we don't need
this<00:05:11.580> study<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:12.060> know<00:05:12.240> that<00:05:12.510> if<00:05:12.750> we<00:05:12.870> should

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
this study to know that if we should

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.969 
this study to know that if we should
have<00:05:13.199> three<00:05:13.410> meals<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:13.770> day

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
have three meals a day

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.340 
have three meals a day
if<00:05:14.760> we're<00:05:14.970> gonna<00:05:15.090> snack<00:05:15.419> it's<00:05:15.630> not<00:05:15.810> much<00:05:16.020> and

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
if we're gonna snack it's not much and

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.110 
if we're gonna snack it's not much and
these<00:05:16.949> studies<00:05:17.130> are<00:05:17.430> pointing<00:05:17.729> out<00:05:17.850> that

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
these studies are pointing out that

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.350 
these studies are pointing out that
that's<00:05:18.750> not<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.139> bad<00:05:19.350> so<00:05:19.830> maybe<00:05:19.979> we<00:05:20.220> should

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
that's not so bad so maybe we should

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.300 
that's not so bad so maybe we should
rethink<00:05:21.360> this<00:05:22.110> whole<00:05:22.169> system<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:22.949> noting

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
rethink this whole system and noting

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.370 
rethink this whole system and noting
that<00:05:23.669> make<00:05:23.940> fat<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.360> enemy<00:05:24.720> and<00:05:24.960> as<00:05:25.080> long<00:05:25.229> as

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
that make fat the enemy and as long as

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.290 
that make fat the enemy and as long as
the<00:05:25.470> calories<00:05:25.889> are<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.130> same<00:05:26.340> yeah<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:26.880> and

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
the calories are the same yeah and and
