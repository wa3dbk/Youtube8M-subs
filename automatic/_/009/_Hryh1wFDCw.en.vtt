it's going to be a little different

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.970 
it's going to be a little different
because<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.050> obvious<00:01:03.170> reason<00:01:03.800> she's

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
because of the obvious reason she's

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.160
