00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.629 

so<00:00:01.199> in<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.439> tutorial<00:00:01.680> we're<00:00:02.310> gonna<00:00:02.460> go

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so in this tutorial we're gonna go

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.059 
so in this tutorial we're gonna go
through<00:00:02.939> lens<00:00:03.270> flares<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:04.049> also<00:00:04.650> different

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
through lens flares and also different

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.690 
through lens flares and also different
methods<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.580> creating<00:00:05.819> Globes<00:00:06.649> so<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:08.040> created

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
methods of creating Globes so I created

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.810 
methods of creating Globes so I created
the<00:00:08.970> scene<00:00:09.210> just<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.050> tutorial<00:00:10.820> I've

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
the scene just for this tutorial I've

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.870 
the scene just for this tutorial I've
got<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.420> sort<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.019> street<00:00:13.469> lamps<00:00:13.650> here<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
got to sort of street lamps here and a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.750 
got to sort of street lamps here and a
sphere<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> ground<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.730> where<00:00:17.730> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
sphere on the ground and where I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.779 
sphere on the ground and where I
basically<00:00:17.910> did<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:19.199> created<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.100> really

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
basically did is I created this really

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.300 
basically did is I created this really
white<00:00:21.270> luminance<00:00:21.810> material<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:23.039> added

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
white luminance material and just added

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.310 
white luminance material and just added
in<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:24.119> added<00:00:24.269> an<00:00:24.480> omni<00:00:24.810> light<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.109> kind<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
in I just added an omni light to kind of

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.040 
in I just added an omni light to kind of
below<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.119> make<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.269> look<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.660> this

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
below it to make it look like this

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.640 
below it to make it look like this
material<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.890> casting<00:00:29.400> light<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:31.320> that's<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
material is casting light so that's the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.670 
material is casting light so that's the
Omni<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:33.780> settings<00:00:34.170> are<00:00:34.320> basically

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
Omni the settings are basically

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.500 
Omni the settings are basically
straightforward<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.850> casting<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.329> ray

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
straightforward of on casting a ray

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.110 
straightforward of on casting a ray
traced<00:00:36.780> shadow<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.410> also<00:00:37.890> fall-off<00:00:38.640> asset<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
traced shadow and also fall-off asset to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.940 
traced shadow and also fall-off asset to
a<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.480> bar<00:00:39.660> square<00:00:39.960> physically<00:00:40.440> accurate<00:00:41.420> so

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
a and bar square physically accurate so

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.170 
a and bar square physically accurate so
I'm<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> render<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> scene<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
I'm just going to render the scene to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
I'm just going to render the scene to
show<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.260> looks<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:48.710> as<00:00:49.710> you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
show you what it looks like and as you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.670 
show you what it looks like and as you
can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.690> it's<00:00:51.690> creating<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> illusion<00:00:52.440> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
can see it's creating the illusion that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.279 
can see it's creating the illusion that
this<00:00:53.070> lamp<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.180> casting<00:00:55.110> an<00:00:55.230> actual<00:00:55.530> light<00:00:55.820> now

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
this lamp is casting an actual light now

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
this lamp is casting an actual light now
you<00:00:58.289> might<00:00:58.469> want<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.710> add<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> bit<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.460> kind

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you might want to add a bit of the kind

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
you might want to add a bit of the kind
of<00:00:59.879> lens<00:01:00.149> flare<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.559> know

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
of lens flare to this and as you know

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.869 
of lens flare to this and as you know
lens<00:01:02.010> flares<00:01:02.280> were<00:01:02.430> quite<00:01:02.640> popular

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
lens flares were quite popular

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.590 
lens flares were quite popular
throughout<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> 90s<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.530> CGI<00:01:04.970> but<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.420> seem

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
throughout the 90s and CGI but they seem

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.640 
throughout the 90s and CGI but they seem
to<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.840> making<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.200> comeback

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
to be making a comeback

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.670 
to be making a comeback
recently<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:09.080> I'm<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> take<00:01:10.560> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
recently and I'm just going to take this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.969 
recently and I'm just going to take this
light<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.110> you'll<00:01:13.110> notice<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> tab

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
light here and you'll notice a tab

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.710 
light here and you'll notice a tab
called<00:01:14.250> lens<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.330> click<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
called lens so if you just click on that

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.320 
called lens so if you just click on that
this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.770> where<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.220> create<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.970> lens

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
this is where you can create a lens

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.620 
this is where you can create a lens
flare<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> hit<00:01:20.610> alt<00:01:20.939> R<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
flare so I'm just going to hit alt R to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.950 
flare so I'm just going to hit alt R to
bring<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> interactive<00:01:22.740> render<00:01:23.960> like

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
bring up the interactive render like

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.109 
bring up the interactive render like
this<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.670> I'm<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.970> move<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
this and I'm just going to move that

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.609 
this and I'm just going to move that
over<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:29.930> like<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.389 

and<00:01:36.340> I'm<00:01:37.240> gonna<00:01:37.390> add<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.750> first<00:01:38.039> lens<00:01:39.039> flare

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
and I'm gonna add the first lens flare

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.069 
and I'm gonna add the first lens flare
so<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.869> you<00:01:40.990> click<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.380> inactive<00:01:42.039> you've<00:01:42.579> got<00:01:42.789> a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
so if you click on inactive you've got a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.889 
so if you click on inactive you've got a
wide<00:01:44.079> selection<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.799> different<00:01:44.979> lens<00:01:45.340> flares

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
wide selection of different lens flares

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.190 
wide selection of different lens flares
so<00:01:46.899> I'm<00:01:46.990> gonna<00:01:47.079> try<00:01:47.350> some<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.780> you'll<00:01:49.780> notice

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
so I'm gonna try some and you'll notice

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.130 
so I'm gonna try some and you'll notice
a<00:01:50.310> rerender<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.429> scene<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.060> then<00:01:52.299> adds<00:01:52.840> it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
a rerender is a scene and then adds it

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.990 
a rerender is a scene and then adds it
after<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.860> renderings<00:01:54.280> down<00:01:54.459> like<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> post

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
after the renderings down like a post

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.669 
after the renderings down like a post
effect

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
effect

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.130 
effect
so<00:01:56.679> that's<00:01:56.829> Sun<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.569> it<00:01:58.569> seems<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.810> be<00:01:58.869> quite

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
so that's Sun and it seems to be quite

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.039 
so that's Sun and it seems to be quite
bright<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.060> can<00:02:01.209> also<00:02:01.359> do<00:02:01.719> is<00:02:01.869> you<00:02:02.020> can

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
bright what you can also do is you can

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.130 
bright what you can also do is you can
add<00:02:02.319> reflexes<00:02:03.039> here<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.990> those<00:02:04.990> are

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
add reflexes here and those are

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.050 
add reflexes here and those are
basically<00:02:05.350> those<00:02:05.740> little<00:02:06.159> kind<00:02:06.429> of<00:02:06.520> circles

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
basically those little kind of circles

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.210 
basically those little kind of circles
that<00:02:07.179> come<00:02:07.450> off<00:02:07.599> the<00:02:07.630> lens<00:02:07.869> flare<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:08.890> if<00:02:09.099> I

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
that come off the lens flare so if I

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.250 
that come off the lens flare so if I
choose<00:02:09.489> say<00:02:09.959> star<00:02:10.959> free<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.799> can<00:02:11.980> see<00:02:12.280> here

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
choose say star free you can see here

control panel you can control how the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.440 
control panel you can control how the
beams<00:02:41.590> look<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.690> then

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.309 

you<00:02:51.170> can<00:02:51.349> add<00:02:51.440> rings<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:53.780> can<00:02:53.930> adjust<00:02:54.200> the

you can add rings you can adjust the

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.400 
you can add rings you can adjust the
size<00:02:54.590> like<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:56.360> brightness<00:02:56.739> thickness

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
size like that the brightness thickness

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.960 
size like that the brightness thickness
breaks<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.709> beams<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.370> you've<00:03:01.550> got<00:03:01.730> all

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
breaks in the beams so you've got all

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.670 
breaks in the beams so you've got all
these<00:03:02.120> kind<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.450> more<00:03:03.020> detailed<00:03:03.440> settings<00:03:03.860> and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
these kind of more detailed settings and

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:15.070 
these kind of more detailed settings and
the<00:03:06.680> same<00:03:06.950> with<00:03:07.160> their<00:03:07.340> reflux<00:03:07.760> editor<00:03:14.080> you

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
the same with their reflux editor you

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.050 
the same with their reflux editor you
can<00:03:15.230> now<00:03:15.350> choose<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:15.860> lens<00:03:16.100> type<00:03:16.400> hexagon

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
can now choose like a lens type hexagon

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.990 
can now choose like a lens type hexagon
you<00:03:17.810> can<00:03:17.930> adjust<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.319> position<00:03:18.470> slightly<00:03:20.110> so

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
you can adjust the position slightly so

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.410 
you can adjust the position slightly so
so<00:03:23.000> these<00:03:23.150> sections<00:03:23.569> are<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:23.989> fine<00:03:24.440> tune<00:03:24.739> ups

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
so these sections are for fine tune ups

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.990 
so these sections are for fine tune ups
now<00:03:26.860> there's<00:03:27.860> different<00:03:28.040> ways<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.430> can<00:03:28.790> add

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
now there's different ways you can add

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.240 
now there's different ways you can add
glows<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:29.959> cinema<00:03:30.290> 4d<00:03:31.660> as<00:03:32.660> soon<00:03:32.870> as<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.250> play

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
glows in cinema 4d as soon as you play

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.220 
glows in cinema 4d as soon as you play
with<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.519> lens<00:03:34.730> settings<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.900> render

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
with the lens settings the render

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.870 
with the lens settings the render
settings<00:03:36.440> automatically<00:03:37.190> adds<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.640> lens

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
settings automatically adds the lens

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.750 
settings automatically adds the lens
effects<00:03:38.350> option<00:03:39.350> here<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.459> haven't<00:03:40.670> got

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
effects option here and you haven't got

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.320 
effects option here and you haven't got
any<00:03:40.910> fiber<00:03:41.299> options<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:42.049> just<00:03:43.120> it's<00:03:44.120> just

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
any fiber options it's just it's just

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.800 
any fiber options it's just it's just
basically<00:03:44.600> an<00:03:44.780> entry<00:03:46.239> now<00:03:47.239> what<00:03:47.420> we<00:03:47.510> can<00:03:47.660> do

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
basically an entry now what we can do

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.680 
basically an entry now what we can do
though<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.910> I'm<00:03:49.910> just<00:03:49.940> going<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.209> turn<00:03:50.420> off<00:03:50.569> the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
though is I'm just going to turn off the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.650 
though is I'm just going to turn off the
slow

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.080 

and<00:03:56.340> I'm<00:03:57.340> actually<00:03:57.430> gonna<00:03:57.670> turn<00:03:57.850> off<00:03:57.970> the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
and I'm actually gonna turn off the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.970 
and I'm actually gonna turn off the
light<00:04:01.020> so<00:04:02.020> what<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.200> can<00:04:02.290> do<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.680> can<00:04:02.740> actually

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
light so what I can do is I can actually

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.410 
light so what I can do is I can actually
add<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.310> glow<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.700> this<00:04:03.970> kind<00:04:04.180> of<00:04:04.210> white

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
add a glow to this kind of white

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.390 
add a glow to this kind of white
material<00:04:05.020> as<00:04:05.140> well<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.620> that's<00:04:06.160> this

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
material as well and that's this

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.490 
material as well and that's this
material<00:04:06.970> here<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:09.190> if<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:10.060> just<00:04:10.330> double<00:04:11.290> click

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
material here so if I just double click

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.900 
material here so if I just double click
it<00:04:12.330> I've<00:04:13.330> also<00:04:13.540> got<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:13.900> glow<00:04:14.170> option<00:04:14.560> here

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
it I've also got this glow option here

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:22.470 
it I've also got this glow option here
so<00:04:15.910> if<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.209> check<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:18.190> add<00:04:18.310> like<00:04:18.520> a<00:04:21.480> glow

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
so if I check that I can add like a glow

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.670 
so if I check that I can add like a glow
to<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.840> material<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:24.870> we<00:04:25.870> can<00:04:26.020> adjust<00:04:26.290> the

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
to that material and we can adjust the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.430 
to that material and we can adjust the
kind<00:04:26.860> of<00:04:27.030> radius<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.330> strength<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:29.110> all<00:04:29.200> that

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
kind of radius and strength and all that

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.660 
kind of radius and strength and all that
and<00:04:29.770> another<00:04:30.760> thing<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.090> notice<00:04:32.610> by<00:04:33.610> default

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
and another thing to notice by default

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.120 
and another thing to notice by default
it<00:04:34.210> uses<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.660> material<00:04:35.140> color<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:35.770> if<00:04:36.010> the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
it uses the material color so if the

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.650 
it uses the material color so if the
material<00:04:36.280> is<00:04:36.640> white<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.240> glow<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.450> going<00:04:37.600> to

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
material is white the glow is going to

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.380 
material is white the glow is going to
be<00:04:37.720> white<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.640> if<00:04:39.640> you<00:04:39.790> want<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.000> check<00:04:40.180> this

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
be white and if you want to check this

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.900 
be white and if you want to check this
you<00:04:40.600> can<00:04:40.750> set<00:04:40.930> your<00:04:41.050> own<00:04:41.200> color<00:04:41.670> so<00:04:42.670> I'm<00:04:42.790> just

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
you can set your own color so I'm just

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.680 
you can set your own color so I'm just
going<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.060> go<00:04:43.180> for<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.390> blue<00:04:43.600> here<00:04:43.870> and<00:04:45.600> as<00:04:46.600> you

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
going to go for a blue here and as you

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.880 
going to go for a blue here and as you
can<00:04:46.780> see<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:47.140> looks<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.560> lot<00:04:47.740> better<00:04:49.260> in<00:04:50.260> this

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
can see this looks a lot better in this

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.220 
can see this looks a lot better in this
situation<00:04:50.950> I<00:04:51.490> guess<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:52.030> color<00:04:52.240> would<00:04:53.080> be

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
situation I guess the color would be

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.670 
situation I guess the color would be
orange<00:04:54.930> maybe<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.050> bit<00:04:56.350> brighter<00:04:56.920> so<00:04:58.680> that's

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
orange maybe a bit brighter so that's

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.450 
orange maybe a bit brighter so that's
another<00:04:59.920> method<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:01.270> problem<00:05:01.630> with<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:01.930> is

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
another method the problem with this is

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.770 
another method the problem with this is
it's<00:05:03.460> going<00:05:03.640> to<00:05:03.700> apply<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.360> all<00:05:04.600> the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
it's going to apply it to all the

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.950 
it's going to apply it to all the
materials<00:05:05.730> so<00:05:06.730> this<00:05:07.030> one<00:05:07.210> would<00:05:07.420> receive<00:05:07.750> the

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
materials so this one would receive the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.750 
materials so this one would receive the
same<00:05:08.140> effect<00:05:08.500> as<00:05:08.680> well<00:05:08.860> but<00:05:09.190> what<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.490> can<00:05:09.640> do

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
same effect as well but what you can do

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.010 
same effect as well but what you can do
is<00:05:09.850> you<00:05:09.940> can<00:05:10.060> basically<00:05:10.180> copy<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:10.720> paste<00:05:10.900> the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
is you can basically copy and paste the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.440 
is you can basically copy and paste the
material<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.680> then<00:05:11.800> remove<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.880> glow<00:05:13.060> option

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
material and then remove the glow option

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.840 
material and then remove the glow option
and<00:05:13.660> then<00:05:13.840> apply<00:05:14.140> that<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.470> any<00:05:14.620> lights<00:05:15.520> where

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
and then apply that to any lights where

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.840 
and then apply that to any lights where
you<00:05:15.940> don't<00:05:16.120> want<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.360> glow<00:05:16.540> effect<00:05:17.200> being

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
you don't want the glow effect being

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:25.760 
you don't want the glow effect being
shown<00:05:18.850> so<00:05:21.210> lastly<00:05:23.550> there's<00:05:24.550> a<00:05:24.670> further<00:05:24.970> method

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
shown so lastly there's a further method

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.600 
shown so lastly there's a further method
if<00:05:26.770> you<00:05:26.830> just<00:05:27.160> click<00:05:27.400> on<00:05:28.770> actual<00:05:29.770> object<00:05:30.220> you

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
if you just click on actual object you

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.230 
if you just click on actual object you
can<00:05:30.730> add<00:05:30.850> a<00:05:30.880> compositing<00:05:31.540> tag

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.909 

and<00:05:35.360> I'm<00:05:36.169> just<00:05:36.259> going<00:05:36.380> to<00:05:36.440> give<00:05:36.590> this<00:05:36.710> an

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
and I'm just going to give this an

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.730 
and I'm just going to give this an
object<00:05:37.310> buffer<00:05:37.669> ID<00:05:37.880> so<00:05:38.240> enable<00:05:38.810> I'm<00:05:39.560> gonna

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
object buffer ID so enable I'm gonna

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.360 
object buffer ID so enable I'm gonna
call<00:05:40.009> it<00:05:40.190> say<00:05:40.850> six<00:05:41.620> if<00:05:42.620> I<00:05:42.710> go<00:05:42.830> to<00:05:42.889> my<00:05:42.979> render

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
call it say six if I go to my render

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.860 
call it say six if I go to my render
settings<00:05:44.259> I'm<00:05:45.259> just<00:05:45.410> going<00:05:45.530> to<00:05:45.590> delete<00:05:45.740> this

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
settings I'm just going to delete this

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.290 
settings I'm just going to delete this
this<00:05:47.870> actually<00:05:48.310> if<00:05:49.310> you<00:05:49.460> right-click<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:50.240> can

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
this actually if you right-click you can

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.969 
this actually if you right-click you can
also<00:05:50.570> add<00:05:50.960> a<00:05:50.990> glow<00:05:51.289> here<00:05:51.710> and<00:05:53.350> if<00:05:54.350> I<00:05:54.470> check<00:05:54.770> this

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
also add a glow here and if I check this

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.120 
also add a glow here and if I check this
I<00:05:55.250> can<00:05:56.000> apply<00:05:56.210> this<00:05:56.479> globe<00:05:56.810> to<00:05:57.229> a<00:05:57.259> specific

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
I can apply this globe to a specific

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.100 
I can apply this globe to a specific
object<00:05:58.280> ID<00:05:58.729> so<00:05:59.060> in<00:05:59.180> this<00:05:59.270> case<00:05:59.539> six<00:05:59.870> and<00:06:02.110> you

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
object ID so in this case six and you

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.779 
object ID so in this case six and you
can<00:06:03.259> basically<00:06:03.380> see<00:06:03.650> here<00:06:04.130> that<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.580> glows

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
can basically see here that the glows

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.719 
can basically see here that the glows
applied<00:06:06.009> you<00:06:07.009> can<00:06:07.160> see<00:06:07.280> that<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.520> glow<00:06:07.669> is

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
applied you can see that the glow is

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.810 
applied you can see that the glow is
applied<00:06:08.030> only<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:08.419> this<00:06:08.630> object<00:06:12.789> like<00:06:13.789> that

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
applied only to this object like that

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.040 
applied only to this object like that
and<00:06:14.560> then<00:06:16.120> you've<00:06:17.120> got<00:06:17.300> a<00:06:17.330> few<00:06:17.509> settings<00:06:17.750> there

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
and then you've got a few settings there

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.390 
and then you've got a few settings there
just<00:06:18.289> here<00:06:18.500> as<00:06:18.620> well<00:06:18.830> so<00:06:19.280> intensity<00:06:20.800> sized

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:34.499 

glow<00:06:25.400> edges<00:06:28.660> now<00:06:29.660> look<00:06:29.900> at<00:06:30.020> that<00:06:32.949> there<00:06:33.949> you<00:06:33.979> go

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
glow edges now look at that there you go

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.360 
glow edges now look at that there you go
so<00:06:35.509> that's<00:06:35.990> a<00:06:36.139> very<00:06:36.320> brief<00:06:36.560> introduction<00:06:37.340> to

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
so that's a very brief introduction to

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.210 
so that's a very brief introduction to
lens<00:06:38.060> effects<00:06:38.449> and<00:06:38.630> glows<00:06:38.810> and<00:06:39.169> I<00:06:39.800> hope<00:06:40.070> you

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
lens effects and glows and I hope you

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.219 
lens effects and glows and I hope you
found<00:06:40.370> this<00:06:40.580> tutorial<00:06:40.760> useful<00:06:41.090> and<00:06:41.630> thanks
