sure the trumpet faces this way because

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.969 
sure the trumpet faces this way because
this<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.869> only<00:01:45.050> area<00:01:45.320> where<00:01:45.500> there's<00:01:45.800> some

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
this is the only area where there's some

option<00:01:48.289> is<00:01:48.380> actually<00:01:48.560> trim<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.250> little<00:01:49.520> bit<00:01:49.610> the

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
option is actually trim a little bit the

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.730 
option is actually trim a little bit the
trumpet<00:01:50.179> unfortunately<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.200> more<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.470> trim

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
trumpet unfortunately the more you trim

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.180 
trumpet unfortunately the more you trim
it<00:01:51.890> kind<00:01:52.070> of<00:01:52.160> affects<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:53.000> tone<00:01:53.240> quality

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
it kind of affects that the tone quality

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.120 
it kind of affects that the tone quality
one<00:01:55.190> one<00:01:55.640> key<00:01:56.350> step<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.500> installing<00:01:57.890> these

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
one one key step to installing these

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.160 
one one key step to installing these
horns<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:59.119> can't<00:01:59.330> actually<00:01:59.570> have<00:01:59.990> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
horns is you can't actually have the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.350 
horns is you can't actually have the
horn<00:02:00.409> physically<00:02:01.250> touching<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:01.970> bodywork

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
horn physically touching a the bodywork

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.810 
horn physically touching a the bodywork
it<00:02:02.840> kind<00:02:03.050> of<00:02:03.110> sounds<00:02:03.320> like<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.530> sick<00:02:03.770> duck<00:02:04.009> when

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
it kind of sounds like a sick duck when

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.639 
it kind of sounds like a sick duck when
you<00:02:05.330> honk<00:02:05.539> it<00:02:05.780> when<00:02:05.929> it<00:02:06.020> when<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.440> things

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
you honk it when it when the things

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.109 
you honk it when it when the things
actually<00:02:06.860> making<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.340> physical<00:02:07.759> contact

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
actually making a physical contact

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.729 
actually making a physical contact
because<00:02:08.660> when<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:08.959> honks<00:02:09.349> it's<00:02:09.440> actually

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
because when this honks it's actually

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.770 
because when this honks it's actually
vibrates<00:02:10.160> quite<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.429> bit<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.849> it<00:02:11.390> wants<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.630> be

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
vibrates quite a bit and it wants to be

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.270 
vibrates quite a bit and it wants to be
you<00:02:12.020> want<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.260> be<00:02:12.349> suspended<00:02:12.980> from<00:02:13.130> the

you want to be suspended from the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.740 
you want to be suspended from the

a<00:02:16.880> lot<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.209> times<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.599> little<00:02:17.660> trial<00:02:17.989> and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
a lot of times it's a little trial and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.800 
a lot of times it's a little trial and
error<00:02:18.230> you'll<00:02:18.440> bolt<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.459> there<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.599> if<00:02:20.690> it

error you'll bolt it in there and if it

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.300 
error you'll bolt it in there and if it
sounds<00:02:21.050> like<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.170> sick<00:02:21.440> duck<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.980> kind<00:02:22.220> of

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
sounds like a sick duck you kind of

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.400 
sounds like a sick duck you kind of
changed<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.730> position<00:02:23.050> tweak<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.200> Brak<00:02:24.380> a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
changed the position tweak the Brak a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.979 
changed the position tweak the Brak a
little<00:02:24.650> bit<00:02:24.739> more<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.489> it's<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.390> horns<00:02:26.870> not

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
little bit more so it's the horns not

little bit more so it's the horns not

right I'm gonna go ahead and pop this in

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.210 
right I'm gonna go ahead and pop this in

a hook up the two electrical connections
to<00:02:34.810> these<00:02:35.810> two<00:02:35.989> guys<00:02:36.140> here<00:02:36.440> normally<00:02:37.400> I'd<00:02:37.459> use

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
to these two guys here normally I'd use

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.440 
to these two guys here normally I'd use
a<00:02:37.670> two<00:02:38.540> male<00:02:39.489> quarter-inch<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.730> quick

a two male quarter-inch of quick

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.990 
a two male quarter-inch of quick
connects<00:02:41.780> since<00:02:42.050> if<00:02:42.200> these<00:02:43.160> are<00:02:43.310> displaces

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
connects since if these are displaces

connects since if these are displaces
all<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.270> have<00:02:44.540> here<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:45.680> spot<00:02:46.069> but<00:02:46.400> we'll<00:02:46.849> go

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
all I have here on spot but we'll go

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.760 
all I have here on spot but we'll go
ahead<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.090> install<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.599> have<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.560> horn

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
ahead and install that have the horn

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.070 
ahead and install that have the horn
installed<00:02:49.190> right<00:02:49.819> now<00:02:49.970> I'm<00:02:50.480> gonna<00:02:50.660> honk<00:02:50.900> it

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
installed right now I'm gonna honk it

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.270 
installed right now I'm gonna honk it
it's<00:02:51.230> gonna<00:02:51.319> sound<00:02:51.500> like<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.860> sick<00:02:52.069> duck

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
it's gonna sound like the sick duck

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.390 
it's gonna sound like the sick duck
noise<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.410> reason<00:02:54.739> being<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.160> actually

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
noise and the reason being is actually

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.790 
noise and the reason being is actually
the<00:02:55.849> horns<00:02:56.390> making<00:02:56.660> physical<00:02:56.810> contact<00:02:57.110> here

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
the horns making physical contact here

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.589 
the horns making physical contact here
and<00:02:58.069> again<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.640> just<00:02:58.670> all<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.239> got<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.420> do<00:02:59.480> is

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
and again you just all you got to do is

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.720 
and again you just all you got to do is
like<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.780> little<00:03:00.080> tweak<00:03:00.319> tweak<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.310> bracket

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
like a little tweak tweak of the bracket

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.229 
like a little tweak tweak of the bracket
the<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.360> kind<00:03:02.569> of<00:03:02.629> get<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.930> where<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:04.519> doesn't

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
the the kind of get it where it doesn't

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.979 
the the kind of get it where it doesn't
make<00:03:05.390> physical<00:03:05.690> contact<00:03:06.379> with<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:08.300> frame<00:03:08.540> you

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
make physical contact with the frame you

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.020 
make physical contact with the frame you
know<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.230> basically<00:03:09.980> kind<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.640> check<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.910> out

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
know and basically kind of check it out

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.290 
know and basically kind of check it out
see<00:03:11.270> if<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.480> works<00:03:12.040> now<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.130> sounds<00:03:13.250> good

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
see if that works now it sounds good

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.880 
see if that works now it sounds good
it's<00:03:14.360> not<00:03:14.480> making<00:03:14.690> any<00:03:14.870> physical<00:03:15.290> contact<00:03:15.740> to

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
it's not making any physical contact to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.190 
it's not making any physical contact to
the<00:03:16.010> frame<00:03:16.220> right<00:03:16.430> there<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:17.300> now<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:17.990> I<00:03:18.020> got

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
the frame right there so now that I got

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.260 
the frame right there so now that I got
in<00:03:18.290> spot<00:03:18.560> wires<00:03:19.310> are<00:03:19.550> all<00:03:19.670> routed<00:03:20.030> I'll<00:03:20.120> go

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
in spot wires are all routed I'll go

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.600 
in spot wires are all routed I'll go
ahead<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.480> tighten<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:22.220> bolt<00:03:22.460> that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
ahead and tighten the the bolt that
