00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.030
 and hello everyone guys with you danchik and 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.969
 today i ran into such a problem 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.670
 I wanted to create an assembly at 172 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.850
 could not find a minimap that is for 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.710
 minecraft 1 7 2 found rei's minimap but 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.689
 the fact is that it is not installed 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:29.480
 folder mods for ja exactly in the root 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.480
 which set the folder is decided 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.180
 root itself 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.520
 version 1 7 2 there fits me this 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.010
 did not arrange as I need under forge 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 since I have a lot of mods and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.210
 I basically found pretty 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.949
 A good alternative if anyone 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 interesting I thought it would be this video by years 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:00.960
 we put myself mod on Yandex drive from here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 download it I think no one has it 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.510
 the difficulty will not cause open archive 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.510
 pull out the mod itself 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:21.060
 cut out go to the root folder mods and 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.790
 I throw it there before you 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.740
 must stand forge on one character where 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.190
 you can download it as you can 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.380
 watch video on my channel 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.810
 expert if I do not forget to put it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.330
 Annotation is not everything, and in principle we include 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.780
 maynkravt or launch minecraft 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:47.520
 how to like a little like 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.920
 say the passage on the assembly in will give 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.140
 us craft series will be coming out through 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.909
 day of Skin that is not every day, and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.420
 in a day I may not live in two 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.210
 I ask you to understand, too 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.600
 launch craft minecraft 1 7 2 ford 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.049
 but again I can repeat 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.180
 video about the fort think everything said here 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.280
 our minecraft itself became 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.070
 mods can by the way the tank handled 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.250
 now mod mod can be pressed quietly 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.220
 before I crashed mine craft everywhere 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.010
 maxell map 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:30.180
 I remember that same dance 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.959
 mini mat let's go star with the test 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.959
 and the world created 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.959
 we go in principle all pretty 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.599
 I see this is a cheap cat that immediately 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.750
 flies away when the amount is set 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.209
 let's go over the settings 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.870
 let's not go deep in here 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.390
 so intuitively push 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.610
 English im or s like 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.099
 like if you used to play on 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.040
 lynx pappy I do not know that you have 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.500
 will not suit see all that 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.230
 shows these horses and so on 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.049
 all this can be disabled in the settings 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:17.720
 There is in principle do the same that 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:21.590
 and Lynx displays coordinates minimap 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.170
 can hide the map location on the left 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.180
 top right and so on that the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.750
 main lana on for all settings on 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.629
 Russian language is very cool 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.150
 enable square card as far as 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.970
 more convenient there is also not possible to enable it 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.220
 would just be T-shirts or marks or T-shirts 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:48.079
 size signs pickles big little 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.660
 I do not know what it is to include 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.569
 caves mode pretty cool I 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.849
 option when you will if enabled 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.019
 when you will be in the caves he 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:02.269
 will show you all highlighted 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.769
 areas of the cave where you were pretty 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.540
 cool i am crap details 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.019
 performance is not here but themselves 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.510
 look at it as I understand it to configure 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.910
 for the weak so far these lighthouses and so 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.359
 further like that what shirts 6 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.870
 show that is when leaving the label 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:25.160
 leave a label in english b or and 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.010
 Russian write some text click 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.280
 ready and actually this very lighthouse itself 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.610
 beats and as for the first block down so 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:39.050
 and don't know how high up to 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.240
 the horse that is and now now 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.930
 let's go further on the settings go 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.660
 at the construction site of the radar 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.729
 radar on off it shows 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.680
 all mapping which is here then 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.880
 there is if you turn off you will have one 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.820
 same rei's minimap 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.820
 can also customize more subtle 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.780
 turns on and off friendly 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.970
 mobs enable / disable players 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.280
 show do not show helmets and so 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.870
 further and the like but very thin 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.000
 setting up someone individually 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.940
 enable full or disable ie 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.080
 Skeletons of slugs and zones nor scales are you 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.729
 further the like is also possible here 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.270
 all connect although you can do 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:29.310
 it's just like that 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.169
 markers are the most basic privilege of this 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.229
 fashion is what is possible 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.080
 teleport to a certain point 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:39.509
 that is, if we put an end more 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.039
 somewhere here let 's write let 's say mother 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:47.039
 23 click ready click click markers 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.590
 select this point and teleport 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.409
 on this point and choose one potali 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:57.780
 teleports to pretty too 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:06:00.510
 funny how something so basically everything on 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.669
