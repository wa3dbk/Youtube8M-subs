people have been really excited to play
this<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.799> I<00:01:09.829> think<00:01:10.069> that<00:01:10.189> God<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.459> War<00:01:10.639> has

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
this and I think that God of War has

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.510 
this and I think that God of War has
gotten<00:01:11.060> kind<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.299> an<00:01:11.420> n<00:01:12.189> reaction<00:01:13.189> from<00:01:13.310> people

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
gotten kind of an n reaction from people

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.819 
gotten kind of an n reaction from people
and<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:14.450> in<00:01:14.600> terms<00:01:14.719> of<00:01:14.869> interest<00:01:15.380> even<00:01:15.529> not

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
and just in terms of interest even not

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.440 
and just in terms of interest even not
even<00:01:15.859> in<00:01:16.189> playing<00:01:16.490> it's<00:01:16.909> not<00:01:16.999> that<00:01:17.119> people<00:01:17.209> are

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
even in playing it's not that people are

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.279 
even in playing it's not that people are
thinking<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:17.779> it's<00:01:17.869> gonna<00:01:17.990> be<00:01:18.139> like

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
thinking that it's gonna be like

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.469 
thinking that it's gonna be like
terrible<00:01:18.950> but<00:01:19.579> you<00:01:19.819> know<00:01:19.939> there's<00:01:20.119> kind<00:01:20.359> of<00:01:20.389> a

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
terrible but you know there's kind of a

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.179 
terrible but you know there's kind of a
general<00:01:20.749> malaise<00:01:21.200> people<00:01:21.859> aren't<00:01:22.069> really

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
general malaise people aren't really

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.730 
general malaise people aren't really
excited<00:01:23.029> to<00:01:23.179> buy<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:23.840> if<00:01:23.959> they<00:01:24.109> had<00:01:24.499> it

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
excited to buy it but if they had it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.559 
excited to buy it but if they had it
they<00:01:24.770> play<00:01:25.369> it<00:01:25.609> so<00:01:25.969> makes<00:01:26.179> sense<00:01:26.389> that<00:01:26.539> they

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
they play it so makes sense that they

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.330 
they play it so makes sense that they
would<00:01:26.659> encourage<00:01:27.079> you<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.289> buy<00:01:27.499> this<00:01:27.560> game<00:01:28.009> and

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
would encourage you to buy this game and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.190 
would encourage you to buy this game and
then<00:01:28.759> be<00:01:28.909> able<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.179> play<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.539> demo<00:01:29.719> it's<00:01:30.049> like

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
then be able to play the demo it's like

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.929 
then be able to play the demo it's like
that<00:01:30.349> added<00:01:30.560> little<00:01:31.069> bonus<00:01:31.579> that<00:01:31.759> add<00:01:31.909> a

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
that added little bonus that add a

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.879 
that added little bonus that add a
little<00:01:32.209> push<00:01:32.599> to<00:01:32.630> maybe<00:01:33.049> get<00:01:33.409> you<00:01:33.560> interested

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:33.889

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
same patch if one is going to be

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.199 
same patch if one is going to be
addressed<00:03:33.920> first<00:03:34.160> it's<00:03:34.700> going<00:03:34.850> to<00:03:34.880> be<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.030> dress

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
addressed first it's going to be a dress

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.860 
addressed first it's going to be a dress
second<00:03:35.600> not<00:03:36.410> sure<00:03:36.709> but<00:03:37.040> they<00:03:37.190> do<00:03:37.300> know<00:03:38.300> it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
second not sure but they do know it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.740 
second not sure but they do know it
happens<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:40.550> that's<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.970> start<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.510> don't<00:03:41.690> know

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
happens so that's a start I don't know

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.000 
happens so that's a start I don't know
it<00:03:41.900> makes<00:03:42.019> sense<00:03:42.230> while<00:03:42.530> all<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.769> these<00:03:42.890> other

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
it makes sense while all of these other

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.310 
it makes sense while all of these other
games<00:03:43.370> are<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:44.000> know<00:03:44.150> scheduled<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.080> come<00:03:45.260> out

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
games are you know scheduled to come out

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.740 
games are you know scheduled to come out
but<00:03:45.680> not<00:03:45.950> out<00:03:46.220> yet<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:47.300> is<00:03:47.420> something<00:03:47.660> that

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
but not out yet this is something that

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.540 
but not out yet this is something that
they<00:03:47.870> can<00:03:47.989> address<00:03:48.170> now<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:49.160> is<00:03:49.340> something

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
they can address now this is something

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.040 
they can address now this is something
that<00:03:49.790> they<00:03:49.940> can<00:03:50.090> look<00:03:50.269> at<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.630> say<00:03:50.810> alright

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
that they can look at and say alright

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.040 
that they can look at and say alright
let's<00:03:51.769> make<00:03:52.100> this<00:03:52.340> system<00:03:52.780> easier<00:03:53.780> for<00:03:53.959> people

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
let's make this system easier for people

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.780 
let's make this system easier for people
to<00:03:54.200> interact<00:03:54.470> with<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.070> also<00:03:55.400> now<00:03:55.550> we<00:03:55.610> have

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
to interact with and also now we have

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.600 
to interact with and also now we have
all<00:03:56.060> of<00:03:56.360> this<00:03:56.540> data<00:03:56.900> about<00:03:57.739> how<00:03:58.100> people<00:03:58.370> are

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610

using the
we<00:03:59.200> use<00:03:59.410> which<00:03:59.650> helps<00:03:59.920> a<00:04:00.010> lot<00:04:00.160> is<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.610> there

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
we use which helps a lot is that there

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.460 
we use which helps a lot is that there
actually<00:04:00.760> aren't<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.330> many<00:04:01.510> games<00:04:01.840> out<00:04:02.020> yet
