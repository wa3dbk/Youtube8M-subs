00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
research a little bit and I saw these a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.000 
research a little bit and I saw these a
bunch<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.900> decided<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.410> wanted<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> try<00:00:22.980> it

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
bunch and I decided I wanted to try it

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.730 
bunch and I decided I wanted to try it
for<00:00:23.279> myself<00:00:23.510> I'm<00:00:24.510> not<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.439> hundred

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
for myself I'm not like a hundred

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.730 
for myself I'm not like a hundred
percent<00:00:26.099> happy<00:00:26.910> with<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.480> outcome<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.439> I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
percent happy with the outcome but I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.950 
percent happy with the outcome but I
still<00:00:29.369> think<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.699> looks<00:00:29.880> really<00:00:30.119> cool<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
still think it looks really cool and I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.020 
still think it looks really cool and I
think<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.500> actually<00:00:32.009> easy<00:00:32.250> enough<00:00:32.640> so

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
think that it's actually easy enough so

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.690 
think that it's actually easy enough so

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
unikitty you want to put a base layer of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.689 
unikitty you want to put a base layer of
white<00:00:51.780> down<00:00:54.110> for<00:00:55.110> unikitty<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
