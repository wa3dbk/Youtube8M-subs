supreme interest in biology I would tell

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.400 
supreme interest in biology I would tell
them<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:51.270> eyes<00:00:51.480> take<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:51.960> light

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
them this as your eyes take in light

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.100 
them this as your eyes take in light
that<00:00:52.890> light<00:00:53.250> hits<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.730> photoreceptors<00:00:54.539> that

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
that light hits your photoreceptors that

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.080 
that light hits your photoreceptors that
light<00:00:55.410> signal<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:56.100> travels<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.699> your<00:00:56.820> brain

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
light signal then travels to your brain

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
light signal then travels to your brain
which<00:00:57.539> processes<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.340> how<00:00:59.460> we

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
which processes it and that is how we

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.029 
which processes it and that is how we
see<00:00:59.850> Pikachu<00:01:00.719> run<00:01:00.930> helps<00:01:01.230> convert<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.770> light

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
see Pikachu run helps convert that light

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.340 
see Pikachu run helps convert that light
into<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> sort<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.789> electrical<00:01:03.539> energy<00:01:03.690> which

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
into a sort of electrical energy which

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.410 
into a sort of electrical energy which
the<00:01:04.530> brain<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.129> understand<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the brain can then understand and that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.289 
the brain can then understand and that
explanation<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.189> much<00:01:08.490> simpler

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
explanation is so much simpler

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.080 
explanation is so much simpler
Pikachu<00:01:09.750> Lauren<00:01:09.990> isn't<00:01:10.200> required<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.220> see<00:01:11.460> nor

Pikachu Lauren isn't required to see nor
is<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> only<00:01:12.689> protein<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.170> does<00:01:13.380> this

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
is it the only protein that does this

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770 
is it the only protein that does this
job<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> does<00:01:14.490> play<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> big<00:01:15.030> part<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
job but it does play a big part of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
job but it does play a big part of
helping<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.830> Thank<00:01:17.130> You<00:01:17.189> Pikachu<00:01:17.490> seeing
