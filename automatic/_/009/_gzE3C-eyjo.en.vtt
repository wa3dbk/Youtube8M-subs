00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.150 
time so you have a pretty good idea of
how<00:03:05.280> long<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.700> takes<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.500> kind<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.920> what

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
how long it takes this is kind of what

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.460 
how long it takes this is kind of what
it's<00:03:08.310> doing<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.880> kind<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.209> just<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.660> guess

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
it's doing this is kind of just I guess

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.290 
it's doing this is kind of just I guess
it's<00:03:10.650> regenerating<00:03:11.580> everything<00:03:12.000> because<00:03:12.180> it

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
it's regenerating everything because it

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.140 
it's regenerating everything because it
takes<00:03:12.540> quite<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.870> while<00:03:13.100> before<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.520> comes<00:03:14.850> up

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
takes quite a while before it comes up

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:47.559 
takes quite a while before it comes up
and<00:03:15.330> ask<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.810> for<00:03:15.840> your<00:03:16.110> password

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:57.009 

okay<00:03:48.319> now<00:03:48.620> you've<00:03:48.920> got<00:03:49.189> your<00:03:50.950> icons<00:03:51.950> up<00:03:56.019> click

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
okay now you've got your icons up click

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.809 
okay now you've got your icons up click
on<00:03:57.230> whichever<00:03:57.680> one<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.040> want<00:03:58.159> to<00:03:58.310> do<00:04:00.700> put<00:04:01.700> in

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
on whichever one you want to do put in

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.880 
on whichever one you want to do put in
your<00:04:01.939> password<00:04:03.159> everything<00:04:04.159> comes<00:04:04.400> back<00:04:04.519> up

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
your password everything comes back up

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.849 
your password everything comes back up
okay<00:04:06.890> we're<00:04:07.099> back<00:04:07.280> up<00:04:07.720> we've<00:04:08.720> got<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.260> desktop

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
okay we're back up we've got the desktop

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.759 
okay we're back up we've got the desktop

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.110 
again I have had this happen a couple of
times<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:19.479> uh<00:04:21.009> one<00:04:22.009> time<00:04:22.280> when<00:04:22.639> I<00:04:22.669> brought<00:04:22.970> it

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
back up with this method the icon for

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.740 
back up with this method the icon for
the<00:04:27.169> sound<00:04:28.099> and<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.550> upper<00:04:28.880> dock<00:04:29.150> up<00:04:29.479> in<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
the sound and the upper dock up in the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.260 
the sound and the upper dock up in the
upper<00:04:30.020> right<00:04:30.259> hand<00:04:30.289> side<00:04:30.699> did<00:04:31.699> not<00:04:31.729> come<00:04:32.240> up

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
upper right hand side did not come up

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.189 
upper right hand side did not come up

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
and I had to do another operation to get

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.520 
and I had to do another operation to get
that<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.650> work<00:04:37.419> if<00:04:38.419> it<00:04:38.630> happens<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.199> the

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
that to work if it happens that the

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.129 
that to work if it happens that the
sound<00:04:40.250> icon<00:04:40.490> does<00:04:41.000> not<00:04:41.240> come<00:04:41.509> up<00:04:41.690> when<00:04:42.500> the

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
sound icon does not come up when the

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.420 
sound icon does not come up when the
computer<00:04:45.139> restarts<00:04:46.060> then<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:48.860> need<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.250> do

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
computer restarts then you need to do

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.219 
computer restarts then you need to do
the<00:04:50.169> another<00:04:51.169> restart<00:04:51.680> it's<00:04:52.159> another<00:04:52.400> type<00:04:52.789> of

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
the another restart it's another type of

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.740 
the another restart it's another type of
reset<00:04:54.229> on<00:04:54.440> it<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.909> I<00:04:55.909> will<00:04:56.090> link<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.720> that

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
reset on it and I will link it to that

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.779 
reset on it and I will link it to that
because<00:04:57.199> I've<00:04:57.470> got<00:04:57.680> it<00:04:57.830> on<00:04:57.949> this<00:04:58.070> same<00:04:58.340> channel

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
because I've got it on this same channel

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.390 
because I've got it on this same channel
so<00:04:59.599> that's<00:05:00.020> how<00:05:00.199> to<00:05:00.490> unlock<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:02.479> Mac<00:05:03.250> when<00:05:04.250> the

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
so that's how to unlock the Mac when the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.420 
so that's how to unlock the Mac when the
screen<00:05:04.699> gets<00:05:04.940> locked<00:05:05.180> up<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:05.690> nothing<00:05:06.110> will

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
screen gets locked up and nothing will

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.430 
screen gets locked up and nothing will
