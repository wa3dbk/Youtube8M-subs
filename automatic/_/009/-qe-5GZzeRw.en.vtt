00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
ugly but you can see it that we were

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.740 
ugly but you can see it that we were
kick<00:02:39.620> its<00:02:39.770> butt<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.370> there's<00:02:40.820> only<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.060> 11

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
kick its butt and there's only like 11

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.050

by<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.269> lot<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.170> seems<00:02:45.350> like<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> plan<00:02:45.980> that

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
by a lot so it seems like the plan that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.220 
by a lot so it seems like the plan that
we're<00:02:46.250> attacking<00:02:46.600> isn't<00:02:47.600> very<00:02:47.750> active<00:02:48.110> so

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
we're attacking isn't very active so

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.040 
we're attacking isn't very active so
it's<00:02:48.350> basically<00:02:48.500> what<00:02:49.040> our<00:02:49.190> plan<00:02:49.459> was<00:02:49.870> two<00:02:50.870> or

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
it's basically what our plan was two or

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.530 
it's basically what our plan was two or
three<00:02:51.230> weeks<00:02:51.380> ago<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.190> but<00:02:52.820> yeah<00:02:53.060> let's<00:02:53.510> just

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
three weeks ago so but yeah let's just

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.930

wall<00:03:01.430> breakers<00:03:01.880> again<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.690> only<00:03:02.870> had<00:03:03.080> three

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
wall breakers again I only had three

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.949 
wall breakers again I only had three
which<00:03:03.650> was<00:03:03.800> a<00:03:03.830> huge<00:03:04.130> mistake<00:03:04.959> getting

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
which was a huge mistake getting

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.509 
which was a huge mistake getting
entering<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.590> wall<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:07.190> key<00:03:07.489> to

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
entering to that wall is this key to

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.120 
entering to that wall is this key to
everything<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.320> felt<00:03:09.680> like<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:09.950> should

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
everything and I felt like it should

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.699 
everything and I felt like it should
have<00:03:10.220> tacked<00:03:10.459> more<00:03:10.880> from<00:03:11.150> behind<00:03:11.510> as<00:03:11.930> he's<00:03:12.590> on

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
have tacked more from behind as he's on

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.590 
have tacked more from behind as he's on
the<00:03:12.799> opposite<00:03:13.280> end<00:03:13.400> where<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.670> did<00:03:13.970> good<00:03:14.239> attack

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.009 
the opposite end where I did good attack
just<00:03:14.959> do<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.320> fact<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.709> amount<00:03:16.579> of

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019

of winning here i wish there was a
little<00:04:07.280> more<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:08.000> a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
little more of a

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.970 
little more of a
controlling<00:04:10.120> base<00:04:10.390> basically<00:04:11.050> just<00:04:11.650> throwing

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
controlling base basically just throwing

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.860 
controlling base basically just throwing
them<00:04:12.070> down<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.520> then<00:04:12.640> saying<00:04:13.060> good<00:04:13.180> luck<00:04:13.480> here
