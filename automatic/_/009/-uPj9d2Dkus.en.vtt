fiberglass<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.180> reworked<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> couple

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
fiberglass and reworked it a couple

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.320 
fiberglass and reworked it a couple
years<00:00:25.560> ago<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.130> think<00:00:26.789> there's<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.180> little

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
years ago I think there's one little

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.680 
years ago I think there's one little
small<00:00:27.720> gang<00:00:28.050> unit<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:32.579> undercarriage<00:00:33.480> is

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
small gang unit the undercarriage is

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.450 
small gang unit the undercarriage is
there<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> deck<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> deck<00:00:35.280> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
there for the deck it's just the deck is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610 
there for the deck it's just the deck is
missing<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> deck<00:00:36.750> everything

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
missing so if you have a deck everything

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.889 
missing so if you have a deck everything
else<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.950> there<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.190> even<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> belt<00:00:39.059> which

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
else is there I even have the belt which

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.319 
else is there I even have the belt which
I'm<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> include<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:42.120> batteries

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
I'm going to include the batteries

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.119 
I'm going to include the batteries
fairly<00:00:43.050> new<00:00:44.930> includes<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.110> power<00:00:46.379> take-off

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.139 

alright<00:00:50.129> I'm<00:00:50.190> gonna<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.489> ahead<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.700> start<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
alright I'm gonna go ahead and start it

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.600 
alright I'm gonna go ahead and start it
up<00:00:53.780> with<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.989> tractor<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> did<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.309> put

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
up with this tractor what I did is I put

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.900 
up with this tractor what I did is I put
a<00:00:56.910> gas<00:00:57.870> valve<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> reason<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.640> did

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
a gas valve on it and the reason I did

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
a gas valve on it and the reason I did
that<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.510> because<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.050> carb<00:01:01.320> leaked<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that was because the carb leaked a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.600 
that was because the carb leaked a
little<00:01:01.949> bit<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.699> every<00:01:03.090> time<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
little bit so what I do every time is I

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.660 
little bit so what I do every time is I
cut<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> gas<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.600> shut<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.930> off<00:01:07.670> okay

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
cut the gas off when I shut it off okay

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.630 
cut the gas off when I shut it off okay
now<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.090> start<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.630> I'm<00:01:09.720> gonna<00:01:09.900> choke<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:26.260 

okay<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:15.820> must<00:01:15.970> have<00:01:16.210> enough<00:01:16.479> fuel<00:01:16.720> much<00:01:17.140> okay

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.480 

right<00:01:26.540> now<00:01:26.720> it's<00:01:26.930> charging

I<00:02:43.450> drove<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.440> clutch<00:02:44.800> was<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.070> little<00:02:45.400> weak

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
I drove it the clutch was a little weak

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.480 
I drove it the clutch was a little weak
however<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.390> was<00:02:46.630> able<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.900> load<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.230> onto<00:02:47.490> the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
however I was able to load it onto the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.699 
however I was able to load it onto the
trailer<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.140> think<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:50.530> going<00:02:50.680> to

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
trailer so but I think it's going to

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.310 
trailer so but I think it's going to
need<00:02:50.860> some<00:02:50.920> attention<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.660> also<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
need some attention and also the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.760 
need some attention and also the
charging<00:02:53.770> system<00:02:54.959> sometimes<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.320> charges

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
charging system sometimes the charges

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.220 
charging system sometimes the charges
sometimes<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.370> doesn't<00:02:57.850> have<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.870> looked<00:02:59.050> at

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
sometimes it doesn't have it looked at

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.020 
sometimes it doesn't have it looked at
it<00:02:59.380> but<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> last<00:02:59.770> time<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.070> was<00:03:00.310> running<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.820> I

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
it but the last time I was running it I

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.060 
it but the last time I was running it I
got<00:03:01.690> halfway<00:03:01.900> done<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.440> cutting<00:03:02.740> job

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
got halfway done with the cutting job

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.260
