00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.020 

I<00:01:48.350> think<00:01:49.220> that<00:01:49.280> people<00:01:49.670> like<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.910> play

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
I think that people like to play

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.000 
I think that people like to play
multiplayer<00:01:50.360> because<00:01:51.170> human<00:01:51.440> players<00:01:51.650> react

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
multiplayer because human players react

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.230 
multiplayer because human players react
in<00:01:52.190> ways<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.400> are<00:01:52.610> surprising<00:01:52.700> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
in ways that are surprising and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.570 
in ways that are surprising and
unpredictable<00:01:53.750> than<00:01:53.930> compared<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.590> of

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
unpredictable than compared to a I of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.950 
unpredictable than compared to a I of
course<00:01:55.760> playing<00:01:56.150> with<00:01:56.300> other<00:01:56.480> players<00:01:56.690> is

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
course playing with other players is

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.910 
course playing with other players is
also<00:01:57.320> very<00:01:57.440> good<00:01:57.560> as<00:01:57.770> well<00:01:59.560> capcom<00:02:00.560> has<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.740> game

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
also very good as well capcom has a game

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.160 
also very good as well capcom has a game
engine<00:02:01.100> called<00:02:01.430> Mt<00:02:01.700> framework<00:02:02.450> which<00:02:03.020> has

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
engine called Mt framework which has

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.170

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.210 
recently been updated to those who 2.0
so<00:02:06.110> creating<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.620> game<00:02:06.650> for<00:02:06.890> multiple

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
so creating the game for multiple

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.550 
so creating the game for multiple
platforms<00:02:07.370> have<00:02:07.760> been<00:02:07.910> very<00:02:08.090> easy<00:02:08.560> however

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
platforms have been very easy however

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.590 
platforms have been very easy however
technology<00:02:10.220> advancement<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:10.759> PCs<00:02:11.210> is<00:02:11.390> much

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
technology advancement on PCs is much

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.630 
technology advancement on PCs is much
quicker<00:02:11.840> than<00:02:12.050> on<00:02:12.170> consoles<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.310> pc

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
quicker than on consoles so the pc

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.910 
quicker than on consoles so the pc
release<00:02:13.820> may<00:02:14.120> be<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.300> little<00:02:14.450> later<00:02:14.750> as<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.740> want
