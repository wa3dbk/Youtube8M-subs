00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.500
 hi guys welcome to the first 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.860
 2013 program to configure equipment 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.810
 puntocom is Wednesday and like every week 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.419
 we bring you a selection of applications 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.360
 and games that we want you to see about 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.940
 windows 8 so we're going to make way for 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.080
 this report that will undoubtedly 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.080
 love we start 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.750
 good guys are already some 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.450
 programs on windows 8 that we have 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.370
 published and to be honest is the 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.120
 first application on photography 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.560
 decent that we found in this time 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.379
 photos is the name of this tool 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.320
 who will undoubtedly appreciate that they have 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.510
 done with a tablet in windows rt since 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.670
 the rest can at least continue using 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.989
 the typical desktop programs like 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.989
 photoshop or others 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.630
 what said photo is an application of 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.570
 Metro style that arrives to be placed in 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.100
 the first positions of his class 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.740
 basically what we find is a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.200
 catalog of adjustments and effects similar to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.140
 of very popular applications on android 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.960
 or years like black and white spine effects 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.370
 bullets edges blur effects 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.370
 adjustable and others 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.340
 Within each effect we find 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.250
 very good variations with results 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.680
 different but also what else we 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.960
 like of photos is that it allows 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.140
 let's modify the basic controls of 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.210
 image to find the perfect scene 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.390
 Saturation contrast brightness 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.880
 dye temperature I assure you that in 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.580
 few minutes your photos will be seen 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.250
 incredible and everything from an application 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.729
 designed primarily to work with 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.729
 tablet 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.090
 one of the most peculiar characters 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.990
 important of the series of drawings 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.470
 animated 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.700
 phineas and ferb is the perry platypus 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.650
 besides appearing in a version 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.200
 special of the game where is my water 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.230
 this character stars in his own 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.580
 game in windows 8 they have called the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.580
 empire strikes back 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.650
 well while maintaining the aesthetic that 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.660
 surrounded series of drawings in the impi 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.850
 we will have to complete a series of 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.030
 levels collecting objects from the stage 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.550
 that will give us money how many are more 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.280
 collect more score we will get 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.870
 although time also plays its great 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.720
 paper here 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.150
 if you play from a PC the keys of 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.430
 address or they will serve to move you and the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.860
 space to shoot since often 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.409
 we will find robots directed by 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.650
 humans who will try to stop our 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.650
 mission 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.930
 the embi strike back is a basic game and 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.970
 with a classic dynamic in the world 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.790
 but that ends up hooking 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.660
 Anyone who puts himself in front of him prove it 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.660
 and you tell us 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.409
 i 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.080
 we continue with the proposals for windows 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.750
 8 this week and this time 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.180
 we will show you write a title of those 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.310
 that serve to challenge oneself or 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.300
 get into a tense pique with some 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.300
 family or friend 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.260
 is kylie is a game in which the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.030
 goal is to get out of a container 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.540
 in the least number of interventions 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.290
 possible to some rubber balls always 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.519
 we will have to keep that premise in mind 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.879
 regardless of how difficult it is 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.370
 put it on each level complicates us the most 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.920
 mission and is that each ball can not be 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.230
 move by itself that is to say 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.909
 put them together and make it go out we have to 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.760
 tilt the container towards different 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.549
 sides to take them to the areas of 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.039
 exit but be careful because every time 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.039
 you have will be marking a movement or 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:27.970
 intervention and therefore subtracting points 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:30.430
 to your game at the end is kylie is not 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.260
 based as much on achieving the objective as 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.780
 in the amount of times you have to 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.970
 intervene to do it and that's where 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.130
 everyone will have to demonstrate their 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.669
 skill or intelligence to be able 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.669
 win 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.000
 we ended up in this week's section 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.090
 about applications and games for windows 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.910
 8 with stands a title that comes from 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.340
 other platforms like android where has 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.900
 Featured as an entertaining game 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.900
 of the most addictive 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.240
 in stands the goal is to complete 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.880
 levels making the protagonist 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.590
 climbed on your snowboard come 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.010
 at the end of the track in the shortest time 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.320
 possible clear is that as in any 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.300
 platform game the score that 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.180
 get while we make the journey 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.790
 it will be crucial to place ourselves in the 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.280
 podium 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.490
 in are we will earn points doing 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.680
 pirouettes postures in the air all these 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.290
 points we can redeem later 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.350
 for improvements new movements in clothes 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.570
 let's say that physics are not all 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.300
 real than in other games but maybe 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.460
 that is the appeal of they are already 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.390
 each jump allows us to do tricks 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.390
 impossible 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.889
 with his carefree look is so is 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.530
 everything a success in the platform to which 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.840
 comes so we recommend you guys 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.840
