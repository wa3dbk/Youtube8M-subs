00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
when dropped because we barely got

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.640

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
enough time to get our full shot motion

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.650 
enough time to get our full shot motion
off<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.010> looking<00:04:04.550> back<00:04:04.730> at<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.060> replay<00:04:05.270> we

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
off and looking back at the replay we

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.480 
off and looking back at the replay we
really<00:04:05.960> didn't<00:04:06.230> get<00:04:06.320> into<00:04:06.500> our<00:04:06.770> shop<00:04:07.010> motion

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
really didn't get into our shop motion

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.370 
really didn't get into our shop motion
we<00:04:07.610> kind<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.850> just<00:04:08.000> checked<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.450> up<00:04:08.570> there<00:04:08.840> with

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
we kind of just checked it up there with

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.410 
we kind of just checked it up there with
just<00:04:09.740> enough<00:04:09.950> time<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.400> spare<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:11.060> beat<00:04:11.270> the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
just enough time to spare to beat the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.870 
just enough time to spare to beat the
shot<00:04:11.690> clock<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.230> we<00:04:12.709> ended<00:04:13.010> up<00:04:13.130> cashing<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.760> in

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
shot clock and we ended up cashing it in

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.120 
shot clock and we ended up cashing it in
so<00:04:14.420> we'll<00:04:14.630> take<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.440> don't<00:04:15.830> know<00:04:15.920> how<00:04:16.100> many

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
so we'll take that I don't know how many

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.860 
so we'll take that I don't know how many
more<00:04:16.489> buzzer<00:04:16.790> beaters<00:04:17.150> like<00:04:17.330> that<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.720> guys

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
why you guys saw so many replays that by

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.140 
why you guys saw so many replays that by

doesn't<00:04:30.240> really<00:04:30.570> matter<00:04:30.810> because<00:04:30.960> we<00:04:31.169> pull<00:04:31.380> up

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
doesn't really matter because we pull up

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
for my teammates now I don't know what

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.400 
for my teammates now I don't know what
this<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.520> about<00:04:53.789> but<00:04:53.970> why<00:04:54.479> am<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.750> missing<00:04:54.990> so

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
this is about but why am I missing so

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.650 
this is about but why am I missing so
many<00:04:55.590> layups<00:04:55.949> right<00:04:56.400> now<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.850> yes<00:04:57.300> on<00:04:57.510> that

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
many layups right now and yes on that

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.450 
many layups right now and yes on that
shot<00:04:57.930> there<00:04:58.199> was<00:04:58.229> defensive<00:04:58.919> pressure<00:04:59.160> there

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
shot there was defensive pressure there

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.400 
shot there was defensive pressure there
so<00:04:59.639> maybe<00:04:59.820> that's<00:05:00.090> why<00:05:00.240> I<00:05:00.270> missed<00:05:00.539> a<00:05:00.660> shot<00:05:00.870> but

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
so maybe that's why I missed a shot but

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.140 
so maybe that's why I missed a shot but

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
left hand and I'm not sure why he went a

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.320 
left hand and I'm not sure why he went a
left<00:05:40.860> handed<00:05:41.190> them<00:05:41.370> right<00:05:41.669> hand<00:05:41.909> it<00:05:42.060> seemed

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
left handed them right hand it seemed

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.850 
left handed them right hand it seemed
like<00:05:42.510> it<00:05:42.659> was<00:05:42.780> a<00:05:42.810> better<00:05:43.050> option<00:05:43.289> at<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.650> time

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
like it was a better option at the time

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.950 
like it was a better option at the time
but<00:05:44.490> anyways<00:05:44.880> it's<00:05:45.150> still<00:05:45.330> two<00:05:45.479> points<00:05:45.840> and

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
but anyways it's still two points and

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.810 
but anyways it's still two points and
we'll<00:05:46.050> take<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.409> score<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:46.889> no<00:05:47.280> Horford<00:05:47.610> is

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
we'll take the score and no Horford is

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.310 
we'll take the score and no Horford is
not<00:05:48.030> making<00:05:48.419> that<00:05:48.479> let's<00:05:48.720> go<00:05:48.900> give<00:05:49.139> me<00:05:49.199> that

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
not making that let's go give me that

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.320 
not making that let's go give me that
board<00:05:49.620> a<00:05:49.830> score<00:05:50.400> here<00:05:50.610> could<00:05:50.760> almost<00:05:50.970> put<00:05:51.210> the

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
board a score here could almost put the

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.089 
board a score here could almost put the
game<00:05:51.510> out<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.750> reach<00:05:51.840> I<00:05:52.229> pass<00:05:52.590> it<00:05:52.770> over<00:05:52.949> to<00:05:52.979> a

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
game out of reach I pass it over to a

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.529 
game out of reach I pass it over to a
reason<00:05:53.460> he<00:05:53.550> elevates<00:05:53.970> for<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.180> 8-foot<00:05:54.510> jump

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
reason he elevates for the 8-foot jump

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.320 
reason he elevates for the 8-foot jump
shot<00:05:54.990> at<00:05:55.110> buries<00:05:55.560> it<00:05:55.680> in<00:05:55.770> transition<00:05:56.430> let's<00:05:57.000> go

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
shot at buries it in transition let's go

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.469 
shot at buries it in transition let's go
so<00:05:57.930> we're<00:05:58.110> moving<00:05:58.229> things<00:05:58.590> ahead<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:58.860> bit<00:05:59.070> 89<00:05:59.789> 87

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
so we're moving things ahead a bit 89 87

attack going up strong with the
left-handed<00:06:09.270> layup<00:06:09.630> there<00:06:09.990> was<00:06:10.080> a<00:06:10.139> little<00:06:10.349> bit

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
left-handed layup there was a little bit

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.779 
left-handed layup there was a little bit
of<00:06:10.530> contact<00:06:10.949> there<00:06:11.070> i<00:06:11.190> probably<00:06:11.460> should<00:06:11.729> have
