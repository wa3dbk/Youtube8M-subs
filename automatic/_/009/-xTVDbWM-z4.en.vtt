repair<00:00:04.500> in<00:00:04.680> Austin<00:00:04.859> Texas<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.819> today<00:00:05.910> I'm

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
repair in Austin Texas and today I'm

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.720 
repair in Austin Texas and today I'm
going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:06.810> talking<00:00:07.049> about<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.710> windows<00:00:08.280> 7

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
going to be talking about the windows 7

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.910 
going to be talking about the windows 7
display<00:00:09.179> properties<00:00:09.719> we're<00:00:10.380> going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.800> be

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
display properties we're going to be

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.820 
display properties we're going to be
setting<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.370> two<00:00:11.960> external<00:00:12.960> monitors<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.769> you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
setting up two external monitors so you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.589 
setting up two external monitors so you
can<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.219> multiple<00:00:14.460> displays<00:00:15.089> or<00:00:15.450> an

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
can have multiple displays or an

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.650 
can have multiple displays or an
extended<00:00:15.929> desktop<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.980> let's<00:00:17.369> begin<00:00:17.630> before<00:00:18.630> I

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
extended desktop so let's begin before I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.090 
extended desktop so let's begin before I
go<00:00:18.810> any<00:00:18.930> further<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.260> want<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.470> explain<00:00:19.770> that

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
go any further I want to explain that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.609 
go any further I want to explain that
this<00:00:20.400> tutorial<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.060> very<00:00:21.119> similar<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.960> Windows

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
this tutorial is very similar to Windows

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.220 
this tutorial is very similar to Windows
XP<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.340> Windows<00:00:23.730> Vista<00:00:23.760> operating<00:00:24.269> systems

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
XP and Windows Vista operating systems

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.470 
XP and Windows Vista operating systems
it's<00:00:26.010> all<00:00:26.310> generally<00:00:26.880> within<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> same<00:00:27.449> area

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
it's all generally within the same area

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.389 
it's all generally within the same area
so<00:00:28.019> once<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.920> screen<00:00:30.109> a<00:00:31.399> screen

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so once you get to this screen a screen

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.280 
so once you get to this screen a screen
settings<00:00:32.850> you'll<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.120> able<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.420> figure<00:00:34.079> out

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
settings you'll be able to figure out

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.560 
settings you'll be able to figure out
exactly<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.460> need<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.180> get<00:00:36.329> this

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
exactly what you need to do to get this

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.630 
exactly what you need to do to get this
all<00:00:36.719> working<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.280> I'm<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
all working for you so I'm going to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.389 
all working for you so I'm going to
assume<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.899> dual<00:00:40.559> head<00:00:40.590> card

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
assume that you have a dual head card

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.950 
assume that you have a dual head card
which<00:00:41.940> means<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.450> has<00:00:43.370> dual<00:00:44.370> output<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.090> VGA<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
which means it has dual output a VGA and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.040 
which means it has dual output a VGA and
DVI<00:00:46.170> or<00:00:46.559> VGA<00:00:46.890> HDMI<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:48.300> whatever<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> output

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
DVI or VGA HDMI or whatever the output

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.389 
DVI or VGA HDMI or whatever the output
is<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> assume<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.250> have

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
is but I'm going to assume that you have

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.540 
is but I'm going to assume that you have
a<00:00:50.430> dual<00:00:50.760> output<00:00:51.239> card<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.309> two

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
a dual output card and that you have two

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.340 
a dual output card and that you have two
monitors<00:00:53.760> already<00:00:54.390> set<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.660> already<00:00:54.989> plugged

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
monitors already set up already plugged

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.840 
monitors already set up already plugged
in<00:00:55.500> already<00:00:55.680> configured<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.340> let's<00:00:56.489> assume

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
in already configured so let's assume

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.069 
in already configured so let's assume
that<00:00:56.910> that's<00:00:57.210> already<00:00:57.420> been<00:00:57.570> taken<00:00:57.870> care<00:00:58.050> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that that's already been taken care of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.299 
that that's already been taken care of
and<00:00:58.410> let's<00:00:58.710> assume<00:00:58.829> you've<00:00:59.219> already

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and let's assume you've already

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
and let's assume you've already
installed<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.789> drivers<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.840> need<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.020> do

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
installed the drivers all we need to do

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
installed the drivers all we need to do
is<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> set<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.309> correctly<00:01:02.430> where

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
is just get it set up correctly where

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
is just get it set up correctly where
screen<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.140> identified<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.799> screen<00:01:05.040> one

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
screen one is identified as screen one

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.560 
screen one is identified as screen one
and<00:01:05.460> screen<00:01:05.880> two<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.260> let's<00:01:07.799> begin<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and screen two so let's begin to get to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600 
and screen two so let's begin to get to
the<00:01:09.720> screen<00:01:09.960> adapter<00:01:10.560> settings<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.490> get

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the screen adapter settings and to get

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.340 
the screen adapter settings and to get
all<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.820> configuration<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
