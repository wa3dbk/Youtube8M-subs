with your mechanics what makes the
camera<00:02:07.399> even<00:02:07.759> more<00:02:08.000> versatile<00:02:08.509> it<00:02:08.780> has<00:02:08.989> a

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
camera even more versatile it has a

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.589 
camera even more versatile it has a
built-in<00:02:09.590> Wi-Fi<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.670> with<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.910> wireless<00:02:11.150> sync

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
built-in Wi-Fi so with the wireless sync

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.479 
built-in Wi-Fi so with the wireless sync
app<00:02:11.750> footage<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.440> be<00:02:12.560> sent<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.040> smartphone

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
app footage can be sent to a smartphone

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.500 
app footage can be sent to a smartphone
or<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.940> tablet

what<00:02:14.900> makes<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.290> cool<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.739> we<00:02:15.950> can<00:02:16.099> set<00:02:16.310> up

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
what makes that cool is we can set up

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.520 
what makes that cool is we can set up

can<00:02:25.730> annotate<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.720> footage<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.290> we<00:02:27.890> can

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
can annotate the footage and we can

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.850 
can annotate the footage and we can
break<00:02:28.280> down<00:02:28.430> your<00:02:28.489> mechanics<00:02:29.209> piece<00:02:29.900> by<00:02:30.109> piece

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.309 

we<00:02:33.860> get<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.190> your<00:02:34.280> balance<00:02:34.730> point<00:02:35.030> here<00:02:35.300> we<00:02:36.290> can

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
we get to your balance point here we can

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.500 
we get to your balance point here we can
even<00:02:36.590> choose<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.920> different<00:02:37.250> color<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:38.209> green

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
even choose a different color the green

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.760 
even choose a different color the green
we<00:02:39.319> can<00:02:39.500> line<00:02:39.770> up<00:02:39.800> your<00:02:40.130> balance<00:02:40.580> point<00:02:41.770> to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
we can line up your balance point to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.290 
we can line up your balance point to
your<00:02:42.920> leg<00:02:43.130> kick<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.550> I'll<00:02:43.790> even<00:02:43.940> show<00:02:44.180> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
your leg kick and I'll even show the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.390 
your leg kick and I'll even show the
degree<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.810> angle<00:02:45.140> down<00:02:45.290> there<00:02:45.590> we<00:02:46.250> can

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
degree of the angle down there we can

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.920 
degree of the angle down there we can
make<00:02:46.550> sure<00:02:46.610> we're<00:02:47.000> at<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.209> position<00:02:47.450> every

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
make sure we're at that position every

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.570 
make sure we're at that position every
time<00:02:48.250> perfect

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.250 

so<00:02:52.580> another<00:02:52.910> thing<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.209> can<00:02:53.450> do<00:02:53.600> is<00:02:53.840> set<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
so another thing we can do is set the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.770 
so another thing we can do is set the
camera<00:02:54.620> with<00:02:54.800> three<00:02:55.130> preset<00:02:55.850> zoom<00:02:56.150> positions

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
camera with three preset zoom positions

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.990 
camera with three preset zoom positions
allowing<00:02:57.560> us<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.830> quickly<00:02:58.160> change<00:02:58.550> from<00:02:58.880> a

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
allowing us to quickly change from a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.229 
allowing us to quickly change from a
wide<00:02:59.239> shot<00:02:59.570> to<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.260> medium<00:03:00.650> shot<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.580> close-up

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.490 

another<00:03:05.239> feature<00:03:05.540> this<00:03:05.810> camera<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
another feature this camera is the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.979 
another feature this camera is the
