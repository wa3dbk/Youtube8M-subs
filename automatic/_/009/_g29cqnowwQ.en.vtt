I've<00:01:05.180> got<00:01:06.180> 1<00:01:06.630> 2<00:01:07.350> 3<00:01:08.189> 4<00:01:09.119> 5<00:01:10.049> 6<00:01:10.799> 7<00:01:11.280> 8<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.990> would

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so that would

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.310 
I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so that would
be<00:01:13.229> 16<00:01:14.189> plus<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> head<00:01:15.360> 17<00:01:15.960> servals<00:01:18.320> so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
be 16 plus the head 17 servals so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.600 
be 16 plus the head 17 servals so
obviously<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.220> able<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
obviously it's going to be able to do a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.179 
obviously it's going to be able to do a
lot<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.880> things<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.420> walking<00:01:21.630> around

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the brackets are made of plastics and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.210 
the brackets are made of plastics and
this<00:01:30.270> looks<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.930> very<00:01:31.140> tough<00:01:31.500> plastics<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
this looks like very tough plastics I

don't<00:01:32.400> think<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.939> break<00:01:33.210> very<00:01:33.240> easily

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
don't think you can break very easily

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.270 
don't think you can break very easily
these<00:01:35.009> ones<00:01:35.369> are<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.259> Olos<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:37.979> small

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
these ones are the Olos one these small

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.490 
these ones are the Olos one these small
ones<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.299> actually<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.200> will

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
ones but this is actually I think will

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
ones but this is actually I think will
be<00:01:40.560> alright<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.159> drop<00:01:41.490> them<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.390> don't

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
be alright if you drop them but don't

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.560 
be alright if you drop them but don't
try<00:01:42.950> if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> got<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.430> 3d<00:01:44.909> printer<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.390> can

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
try if you got a 3d printer you can

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.340 
try if you got a 3d printer you can
definitely<00:01:45.840> make<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.500> yourself<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> back

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
definitely make them yourself so back

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.830 
definitely make them yourself so back
here<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:50.070> got<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.640> Barry's<00:01:51.119> from

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
here you can see got one Barry's from

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590 
here you can see got one Barry's from
battery<00:01:52.200> 2<00:01:52.590> batteries<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
battery 2 batteries here so if the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.359 
battery 2 batteries here so if the
batteries<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.140> charged<00:01:55.409> using<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.920> USB

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
batteries are charged using a USB

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.789 
batteries are charged using a USB
connection<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.329> computer<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> bad

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
connection to the computer so the bad

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.209 
connection to the computer so the bad
results<00:01:59.210> similar<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.509> type<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> battery

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
results similar to this type of battery

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.060 
results similar to this type of battery
so<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.299> charge<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.659> here<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.140> just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
so you can charge it here and just

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.059 
so you can charge it here and just
connect<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.490> together<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.969> pull<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:07.069> so

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
connect it together is pull it out so

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.339 
connect it together is pull it out so
will<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.280> something<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.929> believe

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
will be something like that so I believe

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.470 
will be something like that so I believe
these<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.920> lipos<00:02:11.760> I'm<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.239> sure<00:02:12.450> but

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
these are lipos I'm not sure but

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.449 
these are lipos I'm not sure but
everything's<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:13.989> all<00:02:14.140> these<00:02:14.230> days<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:17.459> to

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
everything's like all these days and to

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.670 
everything's like all these days and to
turn<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.299> on<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.599> off<00:02:19.720> there's<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.379> switch<00:02:20.650> here

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
turn it on and off there's a switch here

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:33.059 
turn it on and off there's a switch here
switch<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.489> on<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.909> go<00:02:26.340> nice<00:02:28.319> okay<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.980> to

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
switch it on you go nice okay so to

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.580 
switch it on you go nice okay so to
control<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.730> robot<00:02:34.269> unlike<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.080> vial<00:02:35.379> of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
control this robot unlike the vial of

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.280 
control this robot unlike the vial of
premium<00:02:36.420> there's<00:02:37.420> some<00:02:37.569> similarities<00:02:38.260> and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
premium there's some similarities and

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.650 
premium there's some similarities and
some<00:02:38.500> difference<00:02:38.980> there<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.610> no<00:02:39.849> remote

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
some difference there is no remote

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.869 
some difference there is no remote
control<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.230> comes<00:02:41.470> with<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.489> robot

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
control that comes with the robot

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.330 
control that comes with the robot
instead<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.780> thing<00:02:44.049> is<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.250> be

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
instead this thing is going to be

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.160 
instead this thing is going to be
controlled<00:02:45.910> using<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.540> Bluetooth<00:02:46.780> module

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
controlled using a Bluetooth module

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.170 
controlled using a Bluetooth module
which<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.680> flown<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:48.129> so<00:02:48.700> if<00:02:48.849> you<00:02:48.970> have<00:02:49.060> an

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
which is flown here so if you have an

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.349 
which is flown here so if you have an
Android<00:02:49.660> mobile<00:02:49.840> phone<00:02:50.319> you<00:02:50.829> can<00:02:51.099> download<00:02:51.730> an

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
Android mobile phone you can download an

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.619 
Android mobile phone you can download an
app<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:53.769> comes<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.099> robotics<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.730> be<00:02:55.569> able

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
app that comes to robotics and be able

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.039 
app that comes to robotics and be able
to<00:02:55.780> control<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:57.250> robot<00:02:57.459> if<00:02:57.910> you're<00:02:58.599> using<00:02:58.810> a

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
to control the robot if you're using a

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.830 
to control the robot if you're using a
remote<00:02:59.379> control<00:02:59.410> so<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.730> controller<00:03:01.299> which

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
remote control so the controller which

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.259 
remote control so the controller which
is<00:03:01.870> in<00:03:02.170> there<00:03:02.620> is<00:03:03.190> similar<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:03.849> control

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
is in there is similar to this control

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.539 
is in there is similar to this control
board<00:03:04.480> here<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.609> this<00:03:06.609> is<00:03:06.849> called<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.329> CN<00:03:08.549> 9.04

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
board here so this is called a CN 9.04

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.630 
board here so this is called a CN 9.04
control<00:03:10.450> board<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.109> it's<00:03:11.590> very<00:03:11.769> new<00:03:12.040> can<00:03:12.400> plug

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
control board and it's very new can plug

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.449 
control board and it's very new can plug
in<00:03:12.760> an<00:03:12.879> USB<00:03:13.079> here<00:03:14.079> and<00:03:14.319> then<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.560> can<00:03:14.769> program

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
in an USB here and then you can program

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.530 
in an USB here and then you can program
it<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.799> think<00:03:18.040> now<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.489> can<00:03:18.819> program<00:03:19.209> a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
it so I think now you can program a

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.190 
it so I think now you can program a
download<00:03:19.989> program<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:21.609> program<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.239> board

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
download program to program this board

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.559 
download program to program this board
is<00:03:23.410> basically<00:03:23.680> an<00:03:24.250> Adreno<00:03:24.669> type<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.120> interface

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
is basically an Adreno type of interface

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.280 
is basically an Adreno type of interface
and<00:03:27.000> once<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.060> plug<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.389> in<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.780> upload

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
and once you plug it in you upload

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.009 
and once you plug it in you upload
sketch<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.829> then<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.400> program<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.599> it

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
sketch and then you can program it so it

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.289 
sketch and then you can program it so it
it<00:03:32.319> doesn't<00:03:32.530> work<00:03:32.829> like<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:33.459> robot<00:03:33.819> plus<00:03:34.030> type

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
it doesn't work like a robot plus type

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.559 
it doesn't work like a robot plus type
of<00:03:34.919> programming<00:03:35.919> but<00:03:36.579> this<00:03:36.760> boy<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.030> believe<00:03:37.359> in

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
of programming but this boy I believe in

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.520 
of programming but this boy I believe in
Dec<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.109> also<00:03:38.680> taking<00:03:39.069> some<00:03:39.430> type<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:40.530> Robo

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
Dec and also taking some type of Robo

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.460 
Dec and also taking some type of Robo
plus<00:03:41.739> motion<00:03:42.190> sort<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.669> thing<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.959> get<00:03:44.230> in

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
plus motion sort of thing so to get in

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.849 
plus motion sort of thing so to get in
so<00:03:44.919> let<00:03:45.040> me<00:03:45.130> show<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.849> inside<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.870> the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
so let me show you the inside of the

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.170 
so let me show you the inside of the
robot<00:03:48.480> okay<00:03:49.480> so<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.870> open<00:03:50.079> it<00:03:50.669> you<00:03:51.669> just<00:03:51.880> remove

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
robot okay so to open it you just remove

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.250 
robot okay so to open it you just remove
these<00:03:52.329> screws<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.299> oh<00:03:55.540> lo<00:03:55.720> type<00:03:56.139> of

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
these screws it's like oh lo type of

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.479 
these screws it's like oh lo type of
screws<00:03:58.200> which<00:03:59.200> are<00:03:59.349> perfect<00:03:59.709> for<00:03:59.829> kids<00:04:00.099> like

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
screws which are perfect for kids like

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:08.280 
screws which are perfect for kids like
this<00:04:00.639> really<00:04:01.000> low-cost<00:04:01.810> rope<00:04:02.139> robots

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.280 

so<00:04:09.290> here<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:09.860> can<00:04:09.890> just<00:04:10.160> tick<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.490> off<00:04:10.610> as<00:04:11.540> you

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
so here you can just tick it off as you

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.520 
so here you can just tick it off as you
can<00:04:12.350> see<00:04:12.620> there's<00:04:12.800> a<00:04:12.890> control<00:04:13.280> board<00:04:13.460> and<00:04:14.530> you

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
can see there's a control board and you

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.340 
can see there's a control board and you
can<00:04:15.710> plug<00:04:15.860> in<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.130> USB<00:04:16.280> at<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:16.850> front<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.350> all

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
can plug in the USB at the front and all

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.400 
can plug in the USB at the front and all
the<00:04:18.500> other<00:04:18.620> stuff<00:04:19.540> this<00:04:20.540> little<00:04:20.870> problem<00:04:21.260> of

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
the other stuff this little problem of

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.320 
the other stuff this little problem of
programming<00:04:21.890> right<00:04:22.100> now<00:04:22.310> is<00:04:22.580> because<00:04:22.790> there's

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
programming right now is because there's

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.770 
programming right now is because there's
usb-con<00:04:24.520> post<00:04:25.520> in<00:04:25.670> there<00:04:26.000> so<00:04:26.180> it's<00:04:26.300> very<00:04:26.360> hard

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
usb-con post in there so it's very hard

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.900 
usb-con post in there so it's very hard
for<00:04:26.840> me<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.110> program<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.710> on<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.890> fly<00:04:28.130> just<00:04:28.700> to

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
for me to program it on the fly just to

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.950 
for me to program it on the fly just to
go<00:04:29.090> through<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:30.740> physical<00:04:30.950> appearance<00:04:31.430> of<00:04:31.760> it

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
go through the physical appearance of it

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.400 
go through the physical appearance of it
so<00:04:32.960> yeah<00:04:33.590> this<00:04:33.890> looks<00:04:34.160> very<00:04:34.480> neat<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.630> nice<00:04:36.050> I

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
so yeah this looks very neat and nice I

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.060 
so yeah this looks very neat and nice I
really<00:04:36.980> like<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:38.410> this<00:04:39.410> looks<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.710> bit<00:04:39.740> flaky

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
really like it this looks a bit flaky

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.380 
really like it this looks a bit flaky
better<00:04:40.490> thing<00:04:40.790> you'll<00:04:40.970> be<00:04:41.090> alright

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
better thing you'll be alright

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.000 
better thing you'll be alright
these<00:04:41.780> part<00:04:42.140> a<00:04:42.350> pre<00:04:42.830> okay<00:04:43.220> pretty<00:04:43.490> tough<00:04:43.730> and

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
these part a pre okay pretty tough and

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.910 
these part a pre okay pretty tough and
yeah<00:04:46.010> overall<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:47.210> feels<00:04:47.270> very<00:04:47.660> good<00:04:47.960> on<00:04:48.290> my

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
yeah overall it feels very good on my

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.440 
yeah overall it feels very good on my
hand<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:50.330> looks<00:04:50.510> very<00:04:50.780> good<00:04:52.060> but<00:04:53.060> don't

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.200 
hand and it looks very good but don't
expect<00:04:53.870> like<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.590> Darwin<00:04:54.980> Opie<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.730> be<00:04:55.910> you

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
expect like the Darwin Opie to be you

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.860 
expect like the Darwin Opie to be you
know<00:04:57.520> here<00:04:58.520> because<00:04:59.000> it's<00:04:59.150> not<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.540> Darwin

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
know here because it's not the Darwin

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.230 
know here because it's not the Darwin
Opie<00:05:00.140> it's<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:00.500> Darwin<00:05:01.070> mini-lp<00:05:01.490> it's

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
Opie it's the Darwin mini-lp it's

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.050 
Opie it's the Darwin mini-lp it's
supposed<00:05:02.570> to<00:05:02.630> be<00:05:02.780> at<00:05:02.930> an<00:05:03.440> entry<00:05:03.770> level<00:05:03.910> type<00:05:04.910> of

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
supposed to be at an entry level type of

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.290 
supposed to be at an entry level type of
robots<00:05:05.590> very<00:05:06.590> affordable<00:05:07.100> for<00:05:07.520> kids<00:05:07.730> to<00:05:08.000> start

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
robots very affordable for kids to start

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.590 
robots very affordable for kids to start
off<00:05:08.450> a<00:05:08.570> rope<00:05:08.780> robotic<00:05:09.790> you<00:05:10.790> know<00:05:10.880> anyone<00:05:11.480> who

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
off a rope robotic you know anyone who

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.060 
off a rope robotic you know anyone who
want<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.750> buy<00:05:11.900> row<00:05:12.080> by<00:05:12.200> row<00:05:12.410> I<00:05:12.590> think<00:05:12.890> I<00:05:12.950> would

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
want to buy row by row I think I would

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.050 
want to buy row by row I think I would
highly<00:05:13.370> recommend<00:05:13.430> it

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
highly recommend it

you<00:05:14.780> go<00:05:14.960> this<00:05:15.140> is<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:15.320> first<00:05:15.500> video<00:05:16.070> of<00:05:16.130> the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
you go this is the first video of the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.250 
you go this is the first video of the
kind<00:05:16.700> of<00:05:16.730> like<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:17.150> box<00:05:17.570> opening<00:05:17.900> type<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.140> video

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
kind of like a box opening type of video

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.770 
kind of like a box opening type of video
I'll<00:05:18.920> be<00:05:19.100> doing<00:05:19.340> another<00:05:19.820> video<00:05:20.420> later

I'll be doing another video later

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.400 
I'll be doing another video later
possibly<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:22.250> show<00:05:22.910> how<00:05:23.390> to<00:05:23.450> control<00:05:24.170> the

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
possibly to show how to control the

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.230 
possibly to show how to control the
robot<00:05:24.440> using<00:05:24.920> a<00:05:24.980> phone<00:05:25.220> or<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.760> program<00:05:26.150> the

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
robot using a phone or to program the

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.260 
robot using a phone or to program the
Arduino<00:05:26.420> and<00:05:26.840> so<00:05:27.050> on<00:05:27.170> so<00:05:27.770> stay<00:05:27.980> tuned<00:05:28.160> so<00:05:28.400> feel
