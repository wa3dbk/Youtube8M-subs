forward the shrouds loosen more like in
this<00:01:20.380> case<00:01:20.590> with<00:01:20.830> this<00:01:20.950> much<00:01:21.130> spread<00:01:21.430> you

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
this case with this much spread you

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.880 
this case with this much spread you
hardly<00:01:21.970> even<00:01:22.149> need<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.540> have<00:01:22.720> travel<00:01:23.380> Eversman

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
hardly even need to have travel Eversman

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.130 
hardly even need to have travel Eversman
okay<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.340> next<00:01:24.430> step<00:01:24.700> before<00:01:24.820> we<00:01:25.180> even<00:01:25.390> start

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
okay the next step before we even start

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.930 
okay the next step before we even start
getting<00:01:26.350> our<00:01:26.440> shrouds<00:01:26.710> even<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.640> make<00:01:27.790> sure

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
getting our shrouds even is to make sure

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.370 
getting our shrouds even is to make sure
our<00:01:27.970> back<00:01:28.240> stays<00:01:28.479> our<00:01:28.630> tension<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.990> evenly

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380

mass RAM on if you have some RAM on
that's<00:01:53.740> going<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.160> screw<00:01:54.490> everything<00:01:54.729> up<00:01:54.940> so

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
that's going to screw everything up so

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.630 
that's going to screw everything up so
keep<00:01:55.869> your<00:01:55.990> RAM<00:01:56.229> loose<00:01:56.649> if<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.069> need<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> little

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
keep your RAM loose if you need a little

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.760 
keep your RAM loose if you need a little
bit<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:58.690> keep<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.899> mast<00:01:59.200> pop<00:01:59.440> forward

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
bit to keep the mast pop forward

on here
right<00:03:25.400> now<00:03:25.579> in<00:03:25.760> this<00:03:25.880> boat<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.359> are<00:03:26.390> said<00:03:26.840> at

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
right now in this boat we are said at

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.270 
right now in this boat we are said at
just<00:03:28.340> under<00:03:28.670> 23<00:03:29.440> generally<00:03:30.440> about<00:03:30.680> one<00:03:30.980> turn

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
just under 23 generally about one turn

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.550 
just under 23 generally about one turn
on<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.700> steam<00:03:32.150> master<00:03:32.630> accounts<00:03:33.350> for<00:03:33.440> about

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
on the steam master accounts for about

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.130 
on the steam master accounts for about
one<00:03:33.859> unit<00:03:34.190> on<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.370> loose<00:03:34.549> gauge<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.120> if<00:03:36.019> you

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
one unit on the loose gauge so if you

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.650 
one unit on the loose gauge so if you
are<00:03:36.230> at<00:03:36.350> 22<00:03:36.829> usually<00:03:37.700> one<00:03:37.880> turn<00:03:38.150> tighter<00:03:38.450> roll

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
are at 22 usually one turn tighter roll

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.500 
are at 22 usually one turn tighter roll
pitch<00:03:38.840> hit<00:03:39.019> 23<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:40.370> we're<00:03:40.910> at<00:03:41.030> base<00:03:41.209> right<00:03:41.450> here

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
pitch hit 23 so we're at base right here

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.440 
pitch hit 23 so we're at base right here
right<00:03:41.810> now<00:03:41.959> in<00:03:42.109> this<00:03:42.200> boat<00:03:42.410> at<00:03:42.530> 23<00:03:43.359> so<00:03:44.359> we

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
right now in this boat at 23 so we

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.910 
right now in this boat at 23 so we
checked<00:03:44.720> make<00:03:44.900> sure<00:03:45.079> mass<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.560> right<00:03:45.739> in<00:03:45.859> the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
checked make sure mass is right in the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.099 
checked make sure mass is right in the
center<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.489> partner<00:03:47.090> which<00:03:47.510> in<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.750> case

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
center of the partner which in the case

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.500 
center of the partner which in the case
of<00:03:48.290> this<00:03:48.380> boat<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:49.549> in<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.850> center<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.359> want

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
of this boat it's in the center you want

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.030 
of this boat it's in the center you want
a<00:03:50.660> little<00:03:50.810> bit<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:50.989> play<00:03:51.230> just<00:03:51.530> like<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:51.829> boat

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
a little bit of play just like this boat

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.129 
a little bit of play just like this boat
has<00:03:52.280> as<00:03:52.639> you<00:03:53.329> know<00:03:53.359> when<00:03:53.810> you're<00:03:53.930> sailing

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
has as you know when you're sailing

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.960 
has as you know when you're sailing
upwind<00:03:54.380> your<00:03:54.709> lower<00:03:54.859> shroud<00:03:55.160> is<00:03:55.370> super<00:03:55.760> loose

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
upwind your lower shroud is super loose

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.120 
upwind your lower shroud is super loose
part<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.290> rig's<00:03:57.500> laying<00:03:57.799> over<00:03:57.980> to

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
part of that is the rig's laying over to

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.500 
part of that is the rig's laying over to
the<00:03:58.220> side<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:58.790> if<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:58.910> were<00:03:59.060> tight<00:03:59.269> at<00:03:59.420> the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
the side so if you were tight at the

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.200 
the side so if you were tight at the
deck<00:03:59.720> you'd<00:03:59.959> be

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
deck you'd be

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.150 
deck you'd be
your<00:04:00.570> mass<00:04:00.720> coming<00:04:01.020> out<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.350> deck<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:02.070> you

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
your mass coming out of the deck so you

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.880 
your mass coming out of the deck so you
need<00:04:02.340> about<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.420> much<00:04:03.480> slop<00:04:04.350> on<00:04:04.560> side<00:04:04.770> to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
need about this much slop on side to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.980 
need about this much slop on side to
side<00:04:05.150> alright<00:04:06.150> next<00:04:06.330> step<00:04:06.450> would<00:04:06.720> be<00:04:06.870> our

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
side alright next step would be our

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.590 
side alright next step would be our
lower<00:04:07.140> Straus<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:08.000> good<00:04:09.000> way<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.210> get<00:04:09.390> your

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
lower Straus a good way to get your

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.260 
lower Straus a good way to get your
lower<00:04:10.080> shrouds<00:04:10.440> correct<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.850> start<00:04:12.120> with

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
lower shrouds correct is to start with

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.240 
lower shrouds correct is to start with
them<00:04:12.450> as<00:04:13.320> tight<00:04:13.500> as<00:04:13.650> you<00:04:13.680> can<00:04:13.770> make<00:04:13.920> them<00:04:14.160> with

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
them as tight as you can make them with

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.710 
them as tight as you can make them with
your<00:04:14.370> fingers<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:14.910> in<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.270> case<00:04:15.480> we've<00:04:15.690> got

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
your fingers so in this case we've got

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.229 
your fingers so in this case we've got
it<00:04:15.990> tight<00:04:16.770> on<00:04:17.010> both<00:04:17.160> sides<00:04:17.460> they're<00:04:17.760> even<00:04:18.090> and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
it tight on both sides they're even and

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.979 
it tight on both sides they're even and
then<00:04:19.020> you<00:04:19.050> can<00:04:19.290> back<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.530> off<00:04:19.860> between<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.989> six

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
then you can back it off between a six

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.910 
then you can back it off between a six
and<00:04:22.290> eight<00:04:23.100> phases<00:04:23.730> to<00:04:24.210> get<00:04:24.420> to<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.660> right

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
and eight phases to get to the right

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.640 
and eight phases to get to the right
setting<00:04:25.920> for<00:04:26.330> upwind<00:04:27.330> sailing<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.110> on<00:04:28.290> we<00:04:28.620> have

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
setting for upwind sailing so on we have

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.740 
setting for upwind sailing so on we have
a<00:04:28.770> little<00:04:28.980> mark<00:04:29.160> on<00:04:29.340> here<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:29.790> can<00:04:29.970> count<00:04:30.240> how

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
a little mark on here so I can count how

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:38.560 
a little mark on here so I can count how
many<00:04:30.810> phases<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.830> letting<00:04:32.190> off<00:04:32.310> on<00:04:33.150> two<00:04:36.920> six

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
many phases and letting off on two six

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.080 
many phases and letting off on two six
seven<00:04:40.190> eight<00:04:43.400> we'll<00:04:44.400> do<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.640> same<00:04:44.820> on<00:04:44.970> the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
seven eight we'll do the same on the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.540 
seven eight we'll do the same on the
other<00:04:45.120> side<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.900> then<00:04:46.380> we'll<00:04:47.100> go<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.400> next

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
other side and then we'll go to the next

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.040 
other side and then we'll go to the next
measuring<00:04:48.000> your<00:04:48.510> seizure

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
measuring your seizure

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.690 
measuring your seizure
alright<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.100> next<00:04:50.310> way<00:04:50.400> we're<00:04:50.550> going<00:04:50.640> to

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
alright the next way we're going to

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.550 
alright the next way we're going to
measure<00:04:50.850> our<00:04:51.180> lower<00:04:51.390> shrouds<00:04:51.750> is<00:04:52.110> by

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
measure our lower shrouds is by

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.740 
measure our lower shrouds is by
measuring<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.010> distance<00:04:53.040> across<00:04:53.630> so<00:04:54.630> we

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
measuring the distance across so we

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.560 
measuring the distance across so we
measure<00:04:54.990> up<00:04:55.730> thirty<00:04:56.730> six<00:04:57.000> inches<00:04:57.300> from<00:04:57.480> the

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
measure up thirty six inches from the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.900 
measure up thirty six inches from the
top<00:04:57.690> of<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.930> band<00:04:58.140> we<00:04:59.130> make<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> little<00:04:59.490> mark<00:04:59.730> on

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
top of the band we make a little mark on

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.610 
top of the band we make a little mark on
the<00:04:59.970> front<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.270> mast<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:01.020> then<00:05:01.500> we

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
the front of the mast and then we

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.520 
the front of the mast and then we
measure<00:05:01.800> across

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.350 

try<00:05:05.100> not<00:05:05.280> to<00:05:05.370> damage<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.700> boat

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.190 

unfortunately<00:05:10.360> this<00:05:10.450> is<00:05:10.600> a<00:05:10.630> little<00:05:10.930> bit<00:05:11.050> of<00:05:11.140> a

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
unfortunately this is a little bit of a

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.600 
unfortunately this is a little bit of a
judgement<00:05:11.620> call<00:05:11.650> how<00:05:11.950> tight<00:05:12.220> do<00:05:12.340> you<00:05:12.370> pull

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
judgement call how tight do you pull

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.880 
judgement call how tight do you pull
this<00:05:12.790> some<00:05:13.060> guys<00:05:13.240> have<00:05:13.540> a<00:05:13.840> shock<00:05:14.230> cord<00:05:14.500> setup

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
this some guys have a shock cord setup

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.830 
this some guys have a shock cord setup
that<00:05:15.010> holds<00:05:15.370> it<00:05:15.490> steady<00:05:16.030> which<00:05:16.390> is<00:05:16.510> not<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.660> bad

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
that holds it steady which is not a bad

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.430 
that holds it steady which is not a bad
idea

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
idea

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.490 
idea
but<00:05:18.220> I<00:05:18.400> can<00:05:18.610> measure<00:05:18.730> across<00:05:19.090> here<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:20.050> right

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
but I can measure across here and right

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.090 
but I can measure across here and right
now<00:05:20.530> I<00:05:20.710> have<00:05:21.390> 28<00:05:22.390> inches<00:05:22.840> between<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.740> shrouds

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
now I have 28 inches between the shrouds

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.190 
now I have 28 inches between the shrouds
and<00:05:24.840> that's<00:05:25.840> a<00:05:25.930> pretty<00:05:26.170> good<00:05:26.410> pretty<00:05:27.400> good

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
and that's a pretty good pretty good

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.000 
and that's a pretty good pretty good
starting<00:05:29.200> setting<00:05:30.040> they<00:05:30.160> have<00:05:31.830> another<00:05:32.830> thing

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
starting setting they have another thing

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.040 
starting setting they have another thing
we<00:05:33.130> can<00:05:33.250> do<00:05:33.370> at<00:05:33.490> this<00:05:33.580> point<00:05:33.670> is<00:05:34.060> right<00:05:34.780> now<00:05:34.900> my

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
we can do at this point is right now my

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.690 
we can do at this point is right now my
shrouds<00:05:35.320> are<00:05:35.440> 28<00:05:35.830> inches<00:05:36.100> from<00:05:36.310> side<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.550> side

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
shrouds are 28 inches from side to side

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.000 
shrouds are 28 inches from side to side
and<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.990> can<00:05:38.050> look<00:05:38.260> at<00:05:38.410> the<00:05:38.470> center<00:05:38.710> line<00:05:38.830> of<00:05:38.890> the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
and I can look at the center line of the

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.920 
and I can look at the center line of the
mass<00:05:39.250> which<00:05:39.670> should<00:05:39.940> be<00:05:40.090> if<00:05:40.300> they're<00:05:40.450> even<00:05:40.780> at

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
mass which should be if they're even at

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.110 
mass which should be if they're even at
about<00:05:41.110> 14<00:05:41.560> inches<00:05:41.590> which<00:05:42.160> is<00:05:42.190> exactly<00:05:42.940> where

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
about 14 inches which is exactly where

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.770 
about 14 inches which is exactly where
it<00:05:43.180> is<00:05:43.240> right<00:05:43.420> now

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
it is right now

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.990 
it is right now
another<00:05:44.440> thing<00:05:44.620> you<00:05:44.710> can<00:05:44.800> do<00:05:44.950> is<00:05:45.100> just<00:05:45.220> take<00:05:45.940> a

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
another thing you can do is just take a

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.640 
another thing you can do is just take a
little<00:05:46.120> swing<00:05:46.420> of<00:05:46.600> your<00:05:46.630> lower<00:05:46.900> strap<00:05:47.260> and

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
little swing of your lower strap and

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.860 
little swing of your lower strap and
this<00:05:47.830> assuming<00:05:48.370> your<00:05:48.490> mass<00:05:48.610> is<00:05:48.640> centered<00:05:49.150> the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
this assuming your mass is centered the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.200 
this assuming your mass is centered the
shroud<00:05:50.110> should<00:05:50.410> feel<00:05:50.650> you<00:05:51.580> know<00:05:51.670> even<00:05:52.030> ones

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
shroud should feel you know even ones

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.120 
shroud should feel you know even ones
not<00:05:52.450> tight<00:05:52.750> now<00:05:52.960> that<00:05:53.110> one's<00:05:53.230> not<00:05:53.350> loose<00:05:53.560> now

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
not tight now that one's not loose now

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.920 
not tight now that one's not loose now
remember<00:05:54.550> both<00:05:54.880> back<00:05:55.090> states<00:05:55.360> have<00:05:55.480> to<00:05:55.570> be<00:05:55.690> set

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
remember both back states have to be set

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.960 
remember both back states have to be set
evenly<00:05:56.290> at<00:05:56.680> this<00:05:56.830> point<00:05:57.100> all<00:05:57.520> right<00:05:57.670> one<00:05:57.820> more

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
evenly at this point all right one more

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.900 
evenly at this point all right one more
thing<00:05:58.540> we<00:05:58.690> can<00:05:58.810> check<00:05:59.110> is<00:05:59.410> our<00:05:59.980> intermediates

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
thing we can check is our intermediates

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.670 
thing we can check is our intermediates
when<00:06:01.150> we've<00:06:01.270> got<00:06:01.450> this<00:06:01.600> all<00:06:01.780> set<00:06:02.050> up<00:06:02.080> if<00:06:02.500> you

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
when we've got this all set up if you

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.409 
when we've got this all set up if you
have<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:02.890> right<00:06:03.040> amount<00:06:03.310> of<00:06:03.419> intermediate

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
have the right amount of intermediate

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:05.850 
have the right amount of intermediate
adjustment<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.140> correct<00:06:05.350> amount<00:06:05.590> of<00:06:05.620> shroud

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
adjustment the correct amount of shroud

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.040 
adjustment the correct amount of shroud
tension<00:06:06.310> at<00:06:06.490> base<00:06:06.880> so<00:06:07.240> let's<00:06:07.480> say<00:06:07.630> we're<00:06:07.870> at

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
tension at base so let's say we're at

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.230 
tension at base so let's say we're at
seventy<00:06:08.710> four<00:06:08.890> millimeters<00:06:09.430> on<00:06:10.030> our

seventy four millimeters on our

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.780 
seventy four millimeters on our
intermediates<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:11.050> we're<00:06:11.980> at<00:06:12.130> twenty<00:06:12.669> three

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
intermediates and we're at twenty three

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.570 
intermediates and we're at twenty three
units<00:06:13.180> on<00:06:13.390> our<00:06:13.660> shrouds<00:06:14.220> you're<00:06:15.220> going<00:06:15.370> to<00:06:15.430> see

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
units on our shrouds you're going to see

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.490 
units on our shrouds you're going to see
the<00:06:15.700> intermediates<00:06:16.240> a<00:06:16.480> little<00:06:16.990> bit<00:06:17.110> loose<00:06:17.320> or

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
the intermediates a little bit loose or

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.840 
the intermediates a little bit loose or
going<00:06:17.620> to<00:06:17.680> be<00:06:17.740> bouncing<00:06:18.160> in<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.280> wind<00:06:18.520> if<00:06:18.730> the

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
going to be bouncing in the wind if the

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.700 
going to be bouncing in the wind if the
shrouds<00:06:19.120> are<00:06:19.270> tighter<00:06:19.540> like<00:06:20.290> if<00:06:20.410> we<00:06:20.500> go<00:06:20.620> to

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
shrouds are tighter like if we go to

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.400 
shrouds are tighter like if we go to
twenty-four<00:06:21.660> twenty-five<00:06:22.660> the

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
twenty-four twenty-five the

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.810 
twenty-four twenty-five the
intermediates<00:06:23.919> will<00:06:24.100> get<00:06:24.250> tight<00:06:24.520> when<00:06:24.760> the

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
intermediates will get tight when the

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.909 
intermediates will get tight when the
boats<00:06:25.000> sitting<00:06:25.180> on<00:06:25.330> the<00:06:25.390> trailer<00:06:25.750> and

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
boats sitting on the trailer and

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.260 
boats sitting on the trailer and
vice-versa<00:06:26.919> if<00:06:27.160> we<00:06:27.700> were<00:06:27.790> to<00:06:27.910> loosen<00:06:28.180> the

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
vice-versa if we were to loosen the

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.640 
vice-versa if we were to loosen the
shrouds<00:06:28.540> the<00:06:28.690> intermediates<00:06:29.169> will<00:06:29.320> look<00:06:29.470> real

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
shrouds the intermediates will look real

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.020 
shrouds the intermediates will look real
loose<00:06:29.890> so<00:06:30.100> this<00:06:30.250> will<00:06:30.400> give<00:06:30.520> you<00:06:30.640> a<00:06:30.669> little<00:06:30.820> bit

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
loose so this will give you a little bit

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.210 
loose so this will give you a little bit
of<00:06:31.180> a<00:06:31.330> double<00:06:32.290> check<00:06:32.650> to<00:06:32.770> see<00:06:32.919> if<00:06:33.010> you're<00:06:33.160> in

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
of a double check to see if you're in

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.360 
of a double check to see if you're in
the<00:06:33.310> neighborhood<00:06:34.830> now<00:06:35.830> I<00:06:35.860> want<00:06:36.070> to<00:06:36.160> show<00:06:36.310> you

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
the neighborhood now I want to show you

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.460 
the neighborhood now I want to show you
how<00:06:36.669> the<00:06:36.729> shrouds<00:06:37.479> get<00:06:37.810> loose<00:06:38.020> when<00:06:38.229> we<00:06:38.320> go

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
how the shrouds get loose when we go

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.920 
how the shrouds get loose when we go
downwind<00:06:38.890> it's<00:06:39.100> important<00:06:39.580> that<00:06:39.610> the<00:06:40.000> crowds

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
downwind it's important that the crowds

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.870 
downwind it's important that the crowds
are<00:06:41.110> loose<00:06:41.290> so<00:06:41.620> the<00:06:41.890> spreaders<00:06:42.280> take<00:06:42.550> down<00:06:42.729> the

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
are loose so the spreaders take down the

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.879 
are loose so the spreaders take down the
back<00:06:43.030> to<00:06:43.210> me

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
back to me

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.589 
back to me
when<00:06:44.189> we<00:06:44.310> lay<00:06:44.460> the<00:06:44.610> ring<00:06:44.759> forward<00:06:45.210> there's<00:06:45.539> a

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
when we lay the ring forward there's a

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.200 
when we lay the ring forward there's a
number<00:06:45.810> of<00:06:46.020> ways<00:06:46.400> to<00:06:47.400> make<00:06:47.520> our<00:06:47.699> shrouds<00:06:48.000> get

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
number of ways to make our shrouds get

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.200 
number of ways to make our shrouds get
loose<00:06:48.389> one<00:06:49.379> to<00:06:50.039> have<00:06:50.189> your<00:06:50.370> step<00:06:50.639> slide<00:06:50.939> back

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
loose one to have your step slide back

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.119 
loose one to have your step slide back
and<00:06:51.539> this<00:06:51.840> code<00:06:52.110> is<00:06:52.139> set<00:06:52.469> up<00:06:52.620> so<00:06:52.770> it<00:06:52.860> slides

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:53.129 
and this code is set up so it slides

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.670 
and this code is set up so it slides
back<00:06:53.250> about<00:06:53.849> two<00:06:54.060> inches<00:06:54.419> that<00:06:55.110> brings<00:06:55.500> the

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
back about two inches that brings the

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.040 
back about two inches that brings the
mass<00:06:55.860> back<00:06:56.159> and<00:06:56.430> look<00:06:56.550> in<00:06:56.759> comparison<00:06:57.030> to<00:06:57.689> the

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
mass back and look in comparison to the

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.540 
mass back and look in comparison to the
location<00:06:58.469> of<00:06:58.560> your<00:06:58.590> shrouds<00:06:58.919> loosening<00:06:59.460> up

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
location of your shrouds loosening up

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.170 
location of your shrouds loosening up
the<00:06:59.639> shrouds

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
the shrouds

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.879 
the shrouds
another<00:07:00.689> method<00:07:00.930> is<00:07:01.139> to<00:07:01.349> have<00:07:01.500> your<00:07:01.590> shrouds

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:01.889 
another method is to have your shrouds

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.670 
another method is to have your shrouds
just<00:07:02.900> connected<00:07:03.900> further<00:07:04.110> forward<00:07:04.500> on<00:07:04.590> the

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
just connected further forward on the

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.149 
just connected further forward on the
boat

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:05.159 
boat

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:09.350 
boat
a<00:07:06.050> third<00:07:07.050> way<00:07:07.259> is<00:07:07.560> to<00:07:07.590> have<00:07:07.919> levers<00:07:08.580> which

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 
a third way is to have levers which

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.170 
a third way is to have levers which
would<00:07:09.539> let<00:07:10.110> off<00:07:10.229> your<00:07:10.379> shrouds<00:07:10.590> obviously<00:07:11.250> or

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
would let off your shrouds obviously or

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.059 
would let off your shrouds obviously or
to<00:07:12.360> have<00:07:12.479> a<00:07:12.509> ramp<00:07:12.840> like<00:07:13.259> a<00:07:13.439> lot<00:07:13.560> of<00:07:13.650> the<00:07:13.710> Folies

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:14.069 
to have a ramp like a lot of the Folies
