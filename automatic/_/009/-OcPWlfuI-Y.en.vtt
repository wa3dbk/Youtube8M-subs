00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
on the reality transformer plugs in here

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.009 
on the reality transformer plugs in here
and<00:00:09.980> then<00:00:10.250> enjoyed<00:00:10.580> your<00:00:10.670> connections<00:00:11.119> is

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
your size your padded cell

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.370 
your size your padded cell
so<00:00:14.790> you're<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.330> checking<00:00:15.600> that<00:00:15.870> while<00:00:16.139> it's

tough<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> try<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> troubleshoot<00:00:20.120> so<00:00:21.120> you<00:00:21.450> got

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
tough to try to troubleshoot so you got

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.230 
tough to try to troubleshoot so you got
the<00:00:21.750> primary<00:00:22.440> control<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.430> transformer<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the primary control the transformer and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.090 
the primary control the transformer and

the CAD cell all one piece

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.220 
the CAD cell all one piece
Wow<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.880> how<00:00:27.000> much<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.450> little<00:00:27.750> puppy<00:00:28.050> or

connections or your pins and then they
they<00:00:38.250> go<00:00:38.400> into<00:00:38.579> these<00:00:38.670> pins<00:00:38.970> here<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.930> just

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
they go into these pins here they just

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.290 
they go into these pins here they just
plug<00:00:40.260> into<00:00:40.470> it<00:00:40.590> does<00:00:41.490> that<00:00:41.640> even<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
plug into it does that even is a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.870 
plug into it does that even is a
standard<00:00:43.160> capacitor<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.400> buy<00:00:44.550> hanging

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
standard capacitor you can buy hanging

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.100 
standard capacitor you can buy hanging
off<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> side<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.390> motor<00:00:45.630> that's<00:00:45.960> some

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
off the side of that motor that's some

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.980 
off the side of that motor that's some
funky<00:00:46.620> deep<00:00:46.800> lingo<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.570> it's<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:48.780> it's

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
funky deep lingo do it's right it's

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.330 
funky deep lingo do it's right it's
right<00:00:49.050> below<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:49.560> case<00:00:49.740> you<00:00:49.890> can't<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.310> from

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
right below the case you can't see from

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.250 
right below the case you can't see from
up<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:50.820> oh<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.450> up<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.720> right<00:00:52.350> here

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
up there oh it's up here right here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.720 
up there oh it's up here right here
yeah<00:00:54.710> that's<00:00:54.890> just<00:00:54.980> that's<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.339> different<00:00:55.640> kind

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
yeah that's just that's a different kind

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.790 
yeah that's just that's a different kind
of<00:00:55.820> capacity<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:56.359> so<00:00:56.719> far<00:00:57.079> you<00:00:57.170> can't<00:00:57.379> find

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
of capacity to so far you can't find

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.290 
of capacity to so far you can't find
anywhere<00:00:58.190> not<00:00:58.399> something<00:00:58.760> go<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:58.879> store<00:00:59.239> for

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
anywhere not something go to store for

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.030 
anywhere not something go to store for

so here's your pump still over still get

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.990 
so here's your pump still over still get
your<00:01:04.129> bleeder<00:01:04.399> valve

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
your bleeder valve

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.510 
your bleeder valve
here's<00:01:05.720> your<00:01:05.840> adjustment<00:01:06.409> if<00:01:07.340> your<00:01:07.490> oil

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
here's your adjustment if your oil

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.450 
here's your adjustment if your oil
nozzle<00:01:08.119> still<00:01:08.590> here's<00:01:09.590> your<00:01:09.710> electrodes<00:01:10.220> in

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
nozzle still here's your electrodes in

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.660 
nozzle still here's your electrodes in
here<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.380> then<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.100> thing<00:01:13.310> here<00:01:13.490> actually

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
here and then this thing here actually

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.169 
here and then this thing here actually
has<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:16.630> gate<00:01:17.630> on<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.960> when<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.590> starts<00:01:18.860> up

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
has a a gate on it when it starts up

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.160 
has a a gate on it when it starts up
there's<00:01:20.179> an<00:01:20.299> air<00:01:20.479> shutter<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:20.899> will

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
there's an air shutter that will

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.469 
there's an air shutter that will
automatically<00:01:21.770> open<00:01:21.799> up<00:01:22.189> on<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.149> thing<00:01:23.330> to

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
automatically open up on the thing to

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.929 
automatically open up on the thing to
give<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.840> air<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.289> needs<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.220> then<00:01:25.789> I

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
give it the air that it needs and then I

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.219 
give it the air that it needs and then I
said<00:01:26.149> then<00:01:26.299> everything<00:01:26.630> works<00:01:26.780> through<00:01:27.049> here

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
said then everything works through here

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.330 
said then everything works through here
here's<00:01:27.470> all<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.740> connections<00:01:28.250> and

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
here's all the connections and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.100 
here's all the connections and
everything<00:01:28.429> that's<00:01:28.670> on<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:28.940> back<00:01:29.119> shows<00:01:29.990> you

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
everything that's on the back shows you

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.539 
everything that's on the back shows you
how<00:01:30.440> to<00:01:30.500> lock<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.890> on<00:01:30.979> everything<00:01:31.340> but<00:01:31.460> it

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
how to lock it on everything but it

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.100 
how to lock it on everything but it
makes<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.030> is<00:01:32.420> pretty<00:01:32.659> tough<00:01:32.869> to

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
makes it it is pretty tough to

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.340 
makes it it is pretty tough to
troubleshoot<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:35.450> we're<00:01:35.630> going<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.899> fire<00:01:36.200> this

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
troubleshoot so we're going to fire this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.440 
troubleshoot so we're going to fire this
one<00:01:36.530> up<00:01:37.299> now<00:01:38.299> where<00:01:38.479> they<00:01:38.600> already<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.080> same

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
one up now where they already the same

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.449 
one up now where they already the same
control<00:01:41.450> box<00:01:41.690> hi<00:01:42.560> primary<00:01:42.979> control<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.399> think

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
control box hi primary control I think

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:44.109 
control box hi primary control I think
so

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
so

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.279 
so
well<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.330> how<00:01:44.450> only<00:01:44.720> I've<00:01:44.899> never<00:01:45.110> really

well you how only I've never really

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.399 
well you how only I've never really
worked<00:01:45.470> on<00:01:45.649> these<00:01:46.720> holy<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:47.929> played<00:01:48.229> with

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
worked on these holy just played with

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.919 
worked on these holy just played with
them<00:01:48.670> or<00:01:49.670> dish<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.179> I'm<00:01:50.390> pretty<00:01:50.630> sure<00:01:50.780> these

them or dish this I'm pretty sure these

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.840 
them or dish this I'm pretty sure these
are<00:01:51.080> all<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.259> same<00:01:51.530> how<00:01:52.159> many<00:01:52.340> beats<00:01:52.549> who<00:01:52.670> uses

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
are all the same how many beats who uses

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.820 
are all the same how many beats who uses

yellow but they have internal to the
pump<00:01:58.369> yes<00:01:58.759> yes<00:01:59.119> here's<00:01:59.420> your<00:01:59.479> wires<00:01:59.830> going<00:02:00.830> to

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
pump yes yes here's your wires going to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.469 
pump yes yes here's your wires going to
it<00:02:01.069> so<00:02:01.250> that's<00:02:01.369> got<00:02:01.610> your<00:02:01.729> tool<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.090> solenoid

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
it so that's got your tool a solenoid

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.930 
it so that's got your tool a solenoid
give<00:02:02.959> it<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.110> good<00:02:03.289> good<00:02:03.950> fart<00:02:04.280> then<00:02:04.610> fold<00:02:04.849> up

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
give it a good good fart then fold up

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.749 
give it a good good fart then fold up
pressure<00:02:05.209> like<00:02:05.950> now<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.310> said<00:02:07.489> this<00:02:07.580> thing

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.520 

it<00:04:28.820> just<00:04:29.060> shut<00:04:29.270> off<00:04:29.330> when<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.720> was<00:04:29.960> running<00:04:30.410> it

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
it just shut off when I was running it

right why was it coming out so foamy
before<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:47.230> it<00:04:48.230> might<00:04:48.410> be<00:04:48.530> enough<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.740> light

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
before that it might be enough to light

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.700 
before that it might be enough to light
it<00:04:49.100> off<00:04:49.250> now<00:04:50.060> it's<00:04:50.240> coming<00:04:50.570> out<00:04:50.720> this<00:04:50.930> way<00:04:51.140> -<00:04:51.200> I

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
it off now it's coming out this way - I

it off now it's coming out this way - I
wouldn't<00:04:52.070> read<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:53.950> trim<00:04:54.950> we'll<00:04:55.370> take<00:04:55.550> that

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
wouldn't read the trim we'll take that

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.400 
wouldn't read the trim we'll take that
and<00:04:55.850> pour<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.090> into<00:04:56.420> that<00:04:56.720> container<00:04:57.050> for

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
and pour that into that container for

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.260 
and pour that into that container for
later<00:04:58.000> just<00:04:59.000> having<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.390> little<00:04:59.690> bit

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
to hook the fan motor back up doesn't

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.620 
to hook the fan motor back up doesn't
look<00:05:11.319> like<00:05:11.470> much<00:05:11.620> idea

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630
