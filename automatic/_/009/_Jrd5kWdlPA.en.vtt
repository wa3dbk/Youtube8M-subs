00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.140
 better than you have to give you can hardly 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.270
 smile because what really 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.110

 little ones left in the care of 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.310
 someone else 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.530
 they are always lamenting but little to 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.200
 little are getting used to this 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.950
 terrible lie einstein said that 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.349
 Madness is waiting for different results 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.329
 doing the same thing I'm convinced of 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.079
 what is real look, I'm not asking you 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.870
 let your work do one thing 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:26.109
 only devotes 10% of your best effort 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.090
 of your best time to give you the 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.790
 opportunity to realize your dreams 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.970
 it seems unreal is not true but although 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.640
 do not believe it alone with the 10% of your best 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.889
 effort you could get to earn double 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.379
 of what you earn today does not matter the figure 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.440
 in principle I will not ask you to 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.870
 you create a closed eye give him the opportunity 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.180
 to the studies you want to do as 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.639

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.780
