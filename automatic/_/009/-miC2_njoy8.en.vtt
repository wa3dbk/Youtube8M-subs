00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.350 

we've<00:00:38.280> always<00:00:38.460> thought<00:00:38.580> the<00:00:38.850> Kazaa<00:00:39.120> she's

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360

exterior<00:00:39.900> design<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.710> its<00:00:40.800> best

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
exterior design was one of its best

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.980 
exterior design was one of its best
features<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.910> big<00:00:42.120> step<00:00:42.360> forward<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
features and a big step forward for the

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.170 
features and a big step forward for the
Suzuki<00:00:43.260> brand<00:00:43.740> but<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> big<00:00:44.700> question<00:00:45.060> with

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
Suzuki brand but the big question with

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.640 
Suzuki brand but the big question with
any<00:00:45.390> design<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.930> whether<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.350> still<00:00:46.620> look

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
any design is whether it will still look

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.220 
any design is whether it will still look
good<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.160> year<00:00:47.430> or<00:00:47.610> five<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.930> think<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
good in a year or five we think the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.230 
good in a year or five we think the
Kizashi<00:00:49.500> does<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> will<00:00:50.400> with<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> shape

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
Kizashi does and will with the shape

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.490 
Kizashi does and will with the shape
that<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.510> neither<00:00:51.690> too<00:00:51.990> bold<00:00:52.230> nor<00:00:52.620> too<00:00:52.920> tame

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500
