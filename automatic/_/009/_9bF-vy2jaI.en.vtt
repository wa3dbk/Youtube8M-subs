00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
could close that so I'm going to go down

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.710 
could close that so I'm going to go down
to<00:02:39.500> attack<00:02:39.830> your<00:02:40.069> legs<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:41.090> snake<00:02:41.360> creeps<00:02:41.599> down

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
to attack your legs so snake creeps down

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.339 
to attack your legs so snake creeps down
primarily<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:44.090> kind<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.599> profile<00:02:45.080> here

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
primarily is this kind of profile here

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.670 
primarily is this kind of profile here
to<00:02:45.980> close<00:02:46.220> somewhere<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:46.940> more<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.330> strike

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
to close somewhere but more to strike

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:57.929 
to close somewhere but more to strike
into<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.769> legs<00:02:49.010> here<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.599> body<00:02:50.810> back<00:02:51.470> here

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.300 

so<00:02:58.939> for<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.239> type<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.510> technique<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.310> can

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
so for this type of technique you can

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.990 
so for this type of technique you can
advance<00:03:01.670> with<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.239> you<00:03:02.659> can<00:03:02.870> retreat<00:03:03.230> with<00:03:03.439> it

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
advance with it you can retreat with it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.970 
advance with it you can retreat with it
advancing<00:03:05.000> would<00:03:05.120> go<00:03:05.269> on<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:06.439> end<00:03:06.739> on<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
advancing would go on and you end on the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.119 
advancing would go on and you end on the
heel<00:03:07.280> as<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:08.209> going<00:03:08.450> down<00:03:08.659> its<00:03:09.379> heel<00:03:09.709> first

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
heel as you going down its heel first

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.580 
heel as you going down its heel first
right

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
right

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.479 
right
striking<00:03:12.700> yeah<00:03:14.200> retreating<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:16.099> stepping

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
striking yeah retreating is stepping

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.280 
striking yeah retreating is stepping
back<00:03:16.670> from<00:03:16.849> something<00:03:17.299> so<00:03:17.629> it<00:03:17.689> has<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.870> normal

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
back from something so it has a normal

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.860 
back from something so it has a normal
stepping<00:03:18.799> it's<00:03:19.370> on<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.640> toes<00:03:19.879> we<00:03:20.390> go<00:03:20.569> back

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
stepping it's on the toes we go back

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.780 
stepping it's on the toes we go back
onto<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.069> toes<00:03:22.959> cover<00:03:24.069> come<00:03:25.069> back<00:03:25.250> here<00:03:25.579> you

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
onto the toes cover come back here you

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.830 
onto the toes cover come back here you
make<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.150> want<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:28.519> we'd<00:03:28.700> be<00:03:28.840> sticking

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
make we want and so we'd be sticking

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.369 
make we want and so we'd be sticking
