00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.660
 Today, the review will be in the form of an interview if you decide to give a girl 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.309
 headphones but do not know what to pay attention to the present 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.360
 probably liked you need to know some of the nuances for this we are today 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.529
 invited to visit dasha and miroslav your answers they 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.490
 tell and show the most important moments on them you never 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.140
 blot checked i sketched some sketches in the phone so i will 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.850
 we will start to look from here to what you will soon turn to attention 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.290
 buy yourself new headphones 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.520
 Probably the first criterion for choosing headphones is the sound quality as well as 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.250
 what else do you need headphones except for skin 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.350
 great music to cuddle 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.910
 convinced that Dasha will tell you about this attention to the sound quality is 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 how comfortable I am with these headphones will be and of course on 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.200
 style and how comfortable you are with these headphones on our desk today 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.830
 almost all types of headphones you like the most and why do you 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.460
 do not like in-ear headphones as they are very comfortable nothing prevents 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.210
 even miroslava chose earbuds ki headphones from us will choose dasha i think 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.050
 it depends on what i buy first of all and basically it is for 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.300
 the phone therefore also my choice is on the ledge of liners although these skills are me 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.830
 gave a very good sound of a ringing sound and ear headphones hug and 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.530
 The best option and won inserts the next question of this nature that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.460
 Headphone design or good sound 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.209
 you headphones inlaid with pebbles and the usual gray 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.979
 inconspicuous headphones but they sound better which ones would you choose a tough answer to this 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:11.670
 the question is because both important factors are the ulcer uncompromisingly for sound good with 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.880
 beautiful pebbles that's about how these headphones are red with gold and sound 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:41.459
 that says I have not yet met the headphones that would not break for example, I 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.060
 headphones the weakest point is where the cable comes out of the jack 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.380
 what do you say about this now let's say how often you break 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.620
 headphones and the weakest headphones and for me it is an integral part since I 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.890
 case I can always therefore 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.750
 It breaks down quite often, that is, they must be constantly changed and Amati is just 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:15.250
 its not like you at the exit from the jack often enough it's like 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:26.170
 3 months and enough if the dog is not you the dog has headphones is delicious and what kind of 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:39.940
 love white black white white i think further too it breaks i think life and further 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.820
 The headphones also broke down correctly. I think in life further, there have been such 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.910
 funny cases to break the headphones of course several times at home 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.120
 in this place you break it just stops working as usual 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.480
 but sometimes it came to water for the record holder to continue with me 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.160
 To the list such a question do you agree that the headphones play the role of decoration such as 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:14.910
 earrings or bracelet for example because headphones to hear music why 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.790
 Apply some kind of pumping as an accessory there or I think that they should 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.730
 only for this can be the use of the factory from and even as you think 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.410
 be headphones important wardrobe accessory 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.520
 a kind of accessory mutual aid between you can stand out from the crowd and now 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.710
 a very big sin is a whole bunch of just headphones 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.460
 stand out single-valued red gold good taste further she believes that 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.210
 Headphones are an integral part of the wardrobe therefore under a different type 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.880
 clothes you should be in different headphones 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.490
 patients should always be consistent in style according to my clothes 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.860
 so there should be a few two or three 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.370
 Where at the moment I have 3 pairs of headphones for more 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.530
