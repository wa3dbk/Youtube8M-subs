00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
close in here at all get out of here

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.450 
close in here at all get out of here
what's<00:01:48.060> all<00:01:48.270> right<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.860> doesn't

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
what's all right because this doesn't

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.149 
what's all right because this doesn't
just<00:01:50.670> increase<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.540> blast<00:01:52.079> radius<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.799> your

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
just increase the blast radius of your

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.609 
just increase the blast radius of your
explosives<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.939> increases<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.170> blast<00:01:55.470> radius

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
explosives it increases the blast radius

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.730 
explosives it increases the blast radius
of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> explosives<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.469> decreases<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
of the explosives but decreases the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.429 
of the explosives but decreases the
damage<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.119> kind<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.570> evens<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.320> out

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
damage so it kind of evens it out

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.010

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
there's a good side to it and then

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
there's a good side to it and then
there's<00:02:04.229> also<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.770> bad<00:02:05.280> side<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.270> don't

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
there's also a bad side to it so don't

deploys this regeneration field type

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.260 
deploys this regeneration field type
thing<00:02:30.960> it's<00:02:31.680> his<00:02:31.920> armor<00:02:32.430> ability<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.060> will

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
thing it's his armor ability that will

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.340 
thing it's his armor ability that will
allow<00:02:33.690> him<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.230> punch<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.250> ground<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:36.350> burst

out<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.890> cloud<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.580> healing<00:02:39.090> powder<00:02:39.420> magic

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
out this cloud of healing powder magic

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.860 
out this cloud of healing powder magic
pixie<00:02:40.770> dust<00:02:40.920> stuff<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:42.300> seems<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.600> it'd

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
pixie dust stuff and it seems like it'd

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.190 
pixie dust stuff and it seems like it'd
probably<00:02:43.230> functions<00:02:43.920> pretty<00:02:44.400> similar<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.600> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
probably functions pretty similar to the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.730 
probably functions pretty similar to the
halo<00:02:46.680> 3<00:02:47.100> region<00:02:47.790> equipment<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:49.200> hoping

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
halo 3 region equipment but I'm hoping

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.560 
halo 3 region equipment but I'm hoping
that<00:02:49.800> it's<00:02:50.070> not<00:02:50.220> quite<00:02:50.520> as<00:02:50.640> effective<00:02:50.970> because

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
that it's not quite as effective because

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.100 
that it's not quite as effective because
that<00:02:52.080> thing<00:02:52.410> was<00:02:52.920> kind<00:02:53.490> of<00:02:53.640> frustrating

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
that thing was kind of frustrating

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.540 
that thing was kind of frustrating
annoying<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.500> seemed<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.920> little<00:02:56.280> bit

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
annoying and seemed a little bit

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.750 
annoying and seemed a little bit
overpowered<00:02:57.410> I'm<00:02:58.410> hoping<00:02:58.680> maybe<00:02:59.100> instead<00:02:59.700> of

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
overpowered I'm hoping maybe instead of

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.540 
overpowered I'm hoping maybe instead of
just<00:03:00.380> regen<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.800> shields<00:03:02.660> by<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.550> fat

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
just regen the shields by like a fat

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.940 
just regen the shields by like a fat
likes<00:03:05.940> quickly<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:06.960> starting<00:03:07.740> up<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
likes quickly like starting up the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.430 
likes quickly like starting up the
shields<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.670> regen<00:03:09.150> them<00:03:09.360> again<00:03:09.660> maybe<00:03:10.290> it

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
shields to regen them again maybe it

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.580 
shields to regen them again maybe it
just<00:03:10.470> gives<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.600> one<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.840> half<00:03:12.870> to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
just gives you like one and a half to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.090 
just gives you like one and a half to
like<00:03:13.860> two<00:03:14.160> times<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.910> shield<00:03:15.230> strength<00:03:16.230> so

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
like two times the shield strength so

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.560 
like two times the shield strength so
it's<00:03:17.220> almost<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.730> an<00:03:17.880> over<00:03:18.270> shield

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
it's almost like you have an over shield

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.630 
it's almost like you have an over shield
while<00:03:18.810> you're<00:03:18.990> in<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.470> but<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.070> don't<00:03:20.280> start

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
while you're in it but you don't start

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.220 
while you're in it but you don't start
recharging<00:03:21.480> right<00:03:21.600> away<00:03:21.780> because<00:03:21.960> it<00:03:22.170> was

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
recharging right away because it was

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.840 
recharging right away because it was
really<00:03:22.620> annoying<00:03:22.860> if<00:03:23.070> you're<00:03:23.220> trying<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.580> be

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
really annoying if you're trying to be

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.930 
really annoying if you're trying to be
are<00:03:24.000> somebody<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.900> halo<00:03:25.410> 3<00:03:25.800> while<00:03:26.730> they're<00:03:26.910> in

the<00:03:27.300> regen<00:03:27.750> field<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.440> then<00:03:28.680> they<00:03:28.980> just

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
the regen field and then they just

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.250 
the regen field and then they just
weren't<00:03:29.670> dying<00:03:30.390> because<00:03:30.690> their<00:03:30.900> shields

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
weren't dying because their shields

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.600 
weren't dying because their shields
would<00:03:31.350> just<00:03:31.560> start<00:03:31.890> instantly<00:03:32.280> start

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
recharging again and that just was

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.570 
recharging again and that just was
really<00:03:35.430> frustrating<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.360> annoying<00:03:36.630> and

mid-range<00:04:08.280> but<00:04:08.880> it's<00:04:09.000> really<00:04:09.270> just<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.960> super

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
mid-range but it's really just a super

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.780 
mid-range but it's really just a super
close<00:04:12.230> close-range<00:04:13.230> weapon<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:14.070> but<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.490> that

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
close close-range weapon and but in that

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.200 
close close-range weapon and but in that
range<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.570> just<00:04:16.020> freakin<00:04:16.620> tears<00:04:17.250> guys<00:04:17.760> to

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
range it just freakin tears guys to

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.110 
range it just freakin tears guys to
shreds<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:19.140> also<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:20.010> eats<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.520> lot<00:04:20.549> of<00:04:20.820> ammo

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
shreds it also just eats a lot of ammo

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.780 
shreds it also just eats a lot of ammo
to<00:04:21.270> it<00:04:21.390> as<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.540> super<00:04:22.080> high<00:04:22.290> fire<00:04:22.710> rate<00:04:22.979> similar

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
to it as a super high fire rate similar

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.970 
to it as a super high fire rate similar
to<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.360> new<00:04:24.720> saw<00:04:25.110> weapon

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
to that new saw weapon

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.300 
to that new saw weapon
and<00:04:26.160> boom<00:04:26.550> cut<00:04:27.090> over<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.480> here<00:04:27.920> always<00:04:28.920> getting

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
and boom cut over to here always getting

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.490 
and boom cut over to here always getting
in<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.490> banshee<00:04:29.910> watch<00:04:30.270> out<00:04:30.510> people<00:04:30.690> Banshee

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
in the banshee watch out people Banshee

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.820 
in the banshee watch out people Banshee
bombs<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.920> glow<00:04:32.250> or<00:04:32.490> alright<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.600> here<00:04:34.230> we<00:04:34.650> get

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
bombs a glow or alright so here we get

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.920 
bombs a glow or alright so here we get
to<00:04:34.950> see<00:04:35.130> some<00:04:35.370> slight<00:04:35.790> differences<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
to see some slight differences to the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.830 
to see some slight differences to the
Banshee<00:04:37.410> that<00:04:37.590> they've<00:04:37.740> done<00:04:38.100> um<00:04:38.510> now<00:04:39.510> it

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
Banshee that they've done um now it

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.040 
Banshee that they've done um now it
seems<00:04:40.140> like<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:41.370> Banshee<00:04:42.060> when<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.630> do<00:04:42.870> that

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
seems like the Banshee when you do that

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.070 
seems like the Banshee when you do that
little<00:04:43.320> back<00:04:43.890> flippy<00:04:44.430> little<00:04:44.700> dealio<00:04:45.660> thing

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
little back flippy little dealio thing

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.450 
little back flippy little dealio thing
um<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:47.580> dip<00:04:48.000> down<00:04:48.450> so<00:04:49.100> previously<00:04:50.100> what

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
um you dip down so previously what

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.440 
um you dip down so previously what
people<00:04:50.700> do<00:04:50.880> is<00:04:50.970> they<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.270> have<00:04:51.420> their

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
people do is they just have their

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.750 
people do is they just have their
Banshee<00:04:51.930> bombs<00:04:52.110> out<00:04:52.350> similar<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:52.980> what<00:04:53.130> naked

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
Banshee bombs out similar to what naked

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.060 
Banshee bombs out similar to what naked
Eli's<00:04:54.030> doing<00:04:54.240> here<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:54.810> they<00:04:55.200> would<00:04:55.380> just<00:04:55.590> get

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
Eli's doing here and they would just get

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.680 
Eli's doing here and they would just get
really<00:04:56.430> close<00:04:56.700> to<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.910> ground<00:04:57.030> shoot<00:04:57.600> a

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
really close to the ground shoot a

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.310 
really close to the ground shoot a
banshee<00:04:57.870> bomb<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.410> do<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.580> backflip<00:04:59.580> and<00:05:00.320> that

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
banshee bomb and do a backflip and that

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.290 
banshee bomb and do a backflip and that
was<00:05:01.530> really<00:05:02.010> crazy<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.730> was<00:05:02.820> really

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
was really crazy and it was really

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.640 
was really crazy and it was really
effective<00:05:03.840> it<00:05:03.930> was<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.080> really<00:05:04.350> effective

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
effective it was a really effective

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.670 
effective it was a really effective
strategy<00:05:05.250> um<00:05:05.820> now<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.420> have<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.110> be<00:05:07.260> a<00:05:07.290> little

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
strategy um now you have to be a little

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.130 
strategy um now you have to be a little
bit<00:05:07.800> more<00:05:08.070> careful<00:05:08.640> when<00:05:09.120> actually<00:05:09.750> doing

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
bit more careful when actually doing

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.410 
bit more careful when actually doing
that<00:05:10.320> because<00:05:10.560> when<00:05:11.190> you<00:05:11.340> do<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.790> backflip

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
that because when you do that backflip

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.170 
that because when you do that backflip
you<00:05:12.870> actually<00:05:13.410> dip<00:05:13.800> down<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.610> you'll<00:05:14.820> kind<00:05:15.090> of

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
you actually dip down and you'll kind of

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.960 
you actually dip down and you'll kind of
hit<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.510> ground<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.140> be<00:05:16.890> much<00:05:17.520> more

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
hit the ground and be much more

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.090 
hit the ground and be much more
vulnerable<00:05:18.570> or<00:05:18.840> potentially<00:05:19.710> even<00:05:19.740> hit<00:05:20.010> the

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
vulnerable or potentially even hit the

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.700 
vulnerable or potentially even hit the
ground<00:05:20.280> so<00:05:20.520> hard<00:05:20.670> that<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.060> hurt<00:05:21.690> yourself<00:05:21.810> so

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
ground so hard that you hurt yourself so

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.820 
ground so hard that you hurt yourself so
a<00:05:23.240> little<00:05:24.240> bit<00:05:24.450> more<00:05:24.810> difficult<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.560> pull<00:05:25.800> off

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
a little bit more difficult to pull off

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.240 
a little bit more difficult to pull off
that<00:05:25.950> trick<00:05:26.510> also<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:28.020> actual<00:05:28.650> backflip

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
that trick also the actual backflip

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.820 
that trick also the actual backflip
itself<00:05:29.670> seems<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.570> be<00:05:30.870> a<00:05:30.900> little<00:05:31.290> bit<00:05:31.380> slower

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
itself seems to be a little bit slower

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.910 
itself seems to be a little bit slower
but<00:05:32.550> even<00:05:32.850> with<00:05:33.120> these<00:05:33.420> slight<00:05:33.870> nerfs<00:05:34.380> if<00:05:34.680> you

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
but even with these slight nerfs if you

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.250 
but even with these slight nerfs if you
will<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.550> vehicle<00:05:35.940> it<00:05:36.270> still<00:05:36.840> seems<00:05:37.080> like

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
will to the vehicle it still seems like

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.590 
will to the vehicle it still seems like
in<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.280> right<00:05:38.490> hands<00:05:38.850> it<00:05:38.940> could<00:05:39.180> be<00:05:39.360> an

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
in the right hands it could be an

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.410 
in the right hands it could be an
ultra-powerful<00:05:40.590> just<00:05:41.130> demolishing<00:05:41.940> every

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
ultra-powerful just demolishing every

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.660 
ultra-powerful just demolishing every
one<00:05:42.570> vehicle<00:05:42.870> like<00:05:43.650> it's<00:05:43.830> been<00:05:44.010> in<00:05:44.250> the

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
one vehicle like it's been in the

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.300 
one vehicle like it's been in the
previous<00:05:45.180> games<00:05:45.830> alright<00:05:46.830> let's<00:05:47.040> cut<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.250> the

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
that's right people the beam rifle is

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.960 
that's right people the beam rifle is
returning<00:06:02.730> in<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.810> halo<00:06:04.440> 4<00:06:04.950> the<00:06:05.400> Covenant

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
returning in to halo 4 the Covenant

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.500 
returning in to halo 4 the Covenant
sniper<00:06:06.360> rifle<00:06:06.840> that<00:06:07.230> we<00:06:07.560> all<00:06:07.770> love<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:09.180> design

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
sniper rifle that we all love the design

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.140 
sniper rifle that we all love the design
of<00:06:09.540> it<00:06:09.750> has<00:06:09.960> changed<00:06:10.560> significantly<00:06:11.120> but<00:06:12.120> it

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
of it has changed significantly but it

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.360 
of it has changed significantly but it
still<00:06:12.420> seems<00:06:12.960> to<00:06:13.050> function<00:06:13.320> very<00:06:13.890> similarly

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
still seems to function very similarly

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.860 
still seems to function very similarly
to<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:15.240> classic<00:06:16.020> beam<00:06:16.380> rifle<00:06:16.770> oh<00:06:17.000> man<00:06:18.000> Andy

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
to the classic beam rifle oh man Andy

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.390 
to the classic beam rifle oh man Andy
picks<00:06:19.080> up<00:06:19.200> a<00:06:19.290> triple<00:06:19.500> kill<00:06:19.830> with<00:06:19.950> it<00:06:20.100> that's

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
picks up a triple kill with it that's

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.510 
picks up a triple kill with it that's
just<00:06:20.580> nasty<00:06:21.410> alright<00:06:22.410> another<00:06:22.650> jump<00:06:23.070> cut<00:06:23.310> all

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
just nasty alright another jump cut all

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.030 
just nasty alright another jump cut all
right<00:06:24.060> here<00:06:24.300> he's<00:06:24.510> switching<00:06:25.080> to<00:06:25.350> the<00:06:25.470> jetpack

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
right here he's switching to the jetpack

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.820 
right here he's switching to the jetpack
and<00:06:26.070> here<00:06:26.490> we<00:06:26.670> seem<00:06:26.910> using<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:27.530> yeah<00:06:28.530> it

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
and here we seem using it and yeah it

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.890 
and here we seem using it and yeah it
pretty<00:06:29.100> much<00:06:29.220> seems<00:06:29.580> like<00:06:29.820> it<00:06:29.940> functions<00:06:30.300> very

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
pretty much seems like it functions very

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.430 
pretty much seems like it functions very
very<00:06:31.440> very<00:06:31.800> similarly<00:06:32.400> to<00:06:32.610> the<00:06:33.210> reach<00:06:33.720> jetpack

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
very very similarly to the reach jetpack

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.880 
very very similarly to the reach jetpack
but<00:06:34.800> maybe<00:06:35.160> is<00:06:35.400> a<00:06:35.430> little<00:06:35.550> bit<00:06:36.290> less<00:06:37.290> thrust

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
but maybe is a little bit less thrust

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.800 
but maybe is a little bit less thrust
you<00:06:38.280> know<00:06:38.400> it's<00:06:38.550> not<00:06:38.670> quite<00:06:38.970> as<00:06:39.150> quick<00:06:39.540> and

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
you know it's not quite as quick and

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.750 
you know it's not quite as quick and
snappy<00:06:40.169> to<00:06:40.290> get<00:06:40.440> you<00:06:40.560> into<00:06:40.710> the<00:06:40.889> air<00:06:41.040> it<00:06:41.400> takes

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
snappy to get you into the air it takes

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.430 
snappy to get you into the air it takes
a<00:06:41.910> little<00:06:42.030> bit<00:06:42.180> longer<00:06:42.480> and<00:06:42.780> it's<00:06:42.900> not<00:06:43.050> quite

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
a little bit longer and it's not quite

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.920 
a little bit longer and it's not quite
as<00:06:43.620> powerful<00:06:44.060> also<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.330> meter<00:06:45.630> on<00:06:45.900> the

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
as powerful also the meter on the

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.409 
as powerful also the meter on the
jetpack<00:06:46.590> how<00:06:46.919> long<00:06:47.340> the<00:06:47.550> jetpack<00:06:47.940> lasts

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
jetpack how long the jetpack lasts

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.629 
jetpack how long the jetpack lasts
actually<00:06:49.230> seems<00:06:49.500> to<00:06:49.680> be<00:06:49.800> considerably

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
actually seems to be considerably

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.020 
actually seems to be considerably
shorter<00:06:51.210> than<00:06:51.780> what<00:06:52.290> it<00:06:52.410> was<00:06:52.440> in<00:06:52.919> reach<00:06:53.370> but<00:06:54.000> I

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
shorter than what it was in reach but I

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.240 
shorter than what it was in reach but I
assume<00:06:54.419> if<00:06:54.630> you<00:06:54.870> combine<00:06:55.260> armor<00:06:55.830> ability

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
assume if you combine armor ability

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.700 
assume if you combine armor ability
efficiency<00:06:56.820> with<00:06:57.450> the<00:06:57.480> day<00:06:57.810> pack<00:06:58.080> that<00:06:58.500> could

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
efficiency with the day pack that could

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.820 
efficiency with the day pack that could
be<00:06:58.830> a<00:06:58.860> deadly<00:06:59.430> combination<00:07:00.260> but<00:07:01.260> that<00:07:01.440> is<00:07:01.590> all

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
be a deadly combination but that is all

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.460 
be a deadly combination but that is all

because I post new halo videos every day

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.260 
because I post new halo videos every day
if<00:07:12.810> you<00:07:13.260> saw<00:07:13.620> something<00:07:14.190> in<00:07:14.370> this<00:07:14.639> video<00:07:15.030> that

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
if you saw something in this video that

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.300 
if you saw something in this video that
was<00:07:15.419> like<00:07:15.690> what<00:07:16.260> the<00:07:16.290> heck<00:07:16.650> I've<00:07:16.830> never<00:07:16.979> seen

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
was like what the heck I've never seen

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.250 
was like what the heck I've never seen
that<00:07:17.520> before<00:07:17.729> and<00:07:18.389> he<00:07:18.450> didn't<00:07:18.780> talk<00:07:18.960> about<00:07:19.139> it

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
that before and he didn't talk about it

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.920 
that before and he didn't talk about it
why<00:07:19.710> it's<00:07:20.250> probably<00:07:20.940> because<00:07:21.210> I've<00:07:21.660> already

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
why it's probably because I've already

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.500 
why it's probably because I've already
made<00:07:22.169> a<00:07:22.229> video<00:07:22.560> on<00:07:22.860> it<00:07:23.040> so<00:07:23.550> i'll<00:07:23.970> have<00:07:24.240> some
