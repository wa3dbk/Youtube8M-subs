up with is that okay and then do this

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.040 
up with is that okay and then do this
thing<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.770> other<00:00:47.800> side<00:00:47.980> but<00:00:48.940> it<00:00:49.180> knots<00:00:49.690> not

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
thing to the other side but it knots not

00:00:50.050 --> 00:01:01.049 
thing to the other side but it knots not
as<00:00:50.170> much<00:00:51.030> okay<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:56.020> a<00:00:56.230> little<00:00:56.500> bit
