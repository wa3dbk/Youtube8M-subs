00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
inspired makeup look and basically what

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.560 
inspired makeup look and basically what
I<00:00:34.559> came<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:34.980> was<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> vibrant<00:00:35.880> purple<00:00:36.210> with

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
I came up with was a vibrant purple with

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.410 
I came up with was a vibrant purple with
a<00:00:36.600> black<00:00:36.989> kind<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.860> smoked<00:00:38.219> out<00:00:38.399> look<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
a black kind of smoked out look with a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.900 
a black kind of smoked out look with a
winged<00:00:39.750> liner<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:40.739> underneath<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.760> had

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
winged liner and then underneath I had

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.510 
winged liner and then underneath I had
the<00:00:42.090> black<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> white<00:00:42.690> stripes<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.710> so

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the black and white stripes going on so

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.770 
the black and white stripes going on so
that's<00:00:44.610> probably<00:00:44.879> why<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.210> looks<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.629> little

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that's probably why it looks a little

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.130 
that's probably why it looks a little
weird<00:00:45.989> from<00:00:46.289> far<00:00:46.530> away<00:00:47.239> but<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.420> looks<00:00:48.570> really

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
weird from far away but it looks really

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.650 
weird from far away but it looks really
awesome<00:00:49.410> close<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.730> kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.390> person

awesome close up and kind of in person

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
awesome close up and kind of in person
looks<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.379> cool<00:00:52.590> far<00:00:52.829> away<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
looks really cool far away I think the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
looks really cool far away I think the
cameras<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.120> picking<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.600> weird<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
