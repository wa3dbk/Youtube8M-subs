studio strobes you have to build by

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.760 
studio strobes you have to build by
putting<00:00:15.269> together<00:00:15.420> their<00:00:15.870> rods<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.619> have

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
putting together their rods and we have

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.920 
putting together their rods and we have
several<00:00:17.039> videos<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.760> how<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.150> symbol<00:00:18.720> those

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.130 
to as bayonet but because it's a generic
mount<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.059> might<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.540> referred<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.989> as

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
mount you might see it referred to as

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350 
mount you might see it referred to as
several<00:00:37.559> times<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.520> amount<00:00:38.670> actually<00:00:38.969> has

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
several times this amount actually has

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.660 
several times this amount actually has
the<00:00:39.600> three<00:00:40.020> square<00:00:40.530> blocks<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> back

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the three square blocks on the back

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.360 
the three square blocks on the back
which<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.719> course<00:00:42.899> master<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.100> three

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
which will of course master to three

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.000 
which will of course master to three
inlets<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.180> allow<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.530> click<00:00:46.860> it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
inlets to allow you to you know click it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.260 
inlets to allow you to you know click it
into<00:00:47.129> place<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.590> quick<00:00:50.370> setup<00:00:50.789> really

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
into place so quick setup really

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510 
into place so quick setup really
literally<00:00:51.690> mean<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.649> take<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.100> center

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
literally mean I can take this center

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.450 
literally mean I can take this center
part<00:00:53.730> press<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.690> work<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.920> soft<00:00:56.219> box

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
part press it in work and the soft box

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.299 
part press it in work and the soft box
will<00:00:56.730> pop<00:00:57.000> open<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.539> an<00:00:57.840> umbrella<00:00:58.140> quick<00:00:58.410> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
will pop open like an umbrella quick so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
will pop open like an umbrella quick so
I'm<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.969> by<00:01:00.030> stabilizing<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.989> on

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
I'm gonna do that by stabilizing it on

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.160 
I'm gonna do that by stabilizing it on
the<00:01:01.230> table<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.640> pushing<00:01:03.510> down<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:04.019> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the table and just pushing down in that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740 
the table and just pushing down in that
center<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> lock<00:01:06.240> into<00:01:06.479> place

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
center so it's going to lock into place

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.140 
center so it's going to lock into place
just<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.340> see<00:01:08.549> that's<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.970> lot

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
just like that you can see that's a lot

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 
just like that you can see that's a lot
easier<00:01:09.420> than<00:01:09.900> putting<00:01:10.140> together<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.799> rods<00:01:11.040> on

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
easier than putting together the rods on

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.090 
easier than putting together the rods on
a<00:01:11.369> softbox<00:01:11.970> once<00:01:12.960> I've<00:01:13.170> done<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.890> attach

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
a softbox once I've done that to attach

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.649 
a softbox once I've done that to attach
it<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> strobe<00:01:14.820> I'm<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.299> gonna<00:01:15.390> grab

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it to the strobe I'm just gonna grab

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:25.850 
it to the strobe I'm just gonna grab
this<00:01:15.930> Center<00:01:16.409> pole<00:01:16.670> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.790> line<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:24.860> now

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
this Center pole kind of line up now

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.039 
this Center pole kind of line up now
you'll<00:01:26.070> notice<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.759> particular<00:01:27.390> stroke

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you'll notice on this particular stroke

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.960 
you'll notice on this particular stroke
I<00:01:28.080> had<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> modeling<00:01:29.070> Bowl<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.490> there<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I had the modeling Bowl in there and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.310 
I had the modeling Bowl in there and
there<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.360> plenty<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.840> clearance<00:01:31.200> between

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
there was plenty of clearance between

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.859 
there was plenty of clearance between
the<00:01:31.650> modeling<00:01:32.130> bulb<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.549> where<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.299> central

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the modeling bulb and where this central

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.380 
the modeling bulb and where this central
part<00:01:34.020> walks<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.950> check<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.060> stir

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
part walks down to check your stir

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.330 
part walks down to check your stir
before<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.110> attach<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.100> necessary

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
before you attach it and if necessary

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.609 
before you attach it and if necessary
take<00:01:39.060> off<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.479> modeling<00:01:39.900> bulb<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
take off that modeling bulb you

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.460 
take off that modeling bulb you
definitely<00:01:41.100> don't<00:01:41.220> want<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> break<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
definitely don't want to break that

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.520 
definitely don't want to break that
giving<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> big<00:01:43.770> mess<00:01:44.040> for<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:46.229> does

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
giving a big mess for you now this does

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.490 
giving a big mess for you now this does
come

with<00:01:48.310> inner<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.940> outter<00:01:49.560> diffusers<00:01:50.560> as<00:01:51.250> well

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
with inner and outter diffusers as well

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.500

get that kind of extra diffusion from

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.580 
get that kind of extra diffusion from
the<00:01:57.910> grid<00:01:58.150> I<00:01:58.450> just<00:01:58.810> want<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.080> show<00:01:59.260> you<00:01:59.320> real

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
the grid I just want to show you real
