00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.539
 hello today we are going to talk about a new 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.099
 franchise that has reached the market that 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.439
 is developed by a not so acid 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.180
 known called radiator that in case not 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.220
 they only knew that they created the games of 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.880
 golf world for psp and then they took 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.880
 what they demand 3 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.110
 and now they have made the great leap of psp 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.210
 playstation 4 and when they go to the store 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.149
 they will see your name in this box 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 game of igor and itineris and x but after 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.670
 of having seen all the trailers of 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 these gentlemen with beards who look 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.160
 'miguel grau' really worth it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.160
 they buy it 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.660
 the story takes us to meet a 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.430
 secret order of gentlemen who come 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.350
 since the king Arthur's time on the table 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.150
 round thanks to a special drink 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.690
 the characters have been able to survive by 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.520
 decades until the year 1886 the scenario 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.650
 in the neo-Victorian version of london 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.300
 during the industrial revolution but it 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.710
 introduce supernatural elements that 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.990
 they give way to creatures like men 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.820
 wolf the premise is interesting but 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.790
 sometimes it is somewhat confusing saying that 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.220
 too many unsolved questions remain 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.720
 the principal is one of the knights 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 who is looking for a rebel group 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.170
 that threatens the order throughout the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.550
 story is shown in scenes that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.539
 explain their relationship with the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.700
 other members and usually 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.619
 work the issue is that in the end no 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.050
 I felt a lot of attachment towards any character 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.820
 in particular the visual aspect of 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.380
 game is what stands out most and is here 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.990
 where there is nothing to reproach the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.340
 jove retail and six the graphic engine that 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.929
 have created allows several of the 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.060
 most impressive images that have 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.770
 seen in video games the difference between 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.259
 the cinematics and the gameplay is 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.640
 practically imperceptible so much so 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.280
 that sometimes I did not know they already had 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.360
 control over my character is admirable 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.040
 all the work that has been done to 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.090
 levels details of all the characters 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.979
 weapons 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.960
 the scenarios the animations and the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.579
 elimination is not only one of the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.049
 more cinematic experiences that 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.149
 has seen but is surprised that with 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.830
 so many elements I have not found nor 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.509
 a single bogey throughout the company 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.729
 the game presents two very mechanical 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.200
 similar uncharted software of which 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.090
 you have to shoot and take cover 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.860
 but add the guns of nikola tesla 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.440
 for example this one that has rays and is 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.810
 super cool then you also have the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.670
 ability to encourage time as in 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.230
 netflix or in max payne right now I'm going to 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.230
 change my story and they will see very 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.230
 disparate 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.080
 and then also of course you have the 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.739
 floating barrels that are in the background 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.989
 they have two types come the types of 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.420
 pure action after parts of stealth 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.250
 which are much slower in which 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.709
 you have to let's say good night 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.300
 to this gentleman and you have to synchronize 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.880
 perfectly attack without another attack 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.880
 it works and there was already a good night 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.000
 and finally you have those scenes of kuyt 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.430
 at the level where you have to mark the button 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.990
 correct at the right time where 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.940
 fight against werewolves but as you see 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.470
 there is no difference between what is 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.520
 gameplay and cinematic everything looks 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.520
 simply spectacular 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.280
 but as beautiful as you can see 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.770
 graphics the gameplay is where he said 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.000
 start to catch a bit the game seems 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.380
 be in constant conflict of 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.090
 each other is an experience 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.340
 visual or a video game with more 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.690
 interaction sometimes works and it 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.000
 gets an interesting balance between 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.709
 both aspects but the campaign is so 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.120
 linear and there are so many quick time events 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.700
 that at times it looks like a demo 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.040
 technique that a video game the mechanics 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.810
 shooting and stealth work fine but 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.300
 they do not seem to do anything new for the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.010
 gender apart from looking very pretty the 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.599
 rhythm in the campaign is quite leisurely 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.610
 and constantly takes away your control 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.080
 to show you some kinematics the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.850
 artificial intelligence in enemies 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.260
 it's a bit disappointing and for some 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.239
 reason is repeated in scenes with is 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.730
 exactly the same mechanics that I 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.080
 they gave the yogurt sensations what 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.760
 was what it was is that the game has the 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.799
 potential with all the context and 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.450
 characters that also present you the 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.950
 incredible presentation is something that everyone 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.260
 they should see even once in their 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.819
 life but the lack of ambition in the 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.530
 gameplay and the little snag of the 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.060
 Narrative end up overshadowing what 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.430
 got to have been one of the best 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.989
 exclusive titles of playstation me 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.670
 It will take seven or eight hours to finish 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 the 16 chapters of the story and 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.980
 after that pitifully there is no 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.750
 almost not a sense 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.400
 replay it there's no way 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.680
 multiplayer or extra content that 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.380
 unlock normally I do not complain about 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.970
 prices and experience it deserves but 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.590
 pay 60 dollars for something not so 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.420
 extraordinary makes me think the two 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.090
 times before going to the store and there 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.550
 preferred to wait for it to go down in price 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.020
 I expected a little more from dior and tinelli 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.669
 six or at the graphic level of 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.830
 cinematographic that yes there is nothing that 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.000
 I'll doubt this is a wonder and it's a 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.550
 new reference of what the playstation 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.590
 4 can do but in narrative issues 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.360
 and gameplay I feel that is the 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.070
 franchise is still not defined very well 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.490
 and relies heavily on what others have 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.490
 done in the past 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.430
 so the potential is there between the 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.840
 neo-Victorian world that have created the 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.550
 characters have introduced and the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.500
 supernatural elements I think the 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.000
 sequel will be very interesting without 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.980
 However, this delivery remains as a 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.630
 first step for something bigger than going 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.280
 to come after is something like that pretty much 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.110
 as uncharted one in precision 3 the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.560
 which was good but the best came 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.560
 after
