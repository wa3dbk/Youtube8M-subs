00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
without necessarily limping you know and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.609 
without necessarily limping you know and
I'm<00:01:29.880> again<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.300> don't<00:01:30.690> a<00:01:30.840> problem<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.350> limping

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
I'm again I don't a problem with limping

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.930 
I'm again I don't a problem with limping
as<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> whole<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.580> these<00:01:32.670> kind<00:01:32.910> of

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
as a whole but in these kind of

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.640 
as a whole but in these kind of
situations<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.630> could<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.930> smaller<00:01:34.229> raises

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
situations you could make smaller raises

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.550 
situations you could make smaller raises
like<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> blinds<00:01:36.080> jun<00:01:37.080> 5<00:01:37.320> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
like with you know the blinds jun 5 you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.109 
like with you know the blinds jun 5 you
can<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.830> make<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:37.979> 10<00:01:38.280> make<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> min<00:01:38.940> raise

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
can just make it 10 make the min raise

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.779 
can just make it 10 make the min raise
or<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.869> make<00:01:40.050> it<00:01:40.170> 12<00:01:40.530> 14<00:01:40.979> or<00:01:41.100> even<00:01:41.280> 15<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
or you know make it 12 14 or even 15 and

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.419 
or you know make it 12 14 or even 15 and
just<00:01:41.910> go<00:01:42.030> ahead<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.270> continue<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.929> do<00:01:43.080> that

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
just go ahead and continue to do that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.490 
just go ahead and continue to do that
when<00:01:44.429> you<00:01:44.520> are<00:01:44.640> limping<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.720> definitely<00:01:46.289> makes

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
when you are limping it definitely makes

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.320 
when you are limping it definitely makes
a<00:01:46.590> possible<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:47.039> smaller<00:01:47.310> whereas<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.090> you're

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
a possible bit smaller whereas if you're

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.700 
a possible bit smaller whereas if you're
playing<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.750> heads-up<00:01:48.990> match<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.530> your

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
playing a heads-up match and your

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.320 
playing a heads-up match and your
opponent<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.250> always<00:01:50.520> raising<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.210> minimum

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
opponent is always raising the minimum

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.790 
opponent is always raising the minimum
and<00:01:51.630> you're<00:01:51.780> always<00:01:52.050> limping<00:01:52.380> you're

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
and you're always limping you're

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.499 
and you're always limping you're
automatically<00:01:53.580> giving<00:01:53.940> up<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.149> little<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
automatically giving up a little bit of

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.760 
automatically giving up a little bit of
an<00:01:54.600> advantage<00:01:54.780> because<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.560> you're<00:01:55.679> in

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
an advantage because when you're in

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.680 
an advantage because when you're in
position<00:01:55.890> you're<00:01:56.550> playing<00:01:56.700> smaller<00:01:57.090> pots<00:01:57.420> so

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
position you're playing smaller pots so

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.469 
position you're playing smaller pots so
I<00:01:58.310> wouldn't<00:01:59.310> use<00:01:59.429> limping<00:01:59.819> as<00:01:59.940> a<00:01:59.970> strategy

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
I wouldn't use limping as a strategy

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.609 
I wouldn't use limping as a strategy
that<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.660> and<00:02:01.020> when<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.289> playing<00:02:01.440> deep

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
that I and when you're playing deep

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.320 
that I and when you're playing deep
stack<00:02:01.830> poker<00:02:02.009> as<00:02:02.190> much<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.759> tournaments

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
stack poker as much in tournaments

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.580 
stack poker as much in tournaments
especially<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.750> play<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.050> heads<00:02:04.289> up<00:02:04.440> sit

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
especially you play like heads up sit

as<00:03:56.110> its<00:03:56.500> own<00:03:56.620> entity<00:03:56.970> but<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.240> lot<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.570> very

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
as its own entity but a lot of very

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.380 
as its own entity but a lot of very
successful<00:03:59.620> players<00:03:59.950> they<00:04:00.850> use<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.030> lot<00:04:01.210> of

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
successful players they use a lot of

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.950 
successful players they use a lot of
programs<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.140> tell<00:04:02.350> them<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:03.700> know<00:04:04.240> where

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
programs to tell them you know where

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.780 
programs to tell them you know where
their<00:04:05.140> most<00:04:05.350> profitable<00:04:05.680> what<00:04:06.430> their<00:04:06.580> most

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
their most profitable what their most

their most profitable what their most
profitable<00:04:07.030> hand<00:04:07.510> range<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:08.020> just<00:04:08.560> all<00:04:08.770> that

profitable hand range is just all that
stuff<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.460> can<00:04:09.670> all<00:04:09.790> be<00:04:09.820> recorded<00:04:10.630> and

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
stuff that can all be recorded and

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:41.890 
stuff that can all be recorded and
tracked

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.119 

now<00:04:42.900> let's<00:04:43.110> talk<00:04:43.319> a<00:04:43.349> little<00:04:43.470> bit<00:04:43.710> about<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:43.919> very

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129 
now let's talk a little bit about a very

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.680 
now let's talk a little bit about a very
risky<00:04:44.490> play<00:04:44.699> and<00:04:44.879> that's<00:04:44.940> check<00:04:45.240> raising<00:04:45.629> the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
risky play and that's check raising the

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.020 
risky play and that's check raising the
turn<00:04:46.129> one<00:04:47.129> of<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.340> other<00:04:47.490> weapons<00:04:47.970> that

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
turn one of the other weapons that

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.460 
turn one of the other weapons that
you're<00:04:48.180> disposing<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.750> turn<00:04:49.020> is<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.259> check

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
you're disposing the turn is the check

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.680 
you're disposing the turn is the check
raise<00:04:49.680> once<00:04:50.340> again<00:04:50.490> though<00:04:50.819> this<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.449> play

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
raise once again though this is a play

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.939 
raise once again though this is a play
that<00:04:51.810> should<00:04:51.960> be<00:04:52.050> used<00:04:52.169> often<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.740> limit

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
that should be used often and limit

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.070 
that should be used often and limit
hold'em<00:04:53.250> but<00:04:53.550> very<00:04:53.849> sporadically<00:04:54.479> no<00:04:54.780> limit

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
hold'em but very sporadically no limit

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.749 
hold'em but very sporadically no limit
for<00:04:55.409> a<00:04:55.440> few<00:04:55.620> key<00:04:55.800> reasons<00:04:56.190> if<00:04:56.370> you're<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.580> small

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
for a few key reasons if you're a small

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.210 
for a few key reasons if you're a small
ball<00:04:56.970> player<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.990> most<00:04:58.139> obvious<00:04:58.440> reason<00:04:59.069> is

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
ball player the most obvious reason is

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.800 
ball player the most obvious reason is
that<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.490> makes<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.819> pot<00:04:59.970> bigger<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:00.750> you

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
that it makes the pot bigger so you

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.330 
that it makes the pot bigger so you
better<00:05:01.139> be<00:05:01.289> sure<00:05:01.319> that's<00:05:01.530> something<00:05:02.039> you<00:05:02.129> want

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
better be sure that's something you want

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.740 
better be sure that's something you want
to<00:05:02.370> have<00:05:02.520> happen<00:05:02.699> before<00:05:03.150> making<00:05:03.330> this<00:05:03.479> play

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
to have happen before making this play

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.409 
to have happen before making this play
to<00:05:04.590> being<00:05:05.220> out<00:05:05.340> of<00:05:05.370> position<00:05:05.580> if<00:05:06.240> your

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
to being out of position if your

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.360 
to being out of position if your
opponent<00:05:06.659> calls<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.229> on<00:05:07.319> the<00:05:07.409> turn<00:05:07.620> you'll<00:05:08.159> be

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
opponent calls you on the turn you'll be

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.710 
opponent calls you on the turn you'll be
faced<00:05:08.639> with<00:05:08.759> difficult<00:05:09.180> decision<00:05:09.569> on<00:05:09.659> the

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
faced with difficult decision on the

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.350 
faced with difficult decision on the
river<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.169> three<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:11.069> check<00:05:11.580> raise<00:05:11.849> could<00:05:12.150> cost

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
river and three a check raise could cost

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.360 
river and three a check raise could cost
you<00:05:12.569> pots<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.080> could<00:05:13.259> have<00:05:13.349> one<00:05:13.560> that

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
you pots that you could have one that

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.980 
you pots that you could have one that
could<00:05:14.550> happen<00:05:14.699> one<00:05:14.969> of<00:05:15.000> two<00:05:15.240> ways<00:05:15.389> either<00:05:15.659> a

great care the play also goes against

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.010 
great care the play also goes against
many<00:05:32.190> small<00:05:32.550> ball<00:05:32.729> concepts<00:05:33.300> that<00:05:33.900> is

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
many small ball concepts that is

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.450 
many small ball concepts that is
designed<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.560> get<00:05:34.680> more<00:05:34.830> money<00:05:35.009> in<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.280> pot

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
designed to get more money in the pot

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.100 
designed to get more money in the pot
which<00:05:35.849> will<00:05:36.030> force<00:05:36.330> bigger<00:05:36.629> bets<00:05:36.840> on<00:05:36.990> the

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
which will force bigger bets on the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.050 
which will force bigger bets on the
river<00:05:37.289> this<00:05:38.009> is<00:05:38.159> good<00:05:38.460> when<00:05:38.699> you<00:05:38.789> have<00:05:38.819> the

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
river this is good when you have the

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.209 
river this is good when you have the
nuts<00:05:39.240> are<00:05:39.360> close<00:05:39.539> to<00:05:39.750> it<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.050> it's<00:05:40.409> also<00:05:40.590> why<00:05:41.190> I

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
nuts are close to it and it's also why I

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:42.770 
nuts are close to it and it's also why I
suggest<00:05:41.699> that<00:05:41.789> when<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.000> do<00:05:42.180> check<00:05:42.449> raise<00:05:42.629> the

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
suggest that when you do check raise the

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.340 
suggest that when you do check raise the
term<00:05:42.960> that<00:05:43.349> you<00:05:43.469> have<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.620> monster<00:05:43.889> hand
