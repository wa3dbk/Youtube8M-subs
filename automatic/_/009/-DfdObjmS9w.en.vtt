you<00:00:19.140> guys<00:00:19.320> know<00:00:19.560> basically<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:21.480> way<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.779> my

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
you guys know basically the way I do my

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.410 
you guys know basically the way I do my
sticks<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> higher<00:00:23.130> pocket<00:00:23.699> right<00:00:24.300> on

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
sticks is with a higher pocket right on

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.529 
sticks is with a higher pocket right on
the<00:00:24.510> lip<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> shooting<00:00:25.289> string<00:00:26.539> but

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the lip of the shooting string but

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.439 
the lip of the shooting string but
basically<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:29.130> stick<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.640> still<00:00:29.880> strong<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
basically the stick is still strong the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.530 
basically the stick is still strong the
same<00:00:30.689> way<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.550> other<00:00:32.669> sticks<00:00:33.120> just

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
same way that I do my other sticks just

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.630 
same way that I do my other sticks just
what<00:00:34.440> you'll<00:00:34.590> find<00:00:34.829> when<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> next

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
what you'll find when we do the next

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790 
what you'll find when we do the next
couple<00:00:36.090> heads<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.410> biggest

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
couple heads is that the biggest

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.459 
couple heads is that the biggest
difference<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> down<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> bottom<00:00:39.469> as

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
difference is down here in the bottom as

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.150 
difference is down here in the bottom as
you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.790> one's<00:00:42.000> loose<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
you can see this one's loose here so the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
you can see this one's loose here so the
pocket<00:00:44.610> forms<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.480> towards<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> bottom

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
pocket forms really towards the bottom

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.920 
pocket forms really towards the bottom
rather<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.739> tighten<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.750> are

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
rather if you tighten it up and you are

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.330 
rather if you tighten it up and you are
loosen<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> side<00:00:50.039> walls

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
loosen up a little bit the side walls

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.939 
loosen up a little bit the side walls
the<00:00:50.610> pocket<00:00:51.030> gets<00:00:51.210> higher<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> lot<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the pocket gets higher so a lot of it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.150 
the pocket gets higher so a lot of it
depends<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.210> bottom<00:00:54.629> string<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:56.039> can

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
depends on this bottom string but we can

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.549 
depends on this bottom string but we can
go<00:00:56.280> through<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> top<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.210> pretty<00:00:57.930> basic<00:00:59.030> and

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
go through the top here pretty basic and

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.139 
go through the top here pretty basic and
the<00:01:01.559> sidewalls<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> loop<00:01:02.760> around<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the sidewalls I like the loop around the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.969 
the sidewalls I like the loop around the
sidewalls

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
sidewalls

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.460 
sidewalls
the<00:01:04.979> same<00:01:05.250> way<00:01:05.519> didn't<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.689> didn't<00:01:07.049> skip<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the same way didn't I didn't skip a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.740 
the same way didn't I didn't skip a
string<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:09.260> each<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.510> after<00:01:12.510> another

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
string so each one is after another

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.920 
string so each one is after another
starting<00:01:13.260> from<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> top<00:01:14.030> right<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:16.490> and

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
starting from the top right up here and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.550 
starting from the top right up here and
yeah<00:01:18.930> using<00:01:19.619> mark<00:01:19.830> mesh<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
yeah using mark mesh on this one and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.880 
yeah using mark mesh on this one and
it's<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:23.030> mesh<00:01:24.030> that's<00:01:24.270> coated<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> wax

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.660 

so<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.400> lasts<00:01:29.820> longer<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.780> molds<00:01:30.990> quicker

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
so it lasts longer and it molds quicker

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.039 
so it lasts longer and it molds quicker
again<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> pocket<00:01:33.210> slow<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.720> more<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
again the pocket slow for more of a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.920 
again the pocket slow for more of a
carryin<00:01:34.439> attackman<00:01:35.040> um<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.659> here

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
carryin attackman um as you can see here

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
carryin attackman um as you can see here
the<00:01:37.439> same<00:01:37.650> style<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.250> all<00:01:38.430> my<00:01:38.460> sticks

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the same style that I do all my sticks

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.880 
the same style that I do all my sticks
one<00:01:39.720> Vita<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.320> pretty<00:01:40.619> tight<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.270> then<00:01:42.890> one

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
one Vita it's pretty tight and then one

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.429 
one Vita it's pretty tight and then one
more<00:01:44.100> shooter<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.640> nylon<00:01:47.240> typically<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.570> do

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
more shooter in a nylon typically I do

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.370 
more shooter in a nylon typically I do
the<00:01:49.950> two<00:01:50.100> shooters<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> nylon<00:01:51.229> sometimes<00:01:52.229> I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the two shooters in a nylon sometimes I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.410 
the two shooters in a nylon sometimes I
can<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:53.040> shooter<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> nylon<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
can just do one shooter in a nylon but I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
can just do one shooter in a nylon but I
always<00:01:54.930> need<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.380> nylon<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.159> prevent<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
always need this nylon to prevent the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.140 
always need this nylon to prevent the
ball
