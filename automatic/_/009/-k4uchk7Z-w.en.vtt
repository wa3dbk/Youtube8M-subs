00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.950 
damn it fuck ah bitch whatever let's
continue<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.700> the<00:05:34.730> LZ<00:05:34.940> which<00:05:36.340> what's<00:05:37.340> that<00:05:37.430> I

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
continue to the LZ which what's that I

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.320 
continue to the LZ which what's that I
guess<00:05:38.960> uh<00:05:39.320> that<00:05:40.010> looks<00:05:40.190> like<00:05:40.280> red<00:05:40.580> smoke<00:05:41.000> so

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
guess uh that looks like red smoke so

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:48.730 
guess uh that looks like red smoke so
I'm<00:05:41.420> guessing<00:05:41.660> that's<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.080> LZ<00:05:42.470> now<00:05:47.740> let's

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
I'm guessing that's the LZ now let's

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.629 
I'm guessing that's the LZ now let's
keep<00:05:48.950> going<00:05:49.250> here

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.010 

I<00:05:52.699> guess<00:05:53.449> this<00:05:53.569> is<00:05:53.719> the<00:05:53.749> end<00:05:53.870> of<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.139> map

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.830 

cool<00:05:58.590> or<00:05:58.710> reach<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.129> LZ<00:05:59.280> I<00:05:59.729> wonder<00:06:00.660> when<00:06:00.780> the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
cool or reach the LZ I wonder when the

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
cool or reach the LZ I wonder when the
helicopter<00:06:00.990> arrives<00:06:03.470> where<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.560> hell<00:06:04.710> is<00:06:04.740> the

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
helicopter arrives where the hell is the

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.320 
helicopter arrives where the hell is the
helicopter<00:06:05.490> oh<00:06:06.169> well<00:06:07.169> there<00:06:07.289> you<00:06:07.409> are<00:06:08.330> snuck
