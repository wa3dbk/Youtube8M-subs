00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.270
 and hop people I hope you 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.550
 turn on we find ourselves for a new 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.290
 video on gta 5 always of lodging with 5 that 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.340
 does a little bit of good today I 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.680
 will show you how to perceive 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.930
 the UFO of the fort without chrono so that of 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.400
 the military base from under 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.000
 to choose dangla I am currently 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.980
 on the mount choose I show you everything 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.360
 first to see it must 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.210
 you still find a point of view 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.530
 which is possible to see it already 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 because if you find the other side 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.210
 of the mountain it'll be a little hard 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.340
 then you have to have the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.829
 visor obviously improved with the 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.530
 vein is improved the sniper with 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.059
 nathalie baye would rather have and you 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.429
 find that you have a point of view 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.829
 on the good heart so the good heart for 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.390
 me it is there must be able to know 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.980
 loved you have to have 100% 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.050
 it is visible at any time from the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.269
 day at any time an even 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.090
 operate I do not know what and that's it 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.280
 any time and so it takes 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.200
 first of all that you position that the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.930
 bell sound that your window 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.030
 sniper is positioned on the good heart to 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.439
 from that moment on so the bunker 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.850
 this is the hoya the elevator I 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.880
 shows you then from this 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.560
 moment you are aiming for the max 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.229
 So here it is with the line is 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.420
 improved so I'm aiming a little bit more 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.219
 than with the normal sniper and there you 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.909
 go up to the sky until the sky that 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.860
 waiting for you to reach the limit 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.119
 no I'm not far there and so 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.670
 normally we should perceive it 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.950
 here and there we see precisely 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.270
 the pheasant's ufo kudo so we're after 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.430
 it's a little harder if you go to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.110
 the blinded so the best is to do 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.060
 how are there who 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.560
 did not know exactly how 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.990
 could see him from the very least 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.689
 I dare there is the best I think that 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.680
 if we just want to see it like that at 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.170
 instead of returning to the military base 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.200
 it's a bit boring so you come here 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.280
 to rest yourself with snipe boots 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.890
 you camp, you can go up there 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.560
 here I put you a second example 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.350
 and then you will see him dre very very 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.730
 easily because you have to know that the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.970
 night at 3 am there are these 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.410
 beams that lurk on the bunker 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.970
 so you see the beams of the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.820
 sheath on the bunker 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.680
 and so here it is really very very 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.290
 easy to perceive if we do this 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.290
 technical afterwards if we want to 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.160
 go by helicopter I do not know what 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.020
 it's a bit more difficult a 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.270
 frankly I galley anyway 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.290
 this is a little tutorial because there 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.360
 in who know it and can precisely 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.680
 and I hope it's this little tutorial 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.850
 you will be pleased do not hesitate to put a 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.240
 little green thumb if that made you 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.980
 pleasure 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.420
 and I mean the next one for 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.420
 a new video go hi to all
