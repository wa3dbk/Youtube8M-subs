00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:12.675
 First divide the hair into 4 areas, the front part of the ear, and the upper and lower parts of the ear. 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:20.340
 The back of the brain is tied with a rubber band tied to the princess head 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:34.220
 The hair in the occipital region is divided into three bundles, starting with two twists from the middle of the bundle. 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:47.880
 After twisting, the scorpion is loosened and twisted into a bun, fixed with a hairpin, 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:02:00.300
 Then process the left and right hair bundles, using the same technique, two twists -&gt; pull loose -&gt; winding, to form a medium height hairpin, 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:16.700
 The hair in the golden spot is scraped, creating a beautiful arc 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:32.220
 Fix the line along the curl of the hair 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.760
 If the golden point is running away, remember to adjust it back, and the beauty of the haircut is positive. 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.020
 Now start the braiding of the front of the right ear 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:47.160
 Divided into two parts, the first two twists of the hair bundle under the twist, loosening the hair around the left, 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:09.100
 The same technique is used for the hair above the right ear side. 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:05:14.700
 The same method is used on the left ear side, and 2 strands of twist-&gt;relaxed-&gt;twisted hairpins are fixed. 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:29.960
 After adjusting the lines and radians of the hair ends, the 啰 is completed. ^^ 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.300
 Adding a bow and diamonds is both pretty and glamorous. ♥
