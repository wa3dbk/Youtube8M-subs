00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.750
 God 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.120
 and 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.410
 and again the same thing going around 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.410
 everywhere 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.520
 no longer will be able to sleep is good 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.300
 wake up so early I would be tired 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.300
 all the time 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.800
 they say God helps him who gets up early 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.980
 I hope that he helps me with something 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.980
 of money 300 yen I do not think it works 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.760
 talking about 300 yen and forgotten about this 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.440
 I had it hidden in the bottom of the drawer 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.890
 of the vegetables and now it's a good 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.130
 moment to get the chocolates out of the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.830
 better quality than there is 5 yen each 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.000
 chocolate and luck that shin chan has me 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.930
 awakened so early and now 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.930
 good profit 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.160
 good morning mom 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.160
 good morning swells 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.120
 do not get choked and enjoy the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.370
 taste that they have everything else are good 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:49.260
 then what we can do is 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.260
 eat us after hanging clothes 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.600
 the last one we go 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.370
 and you realize my mom is doing 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.370
 more old lady every time she gets up more 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.280
 the boy this 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.130
 It is also not wrong to get up early in 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.200
 when but today you passed you we can 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.810
 take advantage to do many things 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.130
 it's true how to go for a walk 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.099
 example 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.170
 Mom is very athletic so you go 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.170
 well you are going to come with me 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.460
 so it's saving you from walking the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.320
 dog and I have more and more hours yes and left 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.320
 to complain 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.100
 if we go so far we will consider 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.210
 I do not know much, but never after 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.250
 go to fail 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.440
 the important thing is to do it in a 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.110
 gradual and increase the distance 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.580
 little by little each day you will all 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.340
 true we can go to the park that are 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.340
 two streets today is up to 5 minutes 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.400

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.400
 we arrived until you wanted we can 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.220
 but if we're just coming in son 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.220
 we can integrate to do gymnastics 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.950
 in joining our group 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.170
 they want us to join, I would prefer 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.870
 go to my house to see the girl from 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.200
 bikini but it still takes a while for 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.200
 that 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.379
 I do not know if I still remember and but since 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.379

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.269

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.870

 I hope to invite you to see the youth 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.480
 doing gymnastics because he does not want to 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.850
 portraying we have to leave until later 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:45.250
 wait if you want to take something with 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.250

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.560
 what woman tell us that all 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.289
 meetings are predestined if you accept 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.180
 the invitation by the way when he said 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.550
 predestined I mean the fact of the 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.979
 transmigration of the soul you understand already 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.250
 I understand, maybe we have 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:09.159
 known in another life what words so 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.470
 deep true yes who knows 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:14.889
 how many times has our reincarnated 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.280
 soul is likely to hear still not 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.280
 had finished 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.590
 prettier 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.190
 the vegetables you want 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.700
 delicious 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.800
 but how nice and big this is my 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.800
 child I'm going to try a little 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.510
 to me 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.000
 about in grace try mine I want the 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:53.040
 opinion of many young palates 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.750
 thanks for nothing and our delicious as 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.180
 they do it teach me we teach 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.170
 and I wish my daughter show the same interest 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.270
 there the same thing I say mine not even 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.400
 wants to taste what I cook as my 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.860
 son since he got married he just wants 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.770
 eat his wife's food again 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.590
 complaining they say that old age is the 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.700
 second childhood then in this case you 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.950
 you would be the youngest of the nursery 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.640
 oh yes I understand perfectly how 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.640
 feel 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.069
 but it's also one that is that I know that 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.069
 all day 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:38.790
 I have to prepare everyone's breakfast 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.130
 I want to tell you that these are sweet potatoes 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.650
 who harvested at home when bringing the 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.169
 what you want but it 's serious too 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.979
 they can take you candy and they are too many 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:51.540
 are some cookies or so many things 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.960
 I'm ashamed to start 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.550
 quiet sure then if it is 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:03.080
 true that god who helps him early 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:07.490
 early morning the saying does not speak of benefits 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:13.160
 materials and then actually talk 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:15.590
 of the sweets that have filling you can 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:20.680
 take it all we will accompany you 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:25.360
 They will all come back whenever you want 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.759
 the gentleman always of merits because no 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.020
 I do not usually find much 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:34.180
 let say 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.180
 sometimes I find 30 yen 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:50.550
 three reasons not to miss the evil well 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.550
 we live to see with the music that you love
