 7 what is 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.759
 KÃ¶hler is a technology company that will set up Switzerland 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.439
 We look back on more than one hundred and fifty years of tradition 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.030
 With our troops there machines we offer solutions to the co2 reduction 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.130
 to reduce worldwide 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 We do this with over one hundred 40 Kraus locations worldwide 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.060
 our philosophy is always to be where our customers are 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.250
 For example, we have had a late Asian market in recent years 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 invested 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.950
 We not only invested in staff but also in new ones 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.450
 Machines that enable the most efficient solutions for the local 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.450
 Markets to ask 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.940
 The BÃ¼hler Trucost machine enables you to cost-effectively make engine blocks 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.590
 and this made of aluminum 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.090
 all dogs 40 seconds a v6 engine block 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.430
 In addition, using the karate machine on structural components 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.820
 getting produced 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.660
 These components are new components and will help in the future 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.320
 to reduce co2 emissions 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.980
 another innovation Petschel is the los porr procedure 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.360
 With this method, new components can be cost-effectively Ruckus 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.950
 Process 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.850
 Buhler is used so Aydin dissolvable salt like who afterwards
