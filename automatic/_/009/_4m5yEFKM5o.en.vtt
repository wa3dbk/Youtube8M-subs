00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
people think of New York or New Jersey

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.870 
people think of New York or New Jersey
so<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.470> we're<00:01:40.619> gonna<00:01:40.740> continue<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.520> katana

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
so now we're gonna continue the katana

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.750 
so now we're gonna continue the katana
trek<00:01:42.420> around<00:01:43.160> around<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.430> Nature<00:01:44.970> Reserve

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
trek around around the Nature Reserve

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.780 
trek around around the Nature Reserve
there<00:01:47.390> are<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.570> ton<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.170> giant<00:01:49.100> bird<00:01:49.340> feathers

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
there are a ton of giant bird feathers

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.000 
there are a ton of giant bird feathers
along<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.450> path<00:01:50.660> when<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:51.410> stop<00:01:51.620> poop<00:01:51.860> and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
along the path when we stop poop and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.260 
along the path when we stop poop and
they're<00:01:52.130> not<00:01:52.280> allowed<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.580> bring<00:01:52.700> dogs<00:01:52.880> here

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
they're not allowed to bring dogs here

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.880 
they're not allowed to bring dogs here
so<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.570> thought<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:53.780> maybe<00:01:54.140> somebody

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
so we thought that maybe somebody

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.490 
so we thought that maybe somebody
brought<00:01:55.010> a<00:01:55.160> dog<00:01:55.400> here<00:01:55.670> but<00:01:55.850> it's<00:01:56.000> really<00:01:56.500> bird

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
brought a dog here but it's really bird

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.830 
brought a dog here but it's really bird
poop<00:01:57.740> from<00:01:58.070> giant<00:01:58.400> giant<00:01:58.940> birds<00:01:59.150> we<00:01:59.660> don't

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
poop from giant giant birds we don't

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.090 
poop from giant giant birds we don't
know<00:01:59.960> which<00:02:00.110> ones<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.500> we<00:02:00.560> haven't<00:02:00.800> seen<00:02:00.950> too

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
know which ones that we haven't seen too

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.590 
know which ones that we haven't seen too
many<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.340> those<00:02:01.460> we've<00:02:01.670> seen<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.850> few<00:02:02.120> we<00:02:02.360> think

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
many of those we've seen a few we think

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.320 
many of those we've seen a few we think

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
what you call civilization there's

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.830 
what you call civilization there's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
houses and there's a bridge to the house

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.310 
houses and there's a bridge to the house
as<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.200> see<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.560> houses<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.190> back

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
as you can see the houses in the back

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.740 
as you can see the houses in the back
but<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.740> so<00:02:16.550> we're<00:02:16.700> out<00:02:16.820> right<00:02:17.090> off<00:02:17.270> Franklin

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
but and so we're out right off Franklin

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.530 
but and so we're out right off Franklin
Turnpike<00:02:18.170> right<00:02:18.410> now<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.240> just<00:02:20.240> so<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.420> know

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
Turnpike right now and just so you know

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:45.370 
Turnpike right now and just so you know
and<00:02:21.470> we're<00:02:21.620> following<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.010> path<00:02:22.100> around

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.940 

okay<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.910> can<00:02:48.120> see<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:48.930> there's<00:02:49.860> a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
okay so you can see that but there's a

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.710 
okay so you can see that but there's a
deer<00:02:50.250> right<00:02:50.430> there

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
deer right there

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.150 
deer right there
yeah<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.290> think<00:02:52.440> we<00:02:52.500> have<00:02:52.620> tons<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
yeah I think we have tons of the and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.220 
yeah I think we have tons of the and
Rosie<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.180> sure<00:02:54.330> not<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.750> close<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.200> it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
Rosie but you sure not this close to it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.980 
Rosie but you sure not this close to it
so<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.680> should<00:02:55.710> cross<00:02:56.250> before<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.940> guy<00:02:57.150> goes

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
so we should cross before that guy goes

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.560 
so we should cross before that guy goes
across<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.500> path<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.070> are<00:02:59.100> taking

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
across the path that we are taking

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.420 
across the path that we are taking
there's<00:03:00.570> another<00:03:00.870> one<00:03:01.110> we<00:03:01.350> saw<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.280> just

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430

there's another one we saw this is just
right<00:03:02.610> across<00:03:02.880> from<00:03:03.200> from<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.320> path<00:03:04.530> here<00:03:04.890> we

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
right across from from the path here we

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.060 
right across from from the path here we
are<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.280> path<00:03:05.490> right<00:03:05.640> here<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:07.070> we

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
are on the path right here and we

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.570 
are on the path right here and we
