00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.640
 to present and we will also present 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.040
 his last toy 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.590
 thanks to all the teapot followers 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.540
 and angelo marconi customer market for 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.130
 TV because as I commented 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.420
 we are going to launch today we are 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.400
 at this time in the launch of 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.740
 egg is our new operating system 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.720
 for televisions it is martÃ­n already 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.490
 available in the Colombian market that 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.550
 It is loaded with many novelties and 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.720
 benefits for all of you good this 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.210
 It is the true toy 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.220
 tell us what a person has again 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.470
 that does not know much about technology because 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.750
 I should buy it that kind of thing 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.870
 well basically we are in changes 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.870
 radicals 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.510
 it's really is Martin the first time 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.920
 the menu previously we worked with a 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.900
 unique for all screens and 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.610
 we really lost experience or 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.809
 we watched television or enjoyed 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.579
 our hammers 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.130
 this time we really achieved 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.619
 integrate the whole concept 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.180
 and we call the launcher where yes 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.070
 we go to the left side I'm going 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.659
 show all applications or 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 functions that we used previously 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.610
 here for example live television 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.630
 web browser or even the content 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.619
 from youtube I was watching 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.109
 currently how can you see the interface 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.079
 it's very fast very dynamic with just 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:29.939
 click on youtube and I am 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.009
 summer while it's loading 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.450
 I can be seeing here, not how it happened 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.170
 before and they realized he was singing 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.479
 while I was home 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.180
 another benefit for us and in iberia 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.479
 of user experience we detect that no 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.390
 know that by consuming applications the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.240
 local content is the case our 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.080
 live television week 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.560
 Explorer and the app store 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.990
 etc. promptly the television feel 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.729
 we have really thought about the need 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.680
 of the client began to collect all the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.409
 information that I have used before 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.450
 for 15 months just one goes right I 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.640
 shows all the applications that I 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.800
 could download and even generate me 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.170
 as the whole user guide and let's say 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.030
 of more general TV functions 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.850
 we still have availability 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.830
 of smarter time machine including the one 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.239
 here we had by connector devices 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.209
 that our connection manager and 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.430
 peripherals and more applications what 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.200
 seek is expose what 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.019
 the consumer is really looking for and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.700
 using and if they want to keep seeing what 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.319
 you are watching we can see a video by 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.319
 example and open another thing amp list 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.879
 do you live 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.940
 can make change immediately 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.700
 live television that in this case by 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.120
 example navigation 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.970
 this is web browsing immediately 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.920
 explorer and the test of fire as 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.010
 something to give me back even though I was in 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.090
 youtube ok which browser uses or is a 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.280
 native of this time really the webkit 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.280
 from the chrome explorer 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.500
 I complied with almost all the codecs of 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.030
 currently it is very important because I know 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.470
 what's going to happen this TV is 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.940
 thought about the future something that already 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.010
 mentioned that of being able to support 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.350
 flash applications and this is egg is not 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.800
 Supports a dish are 100% thought of 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.360
 html5 javascript or that 3 and others 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.300
 functionalities let's say more own 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.820
 televisions of the future not of televisions 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.140
 of traveling and a developer that 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.330
 I would like for example to put your 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.400
 applications in your store that 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.170
 should do currently we are at 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.780
 waiting for the release of the official sdk 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.100
 for that egg and once it's 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.690
 downloaded the webkit and all the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.000
 development performance the process 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.470
 We seek it much easier it 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.030
 download the egg is recorded 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.580
 our store as a developer and 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.690
 can do a much more process 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.370
 streamlined directly with parent company 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.709
 where will you be able to upload your application 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.570
 make the adjustments and receive the subsequent 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.840
 application and you will be able to see published your 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.300
 application in the store 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.450
 well we see that we returned in the 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.450
 video kept running until here 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.740
 I still have the browser 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.850
 how many applications could you open 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.200
 the time up to four applications 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.200
 they support simultaneous 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.610
 in the previous demo they showed something that 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.050
 basically the TV detected that 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.870
 version of the application I have and if there 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.870
 a new truth is exactly then 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.410
 good what is this notifications not 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.970
 the previous ones did have it 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.380
 previous and basically what 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.100
 I feel 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.460
 I as an art content exam 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.319
 I can send notifications to the TV 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.580
 and then for example this is a 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.440
 work that we are very hand in hand with 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.050
 great developers for example with 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.120
 netflix I can tell you that I have a 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.099
 new content or for example now with 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.590
 a new alliance of wii sports I can 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.330
 send a notification and here I 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.460
 appears do not miss the match they're going 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.349
 to give today and I can locate it here in the 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.910
 notification area here punctually 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.349
 your welcome message but they are 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.970
 push notifications that we can 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.120
 generate the television to send that 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.669
 content 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.860
 and what is that alliance that says 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.030
 with wii sports and wii sports is a 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.310
 alliance that we have for our 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.780
 dividers 2012-2013 and those that come 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.090
 also as after is going to be a 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.740
 preloaded content that fortunately 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.570
 we will have the option of having it here 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.210
 directly pre-installed and it's going to 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.320
 allow ace to have obvious access 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.720
 with the previous payment d 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.310
 the planking bettina wing sports of all 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.140
 the content of two versions of the 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.690
 linear content and activity 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.790
 wii sports historical library 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.250
 online that is approximately boots 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.930
 since 2013 of the second semester then 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.910
 We have more than 320 parties already 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.370
 available and different programs that 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.930
 they have at disposal good van 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.020
 going the million dollar question 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.020
 if I have another television what would be the 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.380
 basic decision to change to this 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.900
 a basic decision or the factor that I 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.600
 would take to webber of musical task was 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.550
 I certainly believe that it is the key to success 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.490
 that is going to have this operating system and 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.660
 content in this in the long term is 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.400
 a platform that will expand the 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.810
 spectrum of the developers and the 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.790
 final is that what people want 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.390
 content you want and good quality 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.250
 ok and when we talk about prices it's going to be 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.380
 much more expensive than the others we already have 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.000
 prices like the absolute the products 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.230
 eggs are available in the market 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.910
 national with the elderly 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.040
 traditional market including and what 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.110
 we can find from 500 million in 32 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.760
 inches what we want is to offer to 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.740
 all the public a product to cesc and 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.030
 affordable and that really offers a 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.030
 added value to the final consumer
