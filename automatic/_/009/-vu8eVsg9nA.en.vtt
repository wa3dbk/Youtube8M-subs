most<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.910> difference<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
most of the difference because this is a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.120 
most of the difference because this is a
ceramic<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.650> think<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:25.890> called<00:00:26.039> the
