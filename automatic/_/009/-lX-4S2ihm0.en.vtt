seems to be the number one guy at the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.740 
seems to be the number one guy at the
moment<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:05.270> second<00:01:06.270> how<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.920> will<00:01:08.159> affect

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469 
further implications into the future so

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.760

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
I think he's like he's going to be a

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.899 
I think he's like he's going to be a
great<00:06:06.949> signing<00:06:07.339> for<00:06:07.639> them<00:06:07.759> but<00:06:07.940> again<00:06:08.229> this<00:06:09.229> is

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
great signing for them but again this is

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:15.490 
great signing for them but again this is
there<00:06:10.909> a<00:06:11.529> way<00:06:12.529> of<00:06:14.169> rebuilding<00:06:15.169> from<00:06:15.289> the

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
there a way of rebuilding from the

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.360
