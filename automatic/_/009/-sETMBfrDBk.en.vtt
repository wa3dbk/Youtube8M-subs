00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.200 

the<00:00:03.530> interesting<00:00:03.770> thing<00:00:04.100> about<00:00:04.130> Oct<00:00:04.820> is<00:00:04.970> that

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
the interesting thing about Oct is that

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.740 
the interesting thing about Oct is that
it's<00:00:05.359> a<00:00:05.450> very<00:00:05.600> general<00:00:06.109> technology

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:07.750 
it's a very general technology

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.549 
it's a very general technology
essentially<00:00:08.750> it's<00:00:08.870> a<00:00:08.960> way<00:00:09.080> that<00:00:09.110> you<00:00:09.320> can

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
essentially it's a way that you can

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.589 
essentially it's a way that you can
measure<00:00:09.830> both<00:00:10.219> cross-sectional<00:00:11.000> images<00:00:11.389> as

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
measure both cross-sectional images as

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.629 
measure both cross-sectional images as
well<00:00:11.780> as<00:00:11.870> three-dimensional<00:00:12.639> structures

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
well as three-dimensional structures

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.200 
well as three-dimensional structures
inside<00:00:14.240> both<00:00:14.420> materials<00:00:15.110> and<00:00:15.410> bio<00:00:16.340> biological

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
inside both materials and bio biological

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.630 
inside both materials and bio biological
specimens<00:00:17.810> so<00:00:18.470> it<00:00:18.619> has<00:00:18.770> quite<00:00:19.130> a<00:00:19.189> wide<00:00:19.400> range

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
specimens so it has quite a wide range

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.839 
specimens so it has quite a wide range
of<00:00:19.759> applications<00:00:20.450> going<00:00:20.779> from<00:00:21.110> fundamental

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
of applications going from fundamental

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.389 
of applications going from fundamental
science<00:00:22.849> to<00:00:23.509> clinical<00:00:23.989> applications<00:00:24.980> the

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:25.399 
science to clinical applications the

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.269 
science to clinical applications the
dominant<00:00:25.880> application<00:00:26.480> is<00:00:26.779> in<00:00:27.279> ophthalmology

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
dominant application is in ophthalmology

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.280 
dominant application is in ophthalmology
and<00:00:29.050> it's<00:00:30.550> now<00:00:31.550> a<00:00:31.579> standard<00:00:32.450> of<00:00:32.599> care<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.200> I

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
and it's now a standard of care so I

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.990 
and it's now a standard of care so I
think<00:00:33.380> that<00:00:33.710> if<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:33.920> go<00:00:34.100> into<00:00:34.280> pretty<00:00:34.760> much

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
think that if you go into pretty much

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.380 
think that if you go into pretty much
any<00:00:35.390> ophthalmologist<00:00:36.260> in<00:00:37.269> especially<00:00:38.269> the

T Diagnostics are now a standard and if

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.790 
T Diagnostics are now a standard and if
we<00:00:49.940> look<00:00:50.089> at<00:00:50.210> other<00:00:50.359> areas<00:00:50.469> one<00:00:51.469> of<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:51.679> big

acquired<00:01:21.799> by<00:01:21.950> Zeiss<00:01:22.340> in<00:01:22.579> 94<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.270> then<00:01:23.869> Zeiss

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
acquired by Zeiss in 94 and then Zeiss

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.959 
acquired by Zeiss in 94 and then Zeiss
just<00:01:24.409> did<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.590> tremendous<00:01:24.829> job<00:01:25.159> over<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.790> next

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
just did a tremendous job over the next

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.880 
just did a tremendous job over the next
decade<00:01:26.390> or<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:26.509> bringing<00:01:27.049> this<00:01:27.140> technology<00:01:27.350> to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
decade or so bringing this technology to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.940 
decade or so bringing this technology to
market<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.820> around<00:01:29.060> 1996<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.200> think<00:01:30.380> Zeiss

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
market and around 1996 I think Zeiss

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.959 
market and around 1996 I think Zeiss
released<00:01:31.340> their<00:01:31.579> first<00:01:32.320> commercial<00:01:33.670> Oct<00:01:34.670> Gen

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.660 
released their first commercial Oct Gen
1<00:01:35.119> system<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.409> from<00:01:36.920> there<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.100> market<00:01:37.369> has

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
1 system so from there the market has

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.520 
1 system so from there the market has
grown<00:01:37.789> quite<00:01:38.119> healthily<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.719> today<00:01:39.259> there

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
grown quite healthily and today there

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.310 
grown quite healthily and today there
are<00:01:39.649> lots<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.729> ophthalmic<00:01:41.630> companies<00:01:42.049> and

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
are lots of ophthalmic companies and

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.830 
are lots of ophthalmic companies and
lots<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.680> OCT<00:01:43.549> companies<00:01:44.000> in<00:01:44.149> various<00:01:44.329> medical

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
lots of OCT companies in various medical

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.990 
lots of OCT companies in various medical
fields<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.320> non-medical<00:01:45.710> fields<00:01:46.130> as<00:01:46.250> well<00:01:46.399> so

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
fields and non-medical fields as well so

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.609 
fields and non-medical fields as well so
there's<00:01:47.180> a<00:01:47.270> concept<00:01:47.689> of<00:01:47.990> vertical

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
there's a concept of vertical

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.459 
there's a concept of vertical
integration<00:01:48.829> that<00:01:49.460> we<00:01:49.729> like<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:49.939> stress<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:51.289> I

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
integration that we like to stress and I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.310 
integration that we like to stress and I
think<00:01:51.649> many<00:01:51.770> groups<00:01:52.039> are<00:01:52.250> also<00:01:53.320> emphasizing

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
think many groups are also emphasizing

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.499 
think many groups are also emphasizing
the<00:01:54.409> idea<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:54.920> can<00:01:55.039> take<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.579> fundamental

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
the idea that you can take a fundamental

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.230 
the idea that you can take a fundamental
technology<00:01:57.170> from<00:01:57.530> from<00:01:58.250> basic<00:01:58.640> studies<00:01:59.000> to

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
technology from from basic studies to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.069 
technology from from basic studies to
engineer<00:01:59.929> systems<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.460> then<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.479> put<00:02:02.929> these

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
engineer systems and then to put these

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.990 
engineer systems and then to put these
systems<00:02:03.320> into<00:02:03.859> the<00:02:03.890> clinical<00:02:04.399> environment

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
systems into the clinical environment

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.050 
systems into the clinical environment
where<00:02:05.509> we're<00:02:05.719> actually<00:02:05.840> able<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.789> do<00:02:07.789> studies

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
where we're actually able to do studies

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.230 
where we're actually able to do studies
with<00:02:08.420> patient

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
with patient

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.240 
with patient
and<00:02:09.480> with<00:02:09.630> physicians<00:02:10.380> I'm<00:02:10.650> focused<00:02:11.160> on

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and with physicians I'm focused on

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.740 
and with physicians I'm focused on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
pulmonary imaging and it's such a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.360 
pulmonary imaging and it's such a
fruitful<00:02:13.230> area<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:13.830> are<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.160> many

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
fruitful area there are so many

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.280

different things that it can be used for
in<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> lung<00:02:16.680> because<00:02:17.220> people<00:02:17.790> haven't

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
in the lung because people haven't

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
melanoma for melanoma it comes a little

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.170 
melanoma for melanoma it comes a little
bit<00:03:14.460> more<00:03:14.640> difficult<00:03:16.280> because<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:17.910> case

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
bit more difficult because in this case

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.170 
bit more difficult because in this case
also<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.570> needs<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.200> penetrate<00:03:19.590> deeper

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
also you needs to penetrate deeper

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.710 
also you needs to penetrate deeper
melanoma<00:03:21.180> grows<00:03:21.960> downwards<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.970> they're

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.480 

possibly<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.320> combination<00:03:28.950> with<00:03:29.070> functional

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
possibly the combination with functional

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.400 
possibly the combination with functional
extensions<00:03:29.970> could<00:03:30.330> help<00:03:30.600> improve<00:03:30.780> also<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
extensions could help improve also the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.260 
extensions could help improve also the
capabilities<00:03:32.010> there<00:03:32.220> if<00:03:32.460> you<00:03:32.640> look<00:03:32.880> over<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
capabilities there if you look over the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.530 
capabilities there if you look over the
last<00:03:33.450> decade<00:03:34.260> or<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:35.150> worldwide<00:03:36.150> government

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
last decade or so worldwide government

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.440 
last decade or so worldwide government
funding<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.410> exceeded<00:03:38.100> on<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.150> order<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.390> a

funding is exceeded on the order of a

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.610 
funding is exceeded on the order of a
billion<00:03:39.660> dollar<00:03:39.990> so<00:03:40.290> there's<00:03:40.440> been<00:03:40.590> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
billion dollar so there's been a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.260 
billion dollar so there's been a
tremendous<00:03:40.830> amount<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.640> government

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
tremendous amount of government

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.380 
tremendous amount of government
investment<00:03:43.080> here<00:03:43.320> in<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.500> US<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.160> course

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
investment here in the US and of course

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.580 
investment here in the US and of course
everywhere<00:03:45.390> else<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.780> world<00:03:45.870> the

everywhere else in the world the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.660 
everywhere else in the world the
government<00:03:46.710> has<00:03:46.980> played<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.190> huge<00:03:47.370> role<00:03:47.490> in

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
making this field happen the return has

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.680 
making this field happen the return has
been<00:03:49.800> incredible<00:03:50.760> from<00:03:50.880> an<00:03:51.000> economic<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.570> a

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
been incredible from an economic and a

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.600 
been incredible from an economic and a
human<00:03:51.990> point<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.230> view<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.890> I<00:03:52.980> think<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.370> same

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
human point of view and I think the same

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.700 
human point of view and I think the same
government<00:03:53.850> invested<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.600> investment<00:03:55.500> in<00:03:55.620> the

future<00:03:56.010> are<00:03:56.100> still<00:03:56.310> warranted<00:03:56.790> because

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
future are still warranted because

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.030 
future are still warranted because
there's<00:03:57.600> just<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:57.930> many<00:03:58.140> other<00:03:58.350> applications

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040

there's just so many other applications

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
that I think will continue to pay

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.390 
that I think will continue to pay
dividends<00:04:01.080> in<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.770> area<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.040> optical

companies which which went public and
became<00:04:28.240> very<00:04:28.449> successful<00:04:28.690> but<00:04:29.620> this

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
became very successful but this

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.650 
became very successful but this
partnership<00:04:30.220> really<00:04:30.669> between<00:04:30.940> people<00:04:31.419> who

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
partnership really between people who

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.620 
partnership really between people who
have<00:04:32.550> engineering<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.699> business<00:04:33.910> knowledge

as<00:04:34.810> well<00:04:35.320> as<00:04:35.680> clinical<00:04:36.040> medicine<00:04:36.699> I<00:04:36.820> think<00:04:36.850> is

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
as well as clinical medicine I think is

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.780 
as well as clinical medicine I think is
a<00:04:37.180> very<00:04:37.389> important<00:04:38.130> point<00:04:39.130> because<00:04:39.280> the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
a very important point because the

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.640 
a very important point because the
challenge<00:04:40.240> really<00:04:40.479> is<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.960> be<00:04:41.290> able<00:04:41.350> to<00:04:41.470> go

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
challenge really is to be able to go

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.129 
challenge really is to be able to go
from<00:04:41.830> laboratory<00:04:42.610> demonstration<00:04:43.139> to

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
from laboratory demonstration to

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.280 
from laboratory demonstration to
large-scale<00:04:44.949> applications<00:04:45.639> it's<00:04:45.910> really

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
large-scale applications it's really

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.740 
large-scale applications it's really
critical<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.680> be<00:04:47.800> able<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:48.130> transfer<00:04:48.750> new

larger scale impact on healthcare for me

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.480 
larger scale impact on healthcare for me
a<00:04:55.570> kind<00:04:56.080> of<00:04:56.139> key<00:04:56.320> experience<00:04:56.860> was<00:04:57.430> when<00:04:59.490> for

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
a kind of key experience was when for

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.680 
a kind of key experience was when for
the<00:05:00.550> first<00:05:00.760> time<00:05:00.970> actually<00:05:01.120> had<00:05:01.570> an

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
the first time actually had an

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.850 
the first time actually had an
instrument<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.410> there<00:05:02.500> was<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.650> patient

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
instrument and there was a patient

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.140 
instrument and there was a patient
coming<00:05:03.220> sitting<00:05:03.669> in<00:05:03.729> front<00:05:03.820> of<00:05:04.000> the

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
coming sitting in front of the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.029 
coming sitting in front of the
instrument<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:04.840> actually<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.620> saw<00:05:05.860> that

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
instrument and actually I saw that

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.950 
instrument and actually I saw that
somebody<00:05:06.400> could<00:05:06.550> actually<00:05:06.580> profit<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.510> real

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
somebody could actually profit a real

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.750 
somebody could actually profit a real
person<00:05:08.410> could<00:05:08.560> profit<00:05:08.770> from<00:05:08.949> the<00:05:09.280> from<00:05:09.669> the

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
person could profit from the from the

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.730 
person could profit from the from the
ideas<00:05:10.150> from<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.449> technology<00:05:10.990> that<00:05:11.530> we<00:05:11.710> were

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
ideas from the technology that we were

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.350 
ideas from the technology that we were
developing<00:05:12.010> so<00:05:12.400> this<00:05:12.699> was<00:05:12.850> really<00:05:13.000> very

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
developing so this was really very

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.969 
developing so this was really very
satisfying<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:15.570> confirmed<00:05:16.570> my<00:05:16.810> my<00:05:17.560> decision

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
satisfying and confirmed my my decision

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.960 
satisfying and confirmed my my decision
to<00:05:18.130> continue<00:05:18.669> my<00:05:19.000> my<00:05:19.240> career<00:05:19.479> in<00:05:19.570> this<00:05:19.720> field
