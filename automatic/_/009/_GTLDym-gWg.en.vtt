here<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.559> Australia<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.850> think<00:00:39.559> with<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
here in Australia I just think with the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
here in Australia I just think with the
language<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.160> may<00:00:41.280> not<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:42.000> able<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:42.450> by

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
language I may not I'm able to get by

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
with the French but I just think it's

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
with the French but I just think it's
more<00:00:43.920> clear<00:00:44.340> there's<00:00:44.700> there's<00:00:45.210> little<00:00:45.450> things

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
more clear there's there's little things

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
more clear there's there's little things
that<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:46.050> communicate<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.520> people

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that you can communicate to the people

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.139 
that you can communicate to the people
here<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.510> feel<00:00:49.489> more<00:00:50.489> comfortable<00:00:50.850> here

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149

career ended no not really I think at

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
career ended no not really I think at
the<00:01:24.090> time<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.960> very<00:01:25.020> bitter<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.100> think

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the time I was very bitter but I think

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.370 
the time I was very bitter but I think
at<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> time<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.479> head<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.750> hadn't

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
at the time in my head I hadn't

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.429 
at the time in my head I hadn't
experienced<00:01:28.950> enough<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.340> didn't<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.759> enough

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
experienced enough I didn't have enough

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.800 
experienced enough I didn't have enough
life<00:01:31.439> experience<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:32.130> think<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.060> probably

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
life experience I think I probably

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.990 
life experience I think I probably
placed<00:01:34.200> too<00:01:34.350> much<00:01:34.500> importance<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.130> rugby<00:01:35.460> at

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
placed too much importance on rugby at

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.280 
placed too much importance on rugby at
the<00:01:36.150> time<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.540> I've<00:01:36.659> got<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> couple<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.110> kids

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
the time now I've got a couple of kids

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.810 
the time now I've got a couple of kids
and<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.590> think<00:01:37.650> rugby<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.310> its<00:01:38.460> walk<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and I think rugby is in its walk the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
and I think rugby is in its walk the
place<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:39.990> while<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.229> felt<00:01:40.650> better<00:01:40.829> at

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
place you know while I felt better at

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.920 
place you know while I felt better at
the<00:01:41.070> time<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.610> had<00:01:41.970> no<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.390> feel<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.780> way

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the time I had no right to feel that way

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.100 
the time I had no right to feel that way
I<00:01:43.200> played<00:01:44.159> 92<00:01:44.640> tests

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
I played 92 tests

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.550 
I played 92 tests

many<00:01:49.680> times<00:01:50.010> for<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.280> Wallabies<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790

many times for the Wallabies and
represent<00:01:51.210> my<00:01:51.240> country<00:01:51.480> so<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.830> certainly

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
represent my country so I'm certainly

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.220 
represent my country so I'm certainly
not<00:01:53.280> better<00:01:53.520> now<00:01:53.730> at<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.300> time<00:01:54.510> while<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.960> felt

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
not better now at the time while I felt

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
not better now at the time while I felt
bitter<00:01:55.410> but<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.620> had<00:01:55.740> no<00:01:55.890> right<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.130> feel

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.500 

we<00:02:06.250> had<00:02:06.400> a<00:02:06.430> falling<00:02:06.640> out<00:02:06.880> but<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.150> then<00:02:07.299> coach

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510

Robbie Deans
what<00:02:08.950> was<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.190> turning<00:02:09.520> point<00:02:09.550> was<00:02:09.880> at<00:02:10.060> the

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
what was the turning point was at the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.140 
what was the turning point was at the
Miss<00:02:10.300> kick<00:02:10.569> against<00:02:10.959> England<00:02:11.260> 2010<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:12.150> think

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
Miss kick against England 2010 I think

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.699 
Miss kick against England 2010 I think
so<00:02:13.270> yeah<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.930> mean<00:02:14.170> he's<00:02:14.260> got<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> couple<00:02:14.620> of

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
so yeah I mean he's got a couple of

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.380 
so yeah I mean he's got a couple of
tries<00:02:14.890> I've<00:02:15.280> got<00:02:15.610> my<00:02:15.700> first<00:02:15.910> cut<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.180> kicks

tries I've got my first cut the kicks
over<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.900> then<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.319> don't<00:02:17.980> know<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:18.100> just<00:02:18.190> felt

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
over and then I don't know I just felt

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.670 
over and then I don't know I just felt
him<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.090> bit<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.420> hole<00:02:19.600> with<00:02:19.930> with<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
him in a bit of a hole with with the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.240 
him in a bit of a hole with with the
goal<00:02:20.890> kicking<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:22.650> after<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.680> missed<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.040> one

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
goal kicking and after I missed that one

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.130 
goal kicking and after I missed that one
from<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.520> front<00:02:24.790> which<00:02:24.970> we<00:02:25.060> probably<00:02:25.270> nice<00:02:25.930> and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
from in front which we probably nice and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.100 
from in front which we probably nice and
versatile<00:02:26.530> team<00:02:26.709> up<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:28.300> had<00:02:28.690> like<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> little

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
versatile team up I had like a little

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.199 
versatile team up I had like a little
little<00:02:29.590> smile<00:02:29.920> which<00:02:30.400> was<00:02:30.640> more<00:02:30.850> just<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
little smile which was more just the

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.809 
little smile which was more just the
nervous<00:02:31.630> thing<00:02:31.840> or<00:02:32.410> an<00:02:32.560> embarrassed<00:02:32.980> reaction

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
nervous thing or an embarrassed reaction

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.430 
nervous thing or an embarrassed reaction
for<00:02:33.970> me<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:34.660> think<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.900> was<00:02:35.140> received

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
for me and I think that was received

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.490 
for me and I think that was received
pretty<00:02:35.680> poorly<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:37.269> then<00:02:37.810> from<00:02:38.050> there<00:02:38.260> it

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
pretty poorly and then from there it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.009 
pretty poorly and then from there it
just<00:02:38.760> yeah<00:02:39.760> things<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.209> think<00:02:40.269> unravel<00:02:40.959> from

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
just yeah things I think unravel from

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.080 
just yeah things I think unravel from
there<00:02:41.230> but<00:02:42.040> life<00:02:42.220> seems<00:02:42.489> pretty<00:02:42.730> good<00:02:42.970> in

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
there but life seems pretty good in

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.210 
there but life seems pretty good in
France<00:02:43.360> for<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:44.140> Lana's<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.680> second<00:02:45.100> spot

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
then after that rugby I think I enjoy my

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.140 
then after that rugby I think I enjoy my
rugby<00:03:02.200> more<00:03:02.500> now<00:03:02.680> because<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.160> has<00:03:03.310> less<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:03.940> a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
rugby more now because it has less of a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.750 
rugby more now because it has less of a
focus<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.660> feel<00:03:04.840> I'm<00:03:04.959> playing<00:03:05.760> better

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
focus and I feel I'm playing better

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.569 
focus and I feel I'm playing better
rugby<00:03:07.000> now<00:03:08.070> definitely<00:03:09.070> more<00:03:09.400> than

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
rugby now definitely more than

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.090 
rugby now definitely more than
definitely<00:03:10.269> better<00:03:10.420> than<00:03:10.660> when<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.170> left<00:03:11.410> but

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
definitely better than when I left but

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.440 
definitely better than when I left but
there'll<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:12.370> an<00:03:12.519> exodus<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:13.000> Australian
