free-form<00:00:43.940> defamation<00:00:44.539> box<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.079> then<00:00:45.829> I've

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
free-form defamation box and then I've

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.849 
free-form defamation box and then I've
got<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.129> turbosmooth<00:00:46.579> in<00:00:47.199> this<00:00:48.199> objects<00:00:48.649> case

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
got a turbosmooth in this objects case

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.319 
got a turbosmooth in this objects case
I've<00:00:49.070> got<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.219> taper<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.730> then<00:00:49.820> a<00:00:49.850> turbosmooth

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
I've got a taper and then a turbosmooth

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.349 
I've got a taper and then a turbosmooth
in<00:00:50.840> this<00:00:51.559> one<00:00:51.800> we've<00:00:52.309> got<00:00:52.460> another<00:00:52.699> taper<00:00:53.030> but

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
in this one we've got another taper but

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:54.369 
in this one we've got another taper but
it's<00:00:53.480> doing<00:00:53.690> something<00:00:53.840> slightly<00:00:54.109> different

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
it's doing something slightly different

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.270 
it's doing something slightly different
and<00:00:54.920> in<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:55.789> example<00:00:56.239> we've<00:00:56.750> got<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:57.320> taper

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
and in this example we've got a taper

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.939 
and in this example we've got a taper
and<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:59.269> symmetry<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.559> turbosmooth<00:01:00.949> as<00:01:01.370> well

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
and a symmetry and a turbosmooth as well

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.370 
and a symmetry and a turbosmooth as well
so<00:01:03.949> how<00:01:04.610> do<00:01:04.670> we<00:01:04.910> start<00:01:05.269> from<00:01:05.600> our<00:01:05.900> humble

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
so how do we start from our humble

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.340 
so how do we start from our humble
little<00:01:06.410> box<00:01:06.860> here<00:01:06.980> at<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.060> bottom<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.570> turn

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
little box here at the bottom and turn

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.920 
little box here at the bottom and turn
them<00:01:09.530> into<00:01:09.590> some<00:01:09.890> of<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.070> looks<00:01:10.220> like<00:01:10.460> this

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
them into some of the looks like this

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.320 
them into some of the looks like this
well<00:01:11.930> first<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:12.890> all<00:01:12.979> we've<00:01:13.759> got<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.000> take<00:01:14.180> him

now I've got my basic box shape I can
start<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.340> play<00:02:04.549> around<00:02:04.700> with<00:02:04.969> a<00:02:05.030> few<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.270> the

start to play around with a few of the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.219 
start to play around with a few of the
modifiers<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:07.610> do<00:02:07.789> that<00:02:08.060> we're<00:02:08.600> in<00:02:08.690> our<00:02:08.780> modify

else on well another shape that we've
got<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.459> this<00:03:53.359> one<00:03:53.630> here<00:03:53.870> which<00:03:54.680> is<00:03:55.000> quite

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
got is this one here which is quite

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.340 
got is this one here which is quite
interesting<00:03:56.329> that's<00:03:56.690> got<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.870> free-form

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
interesting that's got a free-form

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.130 
interesting that's got a free-form
deformation<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:59.120> what<00:03:59.329> I<00:03:59.359> might<00:03:59.660> do<00:03:59.959> is

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
deformation on it so what I might do is

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.750 
deformation on it so what I might do is
I<00:04:00.440> might<00:04:00.680> turn<00:04:00.950> off<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.310> effect<00:04:01.579> that<00:04:01.670> that

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
I might turn off the effect that that

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.720 
I might turn off the effect that that
box<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.329> having<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:03.890> might<00:04:04.130> put<00:04:04.370> another

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
box is having and I might put another

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.630 
box is having and I might put another
one<00:04:04.940> on<00:04:05.000> there<00:04:05.299> which<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.200> my<00:04:06.640> freeform

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
one on there which is my freeform

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.370 
one on there which is my freeform
defamation<00:04:08.269> three<00:04:08.600> by<00:04:08.720> three<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:08.989> can<00:04:09.230> have

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
defamation three by three I can have

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.860 
defamation three by three I can have
four<00:04:09.620> by<00:04:09.769> four<00:04:10.040> if<00:04:10.160> I<00:04:10.280> want<00:04:10.519> to<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:11.480> have<00:04:11.600> more

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
four by four if I want to to have more

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.509 
four by four if I want to to have more
control<00:04:12.079> but<00:04:12.440> I'll<00:04:12.500> go<00:04:12.650> for<00:04:12.799> three<00:04:13.069> by<00:04:13.220> three

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
control but I'll go for three by three

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.810 
control but I'll go for three by three
so<00:04:13.700> it<00:04:13.790> matches<00:04:14.060> pretty<00:04:14.569> much<00:04:14.870> my<00:04:15.139> box<00:04:15.820> and

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
so it matches pretty much my box and

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.699 
so it matches pretty much my box and
what<00:04:17.060> this<00:04:17.209> does<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:17.660> is<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:18.049> gives<00:04:18.260> me<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> high

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
what this does it is it gives me a high

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.710 
what this does it is it gives me a high
level<00:04:19.130> control<00:04:19.639> via<00:04:20.000> these<00:04:20.180> control<00:04:20.690> points

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
level control via these control points

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.990 
level control via these control points
of<00:04:21.280> how<00:04:22.280> i'm<00:04:22.610> going<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.479> move<00:04:23.660> things<00:04:23.960> around

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
of how i'm going to move things around

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.610 
of how i'm going to move things around
so<00:04:26.000> i<00:04:26.270> can<00:04:26.630> do<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.080> look<00:04:27.229> you<00:04:27.349> see<00:04:27.500> I'm

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
so i can do that and look you see I'm

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.279 
so i can do that and look you see I'm
moving<00:04:27.950> one<00:04:28.159> point<00:04:28.430> but<00:04:28.729> I'm<00:04:28.880> actually

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
moving one point but I'm actually

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.079 
moving one point but I'm actually
forming<00:04:30.800> lots<00:04:31.129> of<00:04:31.369> points<00:04:31.550> even<00:04:31.789> though<00:04:31.999> I'm

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:32.089 
forming lots of points even though I'm

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:34.689 
forming lots of points even though I'm
only<00:04:32.240> moving<00:04:32.479> two<00:04:32.899> of<00:04:33.080> these<00:04:33.199> points<00:04:33.499> there<00:04:33.919> so

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
only moving two of these points there so

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.429 
only moving two of these points there so
I<00:04:34.729> can<00:04:34.939> come<00:04:35.240> in<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.509> I<00:04:35.599> can<00:04:35.809> start<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.199> sort<00:04:36.379> of

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:36.439 
I can come in and I can start to sort of

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.879 
I can come in and I can start to sort of
grab<00:04:36.770> quite<00:04:37.159> a<00:04:37.189> few<00:04:37.550> of<00:04:37.639> these<00:04:37.789> and<00:04:38.409> I<00:04:39.409> can<00:04:39.619> just

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
grab quite a few of these and I can just

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.459 
grab quite a few of these and I can just
sort<00:04:40.069> of<00:04:40.599> rescale<00:04:41.599> let's<00:04:42.020> see<00:04:42.229> how<00:04:42.349> we're

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:42.469 
sort of rescale let's see how we're

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:44.019 
sort of rescale let's see how we're
going<00:04:42.589> to<00:04:42.649> do<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:42.979> maybe<00:04:43.159> that<00:04:43.399> come<00:04:43.699> maybe

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:44.029 
going to do that maybe that come maybe

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.260 
going to do that maybe that come maybe
that<00:04:44.180> comes<00:04:44.389> out<00:04:44.569> there<00:04:44.869> you<00:04:45.710> don't<00:04:45.919> know

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
that comes out there you don't know

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.609 
that comes out there you don't know
let's<00:04:47.270> come<00:04:47.509> in<00:04:47.599> let's<00:04:47.839> take<00:04:48.139> this<00:04:48.289> one<00:04:48.349> and

00:04:48.609 --> 00:04:48.619 
let's come in let's take this one and

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:52.059 
let's come in let's take this one and
pull<00:04:49.249> that<00:04:49.399> in<00:04:49.520> even<00:04:49.819> further<00:04:50.800> there<00:04:51.800> we<00:04:51.919> go

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069 
pull that in even further there we go

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.359 
pull that in even further there we go
and<00:04:52.339> I<00:04:52.789> can<00:04:52.969> take<00:04:53.210> out<00:04:53.419> individual<00:04:54.050> points<00:04:54.529> and

00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:55.369 
and I can take out individual points and

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:58.239 
and I can take out individual points and
I<00:04:55.490> can<00:04:55.669> start<00:04:55.939> to<00:04:56.089> move<00:04:56.419> them<00:04:56.809> around<00:04:57.129> and<00:04:58.129> you

00:04:58.239 --> 00:04:58.249 
I can start to move them around and you

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:59.859 
I can start to move them around and you
can<00:04:58.399> see<00:04:58.610> here<00:04:58.789> i'm<00:04:58.939> using<00:04:58.969> my<00:04:59.270> marquee

00:04:59.859 --> 00:04:59.869 
can see here i'm using my marquee

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:02.619 
can see here i'm using my marquee
selection<00:05:00.229> to<00:05:00.589> grab<00:05:00.830> sort<00:05:01.159> of<00:05:01.360> three<00:05:02.360> of<00:05:02.479> them

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
selection to grab sort of three of them

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.279 
selection to grab sort of three of them
at<00:05:02.749> a<00:05:02.809> time<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:03.919> pull<00:05:04.249> them<00:05:04.399> out<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:05.259> create<00:05:06.259> a

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
at a time and pull them out and create a

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.339 
at a time and pull them out and create a
more<00:05:06.619> convincing<00:05:07.099> shape<00:05:07.699> of<00:05:07.909> base<00:05:08.169> at<00:05:09.169> the

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
more convincing shape of base at the

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.549 
more convincing shape of base at the
bottom<00:05:09.649> of<00:05:09.770> our<00:05:09.860> building<00:05:11.349> something<00:05:12.349> that's

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:12.559 
bottom of our building something that's

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.709 
bottom of our building something that's
maybe<00:05:12.709> a<00:05:12.860> little<00:05:13.009> bit<00:05:13.219> more<00:05:13.339> rounded<00:05:13.909> but<00:05:14.539> as

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:14.719 
maybe a little bit more rounded but as

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:18.219 
maybe a little bit more rounded but as
it<00:05:15.349> changes<00:05:16.189> in<00:05:16.490> height<00:05:17.240> so<00:05:18.080> its

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
it changes in height so its

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.889 
it changes in height so its
cross-section<00:05:18.949> changes<00:05:19.459> which<00:05:20.300> becomes<00:05:20.689> I

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:20.899 
cross-section changes which becomes I

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:23.019 
cross-section changes which becomes I
think<00:05:21.409> quite<00:05:21.619> an<00:05:21.740> interesting<00:05:22.249> sort<00:05:22.669> of<00:05:22.789> shape

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:23.029 
think quite an interesting sort of shape

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:25.389 
think quite an interesting sort of shape
that<00:05:23.300> we've<00:05:23.449> got<00:05:23.689> there<00:05:23.930> now<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:24.830> could<00:05:25.099> add<00:05:25.219> my

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:25.399 
that we've got there now I could add my

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.879 
that we've got there now I could add my
taper<00:05:25.699> on<00:05:25.879> to<00:05:26.059> that<00:05:26.209> but<00:05:26.449> that<00:05:26.569> would<00:05:26.749> start<00:05:27.649> to

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
taper on to that but that would start to

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.769 
taper on to that but that would start to
make<00:05:28.009> it<00:05:28.159> looks<00:05:28.339> as<00:05:28.490> slightly<00:05:28.849> odd<00:05:29.059> I've<00:05:29.240> kind

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779 
make it looks as slightly odd I've kind

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.029 
make it looks as slightly odd I've kind
of<00:05:29.869> got<00:05:30.020> something<00:05:30.289> that<00:05:30.439> looks<00:05:30.619> a<00:05:30.709> little<00:05:30.860> bit

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
of got something that looks a little bit

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.980 
of got something that looks a little bit
more<00:05:31.159> like<00:05:31.339> using<00:05:31.520> guard<00:05:31.879> there<00:05:32.180> but<00:05:32.809> you<00:05:32.899> know

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
more like using guard there but you know

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.449 
more like using guard there but you know
that's<00:05:33.199> quite<00:05:33.439> cool<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:33.919> quite<00:05:34.219> like<00:05:34.430> that

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:34.459 
that's quite cool I quite like that

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.549 
that's quite cool I quite like that
could<00:05:35.059> be<00:05:35.180> interesting<00:05:35.479> mix<00:05:36.199> things<00:05:36.379> up<00:05:36.469> a

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:36.559 
could be interesting mix things up a

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.429 
could be interesting mix things up a
little<00:05:36.680> bit<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.490> on<00:05:37.759> to<00:05:38.149> that<00:05:38.330> what<00:05:39.139> I'm<00:05:39.259> going

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:39.439 
little bit so on to that what I'm going

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.100 
little bit so on to that what I'm going
to<00:05:39.469> do<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:39.740> I'm<00:05:39.860> going<00:05:39.889> to<00:05:40.099> add<00:05:40.249> a<00:05:40.279> turbosmooth

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
to do is I'm going to add a turbosmooth

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.739 
to do is I'm going to add a turbosmooth
now<00:05:42.580> we<00:05:43.580> should<00:05:43.639> be<00:05:43.819> able<00:05:43.999> to<00:05:44.180> get<00:05:44.360> there<00:05:44.509> we<00:05:44.629> go

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:44.749 
now we should be able to get there we go

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:46.299 
now we should be able to get there we go
we've<00:05:44.959> just<00:05:45.139> got<00:05:45.289> turbo<00:05:45.499> smooth<00:05:45.979> down<00:05:46.099> at<00:05:46.249> the

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:46.309 
we've just got turbo smooth down at the

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:48.579 
we've just got turbo smooth down at the
bottom<00:05:46.459> there<00:05:46.819> and<00:05:46.969> you<00:05:47.809> can<00:05:47.959> see<00:05:48.259> that<00:05:48.289> my

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:48.589 
bottom there and you can see that my

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:50.980 
bottom there and you can see that my
turbo<00:05:49.009> smooth<00:05:49.339> if<00:05:49.580> i<00:05:49.729> change<00:05:50.059> the<00:05:50.330> iterations

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
turbo smooth if i change the iterations

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.009 
turbo smooth if i change the iterations
up<00:05:51.169> to<00:05:51.319> two<00:05:51.759> you<00:05:52.759> can<00:05:52.939> see<00:05:53.120> what<00:05:53.300> it<00:05:53.419> does<00:05:53.599> is<00:05:53.930> it

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:54.019 
up to two you can see what it does is it

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:58.089 
up to two you can see what it does is it
smooth<00:05:54.620> soft<00:05:54.979> my<00:05:55.189> match<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:56.289> it<00:05:57.289> creates<00:05:57.769> sort

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
smooth soft my match and it creates sort

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.279 
smooth soft my match and it creates sort
of<00:05:58.249> four<00:05:58.699> times<00:05:58.939> or<00:05:59.180> in<00:05:59.330> this<00:05:59.659> case<00:05:59.719> sort<00:06:00.199> of

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
of four times or in this case sort of

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.649 
of four times or in this case sort of
eight<00:06:00.649> times<00:06:00.919> as<00:06:01.129> many<00:06:01.249> polygons<00:06:01.939> in<00:06:02.149> my<00:06:02.360> model

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
eight times as many polygons in my model

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.629 
eight times as many polygons in my model
I<00:06:02.809> don't<00:06:03.559> have<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:03.889> view<00:06:04.069> it<00:06:04.159> in<00:06:04.279> this<00:06:04.399> way<00:06:04.610> i

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
I don't have to view it in this way i

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.839 
I don't have to view it in this way i
could<00:06:05.059> just<00:06:05.209> turn<00:06:05.330> on<00:06:05.479> my<00:06:05.719> isoline<00:06:06.289> display

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
could just turn on my isoline display

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.339 
could just turn on my isoline display
and<00:06:07.849> you<00:06:08.300> can<00:06:08.449> see<00:06:08.629> we've<00:06:08.809> got<00:06:08.930> a<00:06:08.959> sort<00:06:09.199> of<00:06:09.229> a

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
and you can see we've got a sort of a

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.159 
and you can see we've got a sort of a
much<00:06:09.860> easier<00:06:10.129> to<00:06:10.490> understand<00:06:11.169> approximation

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
much easier to understand approximation

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.189 
much easier to understand approximation
of<00:06:12.379> the<00:06:12.499> building<00:06:12.860> and<00:06:13.519> from<00:06:13.849> this<00:06:14.059> I<00:06:14.389> can<00:06:15.050> come

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
of the building and from this I can come

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.290 
of the building and from this I can come
up<00:06:15.229> and<00:06:15.469> down<00:06:15.709> my<00:06:16.189> modifier<00:06:16.669> stack<00:06:16.789> so<00:06:17.089> I<00:06:17.149> can

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
up and down my modifier stack so I can

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.869 
up and down my modifier stack so I can
go<00:06:17.389> to<00:06:17.449> my<00:06:17.659> freeform<00:06:18.139> defamation<00:06:18.740> box<00:06:18.979> and

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:19.879 
go to my freeform defamation box and

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.329 
go to my freeform defamation box and
let's<00:06:20.089> say<00:06:20.300> for<00:06:20.509> example<00:06:20.569> I<00:06:21.229> want<00:06:21.889> to<00:06:22.039> take<00:06:22.189> one

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:22.339 
let's say for example I want to take one

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.359 
let's say for example I want to take one
of<00:06:22.459> my<00:06:22.580> control<00:06:22.939> points<00:06:23.709> and<00:06:24.709> I'll<00:06:24.800> move<00:06:25.309> that

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:25.369 
of my control points and I'll move that

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:28.449 
of my control points and I'll move that
out<00:06:25.699> there<00:06:26.379> I'll<00:06:27.379> take<00:06:27.619> this<00:06:27.830> and<00:06:28.099> I'll<00:06:28.189> move

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:28.459 
out there I'll take this and I'll move

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:32.499 
out there I'll take this and I'll move
that<00:06:28.490> out<00:06:28.759> there<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:29.899> you<00:06:30.680> can<00:06:30.860> start<00:06:31.249> to<00:06:31.509> sort

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
that out there and you can start to sort

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.320 
that out there and you can start to sort
of<00:06:32.599> reshape<00:06:33.409> things<00:06:33.830> and<00:06:34.339> you<00:06:34.849> don't<00:06:34.879> have<00:06:35.180> to

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
of reshape things and you don't have to

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.049 
of reshape things and you don't have to
be<00:06:35.449> at<00:06:35.509> the<00:06:35.599> top<00:06:35.779> of<00:06:35.839> that<00:06:36.110> stack<00:06:36.439> either<00:06:37.059> you

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:38.059 
be at the top of that stack either you

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:43.719 
be at the top of that stack either you
see<00:06:38.269> you<00:06:38.479> can<00:06:38.659> just<00:06:38.870> move<00:06:39.079> things<00:06:39.439> around<00:06:42.729> it's

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
see you can just move things around it's

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:46.059 
see you can just move things around it's
got<00:06:43.879> this<00:06:43.969> sort<00:06:44.180> of<00:06:44.209> clay<00:06:44.689> almost<00:06:45.289> putty<00:06:45.649> type

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069 
got this sort of clay almost putty type

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:48.129 
got this sort of clay almost putty type
feel<00:06:46.459> to<00:06:46.699> it<00:06:46.729> when<00:06:47.329> you're<00:06:47.449> working<00:06:47.629> like<00:06:47.990> this

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
feel to it when you're working like this

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.350 
feel to it when you're working like this
it's<00:06:48.860> almost<00:06:49.039> quite<00:06:49.370> organic<00:06:49.999> in<00:06:50.149> the<00:06:50.240> way

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
it's almost quite organic in the way

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.509 
it's almost quite organic in the way
that<00:06:50.509> you<00:06:50.629> do<00:06:50.779> things<00:06:51.079> but<00:06:51.289> as<00:06:51.800> well<00:06:52.219> quite

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:52.519 
that you do things but as well quite

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:54.189 
that you do things but as well quite
interesting<00:06:53.240> because<00:06:53.360> the<00:06:53.659> shapes<00:06:53.930> that<00:06:54.050> you

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
interesting because the shapes that you

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:56.709 
interesting because the shapes that you
can<00:06:54.469> make<00:06:54.709> can<00:06:54.889> be<00:06:55.009> very<00:06:55.279> very<00:06:55.490> freeform<00:06:56.240> in

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:56.719 
can make can be very very freeform in

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:00.189 
can make can be very very freeform in
the<00:06:57.229> way<00:06:57.379> that<00:06:57.529> they<00:06:57.589> flow<00:06:58.810> so<00:06:59.810> we'll<00:06:59.990> come<00:07:00.169> up

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 
the way that they flow so we'll come up

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.079 
the way that they flow so we'll come up
to<00:07:00.349> the<00:07:00.439> top<00:07:00.589> there<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.009> I'll<00:07:02.199> deselect<00:07:03.199> and

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:04.089 
to the top there and I'll deselect and

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:06.429 
to the top there and I'll deselect and
what<00:07:05.089> I<00:07:05.120> would<00:07:05.329> encourage<00:07:05.479> you<00:07:05.779> to<00:07:05.990> do<00:07:06.169> is<00:07:06.349> to

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:06.439 
what I would encourage you to do is to

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.459 
what I would encourage you to do is to
start<00:07:07.399> off<00:07:07.550> yourself<00:07:08.029> with<00:07:08.689> something<00:07:08.959> like<00:07:09.259> a

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
start off yourself with something like a

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:14.739 
start off yourself with something like a
simple<00:07:09.860> box<00:07:11.889> there<00:07:12.889> we<00:07:12.979> go<00:07:13.159> I'm<00:07:14.149> moving<00:07:14.539> on<00:07:14.599> to

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:14.749 
simple box there we go I'm moving on to

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:18.189 
simple box there we go I'm moving on to
your<00:07:14.870> modified<00:07:15.259> tab<00:07:16.059> just<00:07:17.059> try<00:07:17.360> and<00:07:17.569> see<00:07:18.019> what

your modified tab just try and see what

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.899 
your modified tab just try and see what
each<00:07:18.349> one<00:07:18.559> of<00:07:18.620> these<00:07:18.709> does<00:07:19.039> there's<00:07:19.579> far<00:07:19.879> too

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:19.909 
each one of these does there's far too

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:22.540 
each one of these does there's far too
many<00:07:20.209> for<00:07:20.509> me<00:07:20.539> to<00:07:20.749> sort<00:07:20.899> of<00:07:21.019> deal<00:07:21.199> with<00:07:21.550> each

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
many for me to sort of deal with each

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.459 
many for me to sort of deal with each
one<00:07:22.909> individually<00:07:23.149> we<00:07:23.719> will<00:07:23.870> come<00:07:24.079> and<00:07:24.259> use

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:24.469 
one individually we will come and use

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:25.869 
one individually we will come and use
some<00:07:24.709> of<00:07:24.829> them<00:07:24.979> and<00:07:25.189> we<00:07:25.279> will<00:07:25.430> use<00:07:25.579> the<00:07:25.610> more

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 
some of them and we will use the more

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:29.409 
some of them and we will use the more
common<00:07:26.180> ones<00:07:26.209> as<00:07:26.539> we<00:07:26.689> go<00:07:26.870> through<00:07:28.149> this<00:07:29.149> sort

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:29.419 
common ones as we go through this sort

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.809 
common ones as we go through this sort
of<00:07:29.479> training<00:07:29.719> video<00:07:30.079> but<00:07:30.800> really<00:07:31.459> what<00:07:31.550> I<00:07:31.610> want

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:31.819 
of training video but really what I want
