 sweetie on air making who's cooler we 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.710
 the asshole came to visit 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 that we need any glass today 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 transparent can be a few toilet 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.370
 paper can not toilet paper need 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.469
 here's a cone from somewhere to take i don't it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.960
 Nikona Of course he from this tube rooms 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.270
 microbe bottomless flask 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.649
 why is it yes it's such a corpse shorter than an egg 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.980
 we still need some 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.020
 the cylinder here is the cylinder is very long here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.120
 what is such a thing any 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.070
 which can be put so on so here 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.589
 do it here or actually now 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.960
 what's up your nose so that's how it is 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.619
 thing was to have a result in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.570
 in the hands of such a cylinder here this one 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.479
 We put a piece on a glass 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.299
 speed doskado and on board the sections 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.299
 load on the board undressed put our 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.030
 how max figured out somehow figure out the cylinder 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.000
 here on top of the cylinder we put an egg 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.530
 we have never tried but in theory 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 should this physical experience 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.450
 where are you physically everything should turn out 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.380
 the egg must survive despite 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.380
 what will i do like this 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.090
 it turned out and then with four so we 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.880
 unwound a bunch of paper well, of course we 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.070
 we still will not need anywhere 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.010
 academy devil promising morris. i.e 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.600
 don't just throw out the garden need to all 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.970
 treat carefully we never spoil 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.680
 product so things and thing you know yes 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.080
 what can so be checked boiled eggs they 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.300
 or not this is all housewives 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.090
 and a householder for a note if max is not 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:14.959
 crooked hands there now will prove that physics 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:22.070
 does physics act like or date 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:24.040
 god I jerk but clearly giving nothing always 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.750
 we would be removed easily 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.650
 we will also make sausages there 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.670
 groza 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.270
 we work just for the sausage 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.080
 sausage egg name we Well 4 eggs 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.690
 reprisals 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.690
 Now let's check how sharp I am 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.970
 actually yes a little pepper soaring in 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.480
 Generally with one egg of course it works 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.390
 works much better with four and 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.850
 for sure you can listen here right at me 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.560
 Now we got the idea we are all such 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.390
 interactive with us and call 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.630
 interactive who is cooler interactive 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.060
 can be, well well, let's do the same 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.489
 let's who more at a time and do 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.250
 it is necessary to him in this way goes veto yes 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.560
 that will hit next releases and you 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.720
 start straight so well done we say here 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.160
 man could make you many eggs and 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.320
 that way they know that you will 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.330
 ask a sheet which is not for this not 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.370
 need to beat that is no need to boil that 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.010
 there cleaners you should come stay 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.600
 make us even who didn't get in 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.760
 glass and Well here such we 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.280
 It turned out the release of scientific noobs very 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.900
 physically active 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.030
 index temporary yes do not forget 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.600
 video response this video also in 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.959
 description 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.930
 in this video there is that link where are you 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.150
 throwing your options for the following experiences 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.920
 for news, go there 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.190
 PM, you can write to us but damn we 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.780
 just overwhelmed with messages and half 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.580
 invisibility so that we only therefore 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.220
 where to send and down there 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:07.120
 nets themselves for this we left 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.120
 just say goodbye to everyone for now 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.780
