00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:13.710
 summer is not limited it only attracts 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.540
 heat sun pool bikinis and swimsuits in this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.260
 time of the year during the season 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.430
 hot people also work and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.220
 very 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 that is, when it comes to choosing clothes for 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.779
 leave the house when you do not go to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.340
 pool or beach you have to 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.219
 pay close attention 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.700
 That's right, Carol. Actually, that's it. 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.860
 very important that in summer people 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 take care of your image really care 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.200
 of the clothes you will wear so you do not 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.100
 So much cool heat investing in parts with 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.110
 lighter colors, the fabric is also 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.719
 important then it has been with fibers 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.149
 natural is also very cool because 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.949
 will make your skin with which the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.070
 your body transpires in a better way 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.140
 so cotton linen are great options 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.409
 in that sense from now on 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.490
 you give three options of looks to the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.299
 from one more informal to another for a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.150
 work day and the last one for the night 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.240
 as much as we want to leave 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.430
 out there wearing a canga and nothing else 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.770
 care must be taken when 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.009
 choose clothes for summer 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.490
 The more casual look does not require 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.159
 Exquisite high but rather fun one 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.220
 Basic Jeans Bermuda is enhanced by 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.340
 nude belt with parents popping and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.000
 by colorful handmade bracelets 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.090
 however the highlight part of the combination is 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.210
 the morning and transparent tank top with 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.579

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.890

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.049
 person who really wants to enjoy the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.420
 holidays in a nice and modern way 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.200
 then you can invest in parts like 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.329
 this shirt that is of a noble fabric 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.729

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.849
 colors that are fashionable especially 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.520
 pink flower and the bird drawings 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.570

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.220
 fashion is very diverse and 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.280
 it is therefore possible to 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.640

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.970
