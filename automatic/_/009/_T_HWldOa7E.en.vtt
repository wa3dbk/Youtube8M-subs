00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.350 
rookie head coach who previously was a
defensive<00:05:38.190> backs<00:05:38.400> coach<00:05:38.550> so<00:05:38.879> he's<00:05:39.030> moving

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
defensive backs coach so he's moving

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.969 
defensive backs coach so he's moving
over<00:05:39.539> there<00:05:39.629> that<00:05:39.990> defense<00:05:40.349> is<00:05:40.500> getting<00:05:40.770> old

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
over there that defense is getting old

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.890 
over there that defense is getting old
especially<00:05:41.550> in<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.729> secondary<00:05:42.120> I<00:05:42.539> think

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
especially in the secondary I think

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.879 
especially in the secondary I think
Dallas<00:05:43.139> is<00:05:43.229> going<00:05:43.349> to<00:05:43.409> come<00:05:43.590> out<00:05:43.620> and

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
Dallas is going to come out and

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.529 
Dallas is going to come out and
absolutely<00:05:44.520> destroy<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.210> Tampa<00:05:45.509> Bay

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
absolutely destroy the Tampa Bay

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.080 
absolutely destroy the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:46.259> last<00:05:46.860> year<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.669> interesting

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
Buccaneers and last year the interesting

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.399 
Buccaneers and last year the interesting
thing<00:05:48.150> about<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.539> Buccaneers<00:05:48.990> they<00:05:49.139> gave<00:05:49.259> up

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
thing about the Buccaneers they gave up

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.499 
thing about the Buccaneers they gave up
23<00:05:49.800> passing<00:05:50.250> touchdowns<00:05:50.610> eight<00:05:50.849> most<00:05:51.240> in<00:05:51.389> the

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
23 passing touchdowns eight most in the

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.600 
23 passing touchdowns eight most in the
NFL<00:05:51.750> but<00:05:52.080> rushing<00:05:52.680> they<00:05:52.800> only<00:05:53.009> allowed<00:05:53.370> eight

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
NFL but rushing they only allowed eight

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.219 
NFL but rushing they only allowed eight
rushing<00:05:54.210> touchdowns<00:05:54.599> on<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:54.750> year<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:55.080> was

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
rushing touchdowns on the year that was

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.480 
rushing touchdowns on the year that was
the<00:05:55.349> fourth<00:05:55.590> fewest<00:05:55.919> in<00:05:56.069> the<00:05:56.099> leak<00:05:56.310> so<00:05:56.460> they

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
the fourth fewest in the leak so they

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.129 
the fourth fewest in the leak so they
are<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:56.729> little<00:05:56.880> stingy<00:05:57.240> one<00:05:57.720> of<00:05:57.780> those<00:05:57.900> bend

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
are a little stingy one of those bend

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.450 
are a little stingy one of those bend
but<00:05:58.289> don't<00:05:58.319> break<00:05:58.530> defenses<00:05:59.099> but<00:05:59.220> then<00:05:59.370> you

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
but don't break defenses but then you

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.920 
but don't break defenses but then you
can<00:05:59.580> beat<00:05:59.759> them<00:05:59.909> over<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.300> top<00:06:00.330> and<00:06:00.810> I<00:06:00.870> think

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
can beat them over the top and I think

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.360 
can beat them over the top and I think
that's<00:06:01.169> exactly<00:06:01.530> what<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:01.770> Dallas<00:06:01.979> Cowboys

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
that's exactly what the Dallas Cowboys

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.610 
that's exactly what the Dallas Cowboys
are<00:06:02.490> going<00:06:02.610> to<00:06:02.669> I<00:06:02.909> Tony<00:06:03.509> Romo<00:06:03.930> just<00:06:04.289> because<00:06:04.530> I
