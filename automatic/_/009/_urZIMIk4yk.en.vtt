being a mechanical and mechanical
engineering<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.770> what<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.010> actually<00:02:17.040> gave

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
engineering so what they actually gave

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.979 
engineering so what they actually gave
me<00:02:17.550> was<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:18.560> $55,000<00:02:19.560> credit<00:02:20.190> credit<00:02:20.819> line<00:02:21.239> that

me was a $55,000 credit credit line that

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.250 
me was a $55,000 credit credit line that
was<00:02:22.170> an<00:02:22.290> unsecured<00:02:23.010> debt<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.630> what<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.959> means

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
was an unsecured debt so what that means

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.020 
was an unsecured debt so what that means
is<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.500> an<00:02:25.860> unsecured<00:02:26.550> debt<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.849> like<00:02:27.000> a

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
is that an unsecured debt is like a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.460 
is that an unsecured debt is like a

credit card it doesn't have any
financial<00:02:28.819> there's<00:02:29.819> no<00:02:29.940> there's<00:02:30.390> no<00:02:30.450> backing

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
financial there's no there's no backing

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.650 
financial there's no there's no backing
to<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.580> compared<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.730> say<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> mortgage

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
to it compared to say like a mortgage

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.760 
to it compared to say like a mortgage
where<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> mortgage<00:02:34.950> has<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.620> backing<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.739> it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
where a mortgage has a backing to it

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.530 
where a mortgage has a backing to it
which<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.310> house<00:02:38.459> set<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.940> buying<00:02:39.390> them

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
which is the house set you buying them

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.840 
which is the house set you buying them
the<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.319> mortgage<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.800> right<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.610> if<00:02:41.730> you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
the the mortgage with right so if you

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.550 
the the mortgage with right so if you
don't<00:02:42.060> have<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.540> backing<00:02:43.050> it's<00:02:43.260> called<00:02:43.470> an

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
don't have that backing it's called an

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.229 
don't have that backing it's called an
unsecured<00:02:44.190> debt<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.880> credit

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
unsecured debt so it's like a credit

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.550 
unsecured debt so it's like a credit
card<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.540> basically<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.050> fifty<00:02:46.440> five

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the heck I wanted by the end of it

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.590 
the heck I wanted by the end of it
finished<00:02:52.500> my<00:02:52.620> two<00:02:52.799> years<00:02:52.980> off<00:02:53.160> racked<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.390> up

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
finished my two years off racked that up

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.050 
finished my two years off racked that up
quite<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:55.049> over<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.769> think<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.400> had<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.730> twenty

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
quite a bit over I think I had a twenty

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.789 
quite a bit over I think I had a twenty
five<00:02:57.239> twenty<00:02:57.900> five<00:02:57.930> thousand<00:02:58.410> dollars<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:58.709> my

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
five twenty five thousand dollars on my

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.740 
five twenty five thousand dollars on my
credit<00:02:59.010> line<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.640> they<00:03:00.269> also<00:03:00.390> gave<00:03:00.600> me<00:03:00.720> a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750

credit line and they also gave me a
credit<00:03:01.019> card<00:03:01.290> as<00:03:01.470> well<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.769> think<00:03:01.830> over

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
credit card as well and I think over

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.640

seven<00:03:02.790> thousand<00:03:03.239> dollars<00:03:03.569> on<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.530> I'm

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
seven thousand dollars on that so I'm

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.960 
seven thousand dollars on that so I'm
pretty<00:03:04.680> sure<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.069> think<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.370> was<00:03:05.459> around<00:03:05.580> thirty

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
pretty sure I think it was around thirty

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.550 
pretty sure I think it was around thirty
two<00:03:06.209> thousand<00:03:06.660> dollars<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:06.989> off<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.350> top<00:03:07.530> of

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
two thousand dollars just off the top of

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.590 
two thousand dollars just off the top of
my<00:03:07.680> head<00:03:07.950> how<00:03:08.400> was<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.640> able<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.910> get<00:03:09.120> rid<00:03:09.540> of

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
maybe because I thought I was
