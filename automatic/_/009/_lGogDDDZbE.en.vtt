00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.620 
decided to do it so the car Nene change
is<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> really<00:00:14.849> simple<00:00:15.859> thing<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.820> so

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
is a really simple thing is just this so

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.310 
is a really simple thing is just this so
and<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.980> car<00:00:20.220> disappears<00:00:21.080> they'll<00:00:22.080> actually

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
and the car disappears they'll actually

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.349 
and the car disappears they'll actually
listen<00:00:22.890> disappear<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> bottom<00:00:24.689> now

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
listen disappear just the bottom now

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.990 
listen disappear just the bottom now
this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> really<00:00:27.840> cool<00:00:28.050> change<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.939> how<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this is a really cool change and how to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.229 
this is a really cool change and how to
do<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.500> first<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.650> all<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.460> spectator<00:00:32.940> can

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
do it first of all the spectator can

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.860 
do it first of all the spectator can
select<00:00:33.690> any<00:00:33.960> part<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:35.640> case<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.149> nine<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
select any part this case the nine and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.910 
select any part this case the nine and
space<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:38.750> all<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.809> gotta<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.379> put<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
space so all you gotta do is put the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.420 
space so all you gotta do is put the
minus<00:00:41.190> bits<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.760> top<00:00:41.809> how<00:00:42.809> does<00:00:43.020> America

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
minus bits on top how does America

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.889 
minus bits on top how does America
because<00:00:44.430> we're<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> show<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.510> car<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
because we're going to show the car to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.100 
because we're going to show the car to
them<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:50.420> they<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.629> choose<00:00:51.870> one

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
them so you can just they can choose one

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
them so you can just they can choose one
card<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.710> put<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> bar<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.090> top

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
card and you can put in a bar on the top

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.930 
card and you can put in a bar on the top
and<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.070> make<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and then you just have to make the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.029 
and then you just have to make the
Cardini<00:00:57.539> change<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.489> their<00:00:59.489> car<00:00:59.789> disappears

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
Cardini change and their car disappears

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.299 
Cardini change and their car disappears
so<00:01:02.300> first<00:01:03.300> thing<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.570> need<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> practice<00:01:04.309> for

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
so first thing you need to practice for

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.810 
so first thing you need to practice for
the<00:01:05.339> Cardinal<00:01:06.150> changes<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:08.310> whole

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the Cardinal changes for your whole

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270 
the Cardinal changes for your whole
fingers<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.290> then<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> pull

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
fingers here and then just have to pull

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.149 
fingers here and then just have to pull
the<00:01:11.549> top<00:01:12.510> Kart<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.439> position<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the top Kart and to this position and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.560 
the top Kart and to this position and
try<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.290> cover<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.560> car<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.700> hand<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
try to cover that car with this hand so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.520 
try to cover that car with this hand so
like<00:01:21.780> that's<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:24.409> do<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.680> while<00:01:26.280> there

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
like that's then to do this while there

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.350 
like that's then to do this while there
without<00:01:28.530> them<00:01:29.009> noticing<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.790> need<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.210> out
