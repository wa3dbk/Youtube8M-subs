it's a great mask the only reason I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.790 
it's a great mask the only reason I
decided<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.359> dye<00:00:18.630> i4<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.260> mainly<00:00:19.500> was

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.140 
decided to get the dye i4 is mainly was
because<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.460> use<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.449> Tiberius<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:22.230> T<00:00:22.410> 9.1<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.189> I

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
because I use I Tiberius at T 9.1 and I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.400 
because I use I Tiberius at T 9.1 and I
wanted<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.810> something<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.320> would

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
wanted to have something that would

wanted to have something that would
allow<00:00:25.680> me<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.160> use<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.789> scope<00:00:27.060> because<00:00:28.050> it's

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
allow me to use the scope because it's

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.200 
allow me to use the scope because it's
such<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> small<00:00:28.740> profile<00:00:29.310> i<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.939> i<00:00:30.029> can

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
such a small profile i think i can

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.590 
such a small profile i think i can
actually<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.410> use<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.460> mask<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.450> look

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
down the scope at the same time that's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
down the scope at the same time that's
many<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> main<00:00:37.440> reason<00:00:37.710> i<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:37.829> them<00:00:38.070> now

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that it has a great viewing angle and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.000 
that it has a great viewing angle and
they're<00:00:44.190> very<00:00:44.219> reflective<00:00:45.289> there<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.379> go<00:00:46.530> see

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.060 
openings just a positioning and the
angle<00:01:52.500> makes<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.070> bit<00:01:53.220> different<00:01:53.930> ok

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
angle makes it a little bit different ok

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.109 
angle makes it a little bit different ok
another<00:01:56.070> thing<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.520> think<00:01:56.790> could<00:01:56.939> be

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
another thing that I think could be

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.160 
another thing that I think could be
improved<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.110> ear<00:01:59.070> padding<00:02:00.170> after

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
improved on was the ear padding after

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.109 
improved on was the ear padding after
having<00:02:01.350> these<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:02.040> about<00:02:02.189> four<00:02:02.880> or<00:02:02.909> five

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
having these on for about four or five

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.499 
having these on for about four or five
hours<00:02:03.590> they<00:02:04.590> tend<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.979> wear<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:06.390> those

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
hours they tend to wear on you for those

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.880 
hours they tend to wear on you for those
of<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:06.960> gamers<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.590> you've<00:02:07.740> ever

you're here start to feel a little bit

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.780 
you're here start to feel a little bit
tender<00:02:14.850> from<00:02:15.420> having<00:02:15.930> them<00:02:16.050> on<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.980> long<00:02:17.190> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
tender from having them on so long you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.980 
tender from having them on so long you
kind<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.030> get<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.210> same<00:02:18.420> feeling<00:02:18.600> with<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
kind of get the same feeling with the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.520 
kind of get the same feeling with the
soft<00:02:19.230> ears<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:21.050> after<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> couple<00:02:22.320> hours

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
soft ears on this after a couple hours

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.190 
soft ears on this after a couple hours
of<00:02:22.860> wearing<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.880> heard<00:02:24.540> not<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.050> mention

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
of wearing it just heard not to mention

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.820 
of wearing it just heard not to mention
it<00:02:25.410> was<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.560> little<00:02:25.680> bit<00:02:25.850> tight<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:29.060> let's<00:02:30.060> see

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
it was a little bit tight and let's see

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.550 
it was a little bit tight and let's see
it's<00:02:31.830> pretty<00:02:32.100> much<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.490> for<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.760> negatives

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
it's pretty much it for the negatives

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.800 
it's pretty much it for the negatives
the<00:02:34.560> positives<00:02:35.190> which<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.060> really<00:02:36.240> liked<00:02:36.570> is

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
the positives which I really liked is

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.900 
the positives which I really liked is
again<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.140> profile<00:02:37.650> view<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.130> great<00:02:38.970> oh<00:02:40.910> wait

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
again the profile view is great oh wait

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.970 
again the profile view is great oh wait
before<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.360> go<00:02:42.420> back<00:02:42.750> one<00:02:43.410> last<00:02:43.590> negative

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
before I go back one last negative

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.280 
before I go back one last negative
actually<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> pretty<00:02:44.850> annoying<00:02:45.090> one<00:02:45.300> when

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
actually a pretty annoying one when

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.530 
actually a pretty annoying one when
you're<00:02:46.470> wearing<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.920> mask<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.790> inside<00:02:48.510> of

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
you're wearing the mask in the inside of

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.120 
you're wearing the mask in the inside of
the<00:02:48.720> mask<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.320> will<00:02:49.470> not<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.740> able<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.980> tell

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the mask you will not be able to tell

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.600 
the mask you will not be able to tell
through<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.459> video<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:52.250> there's<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.310> bit<00:02:53.490> of

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
through this video but there's a bit of

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.320 
through this video but there's a bit of
a<00:02:53.670> reflection<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.709> see<00:02:56.120> why<00:02:57.120> you're

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
a reflection that you see why you're

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.600 
a reflection that you see why you're
wearing<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.690> mask<00:02:57.930> it's<00:02:58.530> mostly<00:02:58.980> noticeable

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
wearing the mask it's mostly noticeable

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.199 
wearing the mask it's mostly noticeable
when<00:02:59.820> you<00:03:00.030> are<00:03:00.270> in<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.630> shaded<00:03:00.870> area<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.970> looks

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
when you are in a shaded area it looks

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.060 
when you are in a shaded area it looks
like<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.510> might<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:03.780> reflecting<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.500> inside

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
like it might be reflecting the inside

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.300 
like it might be reflecting the inside
itself<00:03:05.459> with<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> mask<00:03:06.950> can't<00:03:07.950> see<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
itself with a mask can't see in the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.730 
itself with a mask can't see in the
camera<00:03:08.640> but<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.750> looks<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:09.990> it's<00:03:10.200> reflecting

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
camera but it looks like it's reflecting

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.520 
camera but it looks like it's reflecting
maybe<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.070> inside<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.610> mask<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:13.320> gets

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
maybe the inside of the mask and it gets

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.250 
maybe the inside of the mask and it gets
really<00:03:14.280> annoying<00:03:14.850> now<00:03:15.720> when<00:03:15.900> you're<00:03:16.019> out<00:03:16.140> in

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
really annoying now when you're out in

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.640 
really annoying now when you're out in
the<00:03:16.320> sunlight<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:17.400> don't<00:03:17.610> see<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.910> as<00:03:18.060> much

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
the sunlight you don't see it as much

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.110 
the sunlight you don't see it as much
but<00:03:19.650> that's<00:03:20.400> definitely<00:03:20.760> something<00:03:20.880> that's

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
but that's definitely something that's

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.660 
but that's definitely something that's
annoying<00:03:21.420> now<00:03:22.080> real<00:03:22.350> cool<00:03:22.680> thing<00:03:23.010> about<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
annoying now real cool thing about the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.449 
annoying now real cool thing about the
the<00:03:24.180> lens<00:03:24.420> itself<00:03:24.600> though<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.459> it's

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the lens itself though is that it's

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.550 
the lens itself though is that it's
mirrored<00:03:26.970> all<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.300> time<00:03:27.540> whether<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.260> are

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
mirrored all the time whether you are

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.400 
mirrored all the time whether you are
you<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.459> see<00:03:29.670> whether<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.600> are<00:03:30.720> indoors<00:03:31.140> or

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
you can see whether you are indoors or

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.699 
you can see whether you are indoors or
outdoors<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:32.130> is<00:03:32.280> mirrored<00:03:32.730> in<00:03:33.350> comparison<00:03:34.350> to

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
outdoors it is mirrored in comparison to

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.590 
outdoors it is mirrored in comparison to
the<00:03:35.269> v-force<00:03:36.410> profilers<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:38.160> could<00:03:38.340> see

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
the v-force profilers you could see

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.750 
the v-force profilers you could see
right<00:03:39.600> through<00:03:39.870> them<00:03:40.050> now<00:03:40.950> if<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.220> take<00:03:41.430> him<00:03:41.610> out

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
right through them now if I take him out

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.150 
right through them now if I take him out
to<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.600> Sun<00:03:43.459> then<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.640> see<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.970> reflective

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
to the Sun then you see the reflective

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.320 
to the Sun then you see the reflective
mirror<00:03:47.160> look<00:03:47.549> on<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.880> otherwise<00:03:48.709> you're<00:03:49.709> clear

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
mirror look on it otherwise you're clear

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
mirror look on it otherwise you're clear
so<00:03:51.330> this<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:51.989> pretty<00:03:52.170> cool<00:03:53.989> again<00:03:54.989> small

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
so this is pretty cool again small

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.060 
so this is pretty cool again small
profile<00:03:56.510> comparing<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.959> probe<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:59.040> the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
profile comparing it to the probe to the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.270 
profile comparing it to the probe to the
profiler<00:03:59.640> you<00:03:59.850> can<00:04:00.030> see<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:01.530> profile<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.100> much

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
