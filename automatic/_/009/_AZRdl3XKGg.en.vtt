00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.080
 my name in this case is nothing 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.659
 important the importance of this text 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.899
 is to tell you how in one day there are 150 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.970
 pesos ruined my life in 2014 the 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.340
 most anticipated video games in the world already 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.159
 they were in presale 'resident evil' 7 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.289
 Aug 8 final part ninja gaiden 5 and 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.659
 some others but the one I expected the most 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.630
 it was the god of war 5 that was expected to 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.850
 out the final part I'm a big fan of 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.319
 goal from the first game to the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.869
 attention with all the games 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.850
 intermediate my obsession led me to 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.280
 buy the order when sony announced the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.640
 game it is clear that among my hobbies 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.929
 is the reading creepy you pass obsessively 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.580
 the holidays came and my parents 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.970
 they left with much distrust 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.710
 leaving me in charge of the house 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.290
 in other cases they would not have left me 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.690
 as the housekeeper but this time 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.940
 it was something special they would go to visit 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.700
 to relatives whose faces I do not know 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.860
 that they would say in Canada after two days 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.050
 It was under control but I was forced to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.780
 apply for a job in a very blockbuster 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.460
 common in my locality every day I 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.920
 I had to attend as a guardian of 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.840
 full time soon after I 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.270
 I began to reveal the days of rest 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.190
 one day already hungry I decided to travel 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.920
 on the outskirts of the city to buy 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.870
 provisions for the next few days I took 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.120
 the motorbike and I flew out of the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.490
 house had to get there fast since it 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.620
 It was getting dark by going through 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.600
 in front of the blockbuster where he worked 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.990
 the traffic stopped me and the foreboding 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.330
 that something bad would happen the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.610
 temptation consumed me something dragged me 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.959
 in commerce could not 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.640
 control my feet 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.230
 when you get to the videogame hall 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.140
 I managed to see something that I really 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.500
 surprised there was a weird game called 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.930
 god of war 41 climb of souls that version 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.730
 never before had temptation seen her 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.459
 It was so big that I decided to spend 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.420
 of the provisions in that game the game 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.310
 only cost 150 pesos and I decided that for 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.190
 be a new game of godos guard 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.409
 It was very cheap to get to my house and 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.480
 I was anxious to try the game at 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:16.620
 start the game appeared four menus 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.390
 high of the story 1s options the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.150
 feeling that something was not going well 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.099
 I was still there a little annoying, feeling 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.920
 that the game was a fighting game 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.480
 I chose arcade mode just to test the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.390
 start there was a selection of 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.160
 characters three characters in total the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.930
 on the left was birds of the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.750
 right was zeus and the middle one 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.359
 obviously it was deals remembering my 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.310
 fascination for hades I chose it at 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.049
 start the game I did not have the option to 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.359
 choose scenario I was in a 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.640
 dark room apparently it was the fourth 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.599
 of a madhouse nothing to do with the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.640
 game 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.590
 Adés fought with the odd things 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.379
 gag with an unusual 'laura of light 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.870
 shortly after killing those things 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.359
 adés began to inflate more than much 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.280
 both physically and apparently so 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.010
 quick was the way the power 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.680
 since I decided to stop playing 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.100
 you can stop that phrase sounded with a voice 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.959
 gloomy and cold without weapons in the message 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.109
 that jumped directly to the screen 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.269
 there were two options kill or die these 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.340
 words bristled my skin I decided 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.610
 keep playing and when I chose the option 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.580
 kill a message jumped very well so 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.610
 you want to kill again two options yes or 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.100
 to die offended scared and tired I decided 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.200
 choose the option yes but here the weird 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.900
 started we have a great list of where 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.290
 choose select a soul the answers 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.840
 they were mom dad sister brother not what 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.840
 I could believe something was very wrong very badly 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.930
 having no other choice I decided to choose 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.820
 brother my logic was that if he died not 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.030
 we would suffer so much since he has not yet 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.690
 born a new battle began but in 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.130
 instead of one two three go a thing breathe 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.100
 in my neck and pronounced the following 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.110
 words rescue your soul those were the 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.930
 words of the famous creepy pasta 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.120
 super smash bros brawl this already had to 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.330
 finish following my knowledge in 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.250

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.169
 epi pastas I understood that I should not commit 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.110
 no mistake that the guy from the creepy 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.849

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.310
 a beast with a big bulge in the 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.710
 belly this was as amorphous as the 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.620
 characters of silente and origins al 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.509

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.060
 des pierced the belly of that thing 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.250
 it was really disturbing and very realistic 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.889
 at the end of the video scene another 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:39.509

 I had to turn off this console 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.990
 any way when trying to 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:50.300

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.379
 so fast I was disturbed with everything 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.539
 that another battle started this time played 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.400
 fight against something very similar to 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.830
 slender 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.229
 by murdering her a very video scene 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.600
 peculiar caught my attention to unearthed 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.639
 his swords in the neck of the thing 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.380
 after that I understood that all this 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.930
 it was really real not only was it the 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.539
 game function was actually 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.580
 killing my family everything was at fault 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.130
 about that damn game and that 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.750
 damn obsession I took that rod to 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.490
 poke the chimney and tear 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.560
 completely the rust there was a 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.270
 short of suddenly from the 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.250
 darkness I managed to see how the order 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.440
 changed shape to a rare beast 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.419
 Robotic skeleton covered arachnid 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.729
 for a kind of meat that was 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.770
 torn in a cruel way more 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.750
 similar creatures came for me and 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.960
 suddenly the television went on with 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.479
 a message you like my show so now 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.250
 comes the final part hahahahaha this 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.010
 history was found on 8 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.930
 December 2014 the young man and all his 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.120
 family found themselves dead in a 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.639
 armchair the mother had the belly 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.070
 totally destroyed and a strange fetus 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:17.990
 it came out of him the father was killed by a 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.030
 hit with a knife in the neck the 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.560
 sister was help in the garden I do not know

 knows the cause of death 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.490
 the young man was deprived of all 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.380
 bones and vital organs which 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.180
 they were ridiculous to be heard 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.490
 exchanged for metal scrap 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.990
 it seems that the young man's head was 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.690
 shattered with a console 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.690
