00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.330
 also Shaqiri Rheinfelden 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.880
 the first the journeymen have this in their hands 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.440
 I will be the approximately half of the population which messages us 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.819
 think in possible 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:14.929
 yes what are they important 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.130
 test the stud for the change 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130
 Remembering what they are 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.980
 yes, half of the population and there are many different 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 types of 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.659
 Welty's senders worry about growing masters titles 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.519
 the Buli Group their grandparents 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.160
 the IFE Ruth's line is 8 percent 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
 and the blankets are moving 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.180
 the WDR he after the crash in the 2 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.060
 It has very much expression in our life 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.120
 and the excellent ones actually 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.280
 because the room 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 Blumenthal around 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.470
 which are now worth settling around the innovations that are 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.050
 all cells under tel the hotel with a tent during the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.480
 which are now took over directly in the vicinity of innovations and the honorees 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.620
 now changes food 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.780
 and they also support the message that these are really 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.590
 that's a bit the world leads the support 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.480
 as a third from new lounge there have needed 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.049
 this on 40 cents per title rewards food and nutrition as well 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.539
 Schoeps is lying like that 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.600
 Base to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.650
 then there are the Bonuses Cotendo tremble Suben word 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.730
 and God sitting there just making the so-called market seems 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.509
 Finally, in exchange with the still on the market shifts to speak 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.970
 more important for them is the Olper commuter trains which are now on the Roxon 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.740
 they're so excited here now and Amax and that's a new twin tailpipe 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.960
 cited 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.479
 that's a new there impression and that's one and or a dozen and so on 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.880
 continue 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.970
 but they are now their soundings 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.120
 Toshibas are now the key to Maxon's growth is very important for 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.739
 the 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.279
 Forwarding information to the next message 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.049
 These are actually nothing but insulation layer 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.250
 so the better the isolation, the faster and safer it comes 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:28.459
 Information will be forwarded and therefore there is also this without God 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.999
 there are those that make Mark Disk touch the isolation cell team 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.009
 then, as in Morgan, there are also which cells and these defense cells which 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.489
 he is called the microglia 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.249
 with Florian Zeller 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.589
 that also looks the are not so important important this time Lyon 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.629
 then raise those of the need 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.240
 it's the last hole 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.120
 We hear the clothes Montenegro concern Â«That means that now 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.840
 education 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.060
 Here I have some time with increased margins of that he's the face 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.279
 so that they can orient themselves 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:04.909
 the here between 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.590
 actually the charterer and the main 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.229
 Percent and the brain happens between states and go has one 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.810
 Liquid so that so-called Lipkow 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.069
 that's the helplessness 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.899
 and this helplessness is important 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.090
 So that life is beautiful to see 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.499
 next to them and looks at the stadium 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:28.549
 because 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.569
 If Mandy did not have any fluids, then my head will be turned off 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:33.779
 would hit 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.319
 life goes on 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.729
 at the city and robbed suggest that he is not as good as they have it 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.939
 a bit of a protective it will be 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:42.959
 his 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.049
 then Montenegro should be filled with water before 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:54.849
 Congestion worries and here combined worried took part he begrudge him cells 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.299
 The Crichton makes this space the driving space out of these cells 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.849
 Can you imagine it so that's really it 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.889
 it's a little bit percent 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.669
 how should I say 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.669
 the potential also this this liquid 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:19.539
 and that's why they also use this space Music becomes their view 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.530
 Jab that actually they do not have to know anymore in the cells are simple 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.650
 really much the jersey 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.990
 nothing explains that the immune cells are in the brain 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.570
 Among the top 10 are that they are so high loads 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.920
 if they send on tour that's the statistic 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.529
 what supportive of the new year 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.050
 and in a knife 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.020
 but he has become reasonably clear what will happen 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.639
 these two are the important ones they need to know what they are doing 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.479
 since this can come from a bit come 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.759
 judgment 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.249
 yes this is not necessarily important now important cells are now the seats
