00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.650
 we are used to bobbies 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.779
 British are high thanks to their 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.850
 characteristic helmets helmets 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.310
 British are approximately 30 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.110
 centimeters its rounded shape fits 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.840
 perfectly in the head but still 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.760
 they add a lot of height to the police and 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.240
 that's not bad when one faces 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.240
 adversity 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.500
 times change but the helmet of the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.920
 bobbies is not the same for a century and 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.610
 medium today a metal mold is used to 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.950
 duplicate those in reinforced plastic 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.080
 the mold descends and enters an oven 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.010
 an operator places a sheet of 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.010
 plastic over 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.579
 lower the lid and slide a cover 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.350
 hot on top you only need a few 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.860
 minutes for the heat to soften the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.860
 plastic 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.380
 the mold rises and from below the vacuum 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.380
 mold the plastic to its shape 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.970
 hardens almost immediately and there 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.829
 than hit it with a rubber mallet to 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.829
 remove the skeleton from the helmet of the mold 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.590
 the material is cut with a saw 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.590
 left over from the wing 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 and the helmet is now ready for the lining 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.020
 for which a wool repellent is used 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.270
 Water 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.659
 the two halves of the pattern of the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.659
 helmet 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.770
 and they are sewn leaving a high seam 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.770
 that gives the helmet a nicer line 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.770
 the pieces that will form the lining of the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.200
 inner part are glued are treated with 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.230
 steam moistening them is easier 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.760
 work with them after they are queued 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.760
 all the exterior of the helmet 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.030
 fabric liner which is already wet 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.590
 makes it easier to spread it over 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.850
 Casting surface of the frame 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.850

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.550

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.770
 then with a wooden tool it 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.070
 Smooth the air bubbles that could 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.070
 stay 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.420
 the wing is trimmed to fix it 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.920
 and a rubber band is sewn around 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.520
 of the wing to reinforce it and make it more 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.520
 Elegant

 the inside of the helmet 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.300
 then tape strips are sewn 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.380
 plastic and foam to make the straps 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.380
 and the barbel complained 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.050

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.920
 the straps are placed inside the helmet 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.730
 and then fastened with a stapler 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.730

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.370
 with a pair of tweezers the lint is removed and
