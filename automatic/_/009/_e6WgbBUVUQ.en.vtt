00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
look at the distribution share we've

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.679 
look at the distribution share we've
built<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.549> beta<00:01:20.880> 1<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.540> has

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
built that in beta 1 so that it has

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.480 
built that in beta 1 so that it has
checkmarks<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.500> go<00:01:22.619> through<00:01:22.860> all<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.310> main

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
installation kit which we've already

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.260 
installation kit which we've already
done<00:01:28.560> prior<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.189> previous<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.880> demo

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
done prior with previous to this demo

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.850 
done prior with previous to this demo
now<00:01:30.990> we're<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> create<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.680> distribution

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
now we're going to create a distribution

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
now we're going to create a distribution
share<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.720> take<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> default

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
share so I just take the default

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.340 
share so I just take the default
settings<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.040> hit<00:01:35.520> create<00:01:35.720> now<00:01:36.720> I've<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
settings and hit create now I've got to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.219 
settings and hit create now I've got to
check<00:01:37.380> marks<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.780> my<00:01:39.780> deployment

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
check marks in my my deployment

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
check marks in my my deployment
workbench<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.640> next<00:01:41.759> thing<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
workbench so the next thing we have to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.090 
workbench so the next thing we have to
do<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.450> install<00:01:42.930> some<00:01:43.259> operating<00:01:43.680> system

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
do is install some operating system

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.300 
do is install some operating system
files<00:01:44.310> I'm<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> point<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:46.009> OS<00:01:47.009> source

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
files I'm going to point to OS source

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.480 
files I'm going to point to OS source
files<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.320> look<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.649> c<00:01:49.890> drive<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.910 
files and look at the c drive and the
deploy<00:01:50.790> source<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.530> we're<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.680> point

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
deploy source and we're going to point

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
deploy source and we're going to point
at<00:01:53.070> an<00:01:53.220> operating<00:01:53.729> system<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.649> basically

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
at an operating system and basically

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.639 
at an operating system and basically
import<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.250> into<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:57.119> environment<00:01:57.649> so

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
import that into this environment so

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.260 
import that into this environment so
we're<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> start<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.250> windows<00:01:59.850> 7

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
we're going to start out with windows 7

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.069 
we're going to start out with windows 7
enterprise<00:02:00.869> x86<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.509> we're<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> use

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
enterprise x86 and we're going to use

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.679 
enterprise x86 and we're going to use
the<00:02:04.649> Move<00:02:05.219> option<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.000> case<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.509> it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the Move option in this case because it

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.749 
the Move option in this case because it
is<00:02:06.930> much<00:02:07.140> faster<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.680> move<00:02:08.009> those<00:02:08.190> files<00:02:08.459> into

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
is much faster to move those files into

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.210 
is much faster to move those files into
the<00:02:08.849> deployment<00:02:09.420> share<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.890> will<00:02:11.009> give<00:02:11.160> us

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the deployment share and it will give us

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.580 
the deployment share and it will give us
a<00:02:11.489> name<00:02:11.670> already<00:02:12.000> pre-configured<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:13.140> mu

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
a name already pre-configured and mu

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.430 
a name already pre-configured and mu
those<00:02:13.739> files<00:02:14.040> over<00:02:14.400> for<00:02:14.640> us<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.840> after<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.290> have

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
those files over for us so after we have

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.170 
those files over for us so after we have
some<00:02:19.620> operating<00:02:19.980> systems<00:02:20.069> installed<00:02:20.940> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
some operating systems installed the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.059 
some operating systems installed the
next<00:02:21.450> thing<00:02:21.599> we<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.290> add<00:02:22.739> some

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
next thing we can do is add some

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.720 
next thing we can do is add some
applications<00:02:23.849> to<00:02:24.239> our<00:02:25.280> installation<00:02:26.280> package

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
applications to our installation package

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.850 
applications to our installation package
so<00:02:27.030> as<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.269> saw<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.660> previous<00:02:28.349> demo<00:02:28.830> of

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
now the MDT driver store will do p and

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.640 
now the MDT driver store will do p and

PID enumeration and basically add the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.800 
PID enumeration and basically add the
drivers<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.609> an<00:04:05.819> image<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.359> are<00:04:06.480> needed

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
drivers to an image that are needed

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.250 
drivers to an image that are needed
based<00:04:07.169> on<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.560> hardware<00:04:08.389> that<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.540> detects<00:04:09.900> so

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
based on the hardware that it detects so

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.710 
based on the hardware that it detects so
I've<00:04:10.980> now<00:04:11.310> got<00:04:11.549> operating<00:04:12.329> systems

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
I've now got operating systems

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.650 
I've now got operating systems
applications<00:04:13.400> packages<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.609> drivers<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:15.450> in

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
applications packages and drivers now in

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.440 
applications packages and drivers now in
my<00:04:15.840> deployment<00:04:16.620> environment<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:18.150> just<00:04:18.329> an

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
my deployment environment and just an

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.089 
my deployment environment and just an
important<00:04:18.840> note<00:04:19.019> here<00:04:19.289> what<00:04:19.440> i<00:04:19.470> could<00:04:19.560> do<00:04:20.070> is

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
important note here what i could do is

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.959 
important note here what i could do is
actually<00:04:21.030> not<00:04:22.070> put<00:04:23.070> in<00:04:23.159> the<00:04:23.250> drivers<00:04:23.640> and

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
actually not put in the drivers and

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.940 
actually not put in the drivers and
packages<00:04:24.539> and<00:04:24.719> dis<00:04:24.810> rely<00:04:25.140> windows<00:04:25.469> update<00:04:25.770> for

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
packages and dis rely windows update for

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.080 
packages and dis rely windows update for
these<00:04:26.070> things<00:04:26.340> so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
these things so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.460 
these things so
the<00:04:27.389> next<00:04:27.600> thing<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.750> need<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:27.930> do<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.169> build<00:04:28.320> a

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
the next thing I need to do is build a

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.110 
the next thing I need to do is build a
task<00:04:28.680> sequence<00:04:28.949> so<00:04:29.310> I've<00:04:29.490> right<00:04:29.730> clicked<00:04:29.970> on

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
task sequence so I've right clicked on

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.780 
task sequence so I've right clicked on
task<00:04:30.360> sequences<00:04:30.930> given<00:04:31.230> it<00:04:31.290> an<00:04:31.380> ID<00:04:31.669> given<00:04:32.669> that

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
task sequences given it an ID given that

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.360 
task sequences given it an ID given that
a<00:04:32.820> task<00:04:33.090> sequence<00:04:33.300> name<00:04:34.100> we're<00:04:35.100> going<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.280> use

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
a task sequence name we're going to use

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.010 
a task sequence name we're going to use
a<00:04:35.400> standard<00:04:35.669> client<00:04:36.240> task<00:04:36.449> sequence<00:04:36.690> which

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
a standard client task sequence which

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.960 
a standard client task sequence which
will<00:04:37.169> do<00:04:37.350> all<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.590> my<00:04:37.740> data<00:04:37.979> migration<00:04:38.639> apps

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
will do all of my data migration apps

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.409 
will do all of my data migration apps
etc<00:04:39.389> as<00:04:40.080> part<00:04:40.889> of<00:04:40.949> a<00:04:41.040> fully<00:04:41.419> unattended

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
bank will set up the administrator

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.150 
bank will set up the administrator
password<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:55.050> will<00:04:55.199> build<00:04:55.380> me<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.919> task

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
password and that will build me a task

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.320 
password and that will build me a task
sequence<00:04:56.430> as<00:04:56.850> well<00:04:57.030> as<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.240> nun<00:04:57.479> attend<00:04:57.840> and

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
sequence as well as a nun attend and

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
sequence as well as a nun attend and
once<00:05:00.330> we're<00:05:00.479> done<00:05:00.540> with<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:00.750> then<00:05:01.139> basically

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
once we're done with that then basically

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.280 
once we're done with that then basically
we<00:05:01.650> have<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:02.300> choose<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.330> new<00:05:03.570> deployment<00:05:03.870> point

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
we have to choose a new deployment point

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.960 
we have to choose a new deployment point
in<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:04.470> case<00:05:04.740> we'll<00:05:04.979> use<00:05:05.220> removable<00:05:05.850> media

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
in this case we'll use removable media

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.010 
in this case we'll use removable media
as<00:05:06.330> I've<00:05:06.540> built<00:05:07.350> off<00:05:07.620> of<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.919> USB<00:05:08.720> Drive<00:05:09.720> I've

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
as I've built off of a USB Drive I've

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.870 
as I've built off of a USB Drive I've
actually<00:05:10.200> imported<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.979> deployment<00:05:11.729> folder

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
actually imported the deployment folder

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.670 
actually imported the deployment folder
in<00:05:12.180> that<00:05:12.300> last<00:05:12.510> demonstration<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.560> the

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
that entire process the last thing I

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.330 
that entire process the last thing I

workbench into a folder in this case

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.940 
workbench into a folder in this case
called<00:05:50.610> media<00:05:50.849> and<00:05:51.240> that<00:05:52.080> is<00:05:52.410> what<00:05:52.740> I<00:05:52.770> would

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
called media and that is what I would

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.480 
called media and that is what I would
copy<00:05:53.220> into<00:05:53.760> a<00:05:53.789> bootable<00:05:54.450> USB<00:05:55.010> stick<00:05:56.010> for

copy into a bootable USB stick for
example<00:05:56.970> which<00:05:57.630> would<00:05:57.810> allow<00:05:57.990> me<00:05:58.200> to<00:05:58.440> build

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
example which would allow me to build

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.310 
example which would allow me to build
out<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.520> operating<00:06:00.000> systems<00:06:00.450> that<00:06:00.690> I've<00:06:00.810> put

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
out the operating systems that I've put

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.659 
out the operating systems that I've put
into<00:06:01.470> it<00:06:01.620> so<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:01.860> could<00:06:01.919> deploy<00:06:02.340> everything

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
into it so I could deploy everything

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.930 
into it so I could deploy everything
from<00:06:02.910> Windows<00:06:03.270> XP<00:06:03.650> to<00:06:04.650> vista<00:06:04.680> to<00:06:05.130> windows<00:06:05.280> 7<00:06:05.760> to
