prefer just to open cuz I'm lazy and I

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
prefer just to open cuz I'm lazy and I
like<00:01:20.050> to<00:01:20.140> save<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:20.530> can<00:01:20.649> just<00:01:20.770> delete

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
like to save and I can just delete

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.100 
like to save and I can just delete
temporary<00:01:21.190> files<00:01:21.490> whenever<00:01:21.910> I<00:01:22.060> want<00:01:22.300> but<00:01:23.020> if

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
temporary files whenever I want but if

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.330 
temporary files whenever I want but if
you<00:01:23.229> don't<00:01:23.410> really<00:01:23.500> know<00:01:23.649> how<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.800> do<00:01:23.890> any<00:01:24.009> tech

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.430 
you don't really know how to do any tech
stuff<00:01:24.700> then<00:01:25.090> I'd<00:01:25.360> recommend<00:01:25.660> saving<00:01:26.080> it<00:01:26.350> so

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440

stuff then I'd recommend saving it so
you<00:01:26.500> can<00:01:26.649> delete<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:26.950> easier<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:28.209> what<00:01:28.390> you

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
you can delete it easier so what you
