00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.500 
you obviously have your contour controls
right<00:02:30.520> here<00:02:30.580> on<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.850> front<00:02:31.090> panel<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
right here on the front panel of the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.830 
right here on the front panel of the
mixer<00:02:31.900> for<00:02:32.050> both<00:02:32.770> up<00:02:33.010> faders<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.820> cross<00:02:34.540> fader

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
mixer for both up faders and cross fader

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.230 
mixer for both up faders and cross fader
so<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:35.800> reverse<00:02:36.130> them<00:02:36.400> put<00:02:37.030> them<00:02:37.150> in

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
so you can reverse them put them in

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.060 
so you can reverse them put them in
hamster<00:02:37.720> mode<00:02:37.930> however<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.500> like<00:02:38.530> them<00:02:38.860> and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
hamster mode however you like them and

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.910 
hamster mode however you like them and
you<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:39.880> attention<00:02:40.750> control<00:02:41.080> on<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.709> cross

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
you have attention control on the cross

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.100 
you have attention control on the cross
fader<00:02:42.160> itself<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.330> if<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.570> like<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.900> real

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
fader itself so if you like it a real

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.620 
fader itself so if you like it a real
stiff<00:02:44.500> feel<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.610> get<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.790> stiff<00:02:46.090> too<00:02:46.360> if<00:02:46.570> you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
stiff feel and get a stiff too if you

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.560 
stiff feel and get a stiff too if you
like<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.900> real<00:02:47.080> loose<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:48.820> can<00:02:48.970> keep<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.300> real

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
like the real loose you can keep it real

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.410 
like the real loose you can keep it real
loose<00:02:49.900> with<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.350> said<00:02:51.870> do<00:02:52.870> some<00:02:53.050> scratching
