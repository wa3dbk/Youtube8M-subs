00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.220

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.800
 wolverine 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.160
 at the moment I have there normal no 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.160
 I chose 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:04.269
 I have the hot black widow girl this is 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.930

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.630
 I have but well there are observed there 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.750
 I leave what I see in Captain 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.750
 america the ones that I want zone 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.670
 I want wolverine maybe later on to 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.670
 crankcase spider-man 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:34.210
 and here this singer's voice this war 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.380
 machine and the mill 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.929
 there are several characters chosen me to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.789
 fight with these 3 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.950
 then I will show you more or less of what 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.100
 it is about 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.259
 He has a pending training 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.200
 means that as I go 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:59.450
 training you have more powers 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.450
 then already opposing the strong 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.200
 but no 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.850
 I like it much more than attacking the three 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.850
 time 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.940
 but no 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.940
 of his death 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:27.390
 I do not have half of life girl 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:34.620
 but then for the days 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:38.700
 is this defense does not list us 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.640
 a life restoration pack 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.060
 however I lose in turn this is my 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.400
 character 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.600
 it's pretty good but coming here is not going 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.620
 buying weapons 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.620
 it is not improving 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.760
 haile from a space that starts 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.370

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.270
 chicago has a very interesting power 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:43.480
 this gives me double turn to be able to attack 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.630

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.290
