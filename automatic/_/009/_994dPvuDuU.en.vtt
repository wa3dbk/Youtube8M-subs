00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.400 
in New York I think the day before on
television<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:39.280> at<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.580> turkey<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.410> guess

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
television so at the turkey I guess

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.890 
television so at the turkey I guess
