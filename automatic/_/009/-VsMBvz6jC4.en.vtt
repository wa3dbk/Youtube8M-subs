playground<00:00:29.859> than<00:00:30.189> boardroom<00:00:30.820> I<00:00:31.060> think<00:00:31.660> it

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
playground than boardroom I think it

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.049

it all is the render farm a collection

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.800 
it all is the render farm a collection
of<00:02:07.920> super-powered<00:02:08.700> processors<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.780> a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and beyond the animation team is working

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.520 
and beyond the animation team is working
on<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.370> top-secret<00:02:17.670> project<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.140> couldn't

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
on a top-secret project so we couldn't

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.890 
on a top-secret project so we couldn't
see<00:02:19.769> their<00:02:20.010> work<00:02:20.220> area<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.150> they<00:02:21.269> did<00:02:21.480> take<00:02:21.720> us

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
see their work area but they did take us

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.569 
see their work area but they did take us
behind<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.380> scenes<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:23.070> show<00:02:23.250> us<00:02:23.370> how<00:02:23.549> a

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
behind the scenes to show us how a

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.030 
behind the scenes to show us how a
typical<00:02:23.820> sequence<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.750> put<00:02:24.959> together<00:02:25.079> this<00:02:25.739> is

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
typical sequence is put together this is

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.009 
typical sequence is put together this is
the<00:02:26.280> storyboard<00:02:26.760> version<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.299> I'll<00:02:27.600> play<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
the storyboard version so I'll play that

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:28.670 
the storyboard version so I'll play that
for<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.260> real<00:02:28.440> quick

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
for you real quick

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.670

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
love you so as you can see this is like

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.160 
love you so as you can see this is like
an<00:02:34.769> animated<00:02:35.130> comic<00:02:35.700> book<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> next<00:02:36.900> step

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
an animated comic book so the next step

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.440 
an animated comic book so the next step
of<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.650> process<00:02:37.860> would<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.340> actually<00:02:39.090> putting

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
of the process would be actually putting

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.900 
of the process would be actually putting
these<00:02:39.570> models<00:02:40.079> into<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> set<00:02:40.890> I'm<00:02:41.459> trying<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
these models into a set I'm trying to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.360 
these models into a set I'm trying to
just<00:02:42.480> block<00:02:43.380> out<00:02:43.530> with<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.890> broadest

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
just block out with the broadest

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.479 
just block out with the broadest
brushstrokes<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.450> main<00:02:45.989> gestures<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.769> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
brushstrokes the main gestures and the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.319 
brushstrokes the main gestures and the
main<00:02:47.640> actions<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:49.070> my<00:02:50.070> final<00:02:50.549> animation

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
main actions this is my final animation

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.780 
main actions this is my final animation
but<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> polished<00:02:52.320> animation<00:02:52.920> with

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
but this is the polished animation with

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.060 
but this is the polished animation with
the<00:02:54.120> cloth<00:02:54.570> simulation<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.440> Carl<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
the cloth simulation on Carl and the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.910 
the cloth simulation on Carl and the
hair<00:02:57.030> simulation<00:02:57.630> on<00:02:57.750> Doug<00:02:57.989> equally

hair simulation on Doug equally
impressive<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.730> research<00:03:00.150> work<00:03:00.450> that's

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
impressive is the research work that's

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.229 
impressive is the research work that's
done<00:03:00.840> before<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> single<00:03:01.980> frame<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.579> animated

making<00:03:33.260> 3d<00:03:34.099> practical<00:03:34.819> models<00:03:35.209> we<00:03:35.540> made<00:03:35.989> a

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
making 3d practical models we made a

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.390 
making 3d practical models we made a
model<00:03:37.580> of<00:03:37.760> Carl's<00:03:38.450> house<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.470> main<00:03:39.709> reason<00:03:40.190> we

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
model of Carl's house the main reason we

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.289 
model of Carl's house the main reason we
did<00:03:40.640> this<00:03:40.849> was<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:42.040> see<00:03:43.040> how<00:03:43.340> we<00:03:43.400> can<00:03:43.790> get<00:03:44.090> an

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
did this was to see how we can get an

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.880 
did this was to see how we can get an
aged<00:03:44.930> nicely<00:03:45.799> aged<00:03:46.130> worn<00:03:46.819> house<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:48.560> didn't

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
aged nicely aged worn house that didn't

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.460 
aged nicely aged worn house that didn't
look<00:03:49.040> too<00:03:49.400> scary<00:03:50.030> like<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.480> haunted<00:03:50.720> house<00:03:51.110> and

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
look too scary like a haunted house and

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.670 
look too scary like a haunted house and
then<00:03:51.650> we<00:03:51.769> also<00:03:51.950> had<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.370> figure<00:03:52.730> out<00:03:53.200> how<00:03:54.200> the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
then we also had to figure out how the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.250 
then we also had to figure out how the
bottom<00:03:55.129> of<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.670> house<00:03:55.879> was<00:03:56.480> actually<00:03:57.110> going

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
bottom of the house was actually going

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.039 
bottom of the house was actually going
to<00:03:57.319> look<00:03:57.650> because<00:03:58.310> we<00:03:58.519> knew<00:03:58.730> going<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.329> be<00:03:59.690> big

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
to look because we knew going to be big

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.610 
to look because we knew going to be big
shots<00:04:00.349> of<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.739> floating<00:04:01.459> off<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.640> ground
