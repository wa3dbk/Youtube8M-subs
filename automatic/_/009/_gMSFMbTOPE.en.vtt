00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 and half of the stream 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.819
 tiger river south of the south 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.790
 leomar work in a region dominated 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.080
 by tobacco cultivation but the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.840
 there farmers are seeking 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.980
 diversify the sites with the cultivation of 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.750
 Blackberry 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
 only they are finding the waves very 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.060
 Guys, look, you can save that. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.650
 money producing the seedlings themselves 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.199
 see only 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.720
 Leomar to take away your doubt we see 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.670
 a plantation of blackberries in Cambui 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.260
 in the south of minas gerais 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 and who is going to explain to us how 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.300
 Mute is the agronomist of emater luiz 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.520
 cláudio rodrigues luís cláudio is simple 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.290
 make the blackberry seedlings 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.989
 yes it's simple the first step is if 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.719
 protect you start by putting the magnifying glass 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.989
 It's a plant with thorns right. 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.930
 called the power of pruning there was the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.930
 your plants in your plantation and remove 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.140
 stakes like this how to pick the twig 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.940
 which will become branching seed that has 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.370
 a thickness of around a pencil 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.220
 A pen, then let's get it here. 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.290
 this here for example cut here and it's 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.840
 It's very important that we make the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.770
 Also withdrawn from the leaves of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.409
 changes because the plant does not yet have 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.040
 root still do not leave this thing that she 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.380
 will suck the plant and will 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 development of this plate a stake 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.360
 can yield more than one molt 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.159
 Ideally, each should have about 20 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.280
 centimeters in length 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.829
 I'm going to catch a fugitive. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.409
 put a resident prepared one afternoon 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.490
 an organic compound 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.979
 Let's plant in our language. 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.860
 now that change is in sight for how much 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.909
 time she can stay for up to one year on the river 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.560
 three months four months can be 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.110
 transported by field but the care 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.270
 during which time she hopes to live 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.759
 not let the water that the producer 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.040
 have to observe to see that it is 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.380
 at the right time to carry this 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.630
 changes to the field of development 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.190
 on the street beyond the leaves on it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.370
 is issuing new sheets 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.989
 she admitted new roots is in franc 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.030
 development, then it is in 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.920
 little conditions 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.440
 until it's ready to be planted mute 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.790
 can stay in the sun long as it is the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.790
 guard regularly
