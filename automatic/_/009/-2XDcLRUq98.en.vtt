00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
of this thing with magnets so you don't

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560 
of this thing with magnets so you don't
have<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> worry<00:00:53.370> about<00:00:53.489> having<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.300> flop

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
have to worry about having this flop

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.430 
have to worry about having this flop
around<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:55.020> anything<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.350> you're

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
around or anything when you're

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.869 
around or anything when you're
transporting<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.340> don't<00:00:56.430> retract

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
transporting it so they don't retract

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.849 
transporting it so they don't retract
back<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.600> some<00:00:57.809> brands<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.289> they

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
back in like some brands do they

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.110 
back in like some brands do they
actually<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.190> connect<00:00:59.520> with<00:00:59.579> magnets<00:01:00.030> on

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
actually just connect with magnets on

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.400 
actually just connect with magnets on
the<00:01:00.239> side<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> magnets<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:00.930> pretty<00:01:01.079> strong

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so you're not gonna think it's a little

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.429 
so you're not gonna think it's a little
bit<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.480> effort<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.899> them<00:01:04.019> off<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.290> they're

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
bit of effort get them off but they're

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899 
bit of effort get them off but they're
pretty<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:05.100> solid<00:01:05.610> they're<00:01:05.729> they're<00:01:05.880> not

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
pretty pretty solid they're they're not

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
pretty pretty solid they're they're not
gonna<00:01:06.060> pop<00:01:06.330> off<00:01:06.510> too<00:01:06.750> easily<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:07.890> some

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
gonna pop off too easily there are some

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.649 
gonna pop off too easily there are some
controls<00:01:08.490> where<00:01:08.760> those<00:01:08.909> magnets<00:01:09.330> are<00:01:09.450> though

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
quality it feels a little bit tinny to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.359 
quality it feels a little bit tinny to
me<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.530> wouldn't<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:37.860> would<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.130> liked<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
me I wouldn't really would have liked to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.980 
me I wouldn't really would have liked to
have<00:01:38.490> heard<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.850> better<00:01:39.119> range<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.689> sound

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
have heard a better range of sound

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.390 
have heard a better range of sound
especially<00:01:40.200> given<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.100> your

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
especially given these are in your

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.340 
especially given these are in your
earbuds<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> best<00:01:42.600> music<00:01:42.780> quality

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
earbuds so not the best music quality

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.899 
earbuds so not the best music quality
I'm<00:01:43.710> not<00:01:43.890> bad<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.280> you're<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.520> running<00:01:44.700> or

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
I'm not bad if you're out running or

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.550 
I'm not bad if you're out running or
doing<00:01:45.060> some<00:01:45.299> podcasts<00:01:45.509> or<00:01:46.020> audiobooks<00:01:46.290> or

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
doing some podcasts or audiobooks or

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.350 
doing some podcasts or audiobooks or
something<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.399> definitely<00:01:48.240> not

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
something like that but definitely not

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
something like that but definitely not
an<00:01:48.509> audiophile<00:01:49.079> device<00:01:49.470> by<00:01:49.649> any<00:01:49.860> stretch<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
an audiophile device by any stretch and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.010 
an audiophile device by any stretch and
I<00:01:50.399> think<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> range<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.450> sound<00:01:51.689> could<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
I think the range of sound could be a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
I think the range of sound could be a
little<00:01:52.200> bit<00:01:52.380> better<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.680> them<00:01:53.070> here's<00:01:53.430> what

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
little bit better on them here's what

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.399 
little bit better on them here's what
