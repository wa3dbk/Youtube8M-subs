00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.470
 side 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.330
 We are going to change the brush now. 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.670
 let's use brush 422 number 1000 to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.650
 yellow ink 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.650

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.010

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.850
 ok still with the same brush I've seen my 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.380
 We're going to use white paint and let's go. 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.380

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.230
 in sheet form 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.400
 the petals can also be made with the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.840
 help of the toothpick for those who do not 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.840

 some girls prefer to work like this 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.060
 I'd rather work with the brush. 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:37.589
 the shape of the petal is already in the air and you 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.839

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:08.339

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:13.860

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:18.209
