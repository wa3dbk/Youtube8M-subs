00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.460
 hello guys welcome one more day to 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.580
 macro ps3 and this time since enough 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.029
 people still do not know how to pass the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.189
 maps from the play to the pce of the pc to the play 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.410
 well I'm going to do a tutorial kind and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 good I started a tutorial trying 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.970
 explain you the best possible as well as 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.140
 would be all the steps to follow and good 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.879
 let's start directly myself 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.810
 I just have a one- gigabyte usb 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.520
 of memory 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.380
 with a series of folders created that 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.570
 now you are going to see simple ssb simply 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.080
 I have it for maps then you go in 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.780
 my pc or computer and the usb simply 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.030
 has this folder called ps3 written 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.940
 in upper case, this folder is valid 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.460
 you create another one there is this you have to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.420
 create us logically within that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.280
 ps3 folder 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.460
 you have to create these three safe folders 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.520
 data dm you that always capitalized 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.140
 remember of city ​​are not used at all 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.810
 I did not have to touch him so far 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.180
 nothing is worth everything all the maps go 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.010
 6 for the folder data in this 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.780
 folder we open it and here all the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.610
 folders that you see this would already be all 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.990
 the maps as the ones that I did most 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.630
 some that I was downloading out there 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.310
 to try and other maps always 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.140
 they are going to be a folder is not a file 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.140
 it's always going to be this folder called np 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.429
 ok this is free publicity 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.190
 of the folder means that it is a 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.960
 map of the European region if outside the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.810
 American region then instead of a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.190
 would have a u so it would be the same 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 np 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.410
 b will be the same if you want you have 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.690
 a map in European region like this and 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.940
 you want to spend it American you can not 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.000
 change the name directly here from 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.229
 the folder and the numbers and so on 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 It will not be worth anything for it 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.360
 we need a program that I have it for 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.400
 here and it's called blood I forced save data 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.630
 that program so good of following a 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.880
 series of steps at the end you can 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.040
 convert it change them from regions and 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.160
 well now explain how to download and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.440
 put a map 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.710
 in the usb to then pass it to the play 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.890
 for example I have here open this 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.870
 it's in a video of mine the adventure map 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.050
 Well, you're just always going to show 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.050
 plus 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.689
 and it's going to go the whole description that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.849
 I put here good you see the billet that 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.469
 I wrote down below, they will always be 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.480
 the two versions no download link 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.120
 this is the European version and then 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.769
 you have down the american good you see 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.599
 here now on this map for example 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.799
 I have two links but good from 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.260
 now I will work only with brow 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.810
 dropbox as long as I do not have problems 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.719
 we would give this link and it will take us 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.129
 directly to this page simply 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.379
 you wait a while to charge if you do not 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.629
 you can update it and because 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.069
 sometimes this name does not come out of the 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.959
 binder 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.280
 then updated and good 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.469
 normally it usually comes out first 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.639
 because being on this page you have 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.939
 to give here these ellipses 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.409
 next to share and to give it here you 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.719
 will come out options because if I 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.450
 you have to put download as zip to 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.000
 that you are all download the file 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.739
 compressed, I already have everything 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.540
 made for it to be faster here what 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.489
 you see this was the file that you download 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.110
 you just look for it in the folders 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.170
 where are you going to the downloads 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.580
 and this is going to come out, this is not what I know 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.630
 we download then simply when 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.870
 let's have the entire desk in the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.520
 folder where you want secondary button 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.380
 extract here and it's going to extract everything 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.210
 what's inside everything together and here 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.250
 You see this folder gives you this already 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.220
 I did it and I created it, not because it opens 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.630
 our folder here you see the folder already 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.800
 this would be the map you see npv because it's the 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.900
 European version and simply here 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.330
 cut or copies I think that also 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.790
 ok but good if you do not want it then 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.550
 just for thais and well I closed here 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.260
 just cut and you stick it inside 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.640
 segi folder of your data 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.520
 usb 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.430
 we open ps3 followed is here and here 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.519
 it would simply be to paste and the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.160
 map inside the usb now I will move to 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.169
 explain how to pass it to the play and 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.240
 how to copy it because you have to make a 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.120
 series of steps also quite simple 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.380
 on the play 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.380
 well that so far 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.510
 good guys, we continue the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.970
 tutorial already in the section of play 3 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.610
 Right now what I did was 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.290
 insert the usb in play 3 and 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.600
 we would simply go here to the section 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.450
 of game in this folder that puts 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.370
 ps3 saved data tool 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.830
 simply inside you would find here 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.950
 would be all saved games of 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.680
 a majority of games that you played 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.240
 I think all the games are saved 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.810
 here more some application and others 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.430
 you can see it then simply in this 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.800
 section is going to leave this device 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.080
 it is seen that it is the usb that you have 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.400
 inside then simply inside here you 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.080
 will come out all the maps that we saw 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.380
 before they were folders 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.880
 because now they become the image and 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.830
 is for example is it that we 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.770
 we download the world of adventures not 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.900
 Well simply knowing what we want 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.600
 we give to the triangle and here we do not know 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.960
 the options we put copy and 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.960
 you just see 15 megabytes and you see what 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.139
 it takes simply is already copied this 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.050
 what makes us spend it from the usb 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:47.380
 here to the memory console of the play and 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.260
 now simply entering the game 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.880
 and when you play game that you 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.160
 load the maps that I will have you 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.560
 Well, you will also get the map that 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.120
 you have downloaded these would be all 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.910
 steps to follow and you can see that it's nothing 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.740
 complicated if you want what you want 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.120
 to do is for all of you and take it out then 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.580
 you just have to do what 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.530
 otherwise not here in saved games 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.470
 of your play, all the 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.270
 maps so for example this you say I want 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.010
 get it out you can just copy though 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.230
 you see the little symbol the little symbol of 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.610
 playstation plus does not need that 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.040
 it simply tells you that you have more 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.480
 options if you want to plus but not 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.180
 it would be necessary we would simply give it to 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:29.110
 copy and we would choose then here the 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.120
 device the usb would copy and it would be what 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.370
 same then between the folders and what 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.920
 you will have to take it out the same process to 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.300
 the vice versa and nothing guys if you have 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.230
 some problem that following these 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.540
 same steps 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.030
 it does not work for you that can be the subject of 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.240
 usb format there I no longer have no 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.470
 I understand so much I know that it can some usb 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.050
 you can computer different 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.150
 ways then investigate for that 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.080
 part nothing I hope it helps you 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.080
 and greetings to all
