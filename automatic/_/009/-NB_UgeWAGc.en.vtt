00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.960
 this is therefore the gas-powered or grass-powered grass machine 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.639
 the grass gas machine 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.349
 I explain again as I do in the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.360
 did a broadcast but then one 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.160
 bit more extensive for the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.890
 through the enthusiasts who goes themselves again 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.699
 want to convert a grass machine into 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.699
 and self-fueling sample 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.050
 so stepped off the grass then happens to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.109
 on the cutting deck 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.689
 the grass comes up and then comes 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.170
 through this cap through this tube enters the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.660
 dryer is very important to the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.820
 tumble dryer that revolves around there is here 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.210
 middle with a chain attached to a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.129
 wheel that turns the rear toe and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.829
 which ensures that the tumble dryer 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.090
 hey dedicate meter nature 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.989
 those are actually all loose 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.629
 valves that hang down open like 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.910
 you fit them up but if they are 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.890
 come down by actually home together 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.550
 closed so a drum is from below 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.920
 always closed and always open from above 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.260
 so here there can be cozy grass in the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.890
 air and warm bee are scooped and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.930
 circulation and a heat source 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.710
 principle is that is sweet and sour 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.400
 drying cabinet 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 if your grass is dry enough then it makes it 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.240
 out and then you stick here in this 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.479
 is a little bit 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.490
 letters are a spirit poetry 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.049
 checkered naturally do not make pellets with 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.460
 a post it 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.890
 but suppose you have a pellet machine here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.100
 have the following pellets here and that is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.530
 then your fuel 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.810
 all the way down here is a tube and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.540
 all the way down to all the way 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.140
 downstairs is a very hot fire really 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.399
 growing gives is a charcoal fire 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.930
 actually not pellets that hand 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.310
 pointed out 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.310
 and because of that high temperature 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.579
 yes words that those arrows up 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.740
 evidence was distilled 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.219
 refers to pyrolysis there so that means 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.230
 actually now that your wood gas is forming 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.990
 so basically everything from it 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.530
 old is evaporated and there is that too 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.580
 here then comes that runs so here 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.990
 through that tube to which will be out here 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.610
 but there is still all filthiness and 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.310
 so then have to get out 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.260
 so the first is the cyclone filter 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.210
 especially to get everything out of water 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.730
 because of course you don't want any water in the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.700
 we will push the engine of your grass machine like this 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.960
 a tube that comes in here works that way 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.760
 turns 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.470
 because the gas can only pay attention to it 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.630
 down 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.550
 what is it a tube here up to 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.200
 put this head so the grass starts 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.520
 to turn here and so to the hall 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.140
 smashed 40 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.790
 as been slazwierder swears and flies 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.530
 everything from water to the net one at the edge 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.230
 of that also the water happens here 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.420
 now fly the rotation of your smoke here 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.920
 air out to the outside 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.570
 along the edge here 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.420
 down I was also a 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.430
 turning the freeze brown comes on it 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.360
 the gas that can pass through this centrally 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.520
 up here 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.370
 there is piping hot then you can do it 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.020
 now do an engine because hot gas 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.840
 it expands so that means that 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.130
 actually less guest is in an elite 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.930
 there 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.660
 gas mixture that happened when they were cold 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.720
 get fashion and that it is the mixture then 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.450
 richer is the lesson that they think radiator 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.720
 just a kind of pipe system 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.730
 and then the cooled gas comes here 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.920
 in a second filter and therefore the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.400
 hamster cage philtre filter have that 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.080
 called 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.580
 this filter is from that 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.040
 Wood chips in which no a hamster 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.580
 cage or you with your rabbit or guinea pig 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.680
 Thrown and then I said to be the last one 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.970
 dirt that you smoked he smoked 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.390
 it is still growing 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.670
 T and Tannin is that kind of thing 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.440
 we did not want in your motorcycle so then it must 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.150
 all out because otherwise stick 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.040
 we must close like all of that 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.290
 is filtered come here into this tube, and 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.860
 itself puts only useful here 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.290
 things and methane gas hydrogen gas that 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.760
 are all burner thing 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.930
 carbon monoxide too, but that is not the case 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.489
 important to burn 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.530
 but there is also one and there 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.750
 then you will pass this citizen 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.640
 I add a little oxygen to this 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.100
 you have to arrange it off 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.980
 then we do the hood opens that bus 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.530
 come here then and your 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.590
 in it your carb actually and there 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.880
 normally use gasoline in the engine 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.500
 but now our gas is gas and then 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.110
 Now comes an engine and there turn 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.110
 grass machine on that they are gas grass machine
