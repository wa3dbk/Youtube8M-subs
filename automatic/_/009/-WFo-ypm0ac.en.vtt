the organization decided that Thierry

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.590 
the organization decided that Thierry
Henry<00:01:15.710> was<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.399> man<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:16.970> wanted<00:01:17.149> to<00:01:17.270> bring<00:01:17.420> to

New<00:01:17.750> York<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.320> what<00:01:18.590> was<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.800> timeframe<00:01:19.340> how

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
New York and what was the timeframe how

long<00:01:19.670> ago<00:01:19.880> was<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:20.750> think<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.800> first

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
long ago was that so I think the first

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.520 
long ago was that so I think the first
contact<00:01:22.990> were<00:01:24.640> two<00:01:25.640> years<00:01:25.850> ago<00:01:25.970> i<00:01:26.270> think<00:01:26.539> and<00:01:26.840> i

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
contact were two years ago i think and i

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.290 
contact were two years ago i think and i
came<00:01:27.890> in<00:01:28.039> in<00:01:28.070> November<00:01:28.610> last<00:01:29.119> year<00:01:29.420> and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
came in in November last year and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.130 
came in in November last year and
everybody<00:01:32.300> already<00:01:32.750> talked<00:01:33.110> about<00:01:33.429> theory

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
everybody already talked about theory

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.249 
everybody already talked about theory
but<00:01:36.160> was<00:01:37.160> not<00:01:37.340> really<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.670> discussion<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:39.110> the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
but was not really a discussion of the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.630 
but was not really a discussion of the
contract<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:39.860> something<00:01:40.160> like<00:01:40.190> this<00:01:40.429> and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
contract and something like this and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.040 
contract and something like this and
then<00:01:40.789> we<00:01:41.110> put<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.229> forward<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.810> Eric<00:01:44.810> Stoecker

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
of the highest strikers i think is still

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.310 
of the highest strikers i think is still
technically<00:04:02.850> very<00:04:03.090> very<00:04:03.390> good<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.020> can<00:04:04.170> be

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
technically very very good and it can be

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.470 
technically very very good and it can be
a<00:04:04.350> strike<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.920> coming<00:04:05.250> short<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.850> way<00:04:06.000> and

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
a strike it coming short in a way and

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.420 
a strike it coming short in a way and
perhaps<00:04:06.810> also<00:04:07.200> play<00:04:07.560> as<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.830> second<00:04:08.190> striker

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
perhaps also play as a second striker

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.270 
perhaps also play as a second striker
but<00:04:08.730> i<00:04:09.170> haven't<00:04:10.170> talked<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.560> much<00:04:10.680> with

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
but i haven't talked that much with

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.070 
but i haven't talked that much with
theory<00:04:11.700> about<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.390> see<00:04:12.720> him<00:04:12.900> as<00:04:13.050> a

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
theory about that but I see him as a

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.360 
theory about that but I see him as a
high<00:04:13.320> striker<00:04:14.090> very<00:04:15.090> mobile<00:04:16.100> central<00:04:17.100> strike
