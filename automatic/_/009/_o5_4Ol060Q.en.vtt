00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello how about a very good day I'm Maria from 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.290
 Garbo and I'm happy to be here with 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.289
 you again sharing a table 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.500
 where we will play themes from the great world of 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.619
 the gastronomy and the etiquette and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.990
 talking about this has not happened any 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.199
 once they are invited to a wedding or some 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.749
 15 years where everything is very nice and very 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.390
 elegant the table is arranged with 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:37.350
 different covered your bread pan 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.410
 different drinks but the surprise is that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.329
 when you want to eat your bread this one 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.179
 it is not 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.530
 the person next to you already knows what 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.590
 ate 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 it also happens with the glasses suddenly 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.329
 one can be found in the situation 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.059
 to be sharing the drink with the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.550
 person who is by our side because 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.579
 they got confused and no longer know which 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.589
 drink drink to solve this there is a 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.720
 very simple method that someone 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.049
 He commented once and it's very easy for me 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.990
 to remember by doing the ok symbol 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.240
 with both hands when doing it with the hand 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.960
 left that is where the plate goes 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.140
 bread that is bread in English is a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.780
 letter be so on the left 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.909
 we will remember be de bread and if we do what 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.149
 same with the right hand that is where 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.880
 go the drinks that is grings in English 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:37.440
 is in a letter d so to the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.080
 right we remember from the dreams 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.540
 this seems like a very simple way 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.420
 to remember that on the left goes the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.900
 pan of bread bread and on the right the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.180
 drinks of the dreams with this 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.510
 We will avoid confusion in the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.790
 great events and we will notice 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.070
 as connoisseurs in the and speaking of 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.990
 pan gabriela valdez asks us what 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.080
 what is the correct way to eat the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.210
 bread since we know that our bread is the 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.180
 which is in the little plate on the left 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.370
 we take it with this hand to not 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.710
 traverse us on our plate and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.140
 helped to the right hand we cut with 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.500
 the fingers a piece of the appropriate size 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.440
 to put it in our mouths we leave the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.200
 remaining bread on the plate and if we have 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.470
 butter once cut the slice 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.650
 we butter it with the spatula 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.070
 that for this purpose he must be willing 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.310
 on the bread the little plate of bread and so on 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.730
 we split a piece and we do not eat it another 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.470
 bit and we never eat it away 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.810
 together all the bread alone 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.600
 from one piece at a time the one that has 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.660
