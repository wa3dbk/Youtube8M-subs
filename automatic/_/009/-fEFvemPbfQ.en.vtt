00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.640
 Today we are going to make the 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:22.750
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:25.890
 salt tortilla cheese tomato onion and 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.890
 grilled chicken 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.420
 The first thing we are going to do is in a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.780
 in a frying pan or in a fryer we are going to 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.570
 throw the tortillas until we go to 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.170
 have a lot of time and we will go 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.580
 moving away we have taken a saucepan and 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.980
 we have boiled water when it is 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.940
 hot let's put the tomatoes for 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.940
 download a little 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.040
 in a container we have thrown the piece 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.900
 of onion salt and tomatoes 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.050
 downloaded and now we 're going to beat it 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.050
 all right 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.840
 now let's take the tortilla and go 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.090
 to put the cheese 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.009
 and let's throw the chicken you can do 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.479
 with chicken without chicken but with chicken 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.479
 It is obviously richer 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 once we have thrown the chicken what 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.290
 we double 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.880
 and we put it in a container suitable for 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.840
 oven now let's take a little 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 our tomato 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.490
 and a little cream we're going to preheat the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.230
 oven 180 degrees we will take them 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.450
 approximately 10 minutes 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.950
 once we have all assembled 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.950
 We are going to take them to the approximate oven 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.370
 after about 15 minutes in the oven 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.500

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.630

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.800
