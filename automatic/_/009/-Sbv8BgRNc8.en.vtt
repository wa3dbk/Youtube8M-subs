00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
gym have no idea how long they're

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.299 
gym have no idea how long they're
resting<00:01:03.930> for<00:01:04.199> nor<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.710> they<00:01:04.799> track<00:01:05.100> their

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
resting for nor do they track their

anything<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.820> important<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
anything like that so it is important to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.929 
anything like that so it is important to
have<00:01:09.510> somewhat<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> an<00:01:10.290> idea<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.799> where<00:01:11.729> you're

at a lot of people underestimate the

at a lot of people underestimate the

amount of time that they're actually
resting<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.400> sometimes<00:01:18.060> overestimate<00:01:18.869> what

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
resting or sometimes overestimate what

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410 
resting or sometimes overestimate what
you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.880> an<00:01:21.000> iPhone<00:01:21.119> or

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you can do is if you have an iPhone or

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.929 
you can do is if you have an iPhone or
stopwatch<00:01:22.080> or<00:01:22.200> anything<00:01:22.729> simply<00:01:23.729> use<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
stopwatch or anything simply use the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
stopwatch or anything simply use the
application<00:01:24.259> to<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.409> an<00:01:25.560> idea<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:26.040> how<00:01:26.310> long

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
application to get an idea of how long

you're<00:01:26.700> resting<00:01:27.090> because<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.780> said<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
you're resting because like I said you

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.560 
you're resting because like I said you
may<00:01:28.439> think<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:28.950> resting<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
minute or two minutes when in actuality

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.359 
minute or two minutes when in actuality
you<00:01:33.570> were<00:01:33.750> only<00:01:33.869> resting<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.590> 30<00:01:34.890> seconds

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you were only resting for 30 seconds

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.740 
you were only resting for 30 seconds
which<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.299> enough<00:01:36.479> time<00:01:36.689> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
which is not going to be enough time to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.350 
which is not going to be enough time to
fully<00:01:37.140> recover<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:38.100> effectively<00:01:38.820> hit<00:01:39.030> another

fully recover to effectively hit another

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.660 
fully recover to effectively hit another
set<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.259> may<00:01:40.439> fall<00:01:40.680> short<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.159> reps<00:01:41.520> you

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
set you may fall short of your reps you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
usually able to lift more times so it is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.679 
usually able to lift more times so it is
good<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:47.070> some<00:01:47.369> kind<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.790> idea<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.420> how

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.380 
when you're working out sometimes your
goal<00:03:38.700> may<00:03:38.940> be<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.360> do<00:03:40.140> your<00:03:40.320> 15<00:03:40.769> reps<00:03:41.100> wait<00:03:41.940> 20

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
goal may be do do your 15 reps wait 20

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.270 
goal may be do do your 15 reps wait 20
seconds<00:03:42.810> so<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:43.110> still<00:03:43.380> feel<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.769> burn<00:03:44.010> and

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
seconds so you still feel the burn and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.009 
seconds so you still feel the burn and
the<00:03:44.340> pump<00:03:44.610> pick<00:03:45.150> up<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.390> weight<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.720> do<00:03:45.870> it

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
the pump pick up the weight and do it

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.170 
the pump pick up the weight and do it
again<00:03:46.110> you're<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.130> fatiguing<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.850> muscle

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
again you're just fatiguing the muscle

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.380 
again you're just fatiguing the muscle
now<00:03:48.769> remember<00:03:49.769> strength<00:03:50.220> training<00:03:50.549> is<00:03:50.850> for

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
now remember strength training is for

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.770 
now remember strength training is for
that<00:03:51.660> strength<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:53.220> progressively<00:03:54.150> overload

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
that strength to progressively overload

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.750 
that strength to progressively overload
to<00:03:54.989> add<00:03:55.170> weight<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.500> get<00:03:55.859> stronger<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.400> get

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
to add weight to get stronger to get

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.449 
to add weight to get stronger to get
bigger<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.359> is<00:03:57.780> not<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.470> increase<00:03:58.920> your<00:03:59.040> heart

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
bigger it is not to increase your heart

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.910 
bigger it is not to increase your heart
rate<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.910> get<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.720> cardiovascular<00:04:01.140> benefit

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
rate and get a cardiovascular benefit

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.860 
rate and get a cardiovascular benefit
from<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.459> recognize<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.420> difference<00:04:03.750> between

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
from so recognize the difference between

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.780 
from so recognize the difference between
strength<00:04:04.530> training<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.040> cardio<00:04:05.130> training

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
strength training and cardio training

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.060 
strength training and cardio training
but<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:06.780> more<00:04:06.930> thing<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.290> lot<00:04:07.380> of<00:04:07.440> people<00:04:07.560> worry

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
but one more thing a lot of people worry

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.670 
but one more thing a lot of people worry
about<00:04:08.359> cortisol<00:04:09.359> levels<00:04:09.750> being<00:04:09.930> increased<00:04:10.470> if

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
about cortisol levels being increased if

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.110 
about cortisol levels being increased if
they're<00:04:10.829> in<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.010> gym<00:04:11.190> too<00:04:11.340> long<00:04:11.549> that's

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
they're in the gym too long that's

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.230 
they're in the gym too long that's
