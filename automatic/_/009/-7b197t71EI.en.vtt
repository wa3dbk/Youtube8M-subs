the<00:00:21.210> foil<00:00:21.510> here<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.810> i<00:00:21.870> just<00:00:21.900> really<00:00:22.260> take<00:00:22.440> off

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the foil here so i just really take off

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.670 
the foil here so i just really take off
the<00:00:22.740> foil<00:00:23.180> like<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:25.200> it<00:00:25.290> needs<00:00:25.440> a<00:00:25.530> very

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
the foil like that so it needs a very

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.200 
and I'm going to keep my thumb over the
top<00:00:31.830> why<00:00:32.279> would<00:00:32.430> he<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:32.820> times<00:00:33.030> well

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210

this<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.840> stop<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.350> call<00:00:34.620> springing<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.310> if

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
this will stop the call springing out if

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.250 
this will stop the call springing out if
someone<00:00:36.120> may<00:00:36.240> be<00:00:36.270> shaken<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.990> the<00:00:37.110> four

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
someone may be shaken up the four

handles<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> bottles<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.070> bit<00:00:38.220> warm<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
handles the bottles a bit warm the

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.030 
handles the bottles a bit warm the
inside<00:00:39.600> pressure<00:00:39.810> will<00:00:40.140> increase<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
inside pressure will increase and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740 
inside pressure will increase and
therefore<00:00:41.370> Corp<00:00:41.940> will<00:00:42.120> shoot<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
therefore Corp will shoot out and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.510 
therefore Corp will shoot out and
probably<00:00:43.110> kill<00:00:43.500> someone<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.220> in<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:44.430> eye

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
probably kill someone if it's in the eye

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.510 
probably kill someone if it's in the eye
that's<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> racing<00:00:46.590> drivers<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.070> no

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that's not what the racing drivers do no

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.940 
that's not what the racing drivers do no
they<00:00:47.730> don't<00:00:48.030> actually<00:00:48.470> but<00:00:49.470> that's<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.770> very

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
they don't actually but that's a very

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.170 
they don't actually but that's a very
different<00:00:50.190> story<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.610> neither<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.000> us<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
different story and neither of us a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.569 
different story and neither of us a
racing<00:00:51.540> drivers<00:00:51.980> what<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.220> say<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.399> if

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
racing drivers what I would say so if

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.460 
racing drivers what I would say so if
you're<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> restaurant<00:00:53.989> gets<00:00:54.989> million<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
you're in a restaurant gets million to

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.290 
you're in a restaurant gets million to
actually<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.130> flick<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.340> cork<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.760> over<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
actually just flick the cork out over a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000 
actually just flick the cork out over a
table<00:00:57.570> he<00:00:57.989> wasn't<00:00:58.230> drinking<00:00:58.320> champagne<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
table he wasn't drinking champagne and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.139 
table he wasn't drinking champagne and
that<00:00:59.160> will<00:00:59.250> encourage<00:00:59.460> them<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> drink<00:00:59.940> some

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that will encourage them to drink some

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.840 
that will encourage them to drink some
so<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.340> take<00:01:02.370> off<00:01:02.670> this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so what you do is you take off this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.780 
so what you do is you take off this
which<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.750> side<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.559> cage<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.519> wire

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
which is the side of the cage the wire

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.300 
which is the side of the cage the wire
and<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.360> unscrew<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.380> beautifully

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and you unscrew this beautifully

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.630 
and you unscrew this beautifully
handcrafted<00:01:08.970> little<00:01:11.000> wire<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.580> open<00:01:14.580> up

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
handcrafted little wire not and open up

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.880 
handcrafted little wire not and open up
the<00:01:14.700> cage<00:01:15.030> always<00:01:16.020> keeping<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.440> thumb<00:01:16.680> over

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the cage always keeping your thumb over

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.120 
the cage always keeping your thumb over
the<00:01:17.100> cork<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.670> then<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.479> grab<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.650> cork<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the cork and then you grab the cork and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.320 
the cork and then you grab the cork and
the<00:01:20.190> wire<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> why<00:01:20.729> I'm<00:01:20.940> holding<00:01:21.119> off<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the wire the why I'm holding off the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.840 
the wire the why I'm holding off the
wire<00:01:21.570> because<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.049> helps<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.560> increase<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
wire because that helps to increase the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.700 
wire because that helps to increase the
grip<00:01:24.060> cage<00:01:24.450> helps<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.049> increase<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.409> grip<00:01:25.590> on

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
grip cage helps to increase the grip on

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.260 
grip cage helps to increase the grip on
the<00:01:25.799> court<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.220> instead<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> turning<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the court and instead of turning the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910 
the court and instead of turning the
cork<00:01:27.570> which<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.049> lot<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.229> people<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.619> or

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
cork which a lot of people do or

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.140 
cork which a lot of people do or
flicking<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.580> your<00:01:29.610> thumb<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
flicking it out with your thumb which is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.820 
flicking it out with your thumb which is
what<00:01:30.299> racing<00:01:30.659> drivers<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.140> I'm<00:01:31.500> gonna<00:01:31.650> twist

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
what racing drivers do I'm gonna twist

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.980 
what racing drivers do I'm gonna twist
the<00:01:31.979> bottle<00:01:32.100> from<00:01:32.580> using<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:32.909> hand<00:01:33.210> energy<00:01:33.810> key

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the bottle from using my hand energy key

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.830 
the bottle from using my hand energy key
so<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> give<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> very<00:01:35.070> very<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.670> quick<00:01:36.600> twist

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so I give a very very very quick twist

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870 
so I give a very very very quick twist
and<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.500> feel<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.830> court<00:01:38.070> coming<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and I can feel the court coming out and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
and I can feel the court coming out and
then<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.240> what's<00:01:39.450> called<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> arms<00:01:40.260> fart

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
then we get what's called the arms fart

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.330 
then we get what's called the arms fart
because<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> listen<00:01:42.979> sounds<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.159> like

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
because if you listen sounds just like

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.999 
because if you listen sounds just like
an<00:01:45.299> ant<00:01:45.479> farm<00:01:45.840> apparently<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.680> don't<00:01:46.830> have<00:01:46.920> an

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
an ant farm apparently I don't have an

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.350 
an ant farm apparently I don't have an
answer<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.640> couldn't<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.000> tell<00:01:48.299> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
answer so I couldn't really tell you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.210 
answer so I couldn't really tell you
that<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> reason<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.380> hold<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.830> sort<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that and the reason I hold it up sort of

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.859 
that and the reason I hold it up sort of
45<00:01:50.610> degrees<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.390> increases<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
45 degrees because it increases the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.390 
45 degrees because it increases the
surface<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> bubbles<00:01:52.979> coming

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
surface so that all the bubbles coming

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.770 
surface so that all the bubbles coming
out<00:01:55.939> connect<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> glass<00:01:57.390> ball<00:01:57.600> from

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
out connect with the glass ball from

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
out connect with the glass ball from
inside<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.500> stops<00:01:58.710> us<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.009> foam<00:01:59.250> from

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
inside and then stops us with foam from

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.039 
inside and then stops us with foam from
just<00:01:59.700> spilling<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.180> vibe<00:02:00.390> right<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:00.900> that

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
just spilling out vibe right like that

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.420 
just spilling out vibe right like that
all<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.259> pressure<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.680> come<00:02:01.860> shooting<00:02:01.890> out

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
all the pressure just come shooting out

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.770 
all the pressure just come shooting out
and<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.090> end<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.329> what's<00:02:03.509> called<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and we end up with what's called a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.569 
and we end up with what's called a
champagne<00:02:04.409> fountain<00:02:04.680> which<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.159> no<00:02:05.340> one's

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
champagne fountain which is no one's

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.789 
champagne fountain which is no one's
friend<00:02:05.909> unless<00:02:06.509> you're<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:06.810> someone<00:02:07.470> else's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
friend unless you're at someone else's

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.469 
friend unless you're at someone else's
party<00:02:07.979> drinking<00:02:08.459> someone<00:02:08.729> else's<00:02:08.819> champagne

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
party drinking someone else's champagne

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.150 
party drinking someone else's champagne
and<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.080> pouring<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> champagne<00:02:10.709> like

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and I like pouring the champagne like

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.340 
and I like pouring the champagne like
this

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
this

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.550 
this

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
partner zones it's actually the carbon

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.330

carbon<00:02:31.310> dioxide<00:02:32.120> coming<00:02:33.050> out<00:02:33.290> got<00:02:34.070> my

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
carbon dioxide coming out got my

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.340 
carbon dioxide coming out got my
monoxide<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.180> come<00:02:35.360> or<00:02:35.600> not<00:02:35.690> gonna<00:02:35.900> be<00:02:36.050> any<00:02:36.170> fun

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
at all yeah just a little bit of carbon

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.270 
at all yeah just a little bit of carbon
dioxide<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:38.810> re<00:02:39.110> increase<00:02:39.710> itself<00:02:40.130> to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
dioxide is it just re increase itself to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.910 
dioxide is it just re increase itself to
the<00:02:40.370> atmospheric<00:02:40.790> pressure<00:02:40.840> okay<00:02:41.860> thank<00:02:42.860> you

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
the atmospheric pressure okay thank you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.450 
the atmospheric pressure okay thank you
very<00:02:43.070> much<00:02:43.190> love<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.700> Sam<00:02:43.880> pain<00:02:44.120> things
