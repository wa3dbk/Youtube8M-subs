00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
plan but the cool thing about this story

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.039 
plan but the cool thing about this story
is<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> lot<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.840> besides

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
is that you can do a lot with it besides

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.460 
is that you can do a lot with it besides
just<00:01:07.500> shooting<00:01:07.799> arrows<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:10.049> I'm<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
just shooting arrows and so I'm going to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.109 
just shooting arrows and so I'm going to
show<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.770> couple<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.159> those<00:01:11.280> things

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.670 

actually<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.600> say<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.470> my

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
actually now that I say that I think my

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.240 
actually now that I say that I think my
examples<00:01:17.159> mostly<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.670> use<00:01:17.820> areas<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:19.250> but

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
examples mostly just use areas but but

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.120 
examples mostly just use areas but but
you<00:01:20.340> know<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.790> use<00:01:20.909> other<00:01:21.060> things<00:01:21.390> too<00:01:22.130> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you know you can use other things too so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.830 
you know you can use other things too so
that's<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> single<00:01:23.610> turret<00:01:23.970> that's<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> one

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
that's the single turret that's the one

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.530 
that's the single turret that's the one
I'm<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> show<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.350> how<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.560> make<00:01:26.540> then

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
I'm going to show you how to make then

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
I'm going to show you how to make then
you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.930> also<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.290> other<00:01:28.320> cool<00:01:28.799> things<00:01:28.979> with

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you can also do other cool things with

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.170 
you can also do other cool things with
it<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.930> turn<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.020> into<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.549> two<00:01:32.549> by<00:01:32.700> two<00:01:32.729> or

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it like turn it into a two by two or

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.160 
it like turn it into a two by two or
three<00:01:33.720> by<00:01:33.840> three<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.689> think<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:37.049> really

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
three by three and I think that's really

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
three by three and I think that's really
cool<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.740> modify<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.400> make<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.610> your

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
cool you can modify it and make it your

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.050 
cool you can modify it and make it your
own<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.170> adapt<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.790> need

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
own and kind of adapt to what you need

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.260 
own and kind of adapt to what you need
it<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:43.100> also<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.210> with

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
it to be also you can do this with

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.200 
it to be also you can do this with
droppers<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.490> wanted<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.820> dispense

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
droppers so if you wanted to dispense

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.719 
droppers so if you wanted to dispense
arrows<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.990> yourself<00:01:49.350> without<00:01:49.729> shooting

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
arrows to yourself without shooting

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.030 
arrows to yourself without shooting
yourself<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> face<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.890> hook

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
yourself in the face you can just hook

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.710 
yourself in the face you can just hook
it<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.430> dropper<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.329> drop<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it up to a dropper and have it drop the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.289 
it up to a dropper and have it drop the
arrows<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.409> did<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.280> diamonds<00:01:56.729> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299

have<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.950> could<00:02:15.130> definitely<00:02:15.390> compact<00:02:16.390> this

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
have you could definitely compact this

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.930 
have you could definitely compact this
and<00:02:16.990> make<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.950> little<00:02:18.100> more<00:02:18.220> manageable<00:02:19.890> so

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
and make it a little more manageable so

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.790 
and make it a little more manageable so
now<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.240> have<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.600> idea<00:02:22.870> I'm<00:02:23.560> going<00:02:23.740> to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
now that you have the idea I'm going to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.470 
now that you have the idea I'm going to
go<00:02:23.890> ahead<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.370> show<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.580> how<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> make<00:02:25.240> this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
go ahead and show you how to make this

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.020 
go ahead and show you how to make this
all<00:02:26.050> you're<00:02:26.530> going<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.680> need<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:27.070> some

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
all you're going to need is some

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.060 
all you're going to need is some
redstone<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:29.370> dispenser<00:02:30.370> or<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.580> dropper<00:02:31.180> a

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
redstone a dispenser or a dropper a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.210 
redstone a dispenser or a dropper a
comparator<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.750> power<00:02:34.750> source<00:02:35.110> such<00:02:35.800> as<00:02:35.830> a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
comparator a power source such as a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.810 
comparator a power source such as a
lever<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:38.110> block<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.830> your<00:02:38.920> choice<00:02:38.980> and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
lever and a block of your choice and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.610 
lever and a block of your choice and
then<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.480> course<00:02:40.540> something<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.170> load<00:02:41.350> into

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
then of course something to load into

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.370 
then of course something to load into
the<00:02:41.890> turret<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.620> what<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.490> need<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> do<00:02:45.970> is

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
the turret so what you need to do is

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.430 
the turret so what you need to do is
take<00:02:47.380> your<00:02:47.560> dispenser<00:02:48.630> go<00:02:49.630> ahead<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.080> place

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
take your dispenser go ahead and place

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.590 
take your dispenser go ahead and place
it<00:02:50.650> I'll<00:02:50.800> put<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.490> on<00:02:51.550> that<00:02:51.760> convenient<00:02:52.390> little

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
it I'll put it on that convenient little

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.550 
it I'll put it on that convenient little
dirt<00:02:52.930> patch<00:02:54.300> put<00:02:55.300> your<00:02:55.810> block<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.290> choice

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
dirt patch put your block of choice

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.800 
dirt patch put your block of choice
right<00:02:56.920> next<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.520> if<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.510> put<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.750> on

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
right next to it and if you put it on

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.440 
right next to it and if you put it on
the<00:02:58.959> Left<00:02:59.170> that's<00:02:59.320> okay<00:02:59.620> to<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:01.090> do<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the Left that's okay to just do the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.130 
the Left that's okay to just do the
opposite<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.110> what<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.590> do<00:03:02.740> with<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.870> go

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
opposite of what I do with this so go

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.380 
opposite of what I do with this so go
ahead<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.380> place<00:03:05.860> redstone<00:03:06.430> on<00:03:06.880> top<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.300> your

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
ahead and place redstone on top of your

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.780 
ahead and place redstone on top of your
block<00:03:07.920> below<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.510> one<00:03:10.510> more<00:03:10.720> behind<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
block below it one more behind that and

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.699 
block below it one more behind that and
then<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.910> want<00:03:13.030> one<00:03:13.269> more<00:03:13.480> behind<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
then you want one more behind the

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.830 
then you want one more behind the
dispenser<00:03:15.600> then<00:03:16.600> take<00:03:17.320> your<00:03:17.500> comparator

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
dispenser then take your comparator

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.070 
dispenser then take your comparator
stick<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.959> in<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.260> little<00:03:20.530> L<00:03:20.709> shape<00:03:21.900> click<00:03:22.900> it

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
stick it in that little L shape click it

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.100 
stick it in that little L shape click it
once<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.910> then<00:03:24.910> hook<00:03:25.360> up<00:03:25.480> your<00:03:25.630> power<00:03:25.780> source

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
once and then hook up your power source

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.530 
once and then hook up your power source
and<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.739> all<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:26.920> have<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.340> do<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:28.390> can

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
and that is all you have to do you can

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.420 
and that is all you have to do you can
turn<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.720> on<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.200> it's<00:03:29.350> ready<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.590> go<00:03:29.709> just

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
turn it on and it's ready to go just

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.890 
turn it on and it's ready to go just
load<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.700> up<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.230> it'll<00:03:32.230> start<00:03:32.530> firing<00:03:33.900> so

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
load it up and it'll start firing so

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.720 
load it up and it'll start firing so
it's<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.080> really<00:03:35.260> simple<00:03:35.440> little<00:03:35.800> thing<00:03:36.070> you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
it's a really simple little thing you

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.340 
it's a really simple little thing you
will<00:03:36.970> probably<00:03:37.239> have<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.750> go<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.170> nether

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
will probably have to go to the nether

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.030 
will probably have to go to the nether
if<00:03:38.620> you're<00:03:38.800> playing<00:03:39.010> in<00:03:39.280> survival<00:03:39.900> but

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
if you're playing in survival but

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.270 
if you're playing in survival but
finding<00:03:42.040> nether<00:03:42.780> quartz<00:03:43.800> isn't<00:03:44.800> very<00:03:44.950> hard<00:03:45.160> to

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
finding nether quartz isn't very hard to

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.590 
finding nether quartz isn't very hard to
do<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:45.790> um<00:03:47.220> yeah<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.610> lot<00:03:49.000> more<00:03:49.030> simple

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
do so um yeah it's a lot more simple

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.240 
do so um yeah it's a lot more simple
than<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.870> old<00:03:50.049> turret<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.650> like<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.220> lot

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
than the old turret I like it a lot

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.070 
than the old turret I like it a lot
better<00:03:51.580> because<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.180> can<00:03:52.209> change<00:03:52.660> what<00:03:52.959> you

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
better because you can change what you

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.860 
better because you can change what you
do<00:03:53.200> with<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.380> for<00:03:53.739> example<00:03:54.160> drop<00:03:55.030> TNT<00:03:55.540> on<00:03:55.570> your

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
do with it for example drop TNT on your

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.870 
do with it for example drop TNT on your
friends<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:58.530> yeah<00:03:59.530> besides<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.130> it's<00:04:00.489> yours

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
friends and yeah besides that it's yours

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.130 
friends and yeah besides that it's yours
to<00:04:01.120> experiment<00:04:01.810> with<00:04:02.370> as<00:04:03.780> for<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.810> channel

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
to experiment with as for the channel

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.810 
to experiment with as for the channel

see<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.460> here<00:04:26.610> I'll<00:04:26.760> go<00:04:26.880> f5<00:04:27.530> it's<00:04:28.530> pretty

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
see you here I'll go f5 it's pretty

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.159 
see you here I'll go f5 it's pretty
similar<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.400> old<00:04:29.430> one<00:04:29.790> but<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.300> think<00:04:31.050> it

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
similar to the old one but I think it

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.219 
similar to the old one but I think it
looks<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.440> little<00:04:31.650> bit<00:04:31.919> more<00:04:32.220> well<00:04:32.490> made

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
looks a little bit more well made

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.270 
looks a little bit more well made
probably<00:04:34.229> because<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.530> didn't<00:04:34.830> make<00:04:34.949> it<00:04:34.979> I<00:04:35.160> just

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
probably because I didn't make it I just

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.810 
probably because I didn't make it I just
found<00:04:35.610> some<00:04:36.650> pre-made<00:04:37.650> skin<00:04:38.100> parts<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.580> kind

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
found some pre-made skin parts and kind

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.900 
found some pre-made skin parts and kind
of<00:04:38.850> put<00:04:39.000> them<00:04:39.090> together<00:04:39.240> but<00:04:40.400> that's<00:04:41.400> okay<00:04:41.729> it

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
of put them together but that's okay it

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.890 
of put them together but that's okay it
works<00:04:42.199> so<00:04:43.199> other<00:04:44.160> than<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.699> don't<00:04:45.240> think<00:04:45.840> I

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900
