00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.430 
so that resulted in me not really making
the<00:03:24.180> team<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.660> when<00:03:24.750> you're<00:03:24.840> not<00:03:24.989> making<00:03:25.379> the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
the team and when you're not making the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.400 
the team and when you're not making the
team<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:26.099> find<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.370> even<00:03:26.519> more<00:03:26.760> boring<00:03:27.109> so<00:03:28.109> it

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
team you find it even more boring so it

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.710 
team you find it even more boring so it
just<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.799> adds<00:03:29.099> up<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.699> I<00:03:30.239> came<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.629> the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
just all adds up and I came to the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.420 
just all adds up and I came to the
conclusion<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.349> I<00:03:31.500> should<00:03:31.889> quit<00:03:32.099> because

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
conclusion that I should quit because

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.909 
conclusion that I should quit because
playing<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.389> now<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:33.780> then<00:03:33.959> in<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.500> pretty

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
playing and now and then in a pretty

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.039 
playing and now and then in a pretty
serious<00:03:35.129> team<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.819> then<00:03:36.359> not<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:36.840> making

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
serious team and then not really making

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.360 
serious team and then not really making
the<00:03:37.290> team<00:03:37.470> because<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.799> don't<00:03:37.980> really<00:03:38.069> give<00:03:38.340> a

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
the team because you don't really give a
