00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
all that might we've we really don't

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.520 
all that might we've we really don't
know<00:03:38.940> we're<00:03:39.120> not<00:03:39.269> too<00:03:39.480> sure<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:39.989> put<00:03:40.349> and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it's too much bling so that was before

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.970 
it's too much bling so that was before
halftime<00:03:47.700> now<00:03:48.120> we<00:03:48.840> are<00:03:48.989> obviously<00:03:49.139> after<00:03:49.889> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
halftime now we are obviously after the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.500 
halftime now we are obviously after the
halftime<00:03:50.190> clip<00:03:50.639> and<00:03:50.849> what<00:03:51.209> we<00:03:51.299> gonna<00:03:51.389> talk

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
about now well the fact that in theory

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.280 
about now well the fact that in theory
would<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.970> believe<00:03:56.970> they<00:03:57.209> don't<00:03:57.329> need<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.959> put

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
would I believe they don't need to put

to<00:04:06.930> get<00:04:07.019> more<00:04:07.169> challenges<00:04:07.680> then<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.549> was<00:04:08.700> cool

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
to get more challenges then it was cool

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.789

by<00:04:09.150> track<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.750> will<00:04:09.959> admit<00:04:10.049> but<00:04:10.379> I<00:04:10.590> don't

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
by track I will admit but I don't

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.009 
by track I will admit but I don't
believe<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.459> needs<00:04:11.669> to<00:04:11.819> be<00:04:11.940> include<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.900> go

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
believe it needs to be include you to go

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.500 
believe it needs to be include you to go
so<00:04:13.169> now<00:04:13.199> obviously<00:04:14.209> honestly<00:04:15.209> or<00:04:15.359> not

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
so now obviously honestly or not

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.719 
so now obviously honestly or not
obviously<00:04:15.889> don't<00:04:16.889> think<00:04:17.280> they'll<00:04:17.430> put<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.639> in

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
obviously don't think they'll put it in

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.729 
obviously don't think they'll put it in
here<00:04:17.880> like<00:04:18.449> I<00:04:18.599> said<00:04:18.630> before<00:04:19.079> they<00:04:19.320> can<00:04:19.530> put

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
here like I said before they can put

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.939

diamond<00:04:59.750> on<00:04:59.870> again<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.230> be<00:05:00.320> honest<00:05:00.530> now<00:05:00.650> the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
diamond on again to be honest now the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.320 
diamond on again to be honest now the
only<00:05:01.010> reason<00:05:01.250> why<00:05:01.370> diamonds<00:05:01.669> in<00:05:01.940> this<00:05:02.060> video

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
only reason why diamonds in this video

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.960 
only reason why diamonds in this video
is<00:05:02.570> because<00:05:02.889> you<00:05:03.889> tell<00:05:04.130> her<00:05:04.250> of<00:05:04.520> making<00:05:04.910> a

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
is because you tell her of making a

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.370 
is because you tell her of making a
video<00:05:05.180> about<00:05:05.210> diamond<00:05:05.630> camo<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.139> it<00:05:06.229> only

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
video about diamond camo and it only

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.110 
video about diamond camo and it only
makes<00:05:06.650> sense<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.889> put<00:05:06.979> diamond<00:05:07.490> camo<00:05:07.729> gun<00:05:07.910> in

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
makes sense to put diamond camo gun in

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.719 
makes sense to put diamond camo gun in
the<00:05:08.240> gameplay<00:05:09.080> in<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.650> background<00:05:10.100> so<00:05:10.340> you

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
the gameplay in the background so you

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.340 
the gameplay in the background so you
know<00:05:11.180> they<00:05:11.330> might<00:05:11.479> just<00:05:11.630> bring<00:05:11.870> out<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.050> heap<00:05:12.320> of

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
know they might just bring out a heap of

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.680 
know they might just bring out a heap of
DLC<00:05:13.040> camos<00:05:13.550> that<00:05:13.760> we<00:05:13.850> all<00:05:13.970> waste<00:05:14.240> our<00:05:14.389> money<00:05:14.479> on

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690

DLC camos that we all waste our money on
