I make it I make it when I'm about to go
to<00:01:14.220> work<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> morning<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.360> have

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to work in the morning and I don't have

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.300 
to work in the morning and I don't have
very<00:01:15.630> much<00:01:15.810> time<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> eat<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.280> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
very much time to eat it so I like to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.510 
very much time to eat it so I like to
make<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.799> little<00:01:20.009> dry<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
make it so it's a it's a little dry and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.609 
make it so it's a it's a little dry and
then<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.900> clumpy

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
then or it's a little like clumpy

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.870 
then or it's a little like clumpy
because<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.340> put<00:01:23.490> some<00:01:23.520> cold<00:01:23.820> water

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
because then you can put some cold water

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
because then you can put some cold water
in<00:01:24.180> afterwards<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.470> makes<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.830> less

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
in afterwards and then it makes it less

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.530 
in afterwards and then it makes it less
hot<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:26.909> you're<00:01:27.000> able<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.240> eat<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> right

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
hot and then you're able to eat it right

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.740 
hot and then you're able to eat it right
away

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
away

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.480 
away
so<00:01:27.960> two<00:01:28.259> minutes<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> microwave<00:01:28.829> this
