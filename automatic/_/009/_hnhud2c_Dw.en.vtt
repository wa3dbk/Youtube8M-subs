00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.340
 every day we overcome you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.210
 distance helps us with this 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.370
 motor transport 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.230
 some machines force us to work 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.150
 others surprise with their speed 3 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.859
 passability but if such cars without 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.279
 which today's life is difficult 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.279
 imagine 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.860
 fire engines are designed to 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.720
 delivery to the place of fire fire 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.410
 fire extinguishing agents and firefighter 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.630
 equipment 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.440
 the first fire truck with a pump was 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.090
 designed by German engineers in 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.489
 1892 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.080
 fire engine in Russia appeared in 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.269
 1907, she celebrated a team of eight 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.640
 man average speed was 60 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.500
 kilometers per hour over 100 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.970
 years since the release of the first fire 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.970
 cars have changed a lot 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.820
 but actually we have something to compare 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.490
 here's another 78 year old fire truck 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.110
 The release tank volume here is 22 tons 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.420
 the car is intended for delivery 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.590
 water in areas where there are no reservoirs 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.590
 and fire hydrants 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.520
 modern fire truck not only 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.350
 delivers the module to the fire site 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.619
 equipped with the latest 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.619
 technology 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.130
 modern fire truck 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.130
 completed with us rich enough 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.260
 as weapons 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.710
 metal equip 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:35.659
 pumping station which 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.659
 fire hose promotion time 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.840
 the main advantage of all this 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.220
 equipment is its equipment 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 very good layout convenient for 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.490
 driver for both drivers and for 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.490
 personnel 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.180
 This car is equipped with a pump. 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.520
 Austrian assembly 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.530
 has two modes of operation as normal 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.780
 pressure and high pressure 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.160
 uses high pressure mode 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.950
 special hose reel high 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.360
 pressure at 4 liters and with 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.750
 pressure is already a style of 100 meters of water 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.330
 pillar 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.490
 Now, this reel is very high pressure 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.150
 effectively cases of initial hangar and 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.770
 case when 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.600
 the main forces are still in the case of steam steam still 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.370
 not profit ie this allows 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.020
 tatoo save a lot of time 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.950
 and water 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.870
 car developers have considered everything 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.880
 requirements of modernity including 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.880
 took care of the convenience of the crew 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.430
 you are calculating this car 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.610
 makes 5 people including the driver 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.810
 here is a division for fighters 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.670
 Seats already reworked immediately 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.320
 respiratory reinforcements 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.500
 that is, they notice right away 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.040
 and the back and put the dumplings 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.040
 security 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.780
 here in this workshop to invest 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.400
 reserve balloon lights radios and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.439
 ice and hydraulics are also needed in 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.370
 the car is equipped with a very good 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.430
 heating system 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.189
 winter day and time is very good fruit 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.409
 color cars symbolize light to the lights 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.599
 color of danger color conspicuous 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.430
 from afar except in red main 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.530
 colors are present and others for 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.480
 identifying marks and contrasting 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.480
 Items set to white
