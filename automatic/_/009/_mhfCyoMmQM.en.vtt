hi<00:00:00.750> I'm<00:00:01.020> Juan<00:00:01.290> and<00:00:01.500> today<00:00:01.740> I<00:00:01.800> want<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.070> do<00:00:02.159> a

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hi I'm Juan and today I want to do a

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.919 
hi I'm Juan and today I want to do a
little<00:00:02.370> follow-up<00:00:02.669> from<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.300> video<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.659> made

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
little follow-up from the video I made

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.550 
little follow-up from the video I made
last<00:00:04.710> week<00:00:05.480> if<00:00:06.480> you've<00:00:06.750> seen<00:00:07.020> it<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.529> know

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
last week if you've seen it you know

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.910 
last week if you've seen it you know
that<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.610> my<00:00:08.880> game<00:00:09.630> pad<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.769> how<00:00:10.860> it

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
that this is my game pad this is how it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.160 
that this is my game pad this is how it
looks<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.280> painted<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.730> what<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.690> don't<00:00:12.929> know

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
looks I painted it what you don't know

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.029 
looks I painted it what you don't know
is<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:14.719> it<00:00:15.719> has<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> different<00:00:16.500> color

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
is this it has a different color

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.900 
is this it has a different color
I<00:00:17.070> changed<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.990> LEDs<00:00:20.000> now<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.390> orange<00:00:22.550> now<00:00:23.550> I

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
I changed the LEDs now it's orange now I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330 
I changed the LEDs now it's orange now I
want<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.449> show<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.630> how<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> do<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.529> I'm

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
want to show you how to do this and I'm

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.450 
want to show you how to do this and I'm
not<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.090> redo<00:00:27.480> mine<00:00:27.769> but<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
not going to redo mine but I'm going to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.930 
not going to redo mine but I'm going to
change<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.779> LEDs<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:31.949> from<00:00:32.460> my

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
change the LEDs on the one from my

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
change the LEDs on the one from my
girlfriend<00:00:34.730> she<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.570> she<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.140> one<00:00:37.380> who

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
girlfriend she actually she was one who

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
girlfriend she actually she was one who
wanted<00:00:39.320> other<00:00:40.320> colors<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.570> specifically

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
wanted other colors and specifically

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.979 
wanted other colors and specifically
pink<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.010> I'm<00:00:44.399> gonna<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.750> put

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
pink so I'm gonna do I'm going to put

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.250 
pink so I'm gonna do I'm going to put
pink<00:00:46.559> LEDs<00:00:47.070> instead<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> green<00:00:48.180> LEDs<00:00:48.629> calm

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
pink LEDs instead of the green LEDs calm

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.299 
pink LEDs instead of the green LEDs calm
and<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> default<00:00:50.610> Xbox<00:00:51.570> 360<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.440> 360<00:00:53.100> game

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and the default Xbox 360 is 360 game

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.170 
and the default Xbox 360 is 360 game
controller<00:00:55.309> before<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> begin<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> test

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
controller before I begin and to test

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
controller before I begin and to test
the<00:00:57.270> polarity<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.840> my<00:00:58.020> LEDs<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the polarity of my LEDs and to do that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.160 
the polarity of my LEDs and to do that
I'm<00:00:59.879> using<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.570> tester<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.440> testa<00:01:02.430> alt<00:01:02.609> mode

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
I'm using a tester and testa alt mode

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.620 
I'm using a tester and testa alt mode
which<00:01:04.170> makes<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.890> diode<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> LED<00:01:06.330> glow

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
which makes the diode and the LED glow

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.170 
which makes the diode and the LED glow
whenever<00:01:07.409> I'm<00:01:07.619> touching<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> right<00:01:08.490> spot<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
whenever I'm touching the right spot and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
whenever I'm touching the right spot and
the<00:01:09.390> red<00:01:09.570> pulse

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.530 

once<00:01:13.200> I've<00:01:13.380> done<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:14.100> need<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.790> turn<00:01:15.390> it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
once I've done that I need to turn it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.610 
once I've done that I need to turn it
around<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.170> check<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.180> under<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.620> other

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
around and check the under at the other

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.520 
around and check the under at the other
side<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.340> LED<00:01:20.780> which<00:01:21.780> usually<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
side of the LED which usually as a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.790 
side of the LED which usually as a
marking<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.479> in<00:01:24.479> my<00:01:24.660> case<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:24.960> marking<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
marking and in my case that marking is a

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.390 
marking and in my case that marking is a
little<00:01:26.220> green<00:01:26.490> tea<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.810> plus<00:01:28.050> side<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
little green tea on the plus side so the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
little green tea on the plus side so the
problem<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:32.880> removing<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.450> LEDs<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
problem with removing the LEDs is that

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.820 
problem with removing the LEDs is that
you<00:01:34.410> actually<00:01:34.619> need<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.750> heat<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.780> both<00:01:37.440> sides

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
you actually need to heat up both sides

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.150 
you actually need to heat up both sides
of<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.190> LED<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:39.979> unless<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.130> have

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
of the LED and unless you have

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.310 
of the LED and unless you have
specialized<00:01:41.970> equipment<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.690> can't<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
specialized equipment you can't do that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.359 
specialized equipment you can't do that
with<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:44.180> soldiering<00:01:45.180> iron<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.190> way<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
with one soldiering iron so the way to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.430 
with one soldiering iron so the way to
do<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.360> heat<00:01:48.690> up<00:01:48.720> both<00:01:49.320> sides<00:01:49.940> at

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
do that is to heat up both sides at

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.370 
do that is to heat up both sides at
individually<00:01:52.440> of<00:01:52.619> course<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.670> glue<00:01:53.910> down

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
individually of course do glue down

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.580 
individually of course do glue down
pretty<00:01:55.380> fast<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:57.750> trick<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.170> want<00:01:58.320> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
pretty fast so the trick you want you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.389 
pretty fast so the trick you want you
you<00:01:59.039> can<00:01:59.250> use<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.960> make<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.140> stay<00:02:01.440> warm<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:02.070> for

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
you can use to make it stay warm for for

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.719 
you can use to make it stay warm for for
a<00:02:02.430> longer<00:02:02.759> time<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.410> put<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.130> little

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
a longer time is to just put a little

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.880 
a longer time is to just put a little
blob<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.210> solder<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.289> each<00:02:08.160> side<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.970> LED

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
blob of solder on each side of the LED

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.789 
blob of solder on each side of the LED
and<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:13.380> solder<00:02:13.830> will<00:02:14.040> keep<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.870> each<00:02:16.410> side

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
and that solder will keep the each side

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.610 
and that solder will keep the each side
of<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.070> LED<00:02:17.220> warm<00:02:17.880> for<00:02:18.209> long<00:02:18.450> enough<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.560> you

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
of the LED warm for long enough that you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.000 
of the LED warm for long enough that you
can<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:21.030> remove<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:22.709> LED<00:02:23.070> like<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.730> did<00:02:23.970> here

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
can just remove the LED like I did here

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.100 
can just remove the LED like I did here
now<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.070> need<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.549> remove<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.120> excess<00:02:27.780> solder

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
now you need to remove the excess solder

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.650 
now you need to remove the excess solder
and<00:02:29.329> to<00:02:30.329> do<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.980> swipe<00:02:31.980> over<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
and to do that just swipe over the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.930 
and to do that just swipe over the
soldering<00:02:33.660> iron<00:02:34.670> over<00:02:35.670> these<00:02:36.049> blobs<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.940> try

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
soldering iron over these blobs and try

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.050 
soldering iron over these blobs and try
to<00:02:39.000> get<00:02:39.209> as<00:02:39.450> much<00:02:39.840> solder<00:02:40.620> as<00:02:40.829> possible<00:02:41.459> from

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to get as much solder as possible from

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.949 
to get as much solder as possible from
it<00:02:43.280> these<00:02:44.280> little<00:02:44.670> little<00:02:44.940> marks<00:02:45.390> here<00:02:45.720> these

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
it these little little marks here these

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.819 
it these little little marks here these
white<00:02:46.290> marks<00:02:46.709> are<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.510> minus<00:02:49.290> side<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
white marks are on the minus side of the

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.319 
white marks are on the minus side of the
LD<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:51.150> me<00:02:51.329> that's<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:52.700> around<00:02:53.700> like

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
LD so for me that's just around like

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.069 
LD so for me that's just around like
this<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.340> need<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.700> put<00:02:56.940> my<00:02:57.090> LED<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.810> this

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
this so I need to put my LED like this

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:06.289 
this so I need to put my LED like this
on<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.769> board<00:02:59.630> and<00:03:04.489> once<00:03:05.489> it's<00:03:05.700> there<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.209> just

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
on the board and once it's there I just

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.190 
on the board and once it's there I just
need<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.900> heat<00:03:07.079> up<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.530> solar<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.610> bit<00:03:09.200> touching

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
need to heat up the solar a bit touching

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:32.040 
need to heat up the solar a bit touching
the<00:03:10.380> LED<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.370> then<00:03:12.090> that's<00:03:12.690> their<00:03:14.510> corn<00:03:15.510> on

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.910 

so<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:33.410> one<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.710> these<00:03:33.800> sticks<00:03:35.200> now<00:03:36.200> before<00:03:36.890> I

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
so that one of these sticks now before I

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.030 
so that one of these sticks now before I
do<00:03:37.670> all<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.600> other<00:03:38.780> LEDs<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.530> want<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:39.920> make

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
do all the other LEDs I want to make

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.090 
do all the other LEDs I want to make
sure<00:03:40.070> that<00:03:40.460> this<00:03:40.760> works<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:41.710> for<00:03:42.710> that<00:03:42.830> I<00:03:42.890> need

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
sure that this works so for that I need

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.800 
sure that this works so for that I need
to<00:03:43.190> put<00:03:43.370> this<00:03:43.880> rubber<00:03:45.160> on<00:03:46.160> top<00:03:46.700> of<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.060> board

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
to put this rubber on top of the board

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.230 
to put this rubber on top of the board
and<00:03:48.050> of<00:03:48.980> course<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.370> need<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:49.610> get<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.880> battery

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
and of course I need to get the battery

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.750 
and of course I need to get the battery
in<00:03:50.390> there<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:51.020> just<00:03:51.709> need<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.130> hold<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.459> in<00:03:52.610> place

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
in there I just need to hold it in place

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.620 
in there I just need to hold it in place
I<00:03:53.060> don't<00:03:53.450> need<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.980> whole<00:03:55.160> case<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:56.420> keep

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
I don't need the the whole case to keep

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.580 
I don't need the the whole case to keep
it<00:03:56.780> there<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.170> there<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:58.010> go<00:03:59.470> that's<00:04:00.470> a

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
it there and there you go that's a

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
it there and there you go that's a
blinking<00:04:00.950> pink<00:04:01.220> LED<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.739> another<00:04:09.980> now<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.580> I

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
blinking pink LED so another now that I

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.400 
blinking pink LED so another now that I
know<00:04:10.760> that<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.270> essence<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:11.660> these<00:04:11.930> LEDs

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
know that the essence that these LEDs

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.370 
know that the essence that these LEDs
work<00:04:12.709> I<00:04:13.010> just<00:04:13.610> need<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.120> get<00:04:14.239> on<00:04:14.450> with<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.870> with

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
work I just need to get on with it with

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:43.740 
work I just need to get on with it with
the<00:04:15.500> rest<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.860> them

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:57.049 

this<00:04:44.350> hard<00:04:44.650> look
