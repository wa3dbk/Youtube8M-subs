00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
you can actually have the computer play

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.839 
you can actually have the computer play

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
against itself and learn about the game

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.370 
against itself and learn about the game
that<00:02:13.030> way<00:02:13.180> there's<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.569> tutorial<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:14.230> it's

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
that way there's a tutorial but it's

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.990 
that way there's a tutorial but it's
great<00:02:14.680> fun<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.920> watch<00:02:15.130> how<00:02:15.400> different<00:02:15.790> players

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
great fun to watch how different players

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.250 
great fun to watch how different players
with<00:02:16.209> different<00:02:16.480> playing<00:02:16.630> styles<00:02:16.690> will<00:02:17.110> play

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
with different playing styles will play

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.960 
with different playing styles will play
and<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:17.950> they'll<00:02:18.130> go<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.430> they'll<00:02:18.519> take<00:02:18.700> tiles

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
and so they'll go and they'll take tiles

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.190 
and so they'll go and they'll take tiles
they'll<00:02:19.269> place<00:02:19.450> them<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.780> shows<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.049> what<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
much when you have everything is

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.970 
much when you have everything is
automated<00:02:28.810> except<00:02:29.440> when<00:02:29.530> you're<00:02:29.650> playing<00:02:29.829> it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
automated except when you're playing it

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.259

decisions but it's actually really
entertaining<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.620> go<00:02:35.709> ahead<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.010> watch<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
entertaining to go ahead and watch the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.009 
entertaining to go ahead and watch the
computer<00:02:37.090> played<00:02:37.329> see<00:02:37.690> all<00:02:37.780> sorts<00:02:37.930> of

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
computer played see all sorts of

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.080 
computer played see all sorts of
interesting<00:02:38.260> stats<00:02:38.739> about<00:02:38.950> what<00:02:39.760> what<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
interesting stats about what what the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.090 
interesting stats about what what the
computer<00:02:40.329> is<00:02:40.480> doing<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.989> then<00:02:41.079> it's<00:02:41.709> it's

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
computer is doing and then it's it's

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.620 
computer is doing and then it's it's
just<00:02:42.280> phenomenal<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.790> can't<00:02:43.030> wait<00:02:43.180> until<00:02:43.420> it's

things we're going to be talking about
soon<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:47.079> your<00:02:47.470> expansion<00:02:47.889> for<00:02:48.310> suburbia<00:02:48.940> is

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
soon is your expansion for suburbia is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.340 
soon is your expansion for suburbia is
that<00:02:49.269> also<00:02:49.630> going<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> be<00:02:49.989> something<00:02:50.230> that

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
that also going to be something that

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.110 
that also going to be something that
will<00:02:50.530> be<00:02:50.650> will<00:02:50.980> be<00:02:51.010> eventually<00:02:51.310> not<00:02:51.730> right<00:02:51.940> at

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
will be will be eventually not right at

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120 
will be will be eventually not right at
lunch<00:02:52.329> but<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.840> expansion<00:02:53.260> will<00:02:53.290> be<00:02:53.680> coming

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
lunch but the expansion will be coming

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.129 
lunch but the expansion will be coming
to<00:02:54.340> let's<00:02:55.239> go<00:02:55.359> ahead<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.510> take<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.720> look<00:02:55.810> at<00:02:55.989> the

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
to let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.660 
to let's go ahead and take a look at the
expansion<00:02:56.530> well<00:02:57.130> actually<00:02:57.250> one<00:02:57.519> more

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
expansion well actually one more

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.830 
expansion well actually one more
question<00:02:57.940> about<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.209> now<00:02:58.389> is<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.630> going<00:02:58.810> to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
question about this now is this going to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.830 
question about this now is this going to
be<00:02:59.019> for<00:02:59.350> obviously<00:02:59.769> for<00:02:59.829> Apple<00:03:00.670> iOS<00:03:00.880> yes<00:03:01.540> it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
be for obviously for Apple iOS yes it

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.629 
be for obviously for Apple iOS yes it
will<00:03:02.019> there<00:03:02.200> be<00:03:02.230> an<00:03:02.350> android<00:03:02.769> version<00:03:02.799> they're

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
will there be an android version they're

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.340 
will there be an android version they're
really<00:03:03.760> eventually<00:03:04.329> eventually<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:05.109> just

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
really eventually eventually so just

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.840 
really eventually eventually so just
further<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:05.799> down<00:03:05.829> there<00:03:06.220> was<00:03:06.400> actually

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
further on down there was actually

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.400 
further on down there was actually
building<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.150> share<00:03:07.450> code<00:03:07.630> base<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.139> should

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
building a share code base that should

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.080 
building a share code base that should
it<00:03:08.530> would<00:03:08.590> be<00:03:08.709> very<00:03:08.829> easy<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.280> port<00:03:09.549> 2<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.940> four

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
it would be very easy to port 2 and four

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.610 
it would be very easy to port 2 and four
excellent<00:03:10.480> all<00:03:10.840> right<00:03:11.049> well<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.500> actually

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
excellent all right well and actually

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.110 
excellent all right well and actually
I'm<00:03:11.980> going<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.310> shake<00:03:12.489> your<00:03:12.579> hand<00:03:12.639> because
