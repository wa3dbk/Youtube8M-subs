00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.550
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.290
 it is just destiny new video to destiny 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.300
 very exciting people who have plans 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.580
 a few minutes made a video where we 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.710
 have said to be league league 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 shit that stays after this 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.430
 video and after discussions ours 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.920
 opinion that does not have to be 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.289
 the one who rolls the inventories in 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.289
 so it has been the lie that was yes 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.210
 megaman xe4 known by reddot one 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.669
 The most famous league I would even 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.829
 already say destiny and he had yes 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 from the outset I think so 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.850
 he has already seen the inventories 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.980
 but can never speak 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 reported after the parents the one 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.180
 or other Japanese leaks 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.370
 has carved out he has always clear 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.370
 That said, that's not the inventory of 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.289
 the next week may someday 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.239
 in between times there was 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.570
 every now and then one or the other 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.359
 Information regarding what we are about 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.670
 expect to have in the next few months 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.769
 people themselves megamind always very clear 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.590
 he said he does not want to spoil people 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.570
 go there that you know what next 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.790
 week bikes or is and he has all 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.760
 clearly if there is a mimic 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.310
 which stores the inventories one to one 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.520
 he will annoy bungie and he will 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.740
 then clearly responsible 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.900
 be changed that the inventories 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.880
 we just have to have megaman 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.430
 then in fact a new league out 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.049
 Of course, we did not care about success 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.450
 with a picture he showed 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.570
 of course, something in advance of it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.270
 should include universal device and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.920
 now it's the red dead he says for 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.259
 The people, of course, very nice that it 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.360
 the red death now gives that would have been so 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.670
 namely not given so far as he knows 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.439
 that has now been changed but he has 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.020
 fear now and said she should 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.780
 do not pray that next week too 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.360
 because this is changed to the us 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.909
 currently in the tower is not seen 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.619
 the one who was previously planned 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.210
 and as we know we have 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.490
 briefly reported in the next 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.680
 months should be your hard light in the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.149
 be inventory or dollars that are 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.509
 things the words have not sold yet 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.519
 you expect almost a halt 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.099
 until last year and I think that was 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.390
 a very clear allusion and just 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.579
 we have it again 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.439
 what are we talking about so league 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.560
 the things are good, the bad things are 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:26.079
 this hotfix has pay for impact 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.150
 and we permanently have the mega one 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.860
 tried to contact again there was 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.019
 so far no answer he was almost one 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.060
 week no longer active since ours 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.319
 last conversation we could not 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.970
 make more contact 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.430
 and now he has said as 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.079
 publicly reported again and that is 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.670
 really very important for us 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.609
 actually all have been waiting for it 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.519
 what says mega my next big thing of 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.299
 Destiny leaks to this hotfix as will 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.980
 go on 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.709
 and then he just has that 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.230
 New strike predicted and we will 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.450
 show you what strike 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.269
 next week that's all 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.030
 Clear if you are not saved 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.639
 then want to switch off here and also the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.829
 people who get in the spoiler 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.530
 they should not be in 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.840
 our comments because others just like that 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.790
 then please spoil somehow big 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.430
 write spoiler colon so that you 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.470
 the commentary can somehow bypass 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.150
 people so again very clear 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.639
 now comes the spoiler and I want 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.459
 again note so inventory league 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.400
 are something completely different namely to 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.319
 the leaks at the weekly strikes also there 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.030
 I want to say again the megaman is 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.829
 not there to spoil you around 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.139
 you the experience to break anything 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.870
 he is there to show the band 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.239
 no matter how much you need to get better 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.280
 we need progress and that 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.989
 was always the good thing about megaman unfortunately 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.269
 This whole league thing in the last 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.120
 weeks went a bit out of rowing 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.790
 but as I said spoiler at this point 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.310
 here we go 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.199
 if everything stays like the megaman 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.419
 thinks then we have next 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:04.120
 week an eagle at the start yes who has 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.829
 all the rest on it hands up yes there will be 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.409
 probably all be quiet and not one 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.049
 No move around Nico will start 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.510
 but with a kind of damage and that 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.030
 arcus hurt that means get your patience 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.410
 and time out gets everything out of her 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.570
 kind 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.040
 then you can do the whole thing 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.670
 next week well over the stage 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.370
 to run 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.800
 we saw again clearly people please 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.240
 spoiler people do not mind that 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.200
 know nothing about it know 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.910
 want 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.160
 we have a very good community 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.960
 in our opinion, too 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.510
 handle each other responsibly 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.310
 that's why it fits a little bit up and down 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.950
