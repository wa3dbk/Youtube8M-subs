were two major findings of the study

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.060 
were two major findings of the study
first<00:00:45.070> we<00:00:45.460> found<00:00:45.760> that<00:00:46.149> by<00:00:46.510> far<00:00:46.899> liquor<00:00:47.560> was

first we found that by far liquor was

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.860 
first we found that by far liquor was
the<00:00:48.250> beverage<00:00:48.579> of<00:00:48.670> choice<00:00:48.730> on<00:00:49.329> underage

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
the beverage of choice on underage

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.610 
the beverage of choice on underage
drinkers<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.670> second<00:00:52.120> major<00:00:52.270> finding<00:00:52.899> was

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
drinkers the second major finding was

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.310 
drinkers the second major finding was
that<00:00:53.700> bureau<00:00:54.700> was<00:00:54.850> second<00:00:55.360> but<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:56.050> malt

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
that bureau was second but that the malt

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
that bureau was second but that the malt
beverages<00:00:56.800> were<00:00:57.010> very<00:00:57.489> close<00:00:57.880> third<00:00:58.570> so<00:00:59.440> as

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
beverages were very close third so as

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.340 
beverages were very close third so as
you're<00:01:00.610> mentioning<00:01:01.059> liquor<00:01:01.300> liquor<00:01:01.870> was<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
you're mentioning liquor liquor was the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.760 
you're mentioning liquor liquor was the
clear<00:01:03.010> choice<00:01:03.040> of<00:01:03.730> almost<00:01:04.479> half<00:01:04.809> of<00:01:05.079> high

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
clear choice of almost half of high

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.010 
clear choice of almost half of high
school<00:01:06.149> students<00:01:07.149> and<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.689> think<00:01:07.899> it's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
school students and I think it's

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.959 
school students and I think it's
important<00:01:08.469> to<00:01:08.560> recognize<00:01:08.679> that<00:01:09.069> 10<00:01:09.520> or<00:01:09.639> 15

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
important to recognize that 10 or 15

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.429 
important to recognize that 10 or 15
years<00:01:09.999> ago<00:01:10.359> that<00:01:10.659> would<00:01:10.840> not<00:01:11.020> have<00:01:11.170> been<00:01:11.200> the

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
years ago that would not have been the

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.149 
years ago that would not have been the
case<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.630> know<00:01:13.749> those<00:01:14.020> times<00:01:14.319> beer<00:01:14.950> was

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
case you know those times beer was

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.219 
case you know those times beer was
clearly<00:01:15.520> in<00:01:15.579> the<00:01:15.670> beverage<00:01:15.969> of<00:01:16.090> choice<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
clearly in the beverage of choice so

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.349 
clearly in the beverage of choice so
people<00:01:17.859> can<00:01:18.189> say<00:01:18.399> well<00:01:18.639> kids<00:01:19.119> might<00:01:19.329> like

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
people can say well kids might like

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.809 
people can say well kids might like
liquor<00:01:19.959> because<00:01:20.289> you<00:01:20.859> can<00:01:21.100> conceal<00:01:21.459> it<00:01:21.609> more

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
liquor because you can conceal it more

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.269 
liquor because you can conceal it more
easily<00:01:21.999> or<00:01:22.359> because<00:01:22.659> it's<00:01:22.840> more<00:01:23.079> easily<00:01:23.409> you

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:24.279 
easily or because it's more easily you

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:26.219 
easily or because it's more easily you
can<00:01:24.399> get<00:01:24.609> drunk<00:01:25.119> quicker<00:01:25.539> if<00:01:25.810> that's<00:01:26.020> your

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
can get drunk quicker if that's your

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.529 
can get drunk quicker if that's your
purpose<00:01:26.590> but<00:01:27.279> that's<00:01:27.909> always<00:01:28.119> been<00:01:28.389> the<00:01:28.509> case

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
purpose but that's always been the case

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.510 
purpose but that's always been the case
so<00:01:28.929> you<00:01:28.990> have<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.319> ask<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:30.100> know<00:01:30.219> what<00:01:30.399> has

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
so you have to ask you know what has

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.319 
so you have to ask you know what has
changed<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:33.159> know<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.369> one<00:01:34.179> of<00:01:34.270> the

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
changed and we know that one of the

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.789 
changed and we know that one of the
things<00:01:34.389> that's<00:01:34.689> change<00:01:35.020> with<00:01:35.229> respect<00:01:35.259> to

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
things that's change with respect to

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.179 
things that's change with respect to
liquor<00:01:36.219> is<00:01:36.579> that<00:01:37.450> they<00:01:37.630> have<00:01:37.779> gone<00:01:38.189> heavily

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
liquor is that they have gone heavily

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.959 
liquor is that they have gone heavily
into<00:01:40.109> cable<00:01:41.109> television<00:01:41.619> advertising<00:01:42.159> going

forward<00:01:43.679> one<00:01:44.679> of<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.829> things<00:01:45.009> we're

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
forward one of the things we're

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.690 
forward one of the things we're
interested<00:01:45.520> in<00:01:45.789> exploring<00:01:46.599> more<00:01:47.109> is<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:48.520> we

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
interested in exploring more is can we

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.239 
interested in exploring more is can we
better<00:01:49.569> document<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.469> relationship<00:01:51.099> between

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249

better document the relationship between
advertising<00:01:52.469> for<00:01:53.469> specific<00:01:53.979> brands<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:54.700> what

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
advertising for specific brands and what

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.569 
advertising for specific brands and what
youth<00:01:55.749> are<00:01:55.959> actually<00:01:56.289> drinking<00:01:56.619> so<00:01:56.889> what

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
youth are actually drinking so what

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.010 
youth are actually drinking so what
you're<00:01:57.729> suggesting<00:01:57.909> is<00:01:58.359> really<00:01:58.749> that<00:01:58.899> the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
you're suggesting is really that the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.219 
you're suggesting is really that the
next<00:01:59.439> step<00:01:59.709> of<00:01:59.889> this<00:02:00.009> research<00:02:00.489> is<00:02:00.789> to<00:02:01.689> go<00:02:02.079> down

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
next step of this research is to go down

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.800 
next step of this research is to go down
even<00:02:02.439> one<00:02:02.709> more<00:02:02.889> level<00:02:03.159> so<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:04.270> go<00:02:04.419> from<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
even one more level so to go from the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.859 
even one more level so to go from the
