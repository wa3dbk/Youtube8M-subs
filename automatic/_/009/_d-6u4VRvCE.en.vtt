00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
here on C and this map is very

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.770 
here on C and this map is very
symmetrical<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.149> other<00:00:42.300> half<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.719> the

map<00:00:42.960> everything<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.100> Bill<00:00:44.550> it's

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
map everything is kind of like Bill it's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.430 
map everything is kind of like Bill it's
very<00:00:44.969> symmetrical<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.289> makes

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
very symmetrical in just that it makes

Orion comfortably I came we're gonna
make<00:00:53.160> our<00:00:53.280> way<00:00:53.340> towards<00:00:53.640> B<00:00:53.820> flag<00:00:54.030> now<00:00:54.210> before<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
make our way towards B flag now before I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.029 
make our way towards B flag now before I
get<00:00:54.840> there<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> should<00:00:55.260> note<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.770> makes

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
get there I should note that this makes

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.580 
get there I should note that this makes
for<00:00:56.250> great<00:00:56.370> cover<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.850> giant<00:00:57.210> red<00:00:57.329> pipe

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
for great cover this giant red pipe

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.260 
for great cover this giant red pipe
makes<00:00:58.590> very<00:00:58.800> very<00:00:59.129> good<00:00:59.579> cover<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.059> same

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
makes very very good cover the same

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.490 
makes very very good cover the same
thing<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.629> said<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.050> red<00:01:01.170> pipe<00:01:01.350> on

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
thing can be said about the red pipe on

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.660 
thing can be said about the red pipe on
the<00:01:01.620> other<00:01:01.739> half<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.190> said<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.460> map

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the other half like I said this map

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.759 
the other half like I said this map
mirrors<00:01:03.180> itself<00:01:03.629> its<00:01:03.840> Maps<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.170> symmetrical

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
mirrors itself its Maps very symmetrical

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.620 
mirrors itself its Maps very symmetrical
so<00:01:05.220> over<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> side<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.270> also<00:01:06.390> have

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
so over here on the a side you also have

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270 
so over here on the a side you also have
a<00:01:06.720> building<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.560> head<00:01:07.860> poke<00:01:08.070> off

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
a building that you can head poke off

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.609 
a building that you can head poke off
over<00:01:08.549> there's<00:01:08.760> two<00:01:08.909> ways<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.570> yeah<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
over there's two ways up and yeah the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.380 
over there's two ways up and yeah the
map<00:01:10.770> itself<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.340> symmetrical<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.210> come

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
map itself very symmetrical so you come

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.000 
map itself very symmetrical so you come
here<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.140> captured<00:01:13.470> B<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:13.740> behind

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
here and you can captured B from behind

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
here and you can captured B from behind
this<00:01:14.189> pillar<00:01:14.460> thing<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.119> call<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> road

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
this pillar thing we call it's a road
