00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
as one of the top players to have played
the<00:01:41.100> game<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> there<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.479> no<00:01:42.600> question<00:01:42.750> about

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the game so there is no question about

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:53.050 
the game so there is no question about
criticism
