it's a preseason cast-iron grill surface
so<00:00:51.320> things<00:00:51.589> aren't<00:00:51.920> going<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.190> stick<00:00:52.399> at<00:00:52.579> its

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
so things aren't going to stick at its

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.119 
so things aren't going to stick at its
that<00:00:52.940> natural<00:00:53.420> non<00:00:53.600> stick<00:00:53.929> to<00:00:54.109> it<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:55.100> just

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
that natural non stick to it and it just

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.400 
that natural non stick to it and it just
really<00:00:55.820> holds<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.510> heat<00:00:56.660> well<00:00:56.870> distribute

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
really holds the heat well distribute

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.689 
really holds the heat well distribute
the<00:00:57.530> heat<00:00:57.679> well<00:00:57.890> when<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:58.519> talk<00:00:58.670> about

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
the heat well when you talk about

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.700 
the heat well when you talk about
searing<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.359> steak<00:00:59.390> or<00:00:59.870> even<00:01:00.079> just<00:01:00.109> a<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:00.679> know

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
searing a steak or even just a you know

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.430 
searing a steak or even just a you know
quick<00:01:01.160> light<00:01:01.489> touch<00:01:01.760> on<00:01:01.999> an<00:01:02.120> ahi<00:01:02.420> tuna<00:01:02.809> that's

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
quick light touch on an ahi tuna that's

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.140 
quick light touch on an ahi tuna that's
it<00:01:03.710> we're<00:01:04.100> all<00:01:04.220> about<00:01:04.400> options<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.059> this

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
it we're all about options and this

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.850 
it we're all about options and this
certainly<00:01:05.330> plays<00:01:05.690> right<00:01:05.900> into<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.350> legs<00:01:06.590> come

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
certainly plays right into the legs come

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.830 
certainly plays right into the legs come
off<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.730> it's<00:01:07.850> portable<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:08.420> could<00:01:08.570> put<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:08.810> in

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
off so it's portable you could put it in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.570 
off so it's portable you could put it in
the<00:01:08.960> carry<00:01:09.170> bag<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.650> move<00:01:09.800> right<00:01:10.010> along<00:01:10.130> but

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
the carry bag and move right along but

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.280 
the carry bag and move right along but
that's<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.000> idea<00:01:11.300> is<00:01:11.390> we<00:01:11.630> want<00:01:11.840> everything<00:01:12.050> to

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
that's the idea is we want everything to

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.230 
that's the idea is we want everything to
be<00:01:12.320> able<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.800> cook<00:01:13.370> really<00:01:13.730> well<00:01:13.880> on<00:01:14.030> your

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
patio one night and be thrown in the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.320 
patio one night and be thrown in the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
you can cook with the Dutch oven on a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.000 
you can cook with the Dutch oven on a
grill<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.960> there<00:01:24.200> are<00:01:24.260> some<00:01:24.350> tricks<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.740> that

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
grill and there are some tricks to that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.980 
grill and there are some tricks to that
I<00:01:25.040> mean<00:01:25.370> because<00:01:25.760> these<00:01:26.060> put<00:01:26.240> up<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:26.510> much<00:01:26.660> heat

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
I mean because these put up so much heat

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.140 
I mean because these put up so much heat
sure<00:01:27.230> I<00:01:27.440> got<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.740> be<00:01:27.800> honest<00:01:28.040> I<00:01:28.250> like<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.850> three

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
sure I got to be honest I like the three

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.630 
sure I got to be honest I like the three
burners<00:01:29.570> because<00:01:30.020> if<00:01:30.140> i<00:01:30.260> use<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.590> BBQ<00:01:31.280> for<00:01:31.490> two

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
burners because if i use the BBQ for two

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.700 
burners because if i use the BBQ for two
burner<00:01:31.850> then<00:01:32.750> I've<00:01:32.840> got<00:01:32.870> another<00:01:33.170> burner<00:01:33.440> left

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
burner then I've got another burner left

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.080 
burner then I've got another burner left
over<00:01:33.950> here<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.190> put<00:01:34.310> something<00:01:34.520> else<00:01:34.730> on<00:01:34.910> in

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
over here to put something else on in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.120 
over here to put something else on in
this<00:01:35.210> case<00:01:35.450> they're<00:01:36.380> brand<00:01:36.620> new<00:01:36.680> hot<00:01:36.890> pot

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130
