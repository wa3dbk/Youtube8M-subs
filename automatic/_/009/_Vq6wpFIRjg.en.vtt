let's<00:03:22.590> see<00:03:22.829> how<00:03:22.950> big<00:03:23.189> he<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.840> it's<00:03:24.840> gonna<00:03:24.959> take

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
let's see how big he is it's gonna take

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:42.429 
let's see how big he is it's gonna take
me<00:03:25.409> some<00:03:25.560> time<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.799> figure<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.219> out<00:03:38.900> 22:44

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:57.199

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
and to arm to arm to tail it is 44 it's

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.300 
and to arm to arm to tail it is 44 it's
hard<00:03:57.419> for<00:03:57.599> me<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.840> tell<00:03:58.019> because<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.799> never

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
hard for me to tell because I never

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.179 
hard for me to tell because I never
really<00:03:59.669> do<00:04:00.090> measure<00:04:00.419> any<00:04:00.720> much<00:04:01.250> I'm<00:04:02.250> only<00:04:02.489> 9

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189
