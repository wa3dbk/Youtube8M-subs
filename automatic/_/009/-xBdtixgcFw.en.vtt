00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
so today we be looking at newness in 62

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.510 
so today we be looking at newness in 62
to<00:00:14.360> MUC<00:00:14.690> -<00:00:14.900> value<00:00:15.799> we're<00:00:15.920> gonna<00:00:16.160> take<00:00:16.309> a<00:00:16.340> look

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
to MUC - value we're gonna take a look

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.519 
to MUC - value we're gonna take a look
at<00:00:17.020> boxing<00:00:18.080> new<00:00:18.890> features<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:20.290> see<00:00:21.290> what's

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
at boxing new features and see what's

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.900 
at boxing new features and see what's
new<00:00:21.619> inside<00:00:23.860> so<00:00:24.860> here<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:25.340> we<00:00:25.490> have<00:00:25.670> in<00:00:25.820> a

package once we have the flesh like
yourself<00:00:28.730> his<00:00:29.720> fever<00:00:30.080> in<00:00:30.490> both<00:00:31.490> ways<00:00:31.759> it<00:00:32.660> has<00:00:32.840> a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
yourself his fever in both ways it has a

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.229 
yourself his fever in both ways it has a
diffuser<00:00:35.120> as<00:00:35.180> well<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.660> know<00:00:35.900> a<00:00:36.170> mini<00:00:36.850> mini<00:00:37.850> boss

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
card and yeah as many functions which

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.729 
card and yeah as many functions which
with<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.470> global<00:00:42.769> beta<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.570> has<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.739> flash

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
with the global beta and has a flash

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.180 
with the global beta and has a flash
then<00:00:46.390> it<00:00:47.390> might<00:00:47.629> amount<00:00:50.080> small<00:00:51.080> soft<00:00:51.440> bag<00:00:51.619> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
then it might amount small soft bag and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.979 
then it might amount small soft bag and
a<00:00:53.059> copy<00:00:53.390> is<00:00:53.600> okapi<00:00:54.019> manuals<00:00:55.449> here<00:00:56.449> we<00:00:56.570> have<00:00:56.750> the

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
a copy is okapi manuals here we have the

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.039 
a copy is okapi manuals here we have the
necessary<00:00:57.650> secret<00:00:58.129> or<00:00:58.250> not<00:00:58.430> -<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:58.900> you<00:00:59.900> can

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
necessary secret or not - and you can

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:01.539 
necessary secret or not - and you can
put<00:01:00.199> four<00:01:00.409> batteries<00:01:00.739> in<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.220> compartment

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
put four batteries in the compartment

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.509 
put four batteries in the compartment
and<00:01:01.909> I<00:01:01.970> simply<00:01:02.510> start<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.869> in<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:03.320> just<00:01:04.129> press

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
and I simply start it in and just press

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.670 
and I simply start it in and just press
the<00:01:04.610> other<00:01:04.729> button<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.269> your<00:01:05.390> turn<00:01:05.600> on<00:01:05.720> so

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
the other button and your turn on so

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.580 
the other button and your turn on so
while<00:01:07.460> it's<00:01:07.610> loading<00:01:07.760> is<00:01:08.150> really<00:01:08.450> color<00:01:08.689> and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
while it's loading is really color and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.100 
while it's loading is really color and
when<00:01:09.799> it's<00:01:09.920> ready<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.369> fire<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:11.659> green<00:01:11.840> and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
when it's ready to fire in in green and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.529 
when it's ready to fire in in green and
you<00:01:12.229> can<00:01:12.260> to<00:01:13.450> tell<00:01:14.450> shots<00:01:14.829> in<00:01:15.829> this<00:01:15.920> pattern<00:01:16.130> so

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
you can to tell shots in this pattern so

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.950 
you can to tell shots in this pattern so
functions<00:01:17.539> wise<00:01:17.780> on<00:01:18.140> can<00:01:19.000> do<00:01:20.000> flash<00:01:20.630> exposure

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
functions wise on can do flash exposure

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.069 
functions wise on can do flash exposure
conversation<00:01:21.619> easily<00:01:22.039> by<00:01:22.880> passing<00:01:23.810> these<00:01:23.899> two

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
conversation easily by passing these two

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.990 
conversation easily by passing these two
patterns<00:01:24.429> so<00:01:25.429> you<00:01:25.670> can<00:01:25.789> either

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
patterns so you can either

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.360 
patterns so you can either
either<00:01:29.300> that<00:01:30.300> or<00:01:30.480> subtract<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.410> exposure<00:01:31.890> by

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
either that or subtract the exposure by

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.710 
either that or subtract the exposure by
by<00:01:33.500> going<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.620> and<00:01:34.770> down<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:35.640> matter<00:01:35.760> of<00:01:35.910> half

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
by going up and down in a matter of half

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
by going up and down in a matter of half
stops<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.530> maximum<00:01:37.800> or<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.370> half<00:01:38.490> in

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
stops up to maximum or one and a half in

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.150 
stops up to maximum or one and a half in
both<00:01:39.240> directions<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:40.530> can't<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.010> the

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
both directions you can't go to the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.980 
both directions you can't go to the
manual<00:01:41.460> mode<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.120> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.450> either<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.750> is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
manual mode so you can either this is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.770 
manual mode so you can either this is
the<00:01:43.110> lowest<00:01:43.740> power<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> full<00:01:45.180> power<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the lowest power do the full power this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.650 
the lowest power do the full power this
is<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.110> full<00:01:46.380> stops<00:01:46.619> or<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.880> set<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
is in full stops or you can set it to a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.570 
is in full stops or you can set it to a
slave<00:01:49.050> mode<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> statement<00:01:50.310> in

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
slave mode this is the statement in

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.550 
slave mode this is the statement in
digital<00:01:50.910> mode<00:01:51.140> instead<00:01:52.140> you're<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
digital mode instead you're going to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.880 
digital mode instead you're going to
render<00:01:52.950> sensor<00:01:53.430> receive<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.470> digital<00:01:55.470> flash

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
render sensor receive a digital flash

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.090 
render sensor receive a digital flash
