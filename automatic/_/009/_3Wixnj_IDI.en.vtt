00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
brandon's idea we took out emptiness

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.170 
brandon's idea we took out emptiness
completely<00:02:14.420> because<00:02:15.250> when<00:02:16.250> they<00:02:16.970> have<00:02:17.150> a

completely because when they have a
field<00:02:17.480> emptiness<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.080> really<00:02:18.290> bad<00:02:18.410> when<00:02:19.130> I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
field emptiness is really bad when I

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.000 
field emptiness is really bad when I
have<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.550> feel<00:02:19.820> than<00:02:20.450> any<00:02:21.050> trap<00:02:21.380> essentially

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010

so<00:02:32.950> we<00:02:33.950> just<00:02:34.070> decided<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.580> would<00:02:34.760> be<00:02:34.790> better<00:02:35.000> to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
so we just decided it would be better to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.050 
so we just decided it would be better to
play<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.200> Righetti<00:02:37.160> Brakes<00:02:37.430> instead<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.970> then

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
to discard so discarding was never a

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.740 
to discard so discarding was never a

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
the mirror match actually because I

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.730 
the mirror match actually because I
couldn't<00:03:48.730> find<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.210> way<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.990> consistently<00:03:50.470> beat

the mirror match I thought Maxie was

really<00:03:52.240> bad<00:03:52.390> they<00:03:52.630> were<00:03:52.720> just<00:03:52.870> said<00:03:52.990> back<00:03:53.140> row

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
really bad they were just said back row

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.910 
really bad they were just said back row
and<00:03:53.560> then<00:03:53.620> they're<00:03:54.370> like<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:55.090> stopped<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.990> I

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
and then they're like it stopped and I

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.020 
and then they're like it stopped and I
would<00:03:57.160> still<00:03:57.310> be<00:03:57.400> in<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.520> really<00:03:57.700> bad<00:03:57.820> position

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
would still be in a really bad position

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.760 
would still be in a really bad position
so<00:03:58.480> i<00:03:58.540> didn't<00:03:58.750> i<00:03:58.930> didn't<00:03:59.080> like<00:03:59.140> Maxie<00:03:59.530> so<00:03:59.710> I

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
so i didn't i didn't like Maxie so I

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.990 
so i didn't i didn't like Maxie so I
completely<00:03:59.950> cut<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.460> and<00:04:00.550> I<00:04:00.610> wasn't<00:04:00.910> hiding

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
completely cut it and I wasn't hiding

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.600 
completely cut it and I wasn't hiding
going<00:04:01.210> to<00:04:01.270> get<00:04:01.510> regular<00:04:01.690> dragons<00:04:02.170> anyway<00:04:02.610> but

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
going to get regular dragons anyway but

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.980 
going to get regular dragons anyway but
the<00:04:03.700> idea<00:04:03.880> behind<00:04:04.000> this<00:04:04.209> was<00:04:04.450> they<00:04:04.690> would<00:04:04.810> be

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
the idea behind this was they would be

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.780 
the idea behind this was they would be
they<00:04:05.320> would<00:04:05.440> put<00:04:05.560> up<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.709> field<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.280> set<00:04:06.550> their

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
they would put up a field and set their

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.670 
they would put up a field and set their
traps<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.300> I'd<00:04:07.360> some<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.660> this<00:04:07.810> fleet<00:04:08.590> of

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
traps and I'd some in this fleet of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.870 
traps and I'd some in this fleet of
their<00:04:08.770> field<00:04:08.950> with<00:04:09.130> those<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.610> then<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.820> took

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
their field with those and then I took

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.570 
their field with those and then I took
my<00:04:10.209> traps<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.780> then<00:04:10.870> like<00:04:11.100> like<00:04:12.100> actually

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
my traps and then like like actually

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.610 
my traps and then like like actually
playing<00:04:12.820> instead<00:04:13.570> of<00:04:13.690> like<00:04:13.900> someone<00:04:14.410> set

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
playing instead of like someone set

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.960 
playing instead of like someone set
infinite<00:04:14.980> back<00:04:15.130> row<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.489> then<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.790> game<00:04:15.910> is

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
infinite back row and then the game is

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.259 
infinite back row and then the game is
just<00:04:16.150> over<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.680> play<00:04:18.669> any<00:04:18.880> mere<00:04:19.090> bache
