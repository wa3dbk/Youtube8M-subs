railroad monkey ones then you know

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.300 
railroad monkey ones then you know
that's<00:02:08.670> different<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.959> me<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that's different but to me and I and the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.780 
that's different but to me and I and the
reason

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
reason

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.220 
reason
because<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> probably<00:02:12.480> don't<00:02:12.659> have<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> real

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
because I probably don't have a real

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.330 
because I probably don't have a real
easy<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.769> hand<00:02:14.099> or<00:02:14.519> haven't<00:02:15.269> um<00:02:15.799> I'm<00:02:16.799> not<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> fan

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
easy in hand or haven't um I'm not a fan

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.530 
easy in hand or haven't um I'm not a fan
of<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.549> shoe<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:17.969> I<00:02:18.000> don't<00:02:18.180> really<00:02:18.299> pay

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
of the shoe so I don't really pay

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.319 
of the shoe so I don't really pay
attention<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.140> them<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.739> if<00:02:20.489> I<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:20.909> to<00:02:20.939> say

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
attention to them so if I was to say

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.630 
attention to them so if I was to say
here<00:02:21.540> I'm<00:02:21.599> gonna<00:02:21.719> spend<00:02:22.010> $3,000<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.370> wasn't

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
here I'm gonna spend $3,000 and wasn't

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520 
here I'm gonna spend $3,000 and wasn't
educated<00:02:23.969> that<00:02:24.569> they<00:02:24.719> have<00:02:24.900> fake<00:02:25.170> receipts
