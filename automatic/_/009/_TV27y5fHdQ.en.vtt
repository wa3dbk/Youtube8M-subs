sheet like this they do have sheets that
are<00:00:50.249> smaller<00:00:50.550> than<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.210> ended<00:00:51.510> up

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
are smaller than this but I ended up

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.700 
are smaller than this but I ended up
getting<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.929> full<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.530> wasn't

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
getting the full one because I wasn't

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.049

shards<00:00:55.679> I<00:00:55.769> literally<00:00:56.159> just<00:00:56.309> broke<00:00:56.519> it<00:00:56.729> so<00:00:56.850> when

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
