Hepner guitar here this is a
custom-built<00:01:11.369> guitar<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.180> fits<00:01:12.720> guitars<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
custom-built guitar so it fits guitars a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.109 
custom-built guitar so it fits guitars a
pretty<00:01:13.950> gentle<00:01:14.189> shape<00:01:14.460> I'd<00:01:14.670> say<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.030> have

a raised fretboard you probably be

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.100 
a raised fretboard you probably be
skeptical<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.240> gonna<00:01:18.360> fit<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:18.750> but

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
skeptical if it's gonna fit or not but

this doesn't have a raised fretboard and
it's<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.189> very<00:01:23.460> nice<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.180> snug

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

back<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> I'll<00:01:35.579> show<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> round<00:01:36.450> view<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
back out and I'll show a round view the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.149 
back out and I'll show a round view the
case<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.259> couldn't<00:01:37.500> even<00:01:37.560> find<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
case because I couldn't even find a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
case because I couldn't even find a
picture<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.900> case<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> don't

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
picture of the top of the case I don't

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.450 
picture of the top of the case I don't
even<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> top<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.159> looked<00:01:41.310> like

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
even know what the top of it looked like

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.940 
even know what the top of it looked like
when<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.640> ordered<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:43.229> know<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.710> it's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
when I ordered it you know it's it's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
when I ordered it you know it's it's
interesting<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.820> isn't

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
interesting because this one isn't

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.450 
interesting because this one isn't
really<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> shape<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.890> guitar<00:01:47.040> like

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
really the shape of a of a guitar like

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
really the shape of a of a guitar like
the<00:01:47.670> gaiter<00:01:47.880> case<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the gaiter case one is but I like that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.319 
the gaiter case one is but I like that
it's<00:01:50.130> kind<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.430> neat<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.820> fits<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.210> your

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it's kind of neat and it fits on your

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.789 
it's kind of neat and it fits on your
shoulders<00:01:51.689> very<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:52.079> since<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.470> shoulders

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
shoulders very well since your shoulders

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.280 
shoulders very well since your shoulders
actually<00:01:52.950> have<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> place<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.490> rest<00:01:54.290> here's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
actually have a place to rest here's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.020 
actually have a place to rest here's
another<00:01:55.500> great<00:01:55.710> thing<00:01:55.890> about<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.250> case<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
another great thing about this case in

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.940 
another great thing about this case in
comparison<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> Gators<00:01:58.140> okay<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.710> this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
comparison to the Gators okay so this

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.789 
comparison to the Gators okay so this
one<00:01:59.219> has<00:01:59.969> these<00:02:00.299> metal<00:02:00.659> clips<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.590> Gator

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
one has these metal clips and the Gator

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
one has these metal clips and the Gator
case<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.310> plastic<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> Gator<00:02:03.540> case

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
case are plastic and on the Gator case

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.780 
case are plastic and on the Gator case
these<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.469> snap<00:02:04.799> off<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.280> come<00:02:05.490> off<00:02:05.640> but

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
these like snap off and come off but

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.749 
these like snap off and come off but
these<00:02:06.000> seem<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.240> they'll<00:02:06.540> stay<00:02:07.310> these<00:02:08.310> clips

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
these seem like they'll stay these clips

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.029 
these seem like they'll stay these clips
seem<00:02:09.360> pretty<00:02:09.989> hard<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> press<00:02:10.530> down<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.009> I

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
seem pretty hard to press down so I

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.410 
seem pretty hard to press down so I
think<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.459> would<00:02:11.580> take<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.790> lot<00:02:12.030> more<00:02:12.060> to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
think it would take a lot more to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.520 
think it would take a lot more to
actually<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:13.319> those

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
actually have those

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.120 
actually have those
let's<00:02:13.740> fall<00:02:13.980> off<00:02:15.230> yeah<00:02:16.230> anyway<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:16.950> feels

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
let's fall off yeah anyway it just feels

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.670 
let's fall off yeah anyway it just feels
very<00:02:17.430> well<00:02:17.670> made<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.870> great<00:02:19.080> case

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
very well made it's a great case

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.910 
very well made it's a great case
Gator<00:02:20.430> case<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.630> good<00:02:21.900> thing<00:02:22.260> about<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.680> is

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
Gator case the good thing about this is

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.730 
Gator case the good thing about this is
it<00:02:23.040> has<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.190> pouch<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:24.660> don't<00:02:25.050> ever<00:02:25.260> use<00:02:25.380> it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
it has a pouch I don't ever use it

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.949 
it has a pouch I don't ever use it
really<00:02:26.069> because<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.550> keep<00:02:27.180> all<00:02:27.330> my<00:02:27.360> stuff<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.870> my

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
really because I keep all my stuff in my

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:28.730 
really because I keep all my stuff in my
backpack

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
backpack

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.860 
backpack
but<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.850> some<00:02:30.000> people<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:30.270> could<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> big

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
but for some people that could be a big

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.970 
but for some people that could be a big
thing<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:31.470> want<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:31.920> an

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
thing if you just want to have an

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.340 
thing if you just want to have an
all-around<00:02:32.370> solution<00:02:33.000> here<00:02:33.209> but<00:02:33.450> here's<00:02:34.230> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
all-around solution here but here's the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.930 
all-around solution here but here's the
problem<00:02:34.500> with<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:34.860> case<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.640> start

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
problem with this case so you start

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.370 
problem with this case so you start
first<00:02:36.180> off<00:02:36.360> you're<00:02:36.569> even<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:37.020> starting

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
first off you're even just starting

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.449 
first off you're even just starting
opening<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.100> thing<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.340> like

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
opening it and this thing is like

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.620 
opening it and this thing is like
lifting<00:02:38.819> off<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.000> ground

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
lifting off the ground

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.350 
lifting off the ground
you<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.560> fully<00:02:40.800> open<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.760> tips

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
you get it to fully open and it tips

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.610 
you get it to fully open and it tips
over<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.660> mean<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.080> get<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.440> where<00:02:43.530> it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
over I mean you can get it to where it

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.180 
over I mean you can get it to where it
balances<00:02:44.270> but<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.230> general<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.769> tips<00:02:47.010> out

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
balances but it in general it tips out

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.560 
balances but it in general it tips out
when<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.459> pull<00:02:47.640> your<00:02:47.670> guitar<00:02:48.090> especially

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
when you pull your guitar especially

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.630 
when you pull your guitar especially
since<00:02:48.750> like<00:02:48.930> your<00:02:49.320> tarp<00:02:49.620> pulls<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.610> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
since like your tarp pulls up on this a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.090 
since like your tarp pulls up on this a
little<00:02:51.030> bit<00:02:51.150> too<00:02:51.360> when<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.630> lift<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.100> it's

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
little bit too when you lift it it's

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.400

ninety dollars to travel light one

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.550 
ninety dollars to travel light one
ninety<00:04:35.849> two<00:04:35.879> I<00:04:36.090> think<00:04:36.449> it<00:04:36.539> was<00:04:36.659> on<00:04:36.810> Amazon<00:04:37.289> free

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
ninety two I think it was on Amazon free

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.070 
ninety two I think it was on Amazon free
shipping<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.370> Gator<00:04:38.669> case<00:04:39.030> was<00:04:39.599> more<00:04:39.840> like

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
shipping the Gator case was more like

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.909 
shipping the Gator case was more like
when<00:04:40.740> it's<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.919> 65<00:04:41.520> or<00:04:41.580> $70<00:04:42.479> so<00:04:43.139> this<00:04:43.500> one<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.889> a

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
when it's a 65 or $70 so this one is a

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.920 
when it's a 65 or $70 so this one is a
little<00:04:44.129> bit<00:04:44.310> more<00:04:44.490> expensive<00:04:44.789> but<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.750> me<00:04:45.900> I

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
little bit more expensive but to me I

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.330 
little bit more expensive but to me I
think<00:04:46.139> it's<00:04:46.409> worth<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.800> for<00:04:46.949> a<00:04:47.009> little<00:04:47.159> bit

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
think it's worth it for a little bit
