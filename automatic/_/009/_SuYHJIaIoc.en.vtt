00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
this track you can see that everything

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.160 
this track you can see that everything
is<00:01:28.759> just<00:01:28.940> really<00:01:29.360> I<00:01:29.390> mean<00:01:29.600> it's<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:29.840> it's

is just really I mean it's just it's
amazing<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.830> great<00:01:31.040> track<00:01:31.340> he's<00:01:31.970> got<00:01:32.090> a

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
amazing is it a great track he's got a

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.820 
amazing is it a great track he's got a
great<00:01:32.300> layout<00:01:32.509> but<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.110> problem<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:33.619> the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
great layout but the problem is the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.560 
great layout but the problem is the
jumps<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.640> can<00:01:34.759> see<00:01:34.940> where<00:01:35.090> he<00:01:35.119> extended

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
jumps and you can see where he extended

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.120 
jumps and you can see where he extended
the<00:01:35.630> sides<00:01:35.930> because<00:01:36.170> right<00:01:36.470> there<00:01:36.680> almost<00:01:36.860> go

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
the sides because right there almost go

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.290 
the sides because right there almost go
to<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.310> left<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.759> was<00:01:37.880> going<00:01:38.119> down<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
to the left and I was going down the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.090 
to the left and I was going down the
middle<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:38.990> go<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.380> far<00:01:39.619> left<00:01:39.860> on<00:01:40.009> that

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
middle so you go to the far left on that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.620 
middle so you go to the far left on that
you're<00:01:40.280> gonna<00:01:40.460> go<00:01:40.670> off<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.880> track<00:01:40.910> that's<00:01:41.420> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
you're gonna go off the track that's the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.529 
you're gonna go off the track that's the
only<00:01:42.410> bad<00:01:42.530> thing<00:01:42.590> as<00:01:43.369> well<00:01:43.670> as<00:01:43.820> dis<00:01:44.060> jumping<00:01:44.450> to

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
only bad thing as well as dis jumping to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.510 
only bad thing as well as dis jumping to
go<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.810> far<00:01:45.020> left<00:01:45.259> there's<00:01:46.160> a<00:01:46.250> problem

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
go to the far left there's a problem

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.680 
go to the far left there's a problem
there's<00:01:46.789> a<00:01:46.880> chance<00:01:47.149> you're<00:01:47.330> going<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.509> fall

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
there's a chance you're going to fall

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.029 
there's a chance you're going to fall
off<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.929> left<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.560> actually<00:01:48.920> on<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
off to the left to and actually on the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.130 
off to the left to and actually on the
second<00:01:49.369> lap<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.610> do<00:01:49.670> fall<00:01:50.090> off<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:50.960> left

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
second lap I do fall off to the left

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.630 
second lap I do fall off to the left
there<00:01:51.289> so<00:01:51.410> that's<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.649> only<00:01:51.679> problem<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.369> I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
there so that's the only problem and I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.040 
there so that's the only problem and I
realize<00:01:52.970> it<00:01:53.090> was<00:01:53.210> probably<00:01:53.509> hard<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.780> even

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
realize it was probably hard to even

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.749 
realize it was probably hard to even
perspective<00:01:54.619> jumps<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.979> way<00:01:55.069> he<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.429> he<00:01:55.520> did

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
perspective jumps the way he that he did

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.850 
perspective jumps the way he that he did
so<00:01:56.600> i'm<00:01:56.720> not<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.140> know<00:01:57.170> ragging<00:01:57.590> on<00:01:57.649> him<00:01:57.740> or

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
so i'm not you know ragging on him or

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.050 
so i'm not you know ragging on him or
