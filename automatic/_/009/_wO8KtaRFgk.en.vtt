00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.730
 I'm going to play diffuse music now 2 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.439
 gonzaga show in this indoor profile that 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 It is using the fife band in 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.609
 in florianópolis and also in the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.130
 workshops I give at the foundation 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.539
 Santa Catarina culture and also I will 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.349
 play this song the way I 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.649
 I learned it and every city ​​hall usually has 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.910
 a way to play and it's up to you 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.559
 if you want to learn to play a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 whichever instrument is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.840
 in popular music to listen to the masters who 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.210
 such a songwriter listen to several 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.399
 people playing her to form people 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.870
 our way of touching our language 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.870
 so this is just one more digit 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.199
 the top once command is natural of the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.570
 music and then I was a little more 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.570
 slow showing the details twice 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.190
 she repeats several things at last and there it is 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.200
 I slowly step through these notes that 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.709
 I touch that tone 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.709
 look that 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.419
 ae 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:04:00.219
 and for that part the salt here from a sun 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:02.859
 the cinemobile half since the jump already jumps 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:08.970
 straight to the note by tac 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.970
 just cum your brother 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.900
 and then when this song gets a little 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.519
 faster 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.889
 we can not do the articulation 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.859
 her playing the notes all the time 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.650
 doing everything is a little difficult to 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:30.960
 about the notes doing that time then 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:33.539
 and can do has to have is to taste instead 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.669
 to do thatta that stays a little 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.740
 Difficult for the tongue is getting a little 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:43.400
 But then you make tumultuous tpi 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:54.270
 Third time figurine will then have 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:56.639
 Élson is more a little clearer than 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.680
 You also have to want to have to 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:04.820
 want to want you wanted yesterday and want to 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.820
 events your way 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.320
 anyway this is a way of playing 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.250
 I hope it works for you to learn. 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.250
 a little more about op
