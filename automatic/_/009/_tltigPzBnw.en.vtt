00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
 for next month it is expected that the 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.589
 international court of justice of the 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.180
 beech 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:09.970
 deliver your ruling on the dispute 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.130
 maritime between Peru and Chile in the neighbor 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.440
 country there are already voices that speak of a 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.380
 possible contempt by the government 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.080
 Chilean is possible a scenario of this 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.130
 kind what is getting either the 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.200
 culmination of a process where two 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.060
 states recognize what are the 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.400
 powers of a court 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.460
 international and then that always 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.289
 generates certain nervousness 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.480
 restlessness but I also think that everything 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.479
 they are speculations I mean once 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.010
 that is accessed and recognized 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:45.819
 attributions and the power that has a 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.539
 court what it deserves or what it is 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:54.129
 should do in this case is to respect and 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.659
 is to respect the good result of the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.179
 query that has been made and the 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.789
 proposal that is going to leave the court 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.129
 international of the beech not for saints 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.899
 It is a mistake to raise this dispute as 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.210
 a competition where some win and others 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.260
 they lose under the optics of the times 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.170
 that run 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.150
 necessary and it is also urgent for Peru 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.570
 and chile can close so 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.700
 definitive what is a conflict that 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.040
 it has more than a century 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.590
 they consider that the conflict does not exist and 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.090
 Obviously that is not the case 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.770
 that this demand has prospered wants 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.870
 say that the conflict that the conflict 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.820
 there is what you have to be prepare 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.000
 the states is to give an answer 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.340
 right and consistent and there I think that 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.530
 the good thing that you should abide by 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.450
 resolution of the international court of 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.130
 there is as much as possible 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.080
 political consequences of a failure 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 unfavorable chili facing the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.729
 November elections saints considers 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.770
 wrong an analysis of this type 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.870
 these are state policies this is 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.750
 above the political color of the 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.360
 governments this process good clear its 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.729
 maximum its maximum expression so 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.430
 say what I wanted the exhibition in the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.670
 court starts with in the government of 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.200
 piñera but this did not start in the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.030
 Piñera government I want to say that this 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.310
 has has a background that is a 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.540
 process a much longer process I 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.620
 I think that we should not raise it as 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.930
 losers or win 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.180
 that is the error Peruvian residents in 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.890
 iquique think differently about 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.989
 the consequences for them of a 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.190
 possible unfavorable result chili in 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.200
 the international court 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.610
 if the immigrant people that we are from Peru 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.230
 or from any country we come to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.840
 work here that we open the door that 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.030
 It's Chile, I just hope it's not 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.300
 that failure 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.150
 and that if it were clear that 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.720
 many Peruvians would hurt us a lot 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.569
 because here the Chilean country welcomed us and 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.990
 welcomed us both at work and in 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.540
 family and so we hope that it 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.420
 fix is ​​solved without there being that 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.230
 problem and there are several people that we 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.440
 harass there is discrimination imagine 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.450
 that if there was the fault it's going to be worse and 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.580
 many people because of the obvious harassment that 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.440
 will have to return we have 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.630
 countries governments wait for 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.430
 result of the failure and until now the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.140
 two have agreed to abide by the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.200
 decision of the international court of 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.510
 justice issue that will be seen only when 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.690
 the ruling is known in the middle of 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.690
 July
