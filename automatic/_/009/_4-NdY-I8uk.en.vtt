00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello good afternoon thank you inside 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.809
 of the blog I wanted you to pose this 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.429
 question and it is if they pay you the right thing I already know 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.559
 which is a super uncomfortable question and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.320
 delicate nobody likes to tell what 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.119
 wins or does not like to think that you do not 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.310
 they are paying what they owe to all 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.689
 we always want to earn more than what we 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.880
 pay and we know that no no is not 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.429
 true that they are paying us in reality 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 what we are producing but here the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.420
 issue is that it is important that in a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.780
 market like this one like the one we live 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.480
 today let's do a real construction act 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.489
 and an act of investigating us to us 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.910
 analyze us and think if 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.649
 we are really contributing or not to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.160
 background with the organization that we are 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.590
 working 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.719
 if we are clear about the achievements 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.879
 that we are contributing what is what 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.160
 we are leaving added value that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.410
 what is the legacy that we are going to leave 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.420
 when we leave this position is more 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.969
 put it in easy what are the achievements 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.799
 that I can put on my resume and in 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.760
 function of this work that is the most 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.670
 important that this does not 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.590
 and depending on having real answers 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 to those questions is that I'm going to be able to 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.600
 know if they are paying me just what 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.010
 certainly companies have many 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.430
 times our salary scales and 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.560
 established or we have clear ideas of 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.600
 how to compensate people I know there 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.910
 someone who is really good at 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.340
 companies are willing to pay better 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.720
 to keep them eye I'm not proposing 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.730
 everyone go where your boss 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.410
 now to ask for more money because I've 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.880
 done my personal research and not from 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.950
 account that contributed more than what 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.900
 they pay me what I'm seeing is the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.260
 importance of knowing that the payment 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.060
 It is obviously linked with the size 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.830
 of responsibility with the size of 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.080
 the company with the task that one has 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.540
 assigned but also with him as one 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.420
 carries out those responsibilities as 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.520
 one does those tasks assigned then 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.890
 it's a two-sided coin in what I 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.830
 I do and what they recognize me 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.090
 and I do believe and especially in this case 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.160
 If you allow me, I'm going to talk to you 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.530
 little bit of women because women 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.759
 we are the ones that least well negotiate the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.439
 time to agree on salaries 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.140
 and from time to time you have to prepare 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.250
 well to be able to approach and ask 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.260
 when a performance evaluation 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.739
 when is the right time to 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.930
 think about asking for an increase and here's 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.909
 to do it and ask how the best 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.099
 way to do it in this company one does not 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.930
 can be sent to ask or ask for a 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.360
 I pay a salary raise like this because 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.129
 yes out of the blue but with a good plan 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.239
 done and we've done a videoblog before 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.010
 that's what they can look for in the 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.730
 library 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.769
 and prepare with that the idea is to have the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.230
 sure of knowing what we are doing 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.010
 more so that they pay us more than we are 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.420
 contributing better to earn that 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.250
 increase or that we are making a 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.750
 significant difference that we are 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.049
 really a strategic resource with the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.870
 company to deserve to be paid what 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.299
 which is fair and better remember if one 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.099
 it's a talent there's a fight for talents 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.659
 now if one truly of the 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.819
 good of those who have better attitude 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.409
 of those who contribute the most is the moment 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.200
 to think if they are paying us just enough 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.730
 and approach the company and have a 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.099
 frank comparsa with them in good 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.989
 terms because one owes to himself 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:23.049
 know if they are being paid just enough 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.049
 I leave with the idea and good luck thanks
