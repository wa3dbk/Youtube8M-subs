protect myself so I gathered the shark's
head<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.539> my<00:01:00.690> fingers<00:01:01.230> trying<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030

Zoo looking at the lion cages that I

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.680 
Zoo looking at the lion cages that I
came<00:03:15.900> up<00:03:16.110> with<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.470> idea<00:03:16.920> I'll<00:03:17.820> make<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.209> cage

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
came up with the idea I'll make a cage

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.050 
came up with the idea I'll make a cage
I'll<00:03:19.470> lower<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.920> over<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> side<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.760> boat

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
I'll lower it over the side of the boat

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.690 
I'll lower it over the side of the boat
in<00:03:21.600> an<00:03:21.870> area<00:03:22.230> where<00:03:22.500> his<00:03:22.680> great<00:03:23.130> big<00:03:23.370> great

white sharks have it and I'll have a

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.580 
white sharks have it and I'll have a
look<00:03:26.130> for<00:03:26.310> myself<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.239> see<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.690> want<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.110> go

look for myself to see if I want to go

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.009 
look for myself to see if I want to go
diving<00:03:28.890> again<00:03:29.280> because<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.910> love<00:03:30.150> diving<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:30.989> I

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
diving again because I love diving but I

diving again because I love diving but I
was<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.650> scared

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
was really scared

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.199 
was really scared
we<00:03:33.750> made<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.170> first<00:03:34.350> cage<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.519> on<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.940> first

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
we made the first cage and on that first

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.500 
we made the first cage and on that first
expedition<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.260> know<00:03:37.890> 48<00:03:38.370> years<00:03:38.820> ago

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510

made the first great white shot films
even<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:43.049> first<00:03:43.290> time<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.860> put<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
even that first time that you put the

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.339 
even that first time that you put the
cage<00:03:44.310> in<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.549> water<00:03:44.760> did<00:03:45.599> that<00:03:45.750> cure<00:03:46.170> your

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
cage in the water did that cure your

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.569 
cage in the water did that cure your
fear<00:03:47.209> not<00:03:48.209> really<00:03:48.720> at<00:03:48.900> all<00:03:49.049> it<00:03:49.500> helped<00:03:49.980> the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
fear not really at all it helped the

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.390 
fear not really at all it helped the
first<00:03:50.849> shot<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.209> came<00:03:52.069> really<00:03:53.069> looked<00:03:53.280> like

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
first shot that came really looked like

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.690 
first shot that came really looked like
a<00:03:53.549> small<00:03:53.909> submarine<00:03:54.840> or<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.379> deadly<00:03:55.950> front

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
a small submarine or the deadly front

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.080 
a small submarine or the deadly front
Tom's<00:03:57.090> like<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.599> not<00:03:58.170> torpedoes<00:03:58.890> with<00:03:59.250> teeth<00:03:59.519> we

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
Tom's like a not torpedoes with teeth we

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.300 
Tom's like a not torpedoes with teeth we
thought<00:04:00.329> maybe<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.959> Sharks<00:04:01.349> were<00:04:01.530> interested

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
thought maybe the Sharks were interested

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.210 
thought maybe the Sharks were interested
in<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.610> people<00:04:03.000> inside<00:04:03.650> but<00:04:04.650> then<00:04:04.829> we<00:04:04.980> found

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
in the people inside but then we found

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.130 
in the people inside but then we found
that<00:04:05.430> they<00:04:05.819> would<00:04:06.000> come<00:04:06.209> up<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.480> bite<00:04:06.720> on<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
that they would come up and bite on the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.319 
that they would come up and bite on the
cage<00:04:07.409> even<00:04:07.859> when<00:04:08.459> there<00:04:08.609> was<00:04:08.700> no<00:04:08.819> one<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.180> it

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
cage even when there was no one in it

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.149 
cage even when there was no one in it
and<00:04:09.629> what<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:09.989> ended<00:04:10.319> up<00:04:10.409> finding<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.890> was<00:04:11.010> the

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
and what we ended up finding it was the

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.610 
and what we ended up finding it was the
electrolysis<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:12.750> was<00:04:12.930> set<00:04:13.140> out<00:04:13.170> by<00:04:13.560> the

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
electrolysis that was set out by the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.180 
electrolysis that was set out by the
saltwater<00:04:14.190> on<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.879> steel<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:16.289> attracted

understand that we need them in our

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
a real relief and I found it wasn't as
