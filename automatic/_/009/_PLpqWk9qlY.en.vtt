scroll up here it's showing us that this

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.680 
scroll up here it's showing us that this
particular<00:02:49.080> motherboard<00:02:49.860> has<00:02:50.430> 4<00:02:51.330> memory

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
particular motherboard has 4 memory

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.040 
particular motherboard has 4 memory
slots<00:02:52.280> often<00:02:53.280> referred<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.640> as<00:02:54.030> DIMM<00:02:54.330> slots<00:02:54.360> or

memory that you can install and use in
your<00:03:25.860> computer<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:27.299> let's<00:03:27.510> say<00:03:27.690> we<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:28.019> a

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
your computer so let's say we have a

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.470 
your computer so let's say we have a
motherboard<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:29.190> has<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.400> limit<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.820> 32

gigabytes of memory that can be
installed<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.000> let's<00:03:33.720> say<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:34.110> use<00:03:34.140> in

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
installed and let's say we use in

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.090 
installed and let's say we use in
Windows<00:03:35.370> 7<00:03:35.640> home<00:03:36.150> premium<00:03:36.180> 64-bit<00:03:37.100> version

Windows 7 home premium 64-bit version

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.960 
Windows 7 home premium 64-bit version
which<00:03:39.030> has<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> limit<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.840> 16<00:03:40.650> gigabytes<00:03:41.160> in

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
which has a limit of 16 gigabytes in

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.050 
which has a limit of 16 gigabytes in
that<00:03:42.209> case<00:03:42.450> 16<00:03:43.440> gigabytes<00:03:44.010> would<00:03:44.430> be<00:03:44.610> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
that case 16 gigabytes would be the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.090 
that case 16 gigabytes would be the
maximum<00:03:45.540> amount<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.959> memory<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.920> can

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
maximum amount of memory that you can

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.840 
maximum amount of memory that you can
install<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.880> use<00:03:48.360> in<00:03:48.720> your<00:03:49.080> computer<00:03:49.850> so

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
install and use in your computer so

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.400 
install and use in your computer so
that's<00:03:51.060> one<00:03:51.299> way<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.630> finding<00:03:51.870> out<00:03:52.170> your

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
that's one way of finding out your

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.860 
that's one way of finding out your
computer's<00:03:52.920> memory<00:03:53.100> limit<00:03:53.610> another<00:03:54.480> way<00:03:54.660> is

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
computer's memory limit another way is

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.289 
computer's memory limit another way is
to<00:03:54.900> use<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.290> memory<00:03:55.739> scanner<00:03:56.010> such<00:03:56.790> as<00:03:57.000> crucial

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
to use a memory scanner such as crucial

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:06.740 
to use a memory scanner such as crucial
memory<00:03:58.110> scanner<00:03:59.030> so<00:04:00.030> let's<00:04:00.209> click<00:04:00.540> on<00:04:00.720> memory

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.020 

this<00:04:07.750> scanner<00:04:08.080> can<00:04:08.380> scan<00:04:08.710> your<00:04:08.890> computer<00:04:09.040> and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
this scanner can scan your computer and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.790 
this scanner can scan your computer and
will<00:04:10.270> then<00:04:10.480> tell<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.780> your<00:04:11.290> computer's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
will then tell you your computer's

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.240 
will then tell you your computer's
memory<00:04:12.040> limit<00:04:12.580> it<00:04:13.480> will<00:04:13.510> also<00:04:13.930> show<00:04:14.140> you

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
memory limit it will also show you

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.410 
memory limit it will also show you
