just want to go over some of the few
changes<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.809> made<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.230> game<00:00:10.469> before

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
changes that we made to the game before

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.310 
changes that we made to the game before
we<00:00:10.920> released<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.599> then<00:00:12.599> also<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.139> couple

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
we released and then also just a couple

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.220 
we released and then also just a couple
of<00:00:13.590> things<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.370> thought<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.700> did<00:00:14.849> well<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.540> some

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
of things I thought we did well and some

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.109 
of things I thought we did well and some
of<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> things<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:17.640> need<00:00:17.789> some

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
of the things that we need some

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.109 
of the things that we need some
improvement<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:19.369> some<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.640> know<00:00:20.699> something

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
improvement on some you know something

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.900 
improvement on some you know something
to<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.990> get<00:00:22.109> us<00:00:22.230> started<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> next<00:00:23.010> game<00:00:23.189> so

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to to get us started in the next game so

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.120 
to to get us started in the next game so
right<00:00:24.060> away<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.529> very<00:00:25.800> very

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
right away we have a we have very very

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.089 
right away we have a we have very very
bare-bones<00:00:26.750> main<00:00:27.750> menu<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.830> could

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
bare-bones main menu this could

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.060 
bare-bones main menu this could
obviously<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.699> improved<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
obviously be improved I like the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.090 
obviously be improved I like the
parallax<00:00:32.700> effect<00:00:33.210> from<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.780> from<00:00:34.710> one<00:00:34.890> area

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
parallax effect from one from one area

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.830 
parallax effect from one from one area
to<00:00:35.250> another<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.910> something<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.300> we

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to another that's something that we

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.250 
to another that's something that we
might<00:00:37.050> bring<00:00:37.860> back<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.399> something<00:00:39.270> later<00:00:39.480> we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
might bring back and something later we

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.819 
might bring back and something later we
added<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.950> tutorial<00:00:41.700> button<00:00:42.530> just<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> give<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
added a tutorial button just to give a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.450 
added a tutorial button just to give a
quick<00:00:44.579> overview<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.660> how<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> play<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> game

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
quick overview of how to play the game

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.979 
quick overview of how to play the game
this<00:00:47.460> could<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> lot<00:00:47.940> better<00:00:48.120> I'm<00:00:48.570> really

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
this could be a lot better I'm really

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.680 
this could be a lot better I'm really
not<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> big<00:00:49.649> fan<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.980> having<00:00:50.399> these<00:00:50.690> slideshow

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
not a big fan of having these slideshow

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.160 
not a big fan of having these slideshow
types<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.350> tutorials<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:54.930> better

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
types of tutorials I think a much better

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
types of tutorials I think a much better
way<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> tutorial<00:00:55.829> would<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
way to do a tutorial would be to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.830 
way to do a tutorial would be to
integrate<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> gameplay<00:00:58.440> itself<00:00:59.840> so

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
integrate it into the gameplay itself so

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.479 
integrate it into the gameplay itself so
that's<00:01:00.870> something<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> keep<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> mind<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:02.100> we

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that's something to keep in mind as we

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.660 
that's something to keep in mind as we
move<00:01:02.699> forward<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:05.150> going<00:01:06.150> into<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> game<00:01:07.670> we

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
move forward and going into the game we

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.750 
move forward and going into the game we
have<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.500> Tower<00:01:10.740> spire<00:01:11.189> here

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
have a we have a little Tower spire here

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.160 
have a we have a little Tower spire here
fire<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> spire<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:13.650> indicates<00:01:14.220> where<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
fire a spire that indicates where the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.539 
fire a spire that indicates where the
enemies<00:01:16.170> are<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.740> traveling<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
enemies are going to be traveling to I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.910 
enemies are going to be traveling to I
would<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.150> liked<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.799> something<00:01:19.799> over

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
would have liked to have something over

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460 
would have liked to have something over
in<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.369> corner<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:21.150> show<00:01:21.360> where<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> enemies

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
in this corner to show where the enemies

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.550 
in this corner to show where the enemies
are<00:01:22.500> spawning<00:01:23.009> from<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.810> didn't<00:01:25.080> we

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
are spawning from but we didn't we

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
are spawning from but we didn't we
didn't<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.040> didn't<00:01:26.280> really<00:01:26.369> find<00:01:26.640> any<00:01:26.880> graphics

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
didn't I didn't really find any graphics

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240 
didn't I didn't really find any graphics
that<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.689> liked<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.040> see

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that I liked for that and you see

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.179 
that I liked for that and you see
whenever<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.670> enemies<00:01:29.970> die<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:32.070> have

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
whenever these enemies die that you have

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.330 
whenever these enemies die that you have
a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.520> plus<00:01:33.150> two<00:01:33.390> plus<00:01:33.420> two<00:01:33.860> these<00:01:34.860> spiders

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
a little plus two plus two these spiders

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
a little plus two plus two these spiders
should<00:01:35.670> give<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> plus<00:01:36.720> three<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.259> that's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
should give you a plus three so that's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.690 
should give you a plus three so that's
it's<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:37.829> scaling<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.790> did<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> lot<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:40.700> lot

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it's all scaling we did a lot of a lot

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.730 
it's all scaling we did a lot of a lot
of<00:01:41.790> balancing<00:01:42.360> before<00:01:42.720> released<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> make

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
of balancing before released it to make

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069 
of balancing before released it to make
sure<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:45.180> too<00:01:45.420> easy<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.750> too

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
sure that it was not too easy not too

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.249 
sure that it was not too easy not too
hard<00:01:48.619> let's<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:50.220> liked<00:01:50.460> this

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
hard let's see I really liked this

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.389 
hard let's see I really liked this
graphical<00:01:52.259> interface<00:01:53.180> minus<00:01:54.180> ones<00:01:54.649> i<00:01:55.649> like

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
graphical interface minus ones i like

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.620 
graphical interface minus ones i like
that<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.570> get<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.280> what<00:01:59.390> wave<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that the you get to see what wave is

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389 
that the you get to see what wave is
coming<00:02:00.689> up<00:02:01.049> next<00:02:01.229> through<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.250> very

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
coming up next through this it's very

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.310 
coming up next through this it's very
colorful<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.509> also<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.899> pretty<00:02:04.079> good<00:02:04.170> idea

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
colorful you also get a pretty good idea

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.169 
colorful you also get a pretty good idea
of<00:02:05.180> what<00:02:06.180> towers<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.200> select<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
of what towers you have to select and

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.570 
of what towers you have to select and
also<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.929> an<00:02:10.020> options<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.920> send<00:02:11.430> waves

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
also you know an options and send waves

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.119 
also you know an options and send waves
button<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.239> think<00:02:12.780> we're<00:02:12.900> integrated<00:02:13.379> pretty

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
button I think we're integrated pretty

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.910 
button I think we're integrated pretty
nicely<00:02:14.690> options<00:02:15.690> could<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> few<00:02:16.739> more

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
nicely options could have a few more

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.119 
nicely options could have a few more
things<00:02:17.160> on<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.489> but<00:02:17.670> that's<00:02:18.120> okay<00:02:18.920> one<00:02:19.920> thing

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
things on it but that's okay one thing

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.160 
things on it but that's okay one thing
that<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.370> think<00:02:20.879> would<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.180> been<00:02:21.660> better<00:02:21.930> is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that I think would have been better is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.140 
that I think would have been better is
if<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.470> could<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.920> displayed<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.640> stats<00:02:23.940> of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
if we could have displayed the stats of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.640 
if we could have displayed the stats of
the<00:02:24.300> turrets<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.810> know<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> name<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.470> what

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
the turrets you know a name of what

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.970 
the turrets you know a name of what
these<00:02:25.830> upgrades<00:02:26.069> do<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:28.290> what<00:02:28.470> they<00:02:28.590> are<00:02:28.770> and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
these upgrades do of what they are and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.070 
these upgrades do of what they are and
what<00:02:29.099> they<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:30.540> would<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.780> been<00:02:30.870> good

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
what they do that would have been good

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.280 
what they do that would have been good
we<00:02:31.920> had<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.129> lot<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.910> confusion<00:02:33.330> whenever<00:02:33.750> we

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
we had a lot of confusion whenever we

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.229 
we had a lot of confusion whenever we
showed<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.769> people<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:36.120> know<00:02:36.209> they

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
showed this to people you know they

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.440 
showed this to people you know they
didn't<00:02:36.629> know<00:02:37.310> what<00:02:38.310> these<00:02:38.459> what<00:02:38.940> these<00:02:39.090> towers

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
didn't know what these what these towers

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.210 
didn't know what these what these towers
could<00:02:39.629> do<00:02:39.840> or<00:02:40.140> or<00:02:40.470> anything<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:44.190> it's

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
could do or or anything so it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.930 
could do or or anything so it's
something<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.760> consider<00:02:45.650> we<00:02:46.650> need<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:47.010> somehow

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
something to consider we need to somehow

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.839 
something to consider we need to somehow
display<00:02:48.480> information<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.290> user<00:02:49.519> in<00:02:50.519> a

we'll try to answer that and we also
have<00:03:15.599> our<00:03:16.140> source<00:03:16.560> code<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.220> game<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:18.780> get

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
have our source code to this game on get

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.140 
have our source code to this game on get
so<00:03:19.890> i'll<00:03:20.010> have<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.250> link<00:03:20.489> down<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
look at that and browse through what we

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.990 
look at that and browse through what we
have<00:03:25.879> and<00:03:27.830> so<00:03:28.830> we're<00:03:29.010> going<00:03:29.159> to<00:03:29.280> be<00:03:29.430> starting<00:03:29.819> a

Rails similar to starfox it's going to

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.190 
Rails similar to starfox it's going to
be<00:03:34.830> targeted<00:03:35.220> at<00:03:35.519> mobile<00:03:36.360> devices<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.959> this

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
be targeted at mobile devices like this

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.630 
be targeted at mobile devices like this
one<00:03:37.379> but<00:03:38.299> instead<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.540> using<00:03:40.129> controllers<00:03:41.129> you

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
one but instead of using controllers you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.550 
one but instead of using controllers you
know<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> controller<00:03:42.269> like<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.750> little<00:03:43.319> joystick

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
know a controller like a little joystick

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.800 
know a controller like a little joystick
over<00:03:44.069> here<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.430> control<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.629> ship

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
over here to control the the ship

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.589 
over here to control the the ship
movement<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:46.739> plan<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.190> using<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:48.090> gyroscope

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
movement we plan on using the gyroscope

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.839 
movement we plan on using the gyroscope
of<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.840> device<00:03:49.110> in<00:03:49.409> order<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.950> move<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.519> ship

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
of the device in order to move the ship

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.630 
of the device in order to move the ship
left<00:03:51.120> right<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.690> adjust<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.560> altitude<00:03:53.099> so

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
left right and adjust the altitude so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.949 
left right and adjust the altitude so
that's<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.970> that's<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.299> neat<00:03:54.450> feature<00:03:54.629> that<00:03:54.930> I

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
that's a that's a neat feature that I

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.990 
that's a that's a neat feature that I
think<00:03:55.230> could<00:03:55.799> be<00:03:55.950> popular<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.580> it'll

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
think could be popular and it'll

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.820 
think could be popular and it'll
definitely<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.420> fun<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.900> learn<00:03:57.989> how<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.260> do

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
definitely be fun to learn how to do

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.850 
definitely be fun to learn how to do
that<00:03:58.980> with<00:03:59.250> with<00:03:59.819> other<00:03:59.970> other<00:04:00.299> devices<00:04:00.860> so

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
that with with other other devices so

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.890 
that with with other other devices so
like<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.430> said<00:04:02.489> have<00:04:03.180> any<00:04:03.330> questions<00:04:03.750> about
