it's<00:00:07.980> dumb<00:00:14.599> so<00:00:15.599> before<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.990> try<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.470> footed

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
it's dumb so before you try one footed

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.980 
it's dumb so before you try one footed
wall<00:00:17.070> phone<00:00:17.369> flip<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.300> want<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.600> do<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
wall phone flip what you want to do is

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.540 
wall phone flip what you want to do is
make<00:00:19.020> sure<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> front<00:00:20.460> flip

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
make sure that you can do a front flip

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.080 
make sure that you can do a front flip
off<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.020> block<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.619> similar<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.279> Webster<00:00:23.760> just

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
off a block so similar to a Webster just

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.060 
off a block so similar to a Webster just
jumping<00:00:24.510> off<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.930> block<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.350> doing<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
jumping off of the block and doing a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.630 
jumping off of the block and doing a
flip<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.230> very<00:00:28.529> similar<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.369> wall

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
flip this is very similar to the wall

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
flip this is very similar to the wall
front<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.090> that's<00:00:30.269> why<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.480> nice<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.170> have

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
front so that's why it's nice to have

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.729 
front so that's why it's nice to have
that<00:00:31.590> before<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.219> try<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.460> drink<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> for

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that before you try this drink so for

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.100 
that before you try this drink so for
this<00:00:34.860> trick<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> momentum<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.630> really

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
this trick for is momentum is really

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.440 
this trick for is momentum is really
important<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:38.489> you're<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:39.239> to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
important because if you're going to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.180 
important because if you're going to
sell<00:00:39.690> towards<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> wall<00:00:40.379> you're<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:40.980> going

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
sell towards the wall you're not going

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.920 
sell towards the wall you're not going
to<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.370> enough<00:00:41.399> power<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.360> you're<00:00:42.809> not

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
to have enough power and you're not

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
to have enough power and you're not
going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.320> able<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> flip<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.760> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
going to be able to get the flip so you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.100 
going to be able to get the flip so you
want<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.149> make<00:00:45.210> sure<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.660> you're<00:00:45.780> going

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110

medium<00:00:46.739> fast<00:00:47.100> speed<00:00:47.670> towards<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> wall<00:00:48.860> when

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
medium fast speed towards the wall when

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.080 
medium fast speed towards the wall when
you're<00:00:49.980> ready<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.000> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you're ready to do this but what you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.779 
you're ready to do this but what you
want<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:52.230> put<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.649> opposite<00:00:53.309> foot<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
want to do is put your opposite foot a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.760 
want to do is put your opposite foot a
couple<00:00:54.059> feet<00:00:54.570> away<00:00:54.600> from<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> wall<00:00:55.230> about<00:00:55.500> two

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
couple feet away from the wall about two

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.459 
couple feet away from the wall about two
and<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:56.579> your<00:00:56.760> other<00:00:57.030> foot<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.260> wall

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and then your other foot on the wall

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.430 
and then your other foot on the wall
just<00:00:59.070> under<00:00:59.520> waist<00:00:59.820> tight<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.870> reason<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> do

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
just under waist tight the reason you do

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.820 
just under waist tight the reason you do
this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.149> higher<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:04.589> you'll

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this is if you do it higher then you'll

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100 
this is if you do it higher then you'll
drive<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.760> body<00:01:06.030> away<00:01:06.270> from<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> wall

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
drive your body away from the wall

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.899 
drive your body away from the wall
during<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> flip<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.159> they'll<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.490> slower

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
during the flip and they'll be slower

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.140 
during the flip and they'll be slower
you'll<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.400> distance<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.670> no<00:01:11.880> height

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you'll have all distance but no height

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.200 
you'll have all distance but no height
if<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:13.170> put<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.470> too<00:01:13.680> low<00:01:13.760> then<00:01:14.760> you'll<00:01:14.939> get

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
if you put it too low then you'll get

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.149 
if you put it too low then you'll get
too<00:01:15.659> much<00:01:15.900> height<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.619> enough<00:01:16.890> distance

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
too much height and not enough distance

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.520 
too much height and not enough distance
away<00:01:17.490> from<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> wall<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:19.259> feet<00:01:19.500> are

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
away from the wall and your feet are

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.730 
away from the wall and your feet are
going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> click<00:01:20.750> usually<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.680> too

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
going to click usually if you go too

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
going to click usually if you go too
close<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> wall<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.540> you're

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
close to the wall it's because you're

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.530 
close to the wall it's because you're
putting<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.320> foot<00:01:25.650> too<00:01:26.159> low<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.299> trying

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
putting your foot too low so I'm trying

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.609 
putting your foot too low so I'm trying
to<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.650> under<00:01:29.070> waist<00:01:29.369> height<00:01:30.619> so

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to have it just under waist height so

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.010 
to have it just under waist height so
before<00:01:31.950> trying<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> trick<00:01:32.729> practice<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> set

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
before trying to trick practice the set

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.670 
before trying to trick practice the set
up<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.259> couple<00:01:34.470> times<00:01:36.140> jumping<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.320> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
up a couple times jumping up like that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.460 
up a couple times jumping up like that
so<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.329> said<00:01:39.390> put<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:39.930> foot<00:01:40.229> about

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
so just as I said put your foot about

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
so just as I said put your foot about
two<00:01:40.740> feet<00:01:40.920> away<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:42.119> under<00:01:42.479> waist

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
two feet away and just under waist

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.560 
two feet away and just under waist
height<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.320> also<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.490> arms<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:45.090> ready

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
height and also have your arms up ready

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.950 
height and also have your arms up ready
to<00:01:45.780> flip<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.619> practice<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.369> few<00:01:47.490> times

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
to flip so practice that a few times

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.840 
to flip so practice that a few times
make<00:01:48.960> sure<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.619> down<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.280> make

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
make sure you have that down and make

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.999 
make sure you have that down and make
sure<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.270> enough<00:01:51.479> height<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.409> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
sure you get enough height with that so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.300 
sure you get enough height with that so
that<00:01:53.159> you're<00:01:53.310> ready<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.909> actual<00:01:54.210> trick

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.780 
push off of the wall make sure you push
off<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.240> 45<00:02:03.930> degree<00:02:04.140> angle<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:05.399> reason<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
off in a 45 degree angle the reason you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.170 
off in a 45 degree angle the reason you
do<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.810> make

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
do this is to make

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.419 
do this is to make
they<00:02:07.270> get<00:02:07.570> in<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.810> height<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.470> enough<00:02:09.160> distance

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
they get in a height and enough distance

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.000 
they get in a height and enough distance
away<00:02:09.910> from<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.300> wall<00:02:10.570> if<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.500> go<00:02:11.650> too<00:02:11.710> much

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
away from the wall if you go too much

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.770 
away from the wall if you go too much
right<00:02:12.280> then<00:02:12.520> you'll<00:02:12.700> end<00:02:13.000> up<00:02:13.180> clipping<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
right then you'll end up clipping the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.550 
right then you'll end up clipping the
wall<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:15.040> 45<00:02:15.550> degree<00:02:16.060> angle<00:02:16.540> with<00:02:16.750> your<00:02:17.200> arms

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
wall so 45 degree angle with your arms

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.920 
wall so 45 degree angle with your arms
up<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:17.980> then<00:02:18.610> at<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.940> point<00:02:19.060> push<00:02:19.600> as<00:02:19.780> hard

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
up and then at this point push as hard

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.220 
up and then at this point push as hard
as<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.380> can<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.010> then<00:02:21.150> bring<00:02:22.150> your<00:02:22.180> hands<00:02:22.840> to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
as you can and then bring your hands to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.199 
as you can and then bring your hands to
your<00:02:23.260> knees<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.920> treat<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> rest<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.180> a

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
your knees and treat the rest like a

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.870 
your knees and treat the rest like a
front<00:02:25.510> flip<00:02:25.920> some<00:02:26.920> people<00:02:27.250> actually<00:02:27.370> drive

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
front flip some people actually drive

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.210 
front flip some people actually drive
them<00:02:28.120> back<00:02:28.360> leg<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.680> similar<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.040> a

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
them back leg to do it similar to a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.370 
them back leg to do it similar to a
Webster<00:02:30.790> but<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.360> found<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.750> first<00:02:31.930> way<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.200> lot

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
Webster but I found the first way a lot

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.140 
Webster but I found the first way a lot
easier<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:33.040> do<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.340> trick<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.030> lot

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
easier to do the trick and it's a lot

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.070 
easier to do the trick and it's a lot
easier<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.660> learn<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:36.160> once<00:02:36.340> you've<00:02:36.459> jumped<00:02:36.790> up

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
easier to learn so once you've jumped up

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.690 
easier to learn so once you've jumped up
reach<00:02:38.080> up<00:02:38.320> bring<00:02:39.010> your<00:02:39.130> hands<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.550> your<00:02:39.640> knees

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
reach up bring your hands to your knees

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.090 
reach up bring your hands to your knees
the<00:02:40.330> rest<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.720> like<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.900> front<00:02:41.260> flip<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:42.010> you

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
the rest is like a front flip so you

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.190 
the rest is like a front flip so you
just<00:02:42.459> treat<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:42.940> like<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> front<00:02:43.570> flip<00:02:43.660> it's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
just treat it like a front flip it's

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.620 
just treat it like a front flip it's
going<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.410> be<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.560> blind<00:02:44.920> my<00:02:45.160> name<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.970> that

going to be a blind my name so on that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.390 
going to be a blind my name so on that
one<00:02:46.840> it's<00:02:47.020> going<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.260> be<00:02:47.320> very<00:02:47.500> hard<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.010> land

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
one it's going to be very hard to land

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.370 
one it's going to be very hard to land
but<00:02:48.850> with<00:02:49.000> practice<00:02:49.270> you'll<00:02:49.720> be<00:02:49.750> able<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.140> get
