a<00:00:03.210> bird<00:00:03.419> feeder<00:00:03.449> out<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.710> tin<00:00:04.890> can<00:00:05.960> start<00:00:06.960> by

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
a bird feeder out of a tin can start by

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.200 
a bird feeder out of a tin can start by
taking<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.649> full<00:00:07.830> pan<00:00:08.099> then<00:00:08.550> using<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> tin

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
taking a full pan then using a tin

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.299 
taking a full pan then using a tin
opener<00:00:09.300> start<00:00:10.019> taking<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> lid<00:00:10.590> off<00:00:10.620> but<00:00:11.070> stop

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.770 
opener start taking the lid off but stop
when<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.580> get<00:00:11.730> just<00:00:12.000> over<00:00:12.240> halfway<00:00:14.780> next

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
when you get just over halfway next

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.359 
when you get just over halfway next
carefully<00:00:16.199> bend<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> lid<00:00:16.650> out<00:00:16.800> using<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.190> knife

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
carefully bend the lid out using a knife

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.910 
carefully bend the lid out using a knife
and<00:00:17.609> empty<00:00:18.060> out<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> contents<00:00:18.779> I've<00:00:19.529> cut<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
and empty out the contents I've cut the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
and empty out the contents I've cut the
can<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.430> lip<00:00:20.580> stays<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> body<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.510> not

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
can so the lip stays on the body and not

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.220 
can so the lip stays on the body and not
on<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> lid

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
on the lid

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.140 
on the lid
this<00:00:22.500> means<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.949> lid<00:00:23.100> has<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> sharp<00:00:23.580> edge<00:00:23.730> but

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
this means the lid has a sharp edge but

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.870 
this means the lid has a sharp edge but
the<00:00:24.210> body<00:00:24.420> doesn't<00:00:25.099> wash<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the body doesn't wash the can out and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.920 
the body doesn't wash the can out and
you<00:00:26.939> should<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.240> something<00:00:27.449> which<00:00:27.630> looks

you should have something which looks

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.460 
you should have something which looks
like<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:29.359> then<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.599> exactly<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.109> same<00:00:31.140> on

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
like this then do exactly the same on

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.319 
like this then do exactly the same on
the<00:00:31.560> other<00:00:31.590> side<00:00:31.920> making<00:00:32.550> sure<00:00:32.610> both<00:00:33.000> sides

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the other side making sure both sides

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.400 
the other side making sure both sides
match<00:00:35.360> next<00:00:36.360> use<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> pair<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.870> scissors<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
match next use a pair of scissors to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.319 
match next use a pair of scissors to
take<00:00:37.770> off<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> small<00:00:38.340> slice<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> lid<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
take off a small slice from the lid and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.910 
take off a small slice from the lid and
base<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> should<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.440> something<00:00:40.770> which

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
base and you should have something which

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.369 
base and you should have something which
looks<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:44.750> now<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.230> bend

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
looks like this now we're going to bend

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.049 
looks like this now we're going to bend
these<00:00:46.590> bits<00:00:46.800> over<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> inside<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> can

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
these bits over to the inside of the can

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.610 
these bits over to the inside of the can
but<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.629> can't<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.050> push<00:00:49.289> because

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
but you can't just push because

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.529 
but you can't just push because
otherwise<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.070> whole<00:00:50.219> lid<00:00:50.430> flexes<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.390> I'm

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
otherwise the whole lid flexes so I'm

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
otherwise the whole lid flexes so I'm
using<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.020> back<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.379> blunt<00:00:52.620> knife<00:00:52.770> to

using the back of a blunt knife to
support<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> lid<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.850> middle<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.300> one

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
support the lid in the middle from one

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
support the lid in the middle from one
side<00:00:54.719> whilst<00:00:55.260> bending<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.770> over<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.160> my

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this next we need to drill a hole

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.950 
this next we need to drill a hole
roughly<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> middle<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.720> didn't

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
roughly in the middle here if it didn't

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.450 
roughly in the middle here if it didn't
go<00:01:19.020> through<00:01:19.200> both<00:01:19.350> layers<00:01:19.619> clamp<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.340> together

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
go through both layers clamp it together

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.350 
go through both layers clamp it together
with<00:01:20.790> some<00:01:20.939> grips<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.509> try<00:01:21.750> again<00:01:23.150> do<00:01:24.150> both

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
with some grips and try again do both

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.910 
with some grips and try again do both
sides<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.200> should<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.890> then

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
sides and it should look like this then

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
sides and it should look like this then
take<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> piece<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.310> bamboo<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.850> feed<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
take a piece of bamboo and feed it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.289 
take a piece of bamboo and feed it
through<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> holes<00:01:31.579> you<00:01:32.579> could<00:01:32.759> use<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> wooden

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
through the holes you could use a wooden

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.219 
through the holes you could use a wooden
dowel<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.960> maybe<00:01:34.229> even<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.770> pencil<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:36.229> finally

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
dowel or maybe even a pencil and finally

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.219 
dowel or maybe even a pencil and finally
we<00:01:37.590> need<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> drill<00:01:38.040> two<00:01:38.220> holes<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.579> top

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
we need to drill two holes in the top

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.109 
we need to drill two holes in the top
use<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:40.439> grips<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.829> flatten<00:01:41.100> off<00:01:41.189> any<00:01:41.310> burrs

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
use some grips to flatten off any burrs

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.240 
use some grips to flatten off any burrs
then<00:01:43.719> thread<00:01:44.079> some<00:01:44.289> heavy-duty<00:01:44.530> cord<00:01:45.039> through

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
then thread some heavy-duty cord through

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.749 
then thread some heavy-duty cord through
