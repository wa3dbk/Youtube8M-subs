00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.569 
different kind of key high-low high-low
pins<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.519> when<00:02:58.970> we<00:02:59.120> put<00:02:59.360> his<00:02:59.540> key<00:02:59.780> in<00:03:00.579> cylinder

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
pins so when we put his key in cylinder

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.300 
pins so when we put his key in cylinder
will<00:03:01.850> not<00:03:02.000> turn<00:03:02.390> because<00:03:03.100> three<00:03:04.100> of<00:03:04.130> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
will not turn because three of the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.699 
will not turn because three of the
spring-loaded<00:03:04.820> pins<00:03:05.299> are<00:03:05.870> down<00:03:06.200> in<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.500> holes

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
spring-loaded pins are down in the holes

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.920 
spring-loaded pins are down in the holes
preventing<00:03:07.310> us<00:03:07.430> from<00:03:07.459> turning<00:03:07.940> when<00:03:08.480> pin<00:03:08.780> is

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
preventing us from turning when pin is

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.470 
preventing us from turning when pin is
too<00:03:09.110> high<00:03:09.350> one<00:03:09.980> pin<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.760> right<00:03:10.910> height<00:03:11.150> so

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
too high one pin is the right height so

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.770 
too high one pin is the right height so
out<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.500> these<00:03:12.680> pins<00:03:13.070> for<00:03:13.940> our<00:03:14.239> preventing

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
out of all these pins for our preventing

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.150 
out of all these pins for our preventing
the<00:03:14.930> cylinder<00:03:15.350> from<00:03:15.500> rotating

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
the cylinder from rotating

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.849 
the cylinder from rotating
hence<00:03:16.610> some<00:03:17.510> amateur<00:03:17.959> just<00:03:18.200> can't<00:03:18.380> walk<00:03:18.620> in

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
hence some amateur just can't walk in

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.280 
hence some amateur just can't walk in
and<00:03:19.040> break<00:03:19.190> into<00:03:19.459> his<00:03:19.579> house<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.150> what<00:03:21.019> we<00:03:21.140> do

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
and break into his house so what we do

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.050 
and break into his house so what we do
now<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.709> we<00:03:21.920> knock<00:03:22.100> out<00:03:22.280> all<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.609> pins<00:03:22.820> we

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
now is we knock out all the pins we

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.130 
now is we knock out all the pins we
don't<00:03:23.269> like<00:03:25.420> they're<00:03:26.420> all<00:03:26.600> different<00:03:26.810> heights

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
don't like they're all different heights

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.280 
don't like they're all different heights
they're<00:03:28.130> all<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.430> same<00:03:28.459> diameter<00:03:29.000> for<00:03:29.900> this

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
they're all the same diameter for this

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.250 
they're all the same diameter for this
particular<00:03:30.739> kind<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.400> lock<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:32.630> being<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.959> quick

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
particular kind of lock so being a quick

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.090 
particular kind of lock so being a quick
set<00:03:34.480> we<00:03:35.480> start<00:03:35.810> with<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.109> top<00:03:36.350> quick<00:03:36.620> set<00:03:36.829> pin

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
set we start with the top quick set pin

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.080 
set we start with the top quick set pin
first<00:03:37.840> slat<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.079> the<00:03:39.980> cylinder<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.940> key

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
first slat in the cylinder and the key

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.800 
first slat in the cylinder and the key
is<00:03:41.239> deep<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.380> we<00:03:42.410> need<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> long<00:03:42.920> pin<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:44.630> that

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
is deep so we need a long pin so that

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.810 
is deep so we need a long pin so that
when<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.049> key<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.350> in<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.890> pin<00:03:46.070> is<00:03:46.250> flush<00:03:46.400> with

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
when the key is in the pin is flush with

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.560 
when the key is in the pin is flush with
the<00:03:46.970> top<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.570> next<00:03:48.200> pin<00:03:48.530> is<00:03:48.709> real<00:03:48.920> high

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
the top the next pin is real high

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.680 
the top the next pin is real high
probably<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.600> quick<00:03:50.900> set<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.440> pin

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
probably a quick set to pin

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.970 
probably a quick set to pin
we<00:03:53.200> have<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.590> pin<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:55.120> throw<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.480> in<00:03:55.570> there

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
we have a to pin and throw it in there

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.560 
we have a to pin and throw it in there
but<00:03:56.980> it's<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.370> little<00:03:57.610> low<00:03:57.760> we<00:03:58.060> don't<00:03:58.090> like<00:03:58.390> the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
but it's a little low we don't like the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.320 
but it's a little low we don't like the
to<00:03:58.750> pin<00:03:59.020> we<00:03:59.890> put<00:04:00.070> them<00:04:00.160> back<00:04:00.190> we<00:04:00.940> grab<00:04:01.150> the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
to pin we put them back we grab the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.030 
to pin we put them back we grab the
three<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.750> put<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:02.800> in<00:04:02.920> there<00:04:04.770> beautiful<00:04:05.770> thing

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
three to put it in there beautiful thing

okay<00:04:07.570> what's<00:04:07.810> number<00:04:08.110> four<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.590> five<00:04:08.830> look

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
okay what's number four and five look

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.960 
okay what's number four and five look
like<00:04:09.310> four<00:04:09.640> is<00:04:09.760> low<00:04:09.970> fives<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.570> little<00:04:10.810> higher

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
like four is low fives a little higher

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.190 
like four is low fives a little higher
so<00:04:12.970> we<00:04:13.090> take<00:04:13.300> quick<00:04:13.720> set<00:04:15.299> take<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.330> stand<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.080> a

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
so we take quick set take a stand and a

quick set number four move way too low

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.340 
quick set number four move way too low
so<00:04:19.900> go<00:04:20.470> for<00:04:20.709> quick<00:04:20.920> set<00:04:21.160> five<00:04:21.960> but<00:04:22.960> he<00:04:23.170> goes

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
so go for quick set five but he goes

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.860 
so go for quick set five but he goes
into<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.650> five<00:04:23.860> hole<00:04:24.100> pretty<00:04:24.580> nice<00:04:24.760> one<00:04:25.600> more

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
into the five hole pretty nice one more

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.990 
into the five hole pretty nice one more
to<00:04:25.990> go<00:04:26.280> well<00:04:27.280> click<00:04:27.550> set<00:04:27.760> six<00:04:28.060> pin<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:30.000> voila

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
to go well click set six pin and voila

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.330 
to go well click set six pin and voila
our<00:04:31.210> cylinder<00:04:32.140> has<00:04:32.260> now<00:04:32.410> been<00:04:32.620> repend

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
our cylinder has now been repend

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.540 
our cylinder has now been repend
and<00:04:34.150> as<00:04:34.390> we<00:04:34.570> operate<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.830> pins<00:04:36.070> go<00:04:36.280> up<00:04:36.370> and

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
and as we operate it the pins go up and

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.520 
and as we operate it the pins go up and
down<00:04:36.670> spring-loaded<00:04:37.510> pins<00:04:37.900> are<00:04:38.110> up<00:04:38.200> above<00:04:38.470> so

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
down spring-loaded pins are up above so

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.650 
down spring-loaded pins are up above so
when<00:04:38.830> we<00:04:38.950> take<00:04:39.160> this<00:04:39.340> key<00:04:39.580> out<00:04:39.730> five
