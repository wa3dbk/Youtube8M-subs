raspberries<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.240> broken<00:01:51.510> apart

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
raspberries that have just broken apart

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.450 
raspberries that have just broken apart
and<00:01:52.110> I'm<00:01:52.170> using<00:01:52.350> frozen<00:01:52.620> raspberries<00:01:53.280> because

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and I'm using frozen raspberries because

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.610 
and I'm using frozen raspberries because
it's<00:01:53.910> winter<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:55.050> are<00:01:55.200> no<00:01:55.350> fresh

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
it's winter and there are no fresh

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.500 
it's winter and there are no fresh
raspberries<00:01:56.160> available<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.970> store<00:01:57.240> but

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
raspberries available in the store but

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.940 
raspberries available in the store but
it<00:01:57.600> still<00:01:57.780> has<00:01:57.930> an<00:01:58.050> amazing<00:01:58.470> flavor<00:01:58.620> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
it still has an amazing flavor and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.160 
it still has an amazing flavor and
gently<00:01:59.670> fold<00:01:59.700> those<00:02:00.180> ingredients<00:02:00.780> into<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
gently fold those ingredients into the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.320 
gently fold those ingredients into the
batter<00:02:01.350> make<00:02:02.010> sure<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:02.310> don't<00:02:02.430> over<00:02:02.940> mix<00:02:02.970> it

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
batter make sure you don't over mix it

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.090 
batter make sure you don't over mix it
because<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.080> raspberries<00:02:04.680> will<00:02:04.860> kind

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
because then the raspberries will kind

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.650 
because then the raspberries will kind
of<00:02:05.190> disintegrate<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.360> you'll<00:02:06.480> have<00:02:06.600> a

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
of disintegrate so then you'll have a

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.200 
of disintegrate so then you'll have a
pink<00:02:07.050> matter<00:02:07.260> instead<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.460> know<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:08.820> like

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
pink matter instead of you know I like

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.330 
pink matter instead of you know I like
to<00:02:09.240> use<00:02:09.450> an<00:02:09.600> ice<00:02:09.750> cream<00:02:09.780> scoop<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.830> scoop<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
to use an ice cream scoop to scoop the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.400 
to use an ice cream scoop to scoop the
batter<00:02:11.460> onto<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.910> pen<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.780> need<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.050> keep<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
batter onto a pen you need to keep the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.170 
batter onto a pen you need to keep the
pan<00:02:16.650> heating<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.340> stove<00:02:17.460> for<00:02:17.700> quite<00:02:18.150> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
pan heating on the stove for quite a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.910 
pan heating on the stove for quite a
while<00:02:18.420> because<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.840> first<00:02:19.200> two<00:02:19.380> pancakes<00:02:19.620> are

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
while because the first two pancakes are

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.400 
while because the first two pancakes are
always<00:02:20.400> less<00:02:20.640> appealing<00:02:21.330> than<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.720> next<00:02:22.260> two

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
always less appealing than the next two

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.590 
always less appealing than the next two
so<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.860> always<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.400> heat<00:02:23.700> my<00:02:23.730> pen<00:02:24.120> about

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
so I always like to heat my pen about

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.090 
so I always like to heat my pen about
three<00:02:24.960> minutes<00:02:25.260> before<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.650> get<00:02:25.860> started

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100

you're gonna scoop mouths is the batter
onto<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.290> pen<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:28.920> gently<00:02:29.250> spread<00:02:29.640> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
out of it wait until the pancake gets

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.570 
out of it wait until the pancake gets
bubbles<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.470> tops<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.040> once<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.400> see
