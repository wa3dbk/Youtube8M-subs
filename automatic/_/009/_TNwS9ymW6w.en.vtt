in<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:00.510> video<00:00:00.750> I'm<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.920> be<00:00:02.040> going<00:00:02.250> over

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
in this video I'm going to be going over

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.440 
in this video I'm going to be going over
step<00:00:03.510> 27<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.380> one<00:00:04.650> parks<00:00:05.040> shark<00:00:05.490> model<00:00:05.910> from

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
step 27 in one parks shark model from

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.190 
step 27 in one parks shark model from
his<00:00:06.600> book<00:00:06.899> dollar<00:00:07.410> origami<00:00:08.540> so<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.630> begin<00:00:09.900> with

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
his book dollar origami so to begin with

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.379 
his book dollar origami so to begin with
actually<00:00:10.710> I'm<00:00:10.920> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.340> take<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.880> step<00:00:12.179> back

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
actually I'm going to take a step back

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.970 
actually I'm going to take a step back
to<00:00:13.380> step<00:00:14.009> 21<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.910> his<00:00:15.089> book<00:00:15.590> because<00:00:16.590> they're

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
to step 21 in his book because they're

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040 
to step 21 in his book because they're
in<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.369> step<00:00:18.029> we're<00:00:18.240> gonna<00:00:18.330> make<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.810> very

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
in that step we're gonna make a very

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.010 
in that step we're gonna make a very
important<00:00:19.560> crease<00:00:20.210> so<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> way<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
important crease so this is the way the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.340 
important crease so this is the way the
model<00:00:22.350> looks<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.220> beginning<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.900> step<00:00:24.900> 20

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
model looks at the beginning of step 20

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.810 
model looks at the beginning of step 20
and<00:00:26.150> for<00:00:27.150> step<00:00:27.480> 21<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.789> open

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and for step 21 what you do is you open

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.720 
and for step 21 what you do is you open
this<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:31.019> open<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> model<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.219> we

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this you open the model up and we

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.330 
this you open the model up and we
already<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.630> crease<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
already have this crease here in the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.209 
already have this crease here in the
model<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.260> what<00:00:37.260> we're<00:00:37.410> supposed<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
model and what we're supposed to do is

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.840 
model and what we're supposed to do is
do<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> pleat<00:00:39.120> where<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.540> put<00:00:40.219> this<00:00:41.219> crease<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
do a pleat where you put this crease in

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.720 
do a pleat where you put this crease in
the<00:00:42.480> model<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.190> what's<00:00:44.340> important

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the model like this and what's important

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.930 
the model like this and what's important
about<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.719> don't<00:00:46.050> crease

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
about this is that you don't crease

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.080 
about this is that you don't crease
these<00:00:47.940> fins<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:50.100> pleat

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
these fins and so you just do a pleat

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
these fins and so you just do a pleat
that<00:00:51.480> looks<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:53.129> we're

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that looks like this and then we're

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.470 
that looks like this and then we're
gonna<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.610> ahead<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.910> skip<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.399> step<00:00:56.789> 27

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
gonna go ahead and skip to up to step 27

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.810 
gonna go ahead and skip to up to step 27
or<00:00:58.260> I'll<00:00:58.440> I'll<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.160> through<00:00:59.399> what<00:00:59.520> we're<00:00:59.670> gonna

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
or I'll I'll go through what we're gonna

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.880 
or I'll I'll go through what we're gonna
do<00:01:00.059> there<00:01:02.539> okay<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.409> what<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.680> look

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
do there okay so this is what we look

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.580 
do there okay so this is what we look
like<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.299> end<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.659> stuff<00:01:06.869> 26<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
like at the end of stuff 26 the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.210 
like at the end of stuff 26 the
beginning<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.960> 27<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.590> I've<00:01:10.710> done<00:01:10.979> is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
beginning of 27 and what I've done is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.960 
beginning of 27 and what I've done is
I've<00:01:11.430> drawn<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:14.159> folds<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.700> we're<00:01:14.850> gonna

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
I've drawn in the folds that we're gonna

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.080 
I've drawn in the folds that we're gonna
be<00:01:15.210> doing<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:16.290> solid<00:01:16.920> line<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
be doing this solid line is just the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.030 
be doing this solid line is just the
crease<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.659> there<00:01:19.080> we're<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.830> actually

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
crease that's there we're not actually

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.460 
crease that's there we're not actually
going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.460> using<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.689> particular<00:01:22.020> crease

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
going to be using that particular crease

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.980 
going to be using that particular crease
what<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.210> crease<00:01:24.600> where<00:01:24.869> we

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
what we have is this crease where we

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.890 
what we have is this crease where we
made<00:01:25.200> about<00:01:25.770> pleat<00:01:26.159> fold<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:27.659> we're<00:01:27.780> gonna

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
made about pleat fold and we're gonna

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
made about pleat fold and we're gonna
make<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> mountain<00:01:28.650> fold<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.670> is

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
make that a mountain fold and this is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.510 
make that a mountain fold and this is
going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> mountain<00:01:30.570> fold<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.520> we're

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
going to be a mountain fold and we're

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.420 
going to be a mountain fold and we're
gonna<00:01:32.670> fold<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.110> well<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.710> I'll<00:01:35.250> show

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
gonna fold this in as well and I'll show

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.460 
gonna fold this in as well and I'll show
you<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.759> when<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.350> we're

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you that when we get there so what we're

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.770 
you that when we get there so what we're
gonna<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.979> we're<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> fold<00:01:38.490> this

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
gonna do is we're going to fold this

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.700 
gonna do is we're going to fold this
like<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:40.400> this<00:01:41.400> part<00:01:41.729> back<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.710> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
like this now this part back here it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.139 
like this now this part back here it's
really<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.100> important<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.579> happens<00:01:44.939> here

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
really not important what happens here

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.780 
really not important what happens here
because<00:01:45.560> once<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> few<00:01:47.250> steps<00:01:47.490> then

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
because once we do a few steps then

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.960 
because once we do a few steps then
we're<00:01:48.000> gonna<00:01:48.149> go<00:01:48.390> back<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:49.759> folding<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
we're gonna go back to folding of the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.289 
we're gonna go back to folding of the
model<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.450> way<00:01:52.549> with<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.000> wonderful

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
model this way with all that wonderful

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.980 
model this way with all that wonderful
fold<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.430> at<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.700> point<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.090> time<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.570> doesn't

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
fold so at this point in time it doesn't

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.429 
fold so at this point in time it doesn't
really<00:01:58.200> matter<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:58.950> happens<00:01:59.340> back<00:01:59.579> here<00:02:00.439> but

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
really matter what happens back here but

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.389 
really matter what happens back here but
what<00:02:01.590> we're<00:02:01.770> gonna<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.100> we're<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.990 
what we're gonna do is we're going to
fold<00:02:02.579> this

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
fold this

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.440 
fold this
long<00:02:04.330> fold<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:06.400> we're<00:02:06.490> going<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.640> fold<00:02:06.850> these

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
long fold and we're going to fold these

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
long fold and we're going to fold these
as<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.080> mountain<00:02:08.679> fold<00:02:09.090> ignoring<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.390> crease

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
as a mountain fold ignoring this crease

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.920 
as a mountain fold ignoring this crease
here<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.930> do<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.290> we're<00:02:15.130> just<00:02:15.160> gonna

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
here and as we do it we're just gonna

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.570 
here and as we do it we're just gonna
push<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:19.110> collapse<00:02:20.110> like<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.580> so

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
push this in and collapse like that so

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.140 
push this in and collapse like that so
that's<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.030> way<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.620> model<00:02:23.980> looks<00:02:24.010> at<00:02:24.700> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
that's the way the model looks at the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.060 
that's the way the model looks at the
beginning<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:25.660> step<00:02:25.870> 28<00:02:26.290> again<00:02:26.650> I'll<00:02:26.800> show<00:02:27.010> you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
beginning of step 28 again I'll show you

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.940 
beginning of step 28 again I'll show you
that<00:02:29.280> we're<00:02:30.280> here<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.740> we're<00:02:32.740> just

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
that we're here like this and we're just

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.670 
that we're here like this and we're just
gonna<00:02:33.070> go<00:02:33.310> ahead<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.080> instructions

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
gonna go ahead and in the instructions

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.470 
gonna go ahead and in the instructions
that<00:02:35.770> says<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.250> pop<00:02:36.550> this<00:02:36.760> point<00:02:37.090> up<00:02:39.480> making

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
that says to pop this point up making

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.670 
that says to pop this point up making
this<00:02:40.780> an<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.200> mountain<00:02:41.680> fold<00:02:43.110> mount<00:02:44.110> fold<00:02:44.470> on

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
this an a mountain fold mount fold on

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.250 
this an a mountain fold mount fold on
these<00:02:46.350> folds<00:02:47.350> ignoring<00:02:48.660> these<00:02:49.660> creases<00:02:50.080> that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
these folds ignoring these creases that

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.550 
these folds ignoring these creases that
are<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.010> paper<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:52.110> as<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.260> do<00:02:53.410> that

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
are in the paper and as you do that

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.000 
are in the paper and as you do that
you're<00:02:53.770> just<00:02:53.950> gonna<00:02:54.040> push<00:02:54.400> this<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:55.770> like<00:02:56.770> that

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
you're just gonna push this in like that

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.660 
you're just gonna push this in like that
and<00:02:57.510> that's<00:02:58.510> how<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.750> get<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.050> step<00:02:59.410> 28<00:02:59.860> next

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
and that's how you get to step 28 next

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.470 
and that's how you get to step 28 next
up<00:03:00.760> 28<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.950> where<00:03:02.950> you're<00:03:03.400> supposed<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.880> fold

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
up 28 is where you're supposed to fold

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.460 
up 28 is where you're supposed to fold
this<00:03:04.690> down<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.380> make<00:03:05.920> that<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:07.170> open-sink<00:03:08.170> and

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
this down and make that a open-sink and

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.990 
this down and make that a open-sink and
I'll<00:03:08.890> be<00:03:09.040> honest<00:03:09.340> with<00:03:09.489> you<00:03:09.610> at<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:09.880> point

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
I'll be honest with you at this point

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.420 
I'll be honest with you at this point
that<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.810> less<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.350> an<00:03:11.470> open<00:03:11.739> sink<00:03:11.980> than<00:03:12.220> sort

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
that is less of an open sink than sort

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.600 
that is less of an open sink than sort
of<00:03:12.489> an<00:03:12.610> open<00:03:12.730> smush<00:03:13.570> on<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:15.010> dollar<00:03:15.250> that's

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
of an open smush on the dollar that's

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.170 
of an open smush on the dollar that's
really<00:03:16.209> small<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.400> said<00:03:18.640> because

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
really small and like I said because

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.030 
really small and like I said because
more<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.660> smush<00:03:20.110> than<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.470> sink<00:03:20.830> but<00:03:23.040> that's

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
more of a smush than a sink but that's

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.740 
more of a smush than a sink but that's
for<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.280> next<00:03:24.310> step<00:03:24.670> but<00:03:25.150> there<00:03:25.299> you<00:03:25.390> go

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
for the next step but there you go

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.650 
for the next step but there you go
step<00:03:26.170> twenty-seven
