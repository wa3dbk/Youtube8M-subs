00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
steering wheel apart I've discovered

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
steering wheel apart I've discovered
what<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> dealer<00:01:23.490> did<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.240> mechanic<00:01:24.630> did

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.609 
this
simply<00:01:25.799> put<00:01:28.159> pieces<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.280> hard<00:01:30.259> card<00:01:31.259> looks

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
simply put pieces of hard card looks

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.920 
simply put pieces of hard card looks
like<00:01:31.710> probably<00:01:32.280> cereal<00:01:32.820> box<00:01:33.110> card<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:35.930> in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
like probably cereal box card I think in

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.999 
like probably cereal box card I think in
order<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:38.540> raise<00:01:39.540> these<00:01:39.960> very<00:01:40.470> very<00:01:40.710> slightly

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
order to raise these very very slightly

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.289 
order to raise these very very slightly
the<00:01:41.790> end<00:01:41.909> result<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:43.790> you<00:01:44.790> eliminate<00:01:45.149> all

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the end result is you eliminate all

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.530 
the end result is you eliminate all
issues<00:01:46.130> when<00:01:47.130> using<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> horn<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:48.149> far<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
issues when using the horn as far as it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.030 
issues when using the horn as far as it
not<00:01:48.720> giving<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:51.509> contact<00:01:52.040> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
not giving you that that contact so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.520 
not giving you that that contact so
that's<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> modification<00:01:53.880> I've<00:01:54.780> had<00:01:55.049> 14

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
