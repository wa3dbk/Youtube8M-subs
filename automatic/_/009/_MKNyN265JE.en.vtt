00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970 

ok<00:00:00.900> guys<00:00:02.090> so<00:00:03.090> we've<00:00:03.360> done<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.980> gravity

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
ok guys so we've done the gravity

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.690 
ok guys so we've done the gravity
powered<00:00:05.370> car<00:00:06.950> so<00:00:07.950> now<00:00:08.220> we're<00:00:08.370> going<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> take

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
powered car so now we're going to take

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.530 
powered car so now we're going to take
that<00:00:08.910> apart<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:10.309> i<00:00:12.230> think<00:00:13.230> i<00:00:13.469> might<00:00:13.799> make<00:00:14.040> a

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
that apart and i think i might make a

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.810 
that apart and i think i might make a
mousetrap<00:00:15.540> car<00:00:16.730> i've<00:00:17.730> used<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.480> before

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
mousetrap car i've used this one before

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.120 
mousetrap car i've used this one before
but<00:00:21.470> hopefully<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.560> still<00:00:22.740> works<00:00:23.010> ok<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> let's

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
but hopefully it still works ok so let's

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:36.170 
but hopefully it still works ok so let's
take<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.550> apart<00:00:31.189> make<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.399> most<00:00:32.940> trap<00:00:35.180> just

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
take this apart make the most trap just

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.369 
take this apart make the most trap just
about<00:00:36.390> there<00:00:36.630> somewhere<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.899> line<00:00:43.110> goes

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
about there somewhere so the line goes

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:53.779 
about there somewhere so the line goes
round<00:00:43.649> their<00:00:44.040> books<00:00:44.760> ran<00:00:45.030> back<00:00:45.300> axle<00:00:52.789> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
round their books ran back axle and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
round their books ran back axle and
we'll<00:00:53.940> try<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> doesn't<00:00:55.800> go

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
we'll try it like that if it doesn't go

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.490 
we'll try it like that if it doesn't go
very<00:00:55.980> far<00:00:56.250> i'll<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> extended<00:00:57.809> arm<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
very far i'll put a extended arm on it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.520 
very far i'll put a extended arm on it
but<00:00:58.890> i'll<00:00:59.010> try<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.780> simple<00:01:01.230> fix

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
but i'll try it just the simple fix

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.770 
but i'll try it just the simple fix
first<00:01:04.460> before<00:01:05.460> i<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.880> i<00:01:06.150> think<00:01:06.450> i<00:01:06.659> might

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
first before i do that i think i might

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.210 
first before i do that i think i might
just<00:01:06.840> take<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.409> spit<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> center

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
just take this spit out to the center

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
just take this spit out to the center
here<00:01:12.979> that's<00:01:13.979> got<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> magnet<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
here that's got a magnet in it and that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.530 
here that's got a magnet in it and that
helps<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.189> drive<00:01:17.189> locate<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.500> DVD<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:19.860> CD

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
helps the drive locate that DVD or CD

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.070 
helps the drive locate that DVD or CD
when<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.869> place<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:23.420> don't<00:01:24.420> need<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.780> there

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
when it's in place I don't need it there

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.810 
when it's in place I don't need it there
and<00:01:25.380> I'll<00:01:25.500> take<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.100> cuz<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.430> might<00:01:26.610> use

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and I'll take it out cuz I might use

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.649 
and I'll take it out cuz I might use
that<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.180> something<00:01:27.210> else<00:01:27.570> later<00:01:28.640> okay<00:01:29.659> glue

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that for something else later okay glue

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:49.760 
that for something else later okay glue
on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> mousetrap

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.650 

if<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:50.920> wanted<00:01:51.250> this<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.760> last<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:52.180> long<00:01:52.300> time<00:01:52.360> I

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
if I wanted this to last a long time I

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.270 
if I wanted this to last a long time I
put<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.080> couple<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.410> nuts<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.770> bolts<00:01:53.920> through

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
put a couple of nuts and bolts through

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.180 
put a couple of nuts and bolts through
there<00:01:55.650> this<00:01:56.650> is<00:01:56.770> only<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.100> quick<00:01:57.400> temporary<00:01:58.120> job

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190

there this is only a quick temporary job
I'm<00:02:00.190> just<00:02:00.460> hot<00:02:00.700> glue<00:02:00.729> in<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.410> because<00:02:02.410> I've

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
I'm just hot glue in it because I've

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.410 
I'm just hot glue in it because I've
used<00:02:02.830> this<00:02:02.979> mouse<00:02:03.250> trap<00:02:03.520> before<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:04.090> already

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
used this mouse trap before it's already

used this mouse trap before it's already
got<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.600> bit<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.840> fishing<00:02:05.200> line<00:02:05.560> tied<00:02:06.550> round<00:02:06.790> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
got a bit of fishing line tied round the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.070 
got a bit of fishing line tied round the
arm<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.930> it's<00:02:08.200> just<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.560> right<00:02:08.709> length<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.630> go

around my hook peg in the back axle wind
up<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> back<00:02:16.270> axle

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:43.260 

I<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:38.530> release<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.880> going<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.090> work

okay just a matter of how far it

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.810 
okay just a matter of how far it
freewheels<00:02:46.960> so<00:02:47.950> we'll<00:02:48.190> take<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.490> down<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
freewheels so we'll take it down to the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.020 
freewheels so we'll take it down to the
kitchen<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.300> try<00:02:49.600> out<00:02:50.460> just<00:02:51.460> before<00:02:51.580> we<00:02:51.820> go

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
kitchen and try out just before we go

kitchen and try out just before we go
that's<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.110> bit<00:02:53.290> I've<00:02:53.410> taken<00:02:53.680> out<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:53.950> the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
that's a bit I've taken out of the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.420 
that's a bit I've taken out of the
middle<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:55.840> got<00:02:55.960> a<00:02:55.990> little<00:02:56.310> magnet<00:02:57.310> in

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
middle so it's got a little magnet in

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.640 
middle so it's got a little magnet in
there<00:02:57.610> that's<00:02:57.820> worth<00:02:57.970> knowing<00:02:58.390> about<00:03:01.650> might

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
there that's worth knowing about might

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.450 
there that's worth knowing about might
be<00:03:02.770> useful<00:03:02.890> for<00:03:03.130> something<00:03:03.430> else<00:03:05.460> right

the<00:03:11.980> mousetrap<00:03:13.140> DVD<00:03:14.140> Drive<00:03:15.270> we're<00:03:16.270> in<00:03:16.390> my

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
the mousetrap DVD Drive we're in my

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.020 
the mousetrap DVD Drive we're in my
kitchen<00:03:16.810> I'm<00:03:17.290> afraid<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.860> washing<00:03:18.640> machines

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
kitchen I'm afraid the washing machines

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.550 
kitchen I'm afraid the washing machines
on<00:03:19.270> so<00:03:19.480> there's<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.690> bit<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.810> background<00:03:20.080> noise

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
on so there's a bit of background noise

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:33.000 
on so there's a bit of background noise
okay<00:03:25.170> fishing<00:03:26.170> line<00:03:31.260> around<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.380> peg<00:03:32.680> on<00:03:32.890> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
okay fishing line around the peg on the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:46.380 
okay fishing line around the peg on the
back<00:03:33.160> axle<00:03:44.310> wind<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.550> up<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.940> could<00:03:46.270> have

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
back axle wind it up I could have

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.190 
back axle wind it up I could have
rounded<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.140> surfaces<00:03:47.739> off<00:03:48.930> just<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.020> make<00:03:50.170> it

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
rounded the surfaces off just to make it

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:58.920 
rounded the surfaces off just to make it
a<00:03:50.350> little<00:03:50.470> bit<00:03:51.239> better<00:03:57.630> springing<00:03:58.630> this<00:03:58.750> on

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
a little bit better springing this on

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.160 
a little bit better springing this on
the<00:03:59.610> on<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.670> fishing<00:04:01.420> line<00:04:01.570> is<00:04:01.750> trying<00:04:02.110> to

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
the on the fishing line is trying to

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.490 
the on the fishing line is trying to
drive<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.650> car<00:04:02.860> forwards<00:04:03.370> anyway<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.290> think

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
drive the car forwards anyway so I think

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.340 
drive the car forwards anyway so I think
I'll<00:04:05.800> do<00:04:06.010> rather<00:04:06.250> than<00:04:06.430> use<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.350> release

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
I'll do rather than use the release

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:23.800 
I'll do rather than use the release
mechanism<00:04:08.580> I'll<00:04:09.580> just<00:04:09.880> hold<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.270> in<00:04:10.420> place

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.600 

there<00:04:24.810> we<00:04:24.900> go<00:04:25.940> five<00:04:26.940> weeks<00:04:27.210> is<00:04:27.450> in<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.660> kitchen

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
there we go five weeks is in the kitchen

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.250 
there we go five weeks is in the kitchen
it<00:04:29.610> had<00:04:29.790> just<00:04:30.210> ran<00:04:30.510> out<00:04:30.630> of<00:04:30.660> energy<00:04:30.870> by<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
it had just ran out of energy by the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.920 
it had just ran out of energy by the
time<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.530> got<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.950> end<00:04:32.100> there<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.750> might

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
time I got to the end there so it might

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.350 
time I got to the end there so it might
have<00:04:34.110> been<00:04:34.200> improved<00:04:34.650> if<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:35.010> put<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.360> longer

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
have been improved if I put a longer

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.620 
have been improved if I put a longer
lever<00:04:36.570> arm<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.200> it<00:04:37.670> but<00:04:38.670> I'm<00:04:38.760> not<00:04:38.940> going<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.270> I

lever arm on it but I'm not going to I

lever arm on it but I'm not going to I
was<00:04:40.110> good<00:04:40.260> enough<00:04:40.440> for<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.860> demonstration

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
was good enough for the demonstration

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
probably go better if I had CDs because

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.510 
probably go better if I had CDs because

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
the back axle and when you let it go

the back axle and when you let it go
that<00:05:24.660> spins<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.260> back<00:05:25.410> axle<00:05:30.410> can't<00:05:31.410> get<00:05:31.530> much

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
that spins the back axle can't get much

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.140 
that spins the back axle can't get much
simpler<00:05:32.070> than<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:33.920> if<00:05:34.920> I<00:05:35.310> wanted<00:05:35.670> to<00:05:35.730> improve

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
simpler than that if I wanted to improve

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.380 
simpler than that if I wanted to improve
this<00:05:36.620> mousetrap<00:05:37.620> car<00:05:37.890> i'll<00:05:38.820> definitely

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
this mousetrap car i'll definitely

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.540 
this mousetrap car i'll definitely
change<00:05:39.690> these<00:05:39.990> wooden<00:05:40.590> wheels<00:05:40.860> back<00:05:41.280> to

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
change these wooden wheels back to

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.600 
change these wooden wheels back to
normal<00:05:41.970> cds<00:05:42.920> because<00:05:43.920> these<00:05:44.070> are<00:05:44.220> a<00:05:44.280> bit<00:05:44.400> heavy

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
normal cds because these are a bit heavy

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.690 
normal cds because these are a bit heavy
and<00:05:46.310> i<00:05:47.310> might<00:05:47.910> put<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.300> longer<00:05:48.950> lever<00:05:49.950> arm<00:05:50.340> on

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
and i might put a longer lever arm on

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.190 
and i might put a longer lever arm on
here<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.420> give<00:05:51.540> us<00:05:51.630> a<00:05:51.720> little<00:05:51.810> bit<00:05:51.990> more

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
here to give us a little bit more

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.850 
here to give us a little bit more
distance<00:05:54.890> because<00:05:55.890> that<00:05:57.350> that<00:05:58.350> is<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:58.620> total

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
distance because that that is the total

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.110 
distance because that that is the total
length<00:05:59.220> of<00:05:59.490> the<00:05:59.960> fishing<00:06:00.960> line<00:06:01.140> and<00:06:01.880> in<00:06:02.880> fact

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
length of the fishing line and in fact

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.070 
length of the fishing line and in fact
only<00:06:03.330> about<00:06:05.060> half<00:06:06.060> of<00:06:06.300> that<00:06:06.450> actually<00:06:06.750> goes

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
only about half of that actually goes

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.230 
only about half of that actually goes
round<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:07.410> back<00:06:07.560> axle<00:06:07.910> because<00:06:08.910> you've<00:06:09.030> still

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
round the back axle because you've still

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.270 
round the back axle because you've still
got<00:06:09.390> quite<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.750> length<00:06:10.530> there<00:06:10.920> that's<00:06:11.130> not

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
got quite a length there that's not

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.790 
got quite a length there that's not
being<00:06:11.490> used<00:06:12.800> so<00:06:14.150> what's<00:06:15.150> that<00:06:15.240> about<00:06:15.800> three

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
being used so what's that about three

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.540 
being used so what's that about three
inches<00:06:17.280> of<00:06:18.080> movement<00:06:19.160> whereas<00:06:20.160> if<00:06:20.310> you<00:06:20.370> put<00:06:20.520> a

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
inches of movement whereas if you put a

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.450 
inches of movement whereas if you put a
longer<00:06:20.970> lever<00:06:21.150> arm<00:06:21.540> on<00:06:21.750> it<00:06:21.870> you<00:06:22.050> could<00:06:22.340> have<00:06:23.340> as

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
longer lever arm on it you could have as

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.679 
longer lever arm on it you could have as
much<00:06:23.640> as<00:06:23.820> you<00:06:23.940> like<00:06:24.120> up<00:06:24.840> to<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.229> limit<00:06:25.350> of

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
much as you like up to the limit of

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.820 
much as you like up to the limit of
strength<00:06:26.019> of<00:06:26.199> the<00:06:26.289> most<00:06:26.469> trap<00:06:28.349> right<00:06:29.349> I<00:06:29.409> hadn't

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
strength of the most trap right I hadn't

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.439 
strength of the most trap right I hadn't
really<00:06:30.189> intended<00:06:30.669> to<00:06:30.669> do<00:06:30.969> this<00:06:31.179> but<00:06:31.419> I

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
really intended to do this but I

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.659 
really intended to do this but I
couldn't<00:06:31.749> resist<00:06:31.989> it<00:06:32.229> I've<00:06:33.009> pinched<00:06:33.489> some

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
couldn't resist it I've pinched some

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.969 
couldn't resist it I've pinched some
wheels<00:06:33.939> off<00:06:34.419> one<00:06:34.869> of<00:06:34.899> my<00:06:34.989> other<00:06:35.169> car<00:06:35.499> so<00:06:35.889> I've

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
wheels off one of my other car so I've

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:42.689 
wheels off one of my other car so I've
got<00:06:36.129> some<00:06:36.309> CDs<00:06:36.759> now<00:06:39.809> the<00:06:40.809> axles<00:06:41.349> are<00:06:41.949> bicycle

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
got some CDs now the axles are bicycle

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.729 
got some CDs now the axles are bicycle
spokes<00:06:43.029> so<00:06:43.329> that<00:06:43.479> nice<00:06:43.629> and<00:06:43.869> thin<00:06:44.169> so<00:06:44.529> we<00:06:44.619> got

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:44.739 
spokes so that nice and thin so we got

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:48.959 
spokes so that nice and thin so we got
low<00:06:44.949> friction<00:06:45.309> on<00:06:45.699> the<00:06:46.169> bearings<00:06:47.519> on<00:06:48.519> the<00:06:48.819> back

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:48.969 
low friction on the bearings on the back

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.259 
low friction on the bearings on the back
axle<00:06:49.239> that's<00:06:49.869> actually<00:06:50.079> a<00:06:50.379> pencil<00:06:51.039> that<00:06:51.999> the

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:52.269 
axle that's actually a pencil that the

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:55.079 
axle that's actually a pencil that the
lead<00:06:52.809> has<00:06:53.139> slipped<00:06:53.949> out<00:06:54.219> of<00:06:54.429> so<00:06:54.669> it's<00:06:54.819> a<00:06:54.879> hollow

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.089 
lead has slipped out of so it's a hollow

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:58.919 
lead has slipped out of so it's a hollow
pencil<00:06:55.779> so<00:06:56.649> I<00:06:56.679> just<00:06:56.919> hot<00:06:57.159> glued<00:06:57.459> that<00:06:57.839> over<00:06:58.839> the

00:06:58.919 --> 00:06:58.929 
pencil so I just hot glued that over the

00:06:58.929 --> 00:07:00.929 
pencil so I just hot glued that over the
back<00:06:59.079> axle<00:06:59.319> to<00:07:00.129> give<00:07:00.279> us<00:07:00.369> a<00:07:00.429> bit<00:07:00.550> of<00:07:00.610> extra

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:00.939 
back axle to give us a bit of extra

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:40.140 
back axle to give us a bit of extra
thickness<00:07:01.860> so<00:07:02.860> we'll<00:07:03.249> see<00:07:03.459> how<00:07:03.489> this<00:07:03.669> goes<00:07:32.009> ok

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.150 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.750 

as<00:07:41.150> you<00:07:41.360> can<00:07:41.510> see<00:07:42.460> significantly<00:07:43.460> faster

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:43.760 
as you can see significantly faster

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.980 
as you can see significantly faster
acceleration<00:07:44.389> and<00:07:46.240> lovely<00:07:47.240> freewheeling

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:47.990 
acceleration and lovely freewheeling

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.260 
acceleration and lovely freewheeling
capability<00:07:48.740> you<00:07:49.250> see<00:07:49.490> it's<00:07:49.639> just<00:07:49.700> rolled<00:07:50.060> all

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270 
capability you see it's just rolled all

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.750 
capability you see it's just rolled all
the<00:07:50.300> way<00:07:50.510> back<00:07:50.889> just<00:07:51.889> on<00:07:52.130> the<00:07:52.250> strength<00:07:52.460> of

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:52.760 
the way back just on the strength of

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.280 
the way back just on the strength of
hitting<00:07:53.120> the<00:07:53.240> wall<00:07:53.389> at<00:07:53.600> the<00:07:53.690> end<00:07:53.840> there<00:07:54.110> and

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:54.290 
hitting the wall at the end there and

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.270 
hitting the wall at the end there and
bouncing<00:07:54.770> back<00:07:56.110> so<00:07:57.110> if<00:07:57.770> you<00:07:57.919> want<00:07:58.070> a<00:07:58.130> really

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 
bouncing back so if you want a really

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.980 
bouncing back so if you want a really
good<00:07:59.500> mousetrap<00:08:00.500> car<00:08:01.030> the<00:08:02.030> treasure<00:08:02.330> trick

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:02.990 
good mousetrap car the treasure trick

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:09.370 
good mousetrap car the treasure trick
there<00:08:04.000> is<00:08:05.000> the<00:08:06.430> bicycle<00:08:07.430> spoke<00:08:07.930> axles<00:08:08.930> because

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:09.380 
there is the bicycle spoke axles because

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.800 
there is the bicycle spoke axles because
that's<00:08:09.560> reduce<00:08:09.919> the<00:08:10.220> friction<00:08:10.570> significantly

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:13.810 

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.090 

and<00:08:14.810> I<00:08:14.900> didn't<00:08:15.200> even<00:08:15.290> need<00:08:15.470> to<00:08:15.680> put<00:08:15.800> a<00:08:15.830> long

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:16.100 
and I didn't even need to put a long

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.000 
and I didn't even need to put a long
