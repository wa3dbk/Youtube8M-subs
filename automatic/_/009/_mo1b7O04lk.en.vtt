00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.260
 it's like taking care of our hair 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.390
 it deals so much with the products that we 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.040
 we apply means I already have the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.610
 open ends and now I wear 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.380
 apply me a repair shampoo or a 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.410
 restorative cream is not so much about 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.360
 that but also of the careful care is 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.480
 tell how we treat our hair 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.310
 like everything you have to spoil it and our 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.580
 hair we have to encourage him from where 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.620
 from where we started to say that there 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.350
 to take care of our hair what is the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.420
 principle what is the base from where 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.910
 we have to start taking care of that hair 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.239
 so grow strong, grow well 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.990
 apart from the feeding is very very 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.940
 important how we wash it seems 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.550
 a bullshit but a lot of us 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.260
 we do not know how to wash our hair but 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.750
 Here I am to tell you how there is 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.520
 do it step 1 we should always 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.240
 brush our hair before 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.310
 wash us what 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.189
 a gentle brushing and as always 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.259
 starting from ends to root a little bit 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.840
 little once inside the view of the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.340
 wta we have already soaked well our 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.329
 hair is to say our hair is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.460
 completely in water we pass to the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.530
 shampoo let's apply this first 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.539
 layer but in such a way that we what 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.619
 we apply in the hand and once what 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.259
 we have in hand we're going 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.220
 Applying for different areas of the leather 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.040
 scalp side whiskers zone 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.280
 higher 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.380
 back area is to say our never and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.330
 to finish our crown we put 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.570
 there the fingers with a little bit of 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.880
 soap and we started soaping through 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.950
 circles in case we are missing 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.710
 water we take a little water to 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.170
 drive well and get that foam that 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.380
 is going to make it drag all of our 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.890
 society is very important that we know 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.380
 that dirt is mainly us 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.220
 remains on the scalp in the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.440
 tips 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.660
 we do not have basic dirt to 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.370
 practically the foam that is going 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.230
 creating on our scalp that 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.010
 it's really where we have our sebum 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.690
 what is it that needs to be cleaned when 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.790
 go dragging all the hair goes 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.020
 to go removing all the amount of 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:46.040
 crap that has remaining hair 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.920
 step 4 if necessary we can apply 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.209
 a second layer of shampoo in this 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.490
 second shampoo that we are going to use 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.460
 less quantity 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.980
 to review and completely remove everything 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.060
 It will not be necessary when the hair is not 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.160
 very dirty step number 5 this this is a 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.500
 very important and very key part and it is 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.240
 to be clarified very well the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.490
 shampoo if in sapu it is not right 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.950
 rinse is not removed dirt 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.950
 therefore it is very important to retire 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.960
 very very well the shampoo and clarify it very 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.590
 well when we know they are there is 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.770
 completely removed when we play the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.960
 texture of our wet hair and wet 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.810
 at the time of playing it is a bit like 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.870
 I 'm not really the keyword but 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.760
 as well as ace but there is no 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.670
 soft is rough because that's what 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.040
 really all the shampoo has been removed 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.540
 go to number 6 this is another of the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.970
 steps very very important and you have two 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.590
 functions that is first save and 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.440
 second that really does its function 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.490
 which is to nourish our hair we are going to 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.340
 to drain all the water to 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.540
 Take advantage of mask or softener according to 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.550
 what we 're leaving we 'll apply and 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.820
 for this it serves so that 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.970
 let's waste the product and so the hair 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.340
 it absorbs all the product that 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.870
 need we will explain it to me no no no 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.239
 I am going to say things without further 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.520
 I will give you a reasoning and have your 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.940
 common sense I do not know if you have hair 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.140
 soaked with water and you apply 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.210
 softener mask that is even more 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.120
 slippery the only stations that are 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.380
 you fall the product is regarding the hair 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.900
 What he is doing is that he goes through 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.090
 fall over 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.190
 so it is very important to drain the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.400
 hair so that when we apply the 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.449
 product remains there already adhered to 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.030
 its function 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.690
 now it's time for the waiting minutes that we 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.669
 tell the manufacturer me in these minutes 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.880
 which are usually 23 minutes according to the 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:58.229
 manufacturer already I say I usually take advantage of 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.889
 to wash all my leather my leather 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.050
 in leather not to wash everything in my body 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.940
 and when I have softener or in the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.870
 mask put on I take advantage of those 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.610
 minutes apart from washing my body 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.440
 I also take advantage of brushing no no no 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.860
 do not sign but to comb melo not with a 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.660
 comb me even with your fingers we are going to 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.080
 happen to clarify perfectly the 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:26.280
 softener or mask that we have left 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.440
 the hair that gives pleasure to touch it and nothing 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.729
 we clarify well well well well well and 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.309
 we drain our hair again 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.259
 good technique to drain our hair 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:39.349
 our hair is no mop 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:42.439
 no afro is no rag no 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:46.219
 a cloth none of that our hair 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:48.800
 you have to look at it a hair when 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.949
 we have wet hair what we have 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.499
 what to do apart through pressure let's go 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:58.279
 dripping down this must be the 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:06:00.080
 movement and that's it until you go 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:03.349
 curious if it is necessary to do it two three 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.649
 Sometimes it becomes what is fatal is 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.809
 we got itf and like that and over and we run off 

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:11.389

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.649
 I marry the hair outdoors I always 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.090
