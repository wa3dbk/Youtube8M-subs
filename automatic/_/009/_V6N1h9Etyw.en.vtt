in he threw a knife at her he threw a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.419 
in he threw a knife at her he threw a
knife<00:02:05.909> at<00:02:06.090> her<00:02:06.180> missed<00:02:06.420> missed<00:02:07.200> yes<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.069> so

knife at her missed missed yes and so

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.550 
knife at her missed missed yes and so
that's<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.629> expect<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.110> get<00:02:10.229> stabbed

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
that's you have to expect to get stabbed
