 the fbi heine can understand forces 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.280
 occult extraterrestrial life nobody has 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.280

 well this time casar hard to pass 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.640
 behind all that I could of course 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.290
 seydoux finally we remember it 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.460
 agreed for the most with the most 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.830
 it's finally the most equal the least 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.000
 equals much more so we will navigate 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.740
 carine galli then carine galli it's 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.020
 good because it's a bit new 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.330
 in your profession gilbert the presentation 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.650
 is she is there it's very human 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.750
 weekend she started with a huge 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.400
 info a huge info because we 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.320
 all thought that even more had 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.080
 bought the exclusive TV rights from the 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.470
 league 1 for big Sunday match 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.720
 evening 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.130
 and well no karina a scoop om monaco 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.050
 it's the shock of tomorrow to say 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:10.150
 obviously in full on eurosport 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.800
 so that's integrating the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.220
 problem is that I look at 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.930
 Eurosport 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.930
 I saw stock hours 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.290
 not too big for a con what 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.910
 I dropped my channel subscription 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.640
 express the package eurosport 2 we telly 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.650
 so here it is a little disgusted I 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.030
 missed the game but overall good 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.770
 seems like it was a nice match in 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.030
 more at a little disgusted since and 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.480
 especially carine galli spoke about it 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.100
 that she surely has eurosport and the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.170
 channel version and she says something 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.560
 really, of course jean marc it's 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.390
 Monaco 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.310
 we remind that manu river has marked 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.260
 his 5th goal after 15 days 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.550
 he assures me they see the river 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:04:00.290
 walk on the water this one is hyper 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:01.670
 ballet but I'm afraid it's not in 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.020
 this show not by the way ah no not 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.160

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.790
 evening with carine galli in tuggen 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:15.560
 has for now anyway 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:16.730
 inchallah it goes very well ago when 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.160
 even a boy we talked a lot about 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.760
 what gregory van der wiel likes 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.530

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.660
 so he passed it said that people are going 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.830
 no football culture and players and we 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.479
 there is a phrase that is often said in 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.580
 football is the pass withdrawn his 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.050
 absolute tears so good him he has 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.210
 understood it's just tell him it's 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.850
 in the opposing area and not 80 meters 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.390
 of the goal because on the 28 because he 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.680
 did 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.270
 he made 28 of them from the dish of 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.440

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:13.319

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.610

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.020
