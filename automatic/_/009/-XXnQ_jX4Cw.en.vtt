00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
for example you could use glitter glue

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
for example you could use glitter glue
you<00:01:20.909> would<00:01:21.030> want<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.240> squeeze<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.049> then

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you would want to squeeze it on and then

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.960 
you would want to squeeze it on and then
just<00:01:22.409> dab<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.650> around<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.310> finger<00:01:23.700> and

just dab it around with your finger and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.179 
just dab it around with your finger and
once<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.540> dried<00:01:24.930> you'd<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> clear<00:01:25.860> bottom

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
once it dried you'd have a clear bottom

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.280 
once it dried you'd have a clear bottom
but<00:01:26.430> with<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:26.700> speckles<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.390> glitter<00:01:28.049> so

the<00:01:55.240> bender<00:01:55.570> ruse<00:01:55.720> because<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.590> don't<00:01:56.740> have<00:01:56.830> to

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
the bender ruse because I don't have to

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.220 
the bender ruse because I don't have to
commit<00:01:57.160> long<00:01:57.400> term<00:01:57.640> but<00:01:58.420> they<00:01:58.630> still<00:01:58.930> serve

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
commit long term but they still serve

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.480 
commit long term but they still serve
the<00:01:59.260> purpose<00:01:59.680> of<00:01:59.740> keeping<00:01:59.920> things<00:02:00.220> in<00:02:00.340> place

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
the purpose of keeping things in place

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.370 
the purpose of keeping things in place
so<00:02:01.420> I'm<00:02:01.480> basically<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:01.840> going<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.170> line<00:02:02.350> it

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
so I'm basically just going to line it

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.320 
so I'm basically just going to line it
but<00:02:02.620> not<00:02:02.830> too<00:02:03.070> deep<00:02:03.310> because<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.970> do<00:02:04.030> want<00:02:04.240> my

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
but not too deep because I do want my
