00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
open up the video file all would do was

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.650

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
import it to sony vegas boy who do was

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.880 
import it to sony vegas boy who do was
it<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.779> would<00:00:21.930> say<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.289> wasn't<00:00:22.560> compatible

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
it just would say that wasn't compatible

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.009 
it just would say that wasn't compatible
so<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:23.880> these<00:00:24.029> codecs<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.570> now<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.869> works

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
so I got these codecs and now it works

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.390 
so I got these codecs and now it works
in<00:00:25.230> everything<00:00:25.590> which<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.859> really<00:00:26.099> good<00:00:26.279> I'm

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
in everything which is really good I'm

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.189 
in everything which is really good I'm
definitely<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:26.910> relieved<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.990> did

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
definitely really relieved and I did

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.230 
definitely really relieved and I did
promise<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.619> after<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.189> silence<00:00:29.640> g80<00:00:29.939> more

I<00:00:30.269> think<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.660> almost<00:00:30.779> hit<00:00:30.990> 500<00:00:31.560> likes<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.859> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
I think we almost hit 500 likes on that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
I think we almost hit 500 likes on that
video<00:00:32.189> which<00:00:32.340> was<00:00:32.489> insane<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.120> that's<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
video which was insane and that's the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.000 
video which was insane and that's the
reason<00:00:33.840> why<00:00:33.989> I've<00:00:34.110> been<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.260> motivated<00:00:34.559> to

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
that high school I'll be able to get a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.300 
that high school I'll be able to get a
college<00:02:09.869> scholarship<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.709> fairly

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
college scholarship it is fairly

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.160 
college scholarship it is fairly
expensive<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.270> high<00:02:12.390> school<00:02:12.660> but

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
expensive to go to that high school but

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.790 
expensive to go to that high school but
