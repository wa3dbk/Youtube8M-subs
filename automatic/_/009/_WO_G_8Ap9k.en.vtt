00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
roast for another minute or so because I

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.089 
roast for another minute or so because I
don't<00:02:09.599> want<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.840> roast<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.560> adjoin<00:02:10.890> for<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
don't want to roast the adjoin for a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.130 
don't want to roast the adjoin for a
longer<00:02:11.400> time<00:02:11.580> turns<00:02:12.180> little<00:02:12.720> bit

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
longer time turns little bit

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.340 
longer time turns little bit
so<00:02:13.910> roasted<00:02:14.910> for<00:02:15.090> another<00:02:15.360> minute<00:02:15.600> becomes

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
so roasted for another minute becomes

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.580 
so roasted for another minute becomes
nice<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.950> warm<00:02:17.160> all<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.750> oils<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.380> the

and of course I meant lots of them

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.300 
and of course I meant lots of them
citric<00:02:54.239> acid<00:02:54.600> crystals<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.680> definitely<00:02:56.190> get

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
citric acid crystals you definitely get

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.699 
citric acid crystals you definitely get
citric<00:02:56.700> acid<00:02:57.000> crystals<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.780> market<00:02:58.110> but

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
citric acid crystals in the market but

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.010 
citric acid crystals in the market but
if<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.980> don't<00:02:59.190> get<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.790> also<00:03:00.030> take<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.870> name

of nimbu fool when you tell me more food
that<00:03:04.140> acetic<00:03:04.980> acid<00:03:05.310> some<00:03:05.850> people<00:03:06.120> don't<00:03:06.330> know

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
that acetic acid some people don't know

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.210 
that acetic acid some people don't know
it<00:03:06.630> as<00:03:06.810> citric<00:03:07.320> acid<00:03:07.620> they<00:03:07.800> know<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.070> as

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
it as citric acid they know it as

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.510 
it as citric acid they know it as
neighbor<00:03:08.640> food<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.950> all<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
neighbor food so that is it and all the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:37.600 

now<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:23.939> this<00:03:24.379> grind<00:03:25.379> it<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> fine<00:03:25.799> powder

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.570 

let's<00:03:38.610> check<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.300> up<00:03:39.480> Wow<00:03:40.250> look<00:03:41.250> at<00:03:41.370> this

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
let's check this up Wow look at this

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:50.890 
let's check this up Wow look at this
what<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.600> Luis<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:44.210> pass<00:03:45.210> it<00:03:45.420> through<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.690> sieve

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.990 

and<00:03:51.900> actually<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:53.010> sieves<00:03:53.280> are<00:03:53.550> graded

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
and actually the sieves are graded

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.700 
and actually the sieves are graded
differently<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.570> know<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.840> finer<00:03:55.080> ones<00:03:55.380> have

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
differently you know the finer ones have

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.580 
differently you know the finer ones have
a<00:03:55.770> different<00:03:56.190> grade<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:57.180> pores<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:58.350> sieves

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
a different grade the pores the sieves

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.200 
a different grade the pores the sieves
that<00:03:58.830> have<00:03:58.950> larger<00:03:59.280> pores<00:03:59.310> have<00:03:59.760> different

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
that have larger pores have different

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.660 
that have larger pores have different
grades<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:00.960> this<00:04:01.140> is<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.440> generic<00:04:01.890> sieve<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.610> I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
grades so this is a generic sieve that I

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.760 
grades so this is a generic sieve that I
am<00:04:02.760> using<00:04:02.970> which<00:04:03.270> we<00:04:03.420> all<00:04:03.570> use<00:04:03.600> at<00:04:03.960> home<00:04:04.200> that

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
am using which we all use at home that

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.070 
am using which we all use at home that
is<00:04:04.890> what<00:04:05.010> I'm<00:04:05.130> using<00:04:05.370> here<00:04:05.490> now<00:04:06.300> once<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:06.780> see

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
is what I'm using here now once you see

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.020 
is what I'm using here now once you see
if<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.850> some<00:04:08.850> dry<00:04:09.090> mango<00:04:09.330> powder<00:04:09.480> in<00:04:09.900> this

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
if this is some dry mango powder in this

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.530 
if this is some dry mango powder in this
now<00:04:12.030> whatever<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.540> left<00:04:13.130> kind<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.310> again<00:04:14.610> Wow

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
now whatever is left kind it again Wow

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.070 
now whatever is left kind it again Wow
