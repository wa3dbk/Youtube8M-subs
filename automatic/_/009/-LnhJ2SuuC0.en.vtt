get a little bit more healing perhaps a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
get a little bit more healing perhaps a
little<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.320> duration<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.210> baffling

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
little bit more duration on a baffling

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.530 
little bit more duration on a baffling
like<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.860> there<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:22.979> also<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.640> profession

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
like that there was also a profession

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.020

specific<00:01:25.140> attribute<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:27.000> here

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
specific attribute as we can see up here

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
specific attribute as we can see up here
for<00:01:27.869> example<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.560> warrior<00:01:28.890> had<00:01:29.070> strength<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
for example the warrior had strength so

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.330 
for example the warrior had strength so
this<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.090> unique<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.659> warrior<00:01:30.960> class<00:01:31.340> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
this was unique to the warrior class and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.530 
this was unique to the warrior class and
basically<00:01:32.579> by<00:01:32.729> putting<00:01:33.000> points<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.299> this

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
basically by putting points into this

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.810 
basically by putting points into this
you<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:35.009> buff<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.490> would<00:01:35.640> add

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
you got a little buff that would add

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.340 
you got a little buff that would add
armor<00:01:36.119> penetration<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.750> your<00:01:37.049> attacks

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
armor penetration on your attacks

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.719 
armor penetration on your attacks
depending<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.799> how<00:01:37.920> many<00:01:37.979> points<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.430> had<00:01:38.610> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
depending on how many points you had in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.380 
depending on how many points you had in

the distribution of attributes is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.530 
the distribution of attributes is

yeah that interplay is going to be going
to<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.569> really<00:02:15.840> interesting<00:02:16.230> actually<00:02:16.349> I'm

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
to be really interesting actually I'm

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.640 
to be really interesting actually I'm
really<00:02:16.890> keen<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.190> see<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.450> anyway<00:02:18.750> over

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
really keen to see that so anyway over

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.470 
really keen to see that so anyway over
here<00:02:19.860> we've<00:02:20.160> got<00:02:20.190> some<00:02:20.640> attributes<00:02:21.180> so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
here we've got some attributes so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.360 
here we've got some attributes so
basically<00:02:21.840> Inca<00:02:22.260> wants<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.590> you've<00:02:22.890> got<00:02:23.190> this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
basically Inca wants to you've got this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.460 
basically Inca wants to you've got this
attribute<00:02:24.330> system<00:02:24.630> broken<00:02:24.989> down<00:02:25.170> into

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
attribute system broken down into

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.199 
attribute system broken down into
primary<00:02:25.950> attributes<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.610> secondary

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
primary attributes and secondary

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.780 
primary attributes and secondary
attributes<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:29.130> terms<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.459> primary

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
attributes so in terms of primary

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.240 
attributes so in terms of primary
attributes<00:02:30.209> these<00:02:30.690> are<00:02:31.019> sort<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.440> basic<00:02:31.920> sort

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
attributes these are sort of basic sort

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.500 
attributes these are sort of basic sort
of<00:02:32.310> structures<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.819> your<00:02:32.940> character<00:02:33.330> that's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
of structures of your character that's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.360 
of structures of your character that's
like<00:02:33.720> how<00:02:33.840> much<00:02:33.989> damage<00:02:34.230> how<00:02:34.980> much<00:02:35.069> health

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
like how much damage how much health

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.100 
like how much damage how much health
they're<00:02:35.519> going<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.870> these<00:02:37.019> are

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
they're going to have and these are

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.080 
they're going to have and these are
going<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> level<00:02:37.530> up<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:38.130> level<00:02:38.310> up<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:38.849> if

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
going to level up as you level up so if

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.400 
going to level up as you level up so if
you<00:02:39.180> go<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.450> wiki<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.959> can<00:02:40.110> notice<00:02:40.380> here

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you go on the wiki you can notice here

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.860 
you go on the wiki you can notice here
that<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.920> says<00:02:41.030> once<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.120> reach<00:02:42.239> level<00:02:42.269> 80<00:02:42.690> you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
that it says once you reach level 80 you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.509 
that it says once you reach level 80 you
will<00:02:42.989> have<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.170> total<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.709> nine<00:02:43.800> hundred<00:02:44.489> and

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
will have a total of nine hundred and

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.890 
will have a total of nine hundred and
sixteen<00:02:44.940> points<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.510> each<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.810> these

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
sixteen points in each of these

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.770 
sixteen points in each of these
attributes<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:47.370> these<00:02:47.580> attributes<00:02:47.880> you're

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
attributes so these attributes you're

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.240 
attributes so these attributes you're
going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.959> see<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.410> they<00:02:49.530> increase<00:02:49.980> at<00:02:50.220> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
going to see that they increase at a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.130 
going to see that they increase at a
similar<00:02:50.610> rate<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:51.060> each<00:02:51.180> other<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.959> only

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
similar rate to each other the only

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.449 
similar rate to each other the only
difference<00:02:52.290> actually<00:02:52.530> comes<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.100> with<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
difference actually comes in with the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.250 
difference actually comes in with the
trait<00:02:53.700> system<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.239> as<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.600> invest<00:02:54.870> points<00:02:55.170> in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
trait system so as you invest points in

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.300 
trait system so as you invest points in
traits<00:02:55.530> you're<00:02:55.769> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.100> able<00:02:56.220> to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
traits you're going to be able to

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.070 
traits you're going to be able to
customize<00:02:56.819> if<00:02:57.360> your<00:02:57.510> character<00:02:57.630> has<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.900> little

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
customize if your character has a little

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.240 
customize if your character has a little
bit<00:02:58.170> more<00:02:58.260> power<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.739> little<00:02:59.040> bit<00:02:59.130> more

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
bit more power a little bit more

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.949 
bit more power a little bit more
toughness<00:02:59.519> so<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.360> get<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> little<00:03:00.630> bit<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.870> a

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
toughness so you get a little bit of a

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.530 
toughness so you get a little bit of a
leeway<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.410> way<00:03:01.709> similarly<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.400> cool<00:03:02.640> yeah

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
leeway that way similarly in cool yeah

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.750 
leeway that way similarly in cool yeah
so<00:03:03.840> similarly<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.769> secondary<00:03:05.280> attributes

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
so similarly in secondary attributes

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.300 
so similarly in secondary attributes
these<00:03:06.450> are<00:03:06.769> attributes<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:07.980> go<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.160> little

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
these are attributes that go a little

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.620 
these are attributes that go a little
bit<00:03:08.489> deeper<00:03:08.670> into<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.060> mechanics<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
bit deeper into the mechanics of the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.990 
bit deeper into the mechanics of the
character<00:03:10.040> we've<00:03:11.040> got<00:03:11.220> things<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.640> increase

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
character we've got things that increase

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.360 
character we've got things that increase
your<00:03:12.180> critical<00:03:12.720> strike<00:03:12.989> multiplier<00:03:13.560> I'm

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
your critical strike multiplier I'm

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.500 
your critical strike multiplier I'm
going<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.640> increase<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.000> duration<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.450> your

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
going to increase the duration of your

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.210 
going to increase the duration of your
sort<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.200> conditions<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:16.950> sort<00:03:17.190> of

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
sort of conditions and that sort of

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.849 
sort of conditions and that sort of
thing<00:03:17.310> these<00:03:17.970> again<00:03:18.299> are<00:03:18.480> these<00:03:19.049> will<00:03:19.680> be

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
thing these again are these will be

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.560 
thing these again are these will be
leveled<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:20.190> as<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.760> increase<00:03:21.060> your<00:03:21.239> traits

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
leveled up as you increase your traits

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.630 
leveled up as you increase your traits
but<00:03:21.900> they<00:03:22.049> won't<00:03:22.320> actually<00:03:22.650> increase<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:23.459> you

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
but they won't actually increase as you

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.670 
but they won't actually increase as you

professional attributes are unique to
each<00:03:35.640> class<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:37.380> for<00:03:37.890> example<00:03:37.920> we've<00:03:38.459> got

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
each class so for example we've got

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.259 
each class so for example we've got
someone<00:03:39.150> like<00:03:39.359> that<00:03:39.390> an<00:03:39.810> eco<00:03:40.049> matter<00:03:41.060> who<00:03:42.060> has

someone like that an eco matter who has
hunger<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.930> what<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.680> does<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.980> increases

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
hunger and what this does is increases

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.390 
hunger and what this does is increases
the<00:03:45.209> life<00:03:45.569> force<00:03:45.840> Paul<00:03:46.170> or<00:03:46.380> we've<00:03:46.980> got<00:03:47.190> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
the life force Paul or we've got a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.610 
the life force Paul or we've got a
ranger<00:03:47.819> which<00:03:48.000> has<00:03:48.239> empathy<00:03:48.600> which<00:03:49.170> improves

talent calculator over here for the

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.000 
talent calculator over here for the
trait<00:04:11.519> system<00:04:12.109> and<00:04:13.109> as<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.440> can<00:04:13.560> see<00:04:13.590> here

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
trait system and as you can see here

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.029 
trait system and as you can see here
we've<00:04:14.609> got<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.790> necromancer<00:04:15.239> loaded<00:04:15.660> up<00:04:15.780> each

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
we've got the necromancer loaded up each

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.849 
we've got the necromancer loaded up each
class<00:04:17.039> has<00:04:17.070> five<00:04:17.669> different<00:04:17.880> trade<00:04:18.329> lines<00:04:18.859> and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
class has five different trade lines and

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.949 
class has five different trade lines and
these<00:04:20.220> within<00:04:21.030> these<00:04:21.150> straight<00:04:21.450> lines<00:04:21.479> you

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
these within these straight lines you

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.230 
these within these straight lines you
can<00:04:22.109> spend<00:04:22.409> points<00:04:22.680> as<00:04:22.979> we<00:04:23.430> do<00:04:23.550> just<00:04:23.820> here<00:04:24.030> and

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
can spend points as we do just here and

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.330 
can spend points as we do just here and
as<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.110> can<00:04:25.229> see<00:04:25.260> when<00:04:25.560> we<00:04:25.650> add<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.830> point

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
as you can see when we add a point

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.220 
as you can see when we add a point
is<00:04:26.430> going<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.730> give<00:04:26.880> us<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:27.210> bonus<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.960> two

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
is going to give us a bonus to two

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.750 
is going to give us a bonus to two
attributes<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:28.949> each<00:04:29.130> trait<00:04:29.400> line<00:04:29.580> is<00:04:29.699> going

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
attributes so each trait line is going

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.820 
attributes so each trait line is going
to<00:04:29.880> give<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.120> two<00:04:30.330> separate<00:04:30.750> attributes<00:04:31.169> so

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
to give you two separate attributes so

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.710 
to give you two separate attributes so
for<00:04:31.949> example<00:04:32.040> cursors<00:04:32.730> here<00:04:32.760> is<00:04:33.120> going<00:04:33.660> to

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
for example cursors here is going to

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.070 
for example cursors here is going to
give<00:04:33.840> us<00:04:33.870> an<00:04:34.650> upgrade<00:04:35.160> to<00:04:35.310> our<00:04:35.340> precision<00:04:35.790> and

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
give us an upgrade to our precision and

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.240 
give us an upgrade to our precision and
upgrade<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.199> our<00:04:37.260> malice<00:04:37.650> which<00:04:37.800> increases

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
upgrade to our malice which increases

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.379 
upgrade to our malice which increases
condition<00:04:38.669> damage<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.000> that's<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.360> a

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
condition damage so that's like a

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.200 
condition damage so that's like a
primary<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.139> secondary<00:04:40.550> now<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:42.090> to

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
primary and a secondary now just to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.510 
primary and a secondary now just to
clarify<00:04:42.389> each<00:04:42.960> time<00:04:43.229> you<00:04:43.410> do<00:04:43.590> level<00:04:43.919> up<00:04:44.010> you

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
clarify each time you do level up you

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.650 
clarify each time you do level up you
get<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:45.030> trait<00:04:45.810> point<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:47.550> you'll<00:04:48.180> get<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.330> total

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
get a trait point so you'll get a total

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.939 
get a trait point so you'll get a total
of<00:04:48.780> seventy<00:04:49.770> at<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.520> end<00:04:50.639> of<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.850> game<00:04:51.560> now<00:04:52.560> on

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
of seventy at the end of the game now on

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.620 
of seventy at the end of the game now on

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
you spend five points in a trait line

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.990 
you spend five points in a trait line
you<00:04:57.479> get<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:58.260> get<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.470> trait<00:04:58.770> which<00:04:59.460> is<00:04:59.639> a<00:04:59.669> skill

like we said earlier the great thing
about<00:05:32.910> this<00:05:33.180> trait<00:05:33.479> system<00:05:33.840> is<00:05:34.050> it's<00:05:34.229> going<00:05:34.440> to

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
about this trait system is it's going to

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.990 
about this trait system is it's going to
be<00:05:34.620> able<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.800> customize<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.430> way<00:05:35.460> a<00:05:35.610> skill

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
be able to customize the way a skill

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.150 
be able to customize the way a skill
performs<00:05:36.479> so<00:05:37.110> this<00:05:37.440> is<00:05:37.560> going<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.740> give<00:05:37.919> us<00:05:37.950> a

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
performs so this is going to give us a

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.460 
performs so this is going to give us a
large<00:05:38.550> diversity<00:05:39.060> to<00:05:39.570> sort<00:05:39.990> of<00:05:40.050> character

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
large diversity to sort of character

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.589 
large diversity to sort of character
you're<00:05:40.620> going<00:05:41.070> to<00:05:41.130> see<00:05:41.280> this<00:05:42.060> is<00:05:42.180> sort<00:05:42.330> of<00:05:42.389> you

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
you're going to see this is sort of you

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.270 
you're going to see this is sort of you
know<00:05:42.630> encompassing<00:05:43.470> to<00:05:43.530> Gil<00:05:43.710> was<00:05:43.800> one<00:05:44.099> where

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
know encompassing to Gil was one where

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.240 
know encompassing to Gil was one where
you<00:05:44.370> had<00:05:44.490> a<00:05:44.520> large<00:05:44.910> pool<00:05:45.660> of<00:05:45.690> skills<00:05:46.250> there's

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
you had a large pool of skills there's

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.560 
you had a large pool of skills there's
actually<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.520> little<00:05:47.639> bit<00:05:47.820> of<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:47.970> less<00:05:48.150> skills

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
actually a little bit of the less skills

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.629 
actually a little bit of the less skills
in<00:05:48.840> this<00:05:49.020> game<00:05:49.289> but<00:05:49.979> then<00:05:50.190> on<00:05:50.310> top<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.520> that

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
in this game but then on top of that

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.760 
in this game but then on top of that
we've<00:05:50.970> got<00:05:51.210> these<00:05:51.450> traits<00:05:52.349> which<00:05:52.530> are<00:05:52.650> going

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
we've got these traits which are going

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.469 
we've got these traits which are going
to<00:05:52.830> allow<00:05:53.039> us<00:05:53.070> to<00:05:53.190> diversify<00:05:53.490> those<00:05:54.000> skills<00:05:54.300> so

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
to allow us to diversify those skills so

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.570 
to allow us to diversify those skills so
it<00:05:54.539> is<00:05:54.660> pretty<00:05:54.780> cool<00:05:54.990> yeah<00:05:55.410> cool<00:05:55.680> so<00:05:56.070> basically

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
it is pretty cool yeah cool so basically

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.920 
it is pretty cool yeah cool so basically
when<00:05:56.760> we<00:05:56.880> marry<00:05:57.120> these<00:05:57.300> two<00:05:57.330> things<00:05:57.720> together

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
when we marry these two things together

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.290 
when we marry these two things together
the<00:05:58.860> potential<00:05:59.130> for<00:05:59.280> customization<00:05:59.729> becomes

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
the potential for customization becomes

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.339 
the potential for customization becomes
nearly<00:06:00.510> me<00:06:00.720> list<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:01.080> we're<00:06:01.229> really
