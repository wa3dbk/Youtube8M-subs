00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
right here it came all purple like with

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.979 
right here it came all purple like with
no<00:00:41.649> string<00:00:42.069> I<00:00:42.339> was<00:00:43.059> just<00:00:43.269> a<00:00:43.359> purple<00:00:43.569> string

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
no string I was just a purple string

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.689 
no string I was just a purple string
that<00:00:44.229> was<00:00:44.679> plastic<00:00:45.219> and<00:00:45.280> didn't<00:00:45.609> move

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
that was plastic and didn't move

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.579 
that was plastic and didn't move
anything<00:00:45.969> like<00:00:46.269> that<00:00:46.299> but<00:00:46.960> I<00:00:47.019> decided<00:00:47.379> to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
anything like that but I decided to

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.020 
anything like that but I decided to
paint<00:00:47.769> mine<00:00:47.949> because<00:00:48.309> I<00:00:48.339> don't<00:00:48.670> really<00:00:48.789> like

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
paint mine because I don't really like

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.639 
paint mine because I don't really like
the<00:00:49.239> way<00:00:49.329> that<00:00:49.449> looked<00:00:49.719> and<00:00:50.079> I<00:00:50.409> think<00:00:50.559> it

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
the way that looked and I think it

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:51.989 
the way that looked and I think it
turned<00:00:50.799> out<00:00:50.859> pretty<00:00:50.920> good<00:00:51.280> so<00:00:51.699> now<00:00:51.850> who<00:00:51.940> you

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
turned out pretty good so now who you

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.629 
turned out pretty good so now who you
can<00:00:52.179> actually<00:00:52.559> shoot<00:00:53.559> we<00:00:53.920> can't<00:00:54.100> shoot<00:00:54.339> stuff

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:54.639 
can actually shoot we can't shoot stuff

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:55.979 
can actually shoot we can't shoot stuff
but<00:00:54.819> it<00:00:54.940> can<00:00:55.209> actually<00:00:55.329> look<00:00:55.659> like<00:00:55.690> he's

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
but it can actually look like he's

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.989 
but it can actually look like he's
shooting<00:00:56.260> stuff<00:00:56.469> in<00:00:56.620> stop<00:00:56.829> motions<00:00:57.280> because

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
shooting stuff in stop motions because

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.239 
shooting stuff in stop motions because
the<00:00:58.119> string<00:00:58.359> can<00:00:58.510> pull<00:00:58.659> back<00:00:58.839> and<00:00:59.079> yet<00:00:59.260> then<00:00:59.829> we

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
the string can pull back and yet then we

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:03.389 
the string can pull back and yet then we
also<00:01:00.459> have<00:01:00.909> his<00:01:01.449> quiver<00:01:01.989> right<00:01:02.289> here<00:01:02.589> oh<00:01:02.769> it's

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
also have his quiver right here oh it's

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.920

mold and it works for him um he's got a

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.820 
mold and it works for him um he's got a
lot<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.310> shiny<00:01:42.640> purple<00:01:43.330> on<00:01:43.540> him<00:01:43.780> especially<00:01:44.620> on

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
lot of shiny purple on him especially on

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.130 
lot of shiny purple on him especially on
his<00:01:45.340> arm<00:01:45.790> which<00:01:46.120> is<00:01:46.150> just<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.630> Winter<00:01:46.930> Soldier

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
his arm which is just the Winter Soldier

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.620 
his arm which is just the Winter Soldier
arm<00:01:47.440> from<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.740> movie<00:01:48.270> Captain<00:01:49.270> America

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
arm from the movie Captain America

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.120 
arm from the movie Captain America
Winter<00:01:50.110> Soldier<00:01:50.350> figure<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.640> uh<00:01:52.120> I<00:01:52.480> think<00:01:53.130> it

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
Winter Soldier figure and uh I think it

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.950 
Winter Soldier figure and uh I think it
works<00:01:54.460> cuz<00:01:54.790> I<00:01:54.880> get<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.090> gun<00:01:55.240> flick<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.630> sleeve

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
works cuz I get the gun flick the sleeve

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.840 
works cuz I get the gun flick the sleeve
but<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.560> still<00:01:56.830> looks<00:01:56.979> kind<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.370> a<00:01:57.460> metal<00:01:57.700> arm

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
but it still looks kind of a metal arm

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.120 
but it still looks kind of a metal arm
just<00:01:58.060> because<00:01:58.210> there's<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.479> shiny<00:01:58.750> shiny<00:01:59.740> paint

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
just because there's a shiny shiny paint

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.630 
just because there's a shiny shiny paint
on<00:02:00.310> it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
on it

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.070 
on it
I<00:02:00.670> think<00:02:01.090> if<00:02:01.180> these<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.479> same<00:02:01.659> colors<00:02:01.960> they

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
I think if these the same colors they

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.440 
I think if these the same colors they
used<00:02:02.229> on<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.470> boots<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.100> dark<00:02:03.340> purple<00:02:03.550> go<00:02:04.270> to

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
used on the boots the dark purple go to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.000 
used on the boots the dark purple go to
work<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.720> little<00:02:04.840> bit<00:02:04.990> better<00:02:05.260> but<00:02:05.680> whatever

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
work a little bit better but whatever

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.459 
work a little bit better but whatever
it's<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.400> cool<00:02:06.640> I<00:02:06.700> like<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.289> so<00:02:08.289> his

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:08.469 
it's so cool I like it so his

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.009 
it's so cool I like it so his
articulation<00:02:08.739> is<00:02:09.489> pretty<00:02:09.879> decent<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.420> mean<00:02:10.450> his

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
articulation is pretty decent I mean his

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.740 
articulation is pretty decent I mean his
head<00:02:11.260> looks<00:02:11.980> up<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.819> much

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
head looks up that much

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.840 
head looks up that much
down<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.290> much<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.920> then<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.220> goes<00:02:15.400> side<00:02:15.700> to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
down that much and then it goes side to

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.760 
down that much and then it goes side to
side<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.600> mean<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.170> goes<00:02:17.260> all<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.530> way<00:02:17.620> around

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
side I mean it goes all the way around

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.490 
side I mean it goes all the way around
if<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.310> want<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:20.140> pretty<00:02:20.380> good

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
if you want it to so it's pretty good

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.340 
if you want it to so it's pretty good
like<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:21.670> he's<00:02:22.360> got<00:02:22.570> oh<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.230> know

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
like that and then he's got oh you know

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.290 
like that and then he's got oh you know
the<00:02:23.470> basic<00:02:23.740> articulation<00:02:24.310> waldron<00:02:24.820> shoulders

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
the basic articulation waldron shoulders

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.370 
the basic articulation waldron shoulders
biceps<00:02:26.020> swivel<00:02:26.560> ah<00:02:26.760> double-jointed<00:02:27.760> elbows

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380

biceps swivel ah double-jointed elbows
wrist<00:02:29.380> articulation<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:30.250> spins<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.940> goes<00:02:31.209> down

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
wrist articulation it spins it goes down

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.020 
wrist articulation it spins it goes down
up<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.890> down<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.459> that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
up and down like that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.720 
up and down like that
his<00:02:34.570> ab<00:02:34.780> crunch<00:02:35.200> kind<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.740> gets<00:02:35.920> um<00:02:36.160> hindered

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
his ab crunch kind of gets um hindered

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.810 
his ab crunch kind of gets um hindered
because<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.270> piece<00:02:37.600> which<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.200> cuz<00:02:38.440> I

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
because of this piece which is it cuz I

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.790 
because of this piece which is it cuz I
don't<00:02:39.820> know<00:02:39.970> they<00:02:40.540> made<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.840> all<00:02:41.140> like

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
don't know they made this all like

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.250 
don't know they made this all like
although<00:02:42.070> they<00:02:42.280> closed<00:02:42.580> again<00:02:42.820> in<00:02:42.970> one<00:02:43.270> piece

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
although they closed again in one piece

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.550 
although they closed again in one piece
it<00:02:44.560> one<00:02:44.740> unified<00:02:45.670> piece<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.690> has<00:02:46.900> AB<00:02:47.140> crunch

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
it one unified piece so has AB crunch

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.440 
it one unified piece so has AB crunch
doesn't<00:02:48.040> work<00:02:48.160> as<00:02:48.370> well<00:02:48.550> like<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.910> still<00:02:49.120> works

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
doesn't work as well like it still works

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.050 
doesn't work as well like it still works
underneath<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:50.140> but<00:02:50.320> it's<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.860> don't<00:02:51.700> know<00:02:51.850> this

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
underneath it but it's I don't know this

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.610 
underneath it but it's I don't know this
sticks<00:02:52.420> out<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.630> little<00:02:52.750> bit<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.380> don't<00:02:53.440> know

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
sticks out a little bit and I don't know

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.949 
sticks out a little bit and I don't know
how<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.739> feel<00:02:53.950> about<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.670> then<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.690> moves

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
how I feel about that and then it moves

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.820 
how I feel about that and then it moves
back<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:57.580> much<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.989> doesn't<00:02:59.260> look<00:02:59.650> like

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
back that much so it doesn't look like

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.140 
back that much so it doesn't look like
he<00:02:59.980> moves<00:03:00.160> back<00:03:00.280> too<00:03:00.970> much<00:03:01.150> or<00:03:01.390> too<00:03:01.690> much<00:03:02.020> but

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
he moves back too much or too much but

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.090 
he moves back too much or too much but
if<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.300> work<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:04.870> can<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.440> then

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
if you work for it you can and then

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.729 
if you work for it you can and then
let's<00:03:07.090> ease<00:03:07.300> get<00:03:07.540> waist<00:03:07.959> swivel<00:03:08.230> which<00:03:08.590> is

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
let's ease get waist swivel which is

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.870 
let's ease get waist swivel which is
underneath<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:10.709> flaps<00:03:11.709> whatever<00:03:12.700> they're

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
underneath the flaps whatever they're

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.770 
underneath the flaps whatever they're
called<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.989> works<00:03:14.350> again<00:03:15.070> but<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.430> make

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
called so it works again but it make

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.470 
called so it works again but it make
it's<00:03:16.780> kind<00:03:17.050> of<00:03:17.200> restricted<00:03:17.680> but<00:03:17.830> not<00:03:17.980> really

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
it's kind of restricted but not really

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.780 
it's kind of restricted but not really
then<00:03:19.480> he's<00:03:19.600> got<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:20.350> kick<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.250> goes<00:03:21.400> up<00:03:21.549> that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
then he's got a kick that goes up that

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.680 
then he's got a kick that goes up that
high<00:03:22.049> upper<00:03:23.049> thigh<00:03:23.230> swivel<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.970> then<00:03:25.150> yeah

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
high upper thigh swivel and then yeah

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.479 
high upper thigh swivel and then yeah
like<00:03:26.440> most<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.830> new<00:03:26.920> figures<00:03:27.190> they<00:03:27.310> don't

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
like most of the new figures they don't

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.670 
like most of the new figures they don't
want<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.670> kick<00:03:27.850> back<00:03:27.880> too<00:03:28.450> far<00:03:28.810> cuz<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.410> butts

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
want to kick back too far cuz the butts

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.539 
want to kick back too far cuz the butts
in<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.950> way<00:03:30.239> he's<00:03:31.239> got<00:03:31.330> double<00:03:31.690> jointed<00:03:31.989> knees

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
in the way he's got double jointed knees

quiver

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.610 
quiver
goes<00:04:27.490> into<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.120> hole<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.690> his<00:04:28.750> back<00:04:29.050> like

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
goes into the hole and his back like

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.920 
goes into the hole and his back like
that<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.940> then<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.270> sits<00:04:31.480> there<00:04:31.630> pretty<00:04:31.840> well

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
that and then it sits there pretty well

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.530 
that and then it sits there pretty well
I<00:04:32.140> mean<00:04:32.470> good<00:04:33.070> shake<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:33.520> he<00:04:33.640> won't<00:04:33.850> come<00:04:34.420> out

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
I mean good shake it he won't come out

I mean good shake it he won't come out
and<00:04:34.900> make<00:04:35.470> it<00:04:35.590> either<00:04:35.650> face<00:04:35.950> this<00:04:36.220> way<00:04:36.460> or<00:04:36.880> that

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
and make it either face this way or that

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.540 
and make it either face this way or that
way<00:04:37.420> I<00:04:37.930> think<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.890> should<00:04:38.920> go<00:04:39.070> this<00:04:39.190> way<00:04:39.250> just

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
way I think it should go this way just

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.570 
way I think it should go this way just
because<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.820> sleeve<00:04:40.120> if<00:04:41.110> I'm<00:04:41.290> not<00:04:41.920> mistaken

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
because the sleeve if I'm not mistaken

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.000 
because the sleeve if I'm not mistaken
it<00:04:42.880> goes<00:04:43.090> on<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.570> bow<00:04:43.780> arm<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.650> know<00:04:44.860> when

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
it goes on the bow arm so you know when

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.950 
it goes on the bow arm so you know when
like<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.220> bowstring<00:04:45.730> comes<00:04:46.210> back<00:04:46.510> it<00:04:46.720> doesn't

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
like the bowstring comes back it doesn't

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.590 
like the bowstring comes back it doesn't
mess<00:04:47.590> up<00:04:47.620> your<00:04:47.920> arm<00:04:48.100> if<00:04:48.910> you're<00:04:49.180> not<00:04:49.390> shooting

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
mess up your arm if you're not shooting

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
mess up your arm if you're not shooting
right<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.170> don't<00:04:50.350> know

right I don't know

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.340 
right I don't know
but<00:04:50.980> so<00:04:51.610> I<00:04:51.640> just<00:04:51.880> have<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.120> on<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.390> side<00:04:52.720> the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
but so I just have it on that side the

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.800 
but so I just have it on that side the
one<00:04:53.560> issue<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.950> have<00:04:54.250> though<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.730> that<00:04:54.810> he

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
one issue I have though is that he

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.510 
one issue I have though is that he
doesn't<00:04:56.170> hold<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.890> bow<00:04:57.160> um<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.720> well<00:04:59.520> watch

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
doesn't hold the bow um that well watch

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.820 
doesn't hold the bow um that well watch
now<00:05:00.790> he's<00:05:01.360> gonna<00:05:01.540> do<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.840> but<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.410> think<00:05:02.740> it's

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
now he's gonna do it but I think it's

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.960 
now he's gonna do it but I think it's
just<00:05:02.919> cuz<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.190> Winter<00:05:03.430> Soldier<00:05:03.640> um<00:05:03.850> he

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
just cuz the Winter Soldier um he

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.520 
just cuz the Winter Soldier um he
doesn't<00:05:04.210> hold<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.480> as<00:05:04.570> well<00:05:04.750> as<00:05:05.020> past

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.210 
clayey shooting in like the fingers are
set<00:05:14.530> differently

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
set differently

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.420 
set differently
this<00:05:15.580> one<00:05:15.700> has<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:16.270> one<00:05:16.930> finger<00:05:17.080> back<00:05:17.440> on<00:05:17.710> the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
this one has a one finger back on the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.550 
this one has a one finger back on the
top<00:05:18.640> like<00:05:18.850> a<00:05:18.880> trigger<00:05:19.180> finger<00:05:19.419> which<00:05:20.230> holds

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
top like a trigger finger which holds

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.080 
top like a trigger finger which holds
the<00:05:20.650> bow<00:05:20.770> in<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.040> smooth<00:05:21.340> which<00:05:21.550> holds<00:05:22.000> a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
the bow in the smooth which holds a

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.730 
the bow in the smooth which holds a
bowstring<00:05:22.600> and<00:05:22.750> this<00:05:22.840> one<00:05:22.960> holds<00:05:23.169> the<00:05:23.230> bow<00:05:23.470> and

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
bowstring and this one holds the bow and

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.440 
bowstring and this one holds the bow and
it<00:05:23.830> works<00:05:24.040> good<00:05:24.370> like<00:05:24.910> that

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
it works good like that

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.980 
it works good like that
but<00:05:26.020> this<00:05:26.740> Hawkeye<00:05:27.190> just<00:05:27.610> has<00:05:27.790> to<00:05:28.419> trigger

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
but this Hawkeye just has to trigger

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.620 
but this Hawkeye just has to trigger
fingers<00:05:29.440> which<00:05:30.250> isn't<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.760> bad<00:05:30.940> thing<00:05:31.000> but<00:05:31.510> it

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
fingers which isn't a bad thing but it

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.690 
fingers which isn't a bad thing but it
makes<00:05:31.810> it<00:05:31.990> more<00:05:32.620> difficult<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:33.220> hold<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:33.520> bow

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
makes it more difficult to hold the bow

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.120 
makes it more difficult to hold the bow
sometimes<00:05:33.970> Oh

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
sometimes Oh

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.070 
sometimes Oh
so<00:05:36.370> you<00:05:36.430> can<00:05:36.669> technically<00:05:37.390> have<00:05:37.630> him<00:05:37.720> hold<00:05:37.960> it

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
so you can technically have him hold it

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.840 
so you can technically have him hold it
in<00:05:38.200> whichever<00:05:38.530> hand<00:05:38.770> you<00:05:38.919> want<00:05:39.190> but<00:05:39.640> I<00:05:39.820> prefer

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
in whichever hand you want but I prefer

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.810 
in whichever hand you want but I prefer
to<00:05:40.240> have<00:05:40.330> him<00:05:40.419> holding<00:05:40.660> it<00:05:40.780> that<00:05:40.990> way<00:05:41.820> even

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
to have him holding it that way even

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.370 
to have him holding it that way even
though<00:05:43.030> he<00:05:43.210> can't<00:05:43.570> hold<00:05:43.750> it<00:05:43.930> in<00:05:44.020> this<00:05:44.169> side

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
though he can't hold it in this side

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.370 
though he can't hold it in this side
let's<00:05:45.280> see<00:05:46.800> because<00:05:47.800> no<00:05:48.580> maybe<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:49.060> want<00:05:49.380> if

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
let's see because no maybe you want if

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.080 
let's see because no maybe you want if
you<00:05:50.560> pull<00:05:50.800> fingers<00:05:51.280> back<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:51.700> know

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
you pull fingers back I know

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.280 
you pull fingers back I know
anyways<00:05:52.479> he<00:05:52.600> doesn't<00:05:52.810> want<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:52.990> hold<00:05:53.080> it<00:05:53.229> that

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
anyways he doesn't want to hold it that

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.110 
anyways he doesn't want to hold it that
way<00:05:53.410> cuz<00:05:53.770> I<00:05:54.040> don't<00:05:54.400> want<00:05:54.550> him<00:05:54.669> to<00:05:54.729> do<00:05:54.790> anyways

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
way cuz I don't want him to do anyways

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.880 
way cuz I don't want him to do anyways
but<00:05:55.600> I<00:05:55.660> think<00:05:55.990> it's<00:05:56.110> a<00:05:56.140> pretty<00:05:56.320> good<00:05:56.410> figure<00:05:56.740> so

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
but I think it's a pretty good figure so

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.800 
but I think it's a pretty good figure so
now<00:05:57.010> let's<00:05:57.310> get<00:05:57.460> some<00:05:57.700> comparisons<00:05:58.510> to<00:05:58.690> the

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
now let's get some comparisons to the

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.840 
now let's get some comparisons to the
other<00:05:58.960> hawkeye<00:05:59.320> figures<00:05:59.620> we've<00:05:59.800> had<00:05:59.979> alright

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
but anyways oh this one's a little bit

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.110 
but anyways oh this one's a little bit
shorter<00:06:19.540> than<00:06:19.630> the<00:06:19.780> other<00:06:19.930> two<00:06:20.110> like<00:06:20.470> yeah<00:06:21.310> the

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
shorter than the other two like yeah the

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.140 
shorter than the other two like yeah the
tinier

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
tinier

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.000 
tinier
okay<00:06:25.150> maybe<00:06:25.360> he's<00:06:25.510> not<00:06:25.660> shorter<00:06:25.990> anyways<00:06:26.800> he

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
okay maybe he's not shorter anyways he

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.550 
okay maybe he's not shorter anyways he
looks<00:06:27.220> at<00:06:27.460> a<00:06:27.580> global<00:06:27.880> shorter<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.390> me<00:06:28.600> than<00:06:29.410> the

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
looks at a global shorter to me than the

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.340 
looks at a global shorter to me than the
other<00:06:29.710> two<00:06:29.950> but<00:06:30.910> they're<00:06:31.780> all<00:06:31.900> pretty<00:06:32.050> cool<00:06:32.290> I

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
other two but they're all pretty cool I

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.370 
other two but they're all pretty cool I
think<00:06:33.010> I<00:06:33.250> might<00:06:33.940> like<00:06:34.150> this<00:06:34.600> one<00:06:34.810> the<00:06:34.960> most

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
think I might like this one the most

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.050 
think I might like this one the most
just<00:06:35.680> good<00:06:35.830> maybe<00:06:36.039> because<00:06:36.310> it's<00:06:36.460> the<00:06:36.580> newest

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
just good maybe because it's the newest

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.750 
just good maybe because it's the newest
oh<00:06:37.390> I<00:06:38.289> like<00:06:38.470> the<00:06:38.620> classic<00:06:39.010> costume<00:06:39.190> even

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
oh I like the classic costume even

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.189 
oh I like the classic costume even
though<00:06:39.820> I<00:06:39.849> know<00:06:39.970> it's<00:06:40.180> a<00:06:40.300> bit<00:06:40.419> corny

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
though I know it's a bit corny

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.409 
though I know it's a bit corny
but<00:06:41.439> I<00:06:41.740> think<00:06:42.009> it's<00:06:42.310> tied<00:06:42.639> between<00:06:42.789> these<00:06:43.210> two

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
but I think it's tied between these two

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.209 
but I think it's tied between these two
I<00:06:43.599> do<00:06:43.659> like<00:06:44.050> this<00:06:44.169> one<00:06:44.229> a<00:06:44.379> lot<00:06:44.529> to<00:06:44.770> them

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:45.219 
I do like this one a lot to them

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.760 
I do like this one a lot to them
just<00:06:46.029> because<00:06:46.180> of<00:06:46.300> talk<00:06:46.449> I<00:06:46.629> and<00:06:46.960> part<00:06:47.650> of<00:06:47.680> the

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
just because of talk I and part of the

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.260 
just because of talk I and part of the
reason<00:06:48.039> I<00:06:48.279> like<00:06:48.430> the<00:06:48.550> Avengers<00:06:48.789> Hawkeye<00:06:49.240> the

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
reason I like the Avengers Hawkeye the

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.119 
reason I like the Avengers Hawkeye the
most<00:06:49.569> is<00:06:49.749> because<00:06:49.960> he<00:06:50.349> loves<00:06:50.529> the<00:06:50.620> bow<00:06:50.830> in<00:06:51.009> his

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:51.129 
most is because he loves the bow in his

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.119 
most is because he loves the bow in his
right<00:06:51.430> hand<00:06:51.509> because<00:06:52.509> he's<00:06:52.990> left-handed<00:06:53.499> just

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:54.129 
right hand because he's left-handed just

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:56.700 
right hand because he's left-handed just
like<00:06:54.249> Jeremy<00:06:54.550> Renner<00:06:54.879> and<00:06:55.150> just<00:06:55.419> like<00:06:55.569> me<00:06:55.810> but

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
like Jeremy Renner and just like me but

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.089 
like Jeremy Renner and just like me but
these<00:06:57.279> two<00:06:57.610> they<00:06:57.819> decided<00:06:58.240> to<00:06:58.270> make<00:06:59.099> Hawkeye

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:34.719 
because it's fancier and purple and

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:36.269 
because it's fancier and purple and
neither<00:07:34.960> of<00:07:35.139> these<00:07:35.259> two<00:07:35.319> have<00:07:35.529> that<00:07:36.039> much

purple<00:07:36.580> to<00:07:36.639> begin<00:07:36.909> with<00:07:37.089> so<00:07:37.210> I<00:07:37.240> think<00:07:37.330> having<00:07:37.629> a

00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:37.839 
purple to begin with so I think having a

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:40.140 
purple to begin with so I think having a
little<00:07:37.900> bit<00:07:38.139> more<00:07:38.319> might<00:07:38.560> help<00:07:38.800> but<00:07:39.669> I<00:07:39.909> think

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.150 
little bit more might help but I think

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.700 
little bit more might help but I think
