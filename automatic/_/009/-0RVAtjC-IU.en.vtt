 description hello everyone with you max and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.420
 today especially to make such a fun 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.640
 video seemed maximum speed 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.880
 bloodseeker well or almost from the very 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.470
 maximum general speed in dota that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.869
 we need for this I went to both 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.769
 took the bladiker and started remembering 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.079
 heaps of 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.559
 but in heaps otherwise download him everything 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.399
 ulta all have that server stupidly crashed 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.040
 I could not stand it so now I did 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.760
 Well, about the average crosses on 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.440
 and let's with the help of our passiv will 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.120
 reach maximum speed 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 there it should be around 3000 so 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:04.979
 already we see the rate of 1500 should be 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:10.070
 things three hope they don't lie here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.070
 Excellent speed we have 7000 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.619
 also pay attention to the damage that 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:22.539
 there for each for each percent x 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:29.940
 Served as well as this Angus by damage and not 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:34.650
 I know exactly what a good thing 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.190
 and for us the bill of the projectile let's still 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.190
 we are picking up 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.630
 so cool but understandable that you 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.630
 nowhere else you can do it just for fun 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.630
 play around 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.259
 cool I wonder how they are there from 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.380
 settled me not yet for a very long time you 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.159
 come on 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.429
 and kill us abnormally let's 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.790
 see how much for how long 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:20.280
 our fountain gets to the fountain of forces 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:28.120
 light so let's start in 35 seconds 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:30.330
 all ran well in 4 seconds is not bad 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.330
 speed 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.740
 so it is already legs and therefore you see 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.900
 slowly us speed decreases well 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.990
 if we hang one more like they don't 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.990
 will die 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:55.980
 not so place you can now still a little bit 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:03.380
 it is so quiet quietly a couple of not 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.380
 giving in is not added 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.130
 how is the server still worth it ? 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.160
 In general, here is such a trick and I 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.610
 forgot 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:27.450
 you can still turn on the drums and 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:29.040
 the speed will be really mad to do 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.080
 the weather is so fun because 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.700
 he wanted the city prosthesis 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:39.440
 why not show you can it not 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.440
 knew looks cool at least 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.010
 1000 only through shift 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.989
 leave his goals 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:04:06.970
 you just click on it like everyone else 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:04:06.970
 harlots let 's 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:31.900
 camera like 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:35.080
 does not have time overall not bad so 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.080
 normal speed 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:53.040
 so it is necessary still 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:56.220
 of these I bring about burn them 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.440
 Alliance I mean, what could have been 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.440
 control amount hp 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:15.229
 you must be strange for them why I can't 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:19.759
 they manage them all the same I am alive 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.939
 zaspavnen Well then let's place 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.129
 brinko 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.129
 we will not need in this speed 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:37.550
 the main thing is not to kill them clearly begins to die 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.740
 Tushinsky I showed you the maximum 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.319
 Therefore, we can speed them up and kill 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.639
 see here how the recession and speed that 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.639
 he typed and all 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:01.420
 all the speed is gone now so what 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.970
 here's a cool chip naturally and his 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.240
 you can not take it will not apply so 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:10.210
 how is it impossible but in principle catch 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.580
 you can pin hang all good luck and 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.440
 put likes if you want me 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.660
 recorded some such garbage from 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:22.590
 but in the lobby there are some shields 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.590
 interesting pieces well until all
