00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.660
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.500
 This theme is 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.470
 Deep Tsutuki that will be here 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.530
 The deep end of the end line 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.790
 To you two ways to drive 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.659
 The contents of this time that I would like to introduce are more than intermediate level 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.489
 A person who can drive well 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.769
 I would like to increase the width of the drive for such people 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.439
 In content that I want you to remember by all means to increase the range that can be supported 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.859
 When it comes deep into it 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.480
 It's so hard to beat you and everyone is also experienced 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.550
 I think, but when I have a deep tsutsuki gun 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.120
 I thought I wanted to hit but a deep tsutsuki came 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.649
 When it gets clogged you get clogged 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.120
 I get founs and loose balls and mistakes 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.769
 It will be countered if it becomes a loose ball 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.929
 I have not hit it well in the form 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.989
 I think that there is also an experience that you will be done 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.620
 The stronger players are called Tsutuki or Butinbutin on the table 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.110
 There are many players who are very good at such small skills 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 In order to compete against such players 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.830
 Drive width of drive of forehand drive 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.360
 It is necessary to expand 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.070
 Because I think that there is no 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.650
 Please practice by all means in that two ways 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.560
 At first we would like to introduce from the first method 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.100
 This is the first method, but the other party doesn't play 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.320
 If you can predict what if you can 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.670
 I think I will be ready with some time in advance 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.000
 I would like to explain from such a story 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.590
 When you can predict such a little prediction 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.500
 If you have time to prepare, take some distance from the platform 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.590
 Please take a simple distance from the stand 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.350
 It is going to go down 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.370
 I wait for the deep-seated Tsutsuzuki 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.030
 Wait up to the top and have a nice ball at the highest point 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.390
 It is a way of thinking to go to beat 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.570
 By doing so, even against the deep tsutsuki 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.450
 I can go for a good drive 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.729
 I can go for a good drive 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.000
 I'm waiting for you 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.700
 Even if you have entered it, just step into it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.040
 As it can be converted to a stronger attack 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.310
 First take the distance firmly and go down and get deep 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.560
 I can wait until I can hit it 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.840
 It is important to do so 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.590
 If you can prepare well a good ball 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.640
 If you have time, you can go to strike 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.000
 So try to take a distance from the platform 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.650
 Next is the second method The second method is reversed this time 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.209
 If you can not prepare If you can not prepare 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.240
 It's bound soon It's bound soon 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.290
 Here at the timing of Tatern Taturn 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.860
 Please be sure to hit. 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.160
 If you hit a strong ball 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.140
 It's very difficult but lifting 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.349
 It's pretty easy This ball bounces 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.200
 Because it strikes using the momentum which is going to go up 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.440
 The momentum that goes up with Taturn 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.910
 In fact, it is a deep ball because it can strike back against the opponent 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.410
 It's so easy to lift it down deep 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.440
 As point is timing 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.080
 It is a racket to match 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.030
 It means that the racket swings vertically 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.180
 Of course if you swing before it 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.770
 Because the possibility of falling is high, it is said that the power is 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.669
 Because it is good to put it once and throw it away 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.349
 Just shake it straight up at an early timing 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.889
 In terms of time because timing is fast 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.889
 Because you can put a little pressure on your opponent 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.569
 It feels like hitting with emphasis on timing 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.050
 In a small swing by doing so 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.520
 As we can raise, we remake system once 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.509
 We prepare for the next rally 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.500
 Will be able to 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.490
 In this way two types of drives 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.050
 We introduced, but always practice both 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.240
 Of course you need a strong ball firmly 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.889
 It would be nice if you hit it, but there is a possibility that it is not 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.779
 Don't get stuck even when a deep ball comes in 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.990
 I can hit at a quick timing or firmly 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.379
 If you are ready, a strong ball will blow 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.129
 I can always do two things like I can hit it 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.099
 Please do practice by all means everyone 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.009
 Thank you for trying it
