00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
eight AMD HD Radian I think it's seven

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.590 
eight AMD HD Radian I think it's seven
hundred<00:03:50.550> of<00:03:51.550> course<00:03:51.820> they<00:03:52.030> told<00:03:52.090> me<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.450> power

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
hundred of course they told me the power

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.870 
hundred of course they told me the power
supply<00:03:53.020> wasn't<00:03:53.410> enough<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.430> did<00:03:54.670> have<00:03:54.760> to

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
supply wasn't enough so I did have to

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.810 
supply wasn't enough so I did have to
upgrade<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.239> power<00:03:55.510> supply<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:56.140> this<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.820> not

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
upgrade the power supply on this and not

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.530 
upgrade the power supply on this and not
to<00:03:58.000> mention<00:03:58.180> it's<00:03:58.720> got<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.640> it's<00:04:00.640> got<00:04:00.850> a<00:04:00.880> quad

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
to mention it's got it it's got a quad
