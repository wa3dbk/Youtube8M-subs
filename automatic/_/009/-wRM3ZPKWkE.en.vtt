00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.820
 hi to all and skyheroes how are you 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.400
 welcome today for the discovery 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.470
 of the new mapaq apocalypse that comes from 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.170
 go out on black ops 2 and there I am on 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.330
 the tablecloth pod in fashion if I get 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.980
 remember well it's in thailand on a 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.400
 edge of a cliff and with 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.750
 pretty dilapidated condominiums and so then 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.980
 I will show the minimap here it is 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.740
 a tablecloth that looks pretty 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.059
 linear and not that big then 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.989
 we will test that a little bit so I 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.820
 follow the beacons you still have to 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.480
 a little gameplay snipers it's done 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.340
 always happy 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.660
 I can already hear a grenade iufm it does not me 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.370
 not happy when playing sniper 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.440
 elite marker it's a pity I had 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.520
 managed to catch up with him so much better then 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.420
 there is a clever little guy who went around 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.579
 and get killed 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.590
 go back there then I'm in 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.530
 match to the death and a match to death often 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.820
 the spawn changes very quickly so it 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.440
 always be alert especially to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.000
 start when you will start the game 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.859
 you go archers on the stroke and half this 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.149
 which seems to him just a normal month but 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.039
 the spawn usually will change 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.270
 almost instantly so you have to 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.309
 always be alert when you at 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.600
 rush spawn in the enemy's camp 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.799
 always go back to see a little 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 little if it is a manager of eri king 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.990
 so already these kinds of maps whose 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.869
 colors I love I love the maps with 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.400
 colors like that ah shit ah 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.740
 good I will still try not to 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.240
 do something catastrophic then there he 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.470
 is the right or left option I'm going 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.090
 from the right of the scooter I left 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.500
 on the left because there we can go through 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.490
 there the purpose of a discovery had 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.049
 finally we can go straight 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.820
 well that's not bad the purpose of the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.210
 discovery is still to show 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.659
 something I did not manage 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.450
 to have it 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.150
 he blew himself up I believe I 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.610
 I'm not going to blow myself up anyway 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.509
 then the mother of lack of precision 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.509
 go we go to the people to the people 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.540
 good it was bad party 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.700
 it is true that there is a small 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.689
 moment I have not played I want you 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.770
 him to take a break and 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.119
 finally when we do a little 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 pause like that sometimes it's not 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.450
 always simple at around 2.6 put back 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.130
 here is the mister grenade that ends up 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 touch and ben I 'll try not 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.710
 too much and ridiculous anyway make a 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.659
 little discovery then go through there 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.129
 Come on, we'll take a little walk we'll see 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.410
 this little mother and the little beach 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.060
 pretty disgusting it does not make you want 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.230
 to go swimming anyway 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:20.250
 but then go we'll go around 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.510
 will try to do more is good 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.800
 obviously when it's the exit 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.810
 matches like that we want to be 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.090
 the first to make a girl quilt 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.959
 to finally make a clip anyway so 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.450
 that's what I'm going to try to do 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.040
 today in addition to the discoveries I 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.830
 will spend a little bit of the day 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.640
 to play is to make of 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.739
 world to the damage 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.620
 try to make a clip and then we go 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.640
 to try with precisely there and ron 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.560
 I hope we will succeed in everything 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.870
 case to do as for the dl if 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.880
 revenge to do a montage so he 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.819
 will be out tomorrow with all the best 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.680
 clips that the team realized on ben 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.120
 precisely on this dlc so if that you 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.690
 interesting I invite you to see tomorrow 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.400
 this little montage in any case well 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.690
 obviously it depends on whether to clips or 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.760
 not but I hope so and I do 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.170
 trust my players who I know are 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.769
 really very good and happens to make 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.940
 very good things 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:12.390
 so here is ojala as we say in mexico 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.560
 finally another there another there another one 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.330
 there there is another there so I 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.040
 had seen him at maera fucked with 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.600
 Taiwan said m 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.890
 I will not get upset either so that 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.480
 looks pretty minor in the sense that 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.030
 usually systematically 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.670
 found to go towards the center towards this 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.620
 axis is the main path of the map and 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.790
 alright I think like any 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.230
 way it's unemployed mode is not there 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.600
 from goal to that has changed 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.170
 you have to go against denials for 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.549
 try to make a maximum 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.810
 of elimination so we are in the process of 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.970
 lose maybe it's a little bit 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.290
 info to open the score in final bat 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.930
 finally it's me first so 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.000
 it's that my team could shit but 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.299
 well that we can never choose his team 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.590
 finally we can choose his team but we 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.980
 never know what we're going to fall on 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.630
 actually we will still work in 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.930
 the spawn we will try to take them 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.329
 just respawn there then otherwise it stays at 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.410
 Beyond I got myself there then 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.959
 there he went straight on I saw one 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.250
 past but I think the ena who is going 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.510
 get there then always in match at 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.709
 death is like that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.569
 where do you go where your allies are 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.560
 usually the enemies are where he 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.560
 is not she so 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.350
 try bitter I had seen it too late 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.250
 pity but we try it does not stay 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.390
 a lot of points we will try when 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.400
 even to catch up with the double girl trick 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.630
 to be hot that's not bad damage 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.960
 he did not stop 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.370
 it's a pathos ouch ouch stop 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.860
 campers so just going on we see 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.020
 precisely all these little ones 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.320
 bungalows where I think it's going to be 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.290
 camping the family here's the 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.240
 camping as you want we see there and I 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.100
 again I'm already scared to see guys 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.660
 in the little huts like that with 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.400
 their shields behind and their aftermath 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.900
 unfortunate target detector but good 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.380
 what do you want is the game my poor 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.280
 lollipop 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.590
 there is nothing alalalala to access 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.880
 gradual dry up so good normally 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.960
 we do a class with isolation for 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.790
 to protect a little bit of that because 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.350
 that indeed when we also yes fm 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.970
 on black ops the bad news 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.750
 is that we no longer see the bar of 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.770
 feed there go there is the best 9 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.940
 and then that it looks to be rather 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.530
 speak to action so that's more 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.360
 not bad that it's grouped together for 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.770
 to try to make good 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.770
 small sequences do a maximum of 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.790
 that he is unfortunately I fell 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.040
 on a team that is even more 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.270
 bad that me so well we'll have 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.590
 a defeat but hey it's okay 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.660
 the important thing is to discover a small 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.160
 little map and down until now 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.490
 it's always a bit of a time 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.630
 getting used to I'm getting fucked 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.980
 I did what I could unfortunately 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.150
 we lost but here we did a 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.730
 little discovery of the map to see a 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.800
 little bit about what it looks like and in 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.180
 anyway I will do the others mapera to the 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.750
 in any case hoping that it 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.669
 you were pleased 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.200
 and in any case for me it seems 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.030
 not bad I think there are good 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.590
 things to do on this map there because 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.390
 that even if there are nooks of camping 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.980
 and the map there is stuff either we can 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.840
 go to the side of the places one can 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.210
 on the side finally the action ares is 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.320
 quite linear and in the x-axis so that all 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.970
 the important ones to make a maximum 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.110
 of elimination that was all for that 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.120
 respect gameplay rank which you liked 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.950
 Feel free to leave a comment 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.360
 leave your opinion a little green thumb 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.860
 and share videos also that makes 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.090
