nothing too fancy one thing that I do

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.140 
nothing too fancy one thing that I do
like<00:04:52.889> that<00:04:52.949> probably<00:04:53.430> most<00:04:53.580> for<00:04:53.879> builders

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
like that probably most for builders

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.059 
like that probably most for builders
have<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.689> especially<00:04:55.169> all<00:04:55.469> the<00:04:55.560> players<00:04:55.830> is

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
that extra pin in right there Lock them

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.010 
that extra pin in right there Lock them
keys<00:05:04.919> maybe<00:05:05.789> because<00:05:06.180> we<00:05:06.300> have<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.449> child<00:05:06.749> here

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
keys maybe because we have a child here

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.379 
keys maybe because we have a child here
so<00:05:07.349> he<00:05:07.740> can<00:05:07.889> come<00:05:08.039> up<00:05:08.069> and<00:05:08.669> switch<00:05:08.849> this<00:05:09.090> into

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
so he can come up and switch this into

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:16.010 
so he can come up and switch this into
gear<00:05:09.659> and<00:05:09.900> then<00:05:10.020> we<00:05:10.409> could<00:05:10.590> roll<00:05:10.770> off<00:05:11.090> anytime

and I have it yet but I know I've got up

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.570 
and I have it yet but I know I've got up
to<00:06:04.820> 45<00:06:05.300> not<00:06:06.199> even<00:06:06.440> trying<00:06:06.710> I<00:06:06.919> wasn't<00:06:07.250> really

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
to 45 not even trying I wasn't really

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.010 
to 45 not even trying I wasn't really
going<00:06:07.729> for<00:06:08.000> a<00:06:08.030> speed<00:06:08.270> record<00:06:08.419> but<00:06:08.720> that<00:06:08.750> was

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
going for a speed record but that was

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.770 
going for a speed record but that was
the<00:06:09.110> two<00:06:09.290> people<00:06:09.650> on<00:06:09.800> who<00:06:10.310> adult<00:06:10.610> me<00:06:11.570> and<00:06:11.690> my

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
the two people on who adult me and my

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.760 
the two people on who adult me and my
wife<00:06:11.960> so<00:06:12.350> it<00:06:13.250> went<00:06:13.370> 45<00:06:13.760> just<00:06:14.419> not<00:06:15.290> even<00:06:15.530> trying

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
wife so it went 45 just not even trying

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.800 
wife so it went 45 just not even trying
so<00:06:16.130> I'm<00:06:16.550> sure<00:06:16.850> it<00:06:16.970> could<00:06:17.090> probably<00:06:17.210> easily<00:06:17.449> be

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
so I'm sure it could probably easily be

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.350 
so I'm sure it could probably easily be
60<00:06:18.289> with<00:06:18.440> just<00:06:18.590> one<00:06:18.770> person<00:06:19.100> on<00:06:19.190> it<00:06:19.220> but<00:06:20.060> if

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
60 with just one person on it but if

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.879 
60 with just one person on it but if
that's<00:06:20.600> something<00:06:20.810> you<00:06:20.990> want<00:06:21.199> this<00:06:21.440> comment

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889
