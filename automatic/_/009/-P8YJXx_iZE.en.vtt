xxx 863 - that is a random seed number

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.530 
xxx 863 - that is a random seed number
just<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.090> random<00:02:20.770> generated<00:02:21.770> number<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.450> then

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
just a random generated number and then

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.140 
just a random generated number and then
so<00:02:23.720> after<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.260> have<00:02:24.470> hit<00:02:24.680> bought<00:02:25.070> once<00:02:26.030> you

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
so after you have hit bought once you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.640 
so after you have hit bought once you
buy<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.390> it'll<00:02:26.810> say<00:02:26.959> payments<00:02:27.380> successful<00:02:29.650> and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
buy it it'll say payments successful and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.590 
buy it it'll say payments successful and
then<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.580> pops<00:02:31.760> up<00:02:31.940> again<00:02:32.060> because<00:02:32.420> obviously

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
then it pops up again because obviously

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.750 
then it pops up again because obviously
I<00:02:32.840> wants<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.290> clicked<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.830> they'll<00:02:34.519> say

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
I wants to just clicked it they'll say

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.530 
I wants to just clicked it they'll say
peanuts<00:02:35.090> successful<00:02:35.570> okay<00:02:36.730> now<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.790> see<00:02:38.150> I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
peanuts successful okay now you see I

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.449 
peanuts successful okay now you see I
basically<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:39.470> doubled<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:39.980> now<00:02:40.160> it's<00:02:40.370> just

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
basically just doubled it now it's just

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.759 
basically just doubled it now it's just
three<00:02:40.790> thousand<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.570> five<00:02:41.930> instead<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.620> two

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
three thousand and five instead of two

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.759 
three thousand and five instead of two
thousand<00:02:43.220> five<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:45.080> is<00:02:45.260> how<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.470> do

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
thousand five and that is how you do

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.370 
thousand five and that is how you do
that<00:02:46.239> if<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.299> want<00:02:47.450> me<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.540> do<00:02:47.750> another<00:02:47.900> game<00:02:48.320> I

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
that if you want me to do another game I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.920 
that if you want me to do another game I
can<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.900> think<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.950> already<00:02:52.760> did<00:02:53.000> bike<00:02:53.269> race<00:02:53.600> as

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
can I think I already did bike race as

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.440 
can I think I already did bike race as
you<00:02:54.080> see<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.320> already<00:02:54.650> have<00:02:54.830> all<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.250> bikes<00:02:55.489> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
you see I already have all the bikes to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.890 
you see I already have all the bikes to
show<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.400> let's<00:02:58.549> say<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.820> try<00:02:59.090> Pandora<00:02:59.600> it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
show you so let's say I try Pandora it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.770 
show you so let's say I try Pandora it
may<00:03:00.140> or<00:03:00.350> may<00:03:00.530> not<00:03:00.560> work<00:03:04.330> just<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.420> show<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.660> a

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
may or may not work just to show you a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.610 
may or may not work just to show you a
game<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:06.850> freedom<00:03:07.850> will<00:03:08.570> not<00:03:08.750> work<00:03:08.959> for<00:03:09.200> every

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
game so freedom will not work for every

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.490 
game so freedom will not work for every
game<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:11.510> probably<00:03:11.930> will<00:03:12.049> work<00:03:12.170> for<00:03:12.440> the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
game it probably will work for the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.560 
game it probably will work for the
majority<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:13.100> them<00:03:13.489> but<00:03:14.060> not<00:03:14.209> every<00:03:14.540> single

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
majority of them but not every single

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.070 
majority of them but not every single
