really nice features the first thing

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.030 
really nice features the first thing
that<00:00:38.000> you<00:00:38.210> notice<00:00:38.330> about<00:00:38.540> it<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:38.960> that<00:00:39.040> regatta

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
that you notice about it is that regatta

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.420 
that you notice about it is that regatta
braid<00:00:40.340> is<00:00:40.550> very<00:00:41.090> limp<00:00:41.750> it<00:00:42.230> has<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.530> very<00:00:43.070> soft

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
braid is very limp it has a very soft

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.729 
braid is very limp it has a very soft
hand<00:00:43.879> to<00:00:44.089> it<00:00:44.210> because<00:00:44.750> it's<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.019> combination<00:00:45.350> of

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
hand to it because it's a combination of

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.220 
hand to it because it's a combination of
filament<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.370> spun<00:00:46.700> yarns<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.930> 12

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
filament and spun yarns and the 12

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.380 
filament and spun yarns and the 12
strand<00:00:48.530> construction<00:00:49.129> makes<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:49.489> very<00:00:49.879> supple

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
strand construction makes it very supple

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.000 
strand construction makes it very supple
so<00:00:51.050> if<00:00:51.170> you're<00:00:51.320> running<00:00:51.469> this<00:00:51.710> through<00:00:51.920> a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
so if you're running this through a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.220 
so if you're running this through a
series<00:00:52.340> of<00:00:52.460> blocks<00:00:52.789> like<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.149> boom<00:00:53.750> bang<00:00:54.020> or

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
series of blocks like a boom bang or

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.700 
series of blocks like a boom bang or
mainsheet<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:55.090> runs<00:00:56.090> very<00:00:56.180> freely<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:57.289> second

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
mainsheet it runs very freely the second

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.529 
mainsheet it runs very freely the second
thing<00:00:57.800> is<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.010> because<00:00:58.670> it's<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.940> 12<00:00:59.180> strand

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
thing is that because it's a 12 strand

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.110 
thing is that because it's a 12 strand
it<00:00:59.780> refuses<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.829> ha<00:01:01.010> chol<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:01.879> if<00:01:02.030> you're

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
it refuses to ha chol so if you're

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.970 
it refuses to ha chol so if you're
letting<00:01:02.449> a<00:01:02.539> sheet<00:01:02.750> out<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.530> gets<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.800> hawk

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
letting a sheet out and it gets a hawk

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.590 
letting a sheet out and it gets a hawk
al<00:01:04.160> in<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.399> it'll<00:01:04.670> run<00:01:04.850> right<00:01:05.059> through<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.330> set

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
al in it it'll run right through a set

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.170 
al in it it'll run right through a set
of<00:01:05.690> lead<00:01:05.899> blocks<00:01:06.520> now<00:01:07.520> as<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:07.759> said<00:01:07.820> it's<00:01:08.090> a

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
of lead blocks now as I said it's a

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.910 
of lead blocks now as I said it's a
hundred<00:01:08.450> percent<00:01:08.570> polyester<00:01:08.930> construction

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
hundred percent polyester construction

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.279 
hundred percent polyester construction
but<00:01:10.399> because<00:01:10.789> it's<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.149> fairly<00:01:11.539> softly<00:01:12.080> laid

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
but because it's a fairly softly laid

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.440 
but because it's a fairly softly laid
line<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.800> stretches<00:01:13.340> at<00:01:13.460> about<00:01:13.670> three<00:01:14.210> percent

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
line it stretches at about three percent

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.540 
line it stretches at about three percent
at<00:01:14.930> fifteen<00:01:15.560> percent<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:16.009> its<00:01:16.130> breaking
