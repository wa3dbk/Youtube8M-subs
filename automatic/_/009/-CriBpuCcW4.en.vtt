 Ã¡lex mari 01 and in this video they 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.330
 I will show how to change the background image 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.240
 of the windows 7 start screen 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.669
 which is so for any image that 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.070
 We want the steps are easy to follow 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.769
 just do what I do at the bottom and everything 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.290
 it will be good to start with the 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.210
 tutorial the first thing we have to 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.640
 to do is go to the start menu and type 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.070
 regedit we will get an application that will 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.199
 called regedit point exe we open it and 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.299
 we will see this that I have on screen 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.699
 next we will unfold the folder 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:48.769
 call hkey local machine after 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.930
 we open the software folder and within 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.890
 we are looking for the microsoft folder and the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.260
 we open 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.030
 inside this we will look for the folder 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.120
 called windows and the april 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.120
 i 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.010
 inside the windows folder we will see the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.080
 folder called current version the 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.800
 we open the same and look for a folder 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.350
 call authentication 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.570
 in this folder we locate the folder 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.210
 called log on wye we open it and we'll see 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.980
 a folder called background we give 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 click and on the right side of the window 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.720
 we will see two files and double click 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.730
 who is called or in background to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 to do it we will get this window where 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.500
 we will see a value of 0 and that we have to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.500
 change by 1 as seen on the screen 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.140
 since they have changed it, they accept 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.390
 and we will finish with this part 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.100
 what follows is to look for an image that 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.940
 like it and want to fund 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.940
 Login 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.289
 the image that they have to use has 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.640
 to be of a resolution of 1,380 x 768 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.640
 and it must be jpg format 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.600
 in my case it is this if the image that 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.140
 they have does not have the resolution that they 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.000
 I say 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.710
 You can use any program to 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.720
 edit images to change the 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.790
 resolution that was what I did then 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.220
 this image does not have the resolution that 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.180
 you need good now we go with the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.209
 last part 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.329
 let's go to local disk equipment if we search 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.280
 the windows folder and open it inside 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.770
 of the folder we will look for the one that is called 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.590
 assistant 32 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.330
 within there are 32 we will locate the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.900
 folder called 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.900
 efe 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.260

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.600
 inside infor we look for the folder 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.610

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.880
 folder we will put the image that we have 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.880
 selected 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.960

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.420

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.310
