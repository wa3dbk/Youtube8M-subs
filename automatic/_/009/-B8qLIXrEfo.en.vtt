00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
showed you got the closed mold and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.469 
showed you got the closed mold and
you've<00:01:05.870> got<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.080> injection<00:01:06.940> injector<00:01:07.940> how<00:01:08.420> to

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
you've got the injection injector how to

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.140 
you've got the injection injector how to
get<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.900> proper<00:01:09.400> contact<00:01:10.400> between<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.850> mold

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
get the proper contact between the mold

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.560 
get the proper contact between the mold
and<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:12.280> injection<00:01:13.280> machine<00:01:16.450> there's<00:01:17.450> a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
and the injection machine there's a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.560 
and the injection machine there's a
cutaway<00:01:18.409> of<00:01:18.770> an<00:01:19.370> actual<00:01:19.610> injection<00:01:20.150> machines

cutaway of an actual injection machines

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.050 
cutaway of an actual injection machines
actually<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.960> big<00:01:21.170> screw<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:21.860> turns<00:01:22.670> and

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
actually a big screw that turns and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.399 
actually a big screw that turns and
forces<00:01:23.540> hot<00:01:24.340> plastic<00:01:25.780> into<00:01:26.780> your<00:01:26.930> mold<00:01:27.140> and

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
forces hot plastic into your mold and

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.310 
forces hot plastic into your mold and
you<00:01:27.460> put<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.670> powder<00:01:28.850> in<00:01:29.030> there<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:30.170> heat

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
you put the powder in there and you heat

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.300 
you put the powder in there and you heat
it<00:01:30.350> up<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.690> that's<00:01:32.690> how<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.799> gets<00:01:33.979> into

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
it up and and that's how it gets into

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.090 
it up and and that's how it gets into
the<00:01:34.340> mold<00:01:34.670> under<00:01:34.909> high<00:01:35.150> pressure<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:36.010> lot<00:01:37.010> of

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
the mold under high pressure a lot of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.950 
the mold under high pressure a lot of
things<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.460> need<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.670> know<00:01:37.970> but<00:01:38.630> it's<00:01:38.810> all

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
things you need to know but it's all

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.250 
things you need to know but it's all
it's<00:01:39.890> all<00:01:40.100> doable<00:01:42.549> hard<00:01:43.549> time<00:01:43.790> here<00:01:44.060> we<00:01:44.180> go

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
it's all doable hard time here we go

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.539 
it's all doable hard time here we go
here's<00:01:45.260> a<00:01:46.150> for<00:01:47.150> example<00:01:47.240> there's<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:48.549> diagram

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
here's a for example there's a diagram

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.200 
here's a for example there's a diagram
of<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.820> correct<00:01:50.500> nozzle<00:01:51.500> screw<00:01:51.770> contact<00:01:52.369> to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
of the correct nozzle screw contact to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.140 
of the correct nozzle screw contact to
get<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.979> know<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.310> doesn't<00:01:55.580> leak<00:01:55.729> out<00:01:55.970> at

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
get you know so it doesn't leak out at

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.480 
get you know so it doesn't leak out at
the<00:01:56.270> at<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.080> joint<00:01:57.619> where<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.860> machine<00:01:58.220> meets

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
the at the joint where the machine meets

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.899 
the at the joint where the machine meets
the<00:01:58.700> mold<00:02:00.100> things<00:02:01.100> like<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.460> need<00:02:01.759> to

the mold things like that you need to

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.230 
the mold things like that you need to
know<00:02:02.320> here<00:02:03.320> we've<00:02:03.470> got<00:02:03.680> some<00:02:04.369> more<00:02:04.549> round<00:02:04.909> some

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
know here we've got some more round some

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.870 
know here we've got some more round some
taco<00:02:05.479> mechanisms<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.350> your<00:02:06.530> mold<00:02:06.770> opening<00:02:07.759> and

closing the mold automatically if you're

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.409 
closing the mold automatically if you're
making<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.769> lot<00:02:09.799> of<00:02:09.950> parts<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.999> don't<00:02:11.029> want<00:02:11.359> to
