00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.190
 for which I always have one 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.330
 blazing speech for years and years 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.310
 Believe me personally 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.770
 a much larger part of the asset 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.820
 as 20 30 percent in gold and silver and 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.710
 Not for two years 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.539
 but for many years have created 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.460
 that also gives me that 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.840
 momentary rest because I am currently 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.219
 clearly ahead and I can yes 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.899
 after feeling who a two years ago 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:33.430
 first attention to gold and silver 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.200
 was and now is back that the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.770
 at the moment already pain for you 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 but with what I give them all on the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.150
 want to give away is the following comparison 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.180
 if you open the newspaper today 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.430
 or yesterday you have a quote 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.320
 george soros can read this 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.130
 patch a manager of well over 80 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.100
 is now 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.350
 and he was then quoted as saying 2011 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.110
 Gold has already been talked about 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.670
 an ultimate bubble occurred and 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.750
 I think that just more mature for 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.130
 nonsense and if that is the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.509
 Mainstream media that I did was 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.369
 Yesterday also with journalists on the way 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.399
 if that's the mainstream media like that 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.320
 I think that is not good for spreading 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.560
 and makes it every journalist's symbol 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 why am i of this opinion everything 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.870
 promoted gold until the year 180 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.720
 corresponded to the gold price high in the year 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:27.159
 1980 of 850 US dollars each troy ounce 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.020
 23 percent of the world at that time 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.590
 Financial assets and financial assets 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.479
 consists of the bank deposits from the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.799
 amount of money thus out of the bonds 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.760
 you pull securities in your window 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.119
 including government bonds 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.080
 bank bonds 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.570
 corporate bonds and of stocks and shares 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.180
 Today we are up to date when I am 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.310
 world financial year 2011 as 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.900
 we are very up to date 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.150
 3.5 percent 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.159
 we are miles away from the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.530
 bubble that we had in fact because that 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.870
 what we experienced in 1980 was in the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.610
 did a bubble 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.500
 and since I now myself young 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.940
 grumble and for silver as an investment 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.140
 I fight them as I pay them 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.480
 Include silver immediately 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.700
 At the time, silver was 15 percent 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.340
 So all promoted silver made 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.850
 then the value of 50 US dollar per 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.260
 fine ounce on january 18, 1980 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.530
 Proud 15 percent of the financial assets 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.470
 we are currently at 0.56 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.150
 percent at today's prices so I say 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.100
 I do not want to see them in the 15s 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.510
 consider it dubious that the humans 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.920
 cheeky today on the way 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.780
 if we give at five percent 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.470
 it will be the silver boy 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.470
 suffice
