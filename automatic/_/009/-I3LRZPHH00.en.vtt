00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
changing the disc make sure

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.870 
changing the disc make sure
disconnect<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.100> air<00:02:14.280> cutter<00:02:14.520> from<00:02:14.760> the

as<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.240> see<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.660> three<00:02:18.900> inch<00:02:19.170> high<00:02:19.410> speed

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
as you can see the three inch high speed

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.260 
as you can see the three inch high speed
air<00:02:19.860> cutter<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.700> one<00:02:20.970> tool<00:02:21.240> that

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
air cutter is the one tool that

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.350 
air cutter is the one tool that
definitely<00:02:22.200> makes<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.740> cut<00:02:23.040> I'm<00:02:23.280> Pat<00:02:24.060> and
