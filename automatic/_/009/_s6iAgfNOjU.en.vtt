00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.469 
here I've got this timer ante by gallon
pail<00:01:14.500> let's<00:01:15.500> see<00:01:15.770> now<00:01:15.950> start<00:01:16.490> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:30.899 

right<00:01:22.479> around<00:01:22.600> four<00:01:23.020> seconds<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:29.909> something

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
right around four seconds now something

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.240 
right around four seconds now something
else<00:01:31.119> I<00:01:31.300> got<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.630> thinking<00:01:31.990> what<00:01:32.770> would<00:01:32.860> happen

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
else I got to thinking what would happen

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.880 
else I got to thinking what would happen
is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.530 

I<00:01:37.380> use<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.530> 99-cent<00:01:39.220> ball<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.659> is<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:40.840> 99-cent

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
I use the 99-cent ball this is a 99-cent

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.390 
I use the 99-cent ball this is a 99-cent
rubber<00:01:43.540> ball<00:01:44.280> put<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.400> in<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.670> tube<00:01:47.400> and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
rubber ball put this in the tube and

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.280 
rubber ball put this in the tube and
then<00:01:48.520> again<00:01:49.050> quickly<00:01:50.050> bring<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.500> over<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.800> top

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.500 

like<00:01:54.830> at<00:01:54.980> that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.680 

which

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.540 

we<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.350> ball<00:02:01.440> mill<00:02:02.010> is<00:02:02.190> spinning

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
we just see the ball mill is spinning

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.219 
we just see the ball mill is spinning
around<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:04.220> it's<00:02:05.220> still<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> lot<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> pressure

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.399 

and<00:02:08.800> for<00:02:09.250> whatever<00:02:09.399> it's<00:02:09.640> worth<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:11.050> can<00:02:11.230> take

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
and for whatever it's worth you can take

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:17.660 
and for whatever it's worth you can take
this<00:02:11.560> ball<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:14.400> move<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.549> over<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
this ball and move it over to the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.119 
this ball and move it over to the
swallow<00:02:18.670> siphon<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.860> get<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.099> same

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
swallow siphon and you get the same

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.880 
swallow siphon and you get the same
effect<00:02:22.409> and<00:02:23.409> all<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:25.560> really<00:02:26.560> good

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
effect and all of this is really good

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.250 
effect and all of this is really good
because<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.489> this<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.879> can<00:02:28.030> get<00:02:28.209> maybe<00:02:28.510> 4,500

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
because of this you can get maybe 4,500

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.140 
because of this you can get maybe 4,500
gallons<00:02:29.739> an<00:02:30.069> hour<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.489> water<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.480> much<00:02:32.140> less

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
gallons an hour of water this much less

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.930 
gallons an hour of water this much less
maybe<00:02:34.170> might<00:02:35.170> amuse<00:02:35.379> certain<00:02:35.860> people<00:02:36.250> maybe

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
maybe might amuse certain people maybe

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.220 
maybe might amuse certain people maybe
it<00:02:37.090> was<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.420> larger<00:02:37.810> ball<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:39.190> would<00:02:39.400> also

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
it was the larger ball it would also

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.509 
it was the larger ball it would also
design<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.829> can<00:02:41.950> have<00:02:42.099> something<00:02:42.430> on

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
design that you can have something on

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.680 
design that you can have something on
the<00:02:42.610> outside<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.239> ball<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.680> would

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the outside of the ball and it would

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.839 
the outside of the ball and it would
send<00:02:46.690> off<00:02:46.900> light<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:48.160> can<00:02:48.310> use<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.549> a<00:02:48.640> night

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
send off light you can use it a night

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.479 
send off light you can use it a night
you<00:02:49.629> know<00:02:49.750> at<00:02:49.900> night<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.349> might<00:02:50.620> work<00:02:50.829> grab

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
you know at night this might work grab

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.640 
you know at night this might work grab
the<00:02:51.609> ball<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.180> some<00:02:52.480> reflective<00:02:53.019> material<00:02:53.530> on

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
the ball and some reflective material on

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.160 
the ball and some reflective material on
and<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.069> light<00:02:54.280> shine<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:55.450> might<00:02:55.660> shoot<00:02:55.930> like

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
and a light shine it might shoot like

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.640 
and a light shine it might shoot like
all<00:02:56.890> over<00:02:56.920> as<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.910> some<00:02:58.090> reason<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:59.560> not

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
all over as in some reason it's not

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.910 
all over as in some reason it's not
rotating<00:03:00.989> kind<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.109> staying<00:03:02.379> in<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.739> same
