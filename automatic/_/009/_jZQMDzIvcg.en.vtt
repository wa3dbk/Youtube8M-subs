 the creator of the single player map 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.760

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.700
 selective shtick of the strings 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.700
 your friend is going to have 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.240

 and you will see what 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:00.640
 putting here maybe it's not worth 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.640
 not worth in some people not 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.750
