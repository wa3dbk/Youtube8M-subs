podium on in a number of events and I

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.069 
podium on in a number of events and I
can't<00:00:55.489> predict<00:00:55.850> how<00:00:56.329> many<00:00:56.539> medals<00:00:56.840> that's

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
can't predict how many medals that's

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
that's going to turn out to be but our

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.080 
that's going to turn out to be but our
focus<00:00:59.149> is<00:00:59.840> just<00:01:00.140> on<00:01:00.410> executing<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.640> perfect

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
forward to starting in autumn I think

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.530 
forward to starting in autumn I think
we've<00:02:17.709> got<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.249> best<00:02:18.670> team<00:02:18.939> we've<00:02:19.150> ever<00:02:19.299> had

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
we've got the best team we've ever had

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.500 
we've got the best team we've ever had
here<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:20.609> not<00:02:21.609> only<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.939> we've<00:02:22.269> got<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
here and not only that we've got the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.170 
here and not only that we've got the
home<00:02:22.659> crowd<00:02:23.099> home<00:02:24.099> support<00:02:24.549> and<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.969> think

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
home crowd home support and I think

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.550 
home crowd home support and I think
that's<00:02:25.329> going<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.510> be<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.629> huge<00:02:25.750> advantage<00:02:25.959> to

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
that's going to be a huge advantage to

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.559 
that's going to be a huge advantage to
everyone<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.219> team<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:27.430> yeah<00:02:28.329> definitely

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
everyone on the team so yeah definitely

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.319 
everyone on the team so yeah definitely
think<00:02:29.079> we<00:02:29.409> should<00:02:29.889> do<00:02:30.010> better<00:02:30.250> than<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.549> lasting

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
think we should do better than a lasting

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.869 
think we should do better than a lasting
