the mask integrator the mask integrator
lets<00:00:14.830> you<00:00:14.980> mask<00:00:15.250> and<00:00:15.610> crop<00:00:15.969> very<00:00:16.299> complex

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
lets you mask and crop very complex

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.470 
lets you mask and crop very complex

if<00:00:34.059> you<00:00:34.629> want<00:00:34.750> to<00:00:34.930> test<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.320> mask<00:00:35.530> integrator

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
if you want to test the mask integrator

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.190 
if you want to test the mask integrator
but<00:00:36.489> have<00:00:36.670> no<00:00:36.850> adequate<00:00:37.180> pictures<00:00:37.780> yet<00:00:38.050> to
