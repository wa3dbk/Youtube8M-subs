city because I guess there are different
places<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.289> have<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.590> same<00:01:32.770> zip<00:01:32.979> code<00:01:33.039> I

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
places that have the same zip code I

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:52.660 
places that have the same zip code I
guess<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.729> will<00:01:39.819> reload

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
save and then done and then you do the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.190 
save and then done and then you do the
same<00:04:02.540> thing<00:04:02.900> with<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.820> wallpaper<00:04:04.820> HTML<00:04:05.540> and

same thing with the wallpaper HTML and

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.640 
same thing with the wallpaper HTML and
then<00:04:06.590> that<00:04:06.800> will<00:04:06.980> change<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.489> location<00:04:07.670> of

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650
