one which was didn't work very well and

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.410 
one which was didn't work very well and
I've<00:01:04.100> realized<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:04.850> there's<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.119> lot<00:01:05.149> of

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
I've realized that there's a lot of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.099 
I've realized that there's a lot of
metal<00:01:05.960> rod<00:01:06.170> for<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.439> spices<00:01:07.130> Kia<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.109> am

there's<00:01:09.829> a<00:01:09.889> metal<00:01:10.249> rod<00:01:10.399> to<00:01:10.549> me<00:01:10.670> see<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.119> I'll

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:11.209 
there's a metal rod to me see it so I'll

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:15.969 
there's a metal rod to me see it so I'll
replace<00:01:11.539> that<00:01:11.779> with<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.759> an<00:01:13.759> old<00:01:13.969> arrow<00:01:14.679> and<00:01:15.679> see

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
replace that with a an old arrow and see

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.649 
replace that with a an old arrow and see
what's<00:01:16.219> really<00:01:16.459> well<00:01:16.700> nice<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.179> comfortable

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
what's really well nice and comfortable

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.559 
what's really well nice and comfortable
for<00:01:18.409> me<00:01:18.590> being<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:19.099> bit<00:01:19.219> chunky<00:01:19.639> it's<00:01:19.969> a<00:01:20.179> little

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
for me being a bit chunky it's a little

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.300 
for me being a bit chunky it's a little
bit<00:01:20.689> on<00:01:20.749> the<00:01:20.869> tight<00:01:21.049> side<00:01:21.349> the<00:01:21.950> distance

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
bit on the tight side the distance

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.599 
bit on the tight side the distance
between<00:01:22.969> where<00:01:23.659> your<00:01:23.990> thighs<00:01:24.170> roll<00:01:24.579> it's<00:01:25.579> a

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609 
between where your thighs roll it's a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.639 
between where your thighs roll it's a
little<00:01:25.880> bit<00:01:25.999> tight<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:26.869> if<00:01:26.990> you're<00:01:27.109> any<00:01:27.259> bigger

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
little bit tight so if you're any bigger

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.279 
little bit tight so if you're any bigger
than<00:01:27.829> say<00:01:28.310> maybe<00:01:29.029> sixteen<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.599> half<00:01:29.630> 17

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
than say maybe sixteen and a half 17

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.739 
than say maybe sixteen and a half 17
stone<00:01:30.649> you're<00:01:31.039> bit<00:01:31.189> wide<00:01:31.479> probably<00:01:32.479> not<00:01:32.630> for

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
stone you're bit wide probably not for

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:34.959 
stone you're bit wide probably not for
you<00:01:32.810> it's<00:01:33.169> not<00:01:33.319> a<00:01:33.349> very<00:01:33.649> big<00:01:33.679> car<00:01:34.069> it's<00:01:34.669> not

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
you it's not a very big car it's not

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.269 
you it's not a very big car it's not
very<00:01:35.240> long<00:01:35.359> so<00:01:35.419> about<00:01:35.799> about<00:01:36.799> nine<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.039> our

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:37.279 
very long so about about nine and our

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:40.510 
very long so about about nine and our
foot<00:01:37.579> something<00:01:37.880> like<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.209> long<00:01:39.159> so<00:01:40.159> I'm

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
foot something like that long so I'm

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.669 
foot something like that long so I'm
probably<00:01:40.909> about<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.539> limit<00:01:41.840> of<00:01:41.990> its<00:01:42.319> capacity

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
probably about the limit of its capacity

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.419 
probably about the limit of its capacity
and<00:01:43.459> on<00:01:43.909> that<00:01:44.359> note<00:01:44.539> when<00:01:45.169> I<00:01:45.200> am<00:01:45.469> climbing<00:01:45.799> in<00:01:46.340> a

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
and on that note when I am climbing in a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.969 
and on that note when I am climbing in a
river<00:01:46.669> I<00:01:46.999> cannot<00:01:47.659> draw<00:01:47.959> a<00:01:47.989> kayak<00:01:48.499> this<00:01:48.799> and

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
river I cannot draw a kayak this and

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.529 
river I cannot draw a kayak this and
what<00:01:49.069> I<00:01:49.099> mean<00:01:49.189> by<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:49.639> is<00:01:49.849> I<00:01:49.909> can't<00:01:50.179> go<00:01:50.419> out

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
what I mean by that is I can't go out

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.330 
what I mean by that is I can't go out
and<00:01:50.659> quite<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.109> stay<00:01:51.289> dry<00:01:51.499> weather<00:01:51.979> carry

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
and quite and stay dry weather carry

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.870 
and quite and stay dry weather carry
might<00:01:52.579> happen<00:01:52.819> and<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.899> reason<00:01:54.200> for<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.380> is

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
might happen and the reason for that is

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.940 
might happen and the reason for that is
water<00:01:55.880> when<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.689> pedaled<00:01:57.109> hard<00:01:57.139> and<00:01:57.560> when<00:01:57.649> I<00:01:57.679> saw

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
water when I pedaled hard and when I saw

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.289 
water when I pedaled hard and when I saw
that<00:01:58.099> I<00:01:58.159> stopped<00:01:58.549> or<00:01:58.759> any<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:58.939> your<00:01:59.029> waves

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
that I stopped or any of your waves

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.080 
that I stopped or any of your waves
