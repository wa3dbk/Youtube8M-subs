00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:06.379
 Cool fantasy. 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.063
 Today is Friday, I can wear whatever you want 

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:11.122
 And this is not a fantasy, it's an Adventurer's robe. 

00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:12.386
 This is Thursday, Michael. 

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:13.917
 You look like a musketeer 

00:00:13.918 --> 00:00:15.423
 You look like a gay musketeer 

00:00:15.424 --> 00:00:17.004
 You look like my gay uncle, a musketeer 

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:20.868
 You look like what I imagine to be his gay uncle dressed as a musketeer 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.350
 Yes, it should be 

00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:23.709
 He must... 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 Maybe dude 

00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:27.070
 Do you have the same tattoos? 

00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:28.175
 I do not have tattoos 

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:29.317
 Michael told me 

00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:30.619
 Michael is a liar. 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.585
 I'm waiting for someone 

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:32.805
 Let me guess... 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.900
 I hate my job 

00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.198
 I'm tired. I'm going to resign 

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:44.448
 A new one should be simple 

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:49.447
 Oh no! Here we go, in rhythm 

00:00:49.513 --> 00:00:50.513
 (here we go) Hunting gold, that's the goal 

00:00:50.514 --> 00:00:52.533
 (here we go) or else we have been enrolled 

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:53.534
 (in rhythm) I think we've all played 

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:54.830
 (on the beat) so I do not care what you say 

00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:57.025
 (hunting for gold) Because every day we play live RPG 

00:00:57.097 --> 00:00:58.580
 Every day we play RPG live 

00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:01.293
 I'm not a little worker, with a boring routine 

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.482
 (kisses her on the mouth) I kiss a girl in the mouth, just to remind her 

00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:04.873
 (kisses her on the mouth) I'm not a stranger to danger 

00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:06.417
 I personally am an Adventurer. 

00:01:06.418 --> 00:01:08.005
 I have a Black Elf and a Magician in my group 

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:09.964
 So do not think we're scared of you 

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:11.519
 I'm a Black Elf 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.950
 I am stupidity in person 

00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:14.598
 (this stupid is so bad) Cut throats, kill people 

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:15.599
 (this stupid one is so bad) trying to be myself 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.513
 I'm like, "Do not be crazy, because I'm bad." 

00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:21.065
 You know, I was born this way. 

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.437
 (Uncle Larry!) It's like being gay 

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:24.972
 (Uncle Larry!) Oh, no! Here we go, in rhythm 

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:26.874
 (here we go) Hunting gold, that's the goal 

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:28.498
 (here we go) or else we have been enrolled 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:29.499
 (in rhythm) I think we've all played 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.322
 (on the beat) so I do not care what you say 

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.043
 (hunting for gold) Because every day we play live RPG 

00:01:33.044 --> 00:01:34.512
 Every day we play RPG live 

00:01:34.513 --> 00:01:37.427
 Oh no! Here we go, in rhythm 

00:01:37.428 --> 00:01:39.078
 (here we go) Hunting gold, that's the goal 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.106
 (here we go) or else we have been enrolled 

00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:41.532
 (in rhythm) I think we've all played 

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:42.959
 (on the beat) so I do not care what you say 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.025
 (hunting for gold) Because every day we play live RPG 

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:46.223
 Every day we play live RPG 

00:01:46.224 --> 00:01:47.999
 Rule 1: Do not hit the face 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.409
 Rule 2: If you are hit on the leg, kneel and shout 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.063
 If you get hit again then you're out 

00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:53.657
 Rule 3: Remember these ... 

00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:58.626
 (Follow these rules) 

00:01:58.627 --> 00:02:00.255
 Look at their faces. 

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:01.559
 see your fear 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.533
 (the Mage appears) A cloud of smoke and the Mage appears 

00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:07.629
 I do not care if you notice my cool look 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.630
 in my charming talent 

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:10.217
 in my white hair and fluttering Mago 

00:02:10.218 --> 00:02:13.355
 Oh no! Here we go, in rhythm 

00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:14.954
 (here we go) Hunting gold, that's the goal 

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:16.427
 (here we go) or else we have been enrolled 

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:17.440
 (in rhythm) I think we've all played 

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:18.986
 (on the beat) so I do not care what you say 

00:02:18.987 --> 00:02:21.002
 (hunting for gold) Because every day we play live RPG 

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:22.489
 Every day we play live RPG 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.406
 Oh no! Here we go, in rhythm 

00:02:25.407 --> 00:02:26.967

 (hunting for gold) Because every day we play live RPG 

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:34.585
 Every day we play live RPG 

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:36.951
 Wait, is this how to play WOW? 

00:02:36.952 --> 00:02:38.593
 No, Ogres sucker. I'm a real wizard kicker. 

00:02:38.594 --> 00:02:39.937
 If you giggle it will make my sword grow 

00:02:39.938 --> 00:02:40.938
 For all of you WOW kids: 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:41.939
 you know what is "classless" 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.042
 (gargle fucking goblin?) or who gargle goblin fucking 

00:02:43.043 --> 00:02:46.281
 (gargareja fucking goblin?) And it's not PC in this PVE for another online RPG 

00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:47.987
 But it's not PVP either, it's you against me 

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:49.114
 and I make my PVC weapons 

00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:50.218
 (PVC) I am loyal to this game 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.664
 (PVC) I have a unicorn tattoo 

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:53.393
 So, you all envious 

00:02:53.394 --> 00:02:54.798
 Is this real enough for you? 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.191
 I'm a Wizard. I'm an elf. 

00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:58.047
 I like to spank. Yourself. 

00:02:58.048 --> 00:02:59.144
 You are nothing. Adventurers tell 

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:01.045
 I challenge you to a duel 

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:12.805
 (We're dueling for fun) 

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:15.009
 Watch me cut. Watch me hit 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.401
 See me decided, spend that money 

00:03:16.402 --> 00:03:17.651
 Virgins sing their mermaid songs 

00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:19.051
 Let me see that iron floss. 

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:20.654
 Belts of chastity excite me a lot 

00:03:20.654 --> 00:03:22.462
 The Magus scepter grows hard and long 

00:03:22.463 --> 00:03:24.076
 Playing from R to P to G - LIVE 

00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:25.540
 Hand on the handle, grab the sword and 

00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.059
 Oh no! Here we go, in rhythm 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.988
