nose slide you basically will be
approaching<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.019> ledge<00:00:46.199> with<00:00:46.769> enough<00:00:47.339> speed

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
approaching the ledge with enough speed

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.069 
approaching the ledge with enough speed
so<00:00:47.699> once<00:00:48.269> you<00:00:48.420> get<00:00:48.510> into<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> ledge<00:00:48.960> you're

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
fight keep flicking those slide and then

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.360 
fight keep flicking those slide and then
I<00:02:10.509> would<00:02:10.660> say<00:02:10.840> one<00:02:11.140> towards<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.590> end<00:02:11.830> is<00:02:12.099> a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
I would say one towards the end is a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.759 
I would say one towards the end is a
frontside<00:02:12.849> lipslide<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:14.410> once<00:02:14.620> you

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
frontside lipslide and then once you

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.100 
frontside lipslide and then once you
once<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.310> go<00:02:15.489> all<00:02:15.610> those<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.150> you're<00:02:16.840> doing

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
once you go all those and you're doing

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.550 
once you go all those and you're doing
pretty<00:02:17.200> well<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:18.190> would<00:02:19.060> say<00:02:19.329> work<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:20.170> them<00:02:20.350> and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
pretty well I would say work on them and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.930 
pretty well I would say work on them and
I'll<00:02:21.340> see<00:02:21.549> you<00:02:21.640> next<00:02:21.670> time<00:02:21.970> Cheers
