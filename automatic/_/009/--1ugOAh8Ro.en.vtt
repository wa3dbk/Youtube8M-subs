underneath<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.600> thing<00:00:51.749> in<00:00:51.870> turn<00:00:52.050> will<00:00:52.260> be

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:52.679 
underneath little thing in turn will be

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:54.590 
underneath little thing in turn will be
able<00:00:52.859> to<00:00:52.920> angle<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.309> down<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.879> case<00:00:53.940> you're

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
able to angle it down in case you're

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.419 
able to angle it down in case you're
trying<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.260> cover<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.859> little<00:00:56.159> different

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
trying to cover a little different

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.130 
trying to cover a little different
pattern<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.850> they're<00:00:56.999> very<00:00:57.030> adaptable<00:00:57.839> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
pattern so they're very adaptable and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.500 
pattern so they're very adaptable and
they<00:00:58.620> sound<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.249> million<00:00:59.969> bucks<00:00:59.999> they

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
they sound like a million bucks they

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.450 
they sound like a million bucks they
also<00:01:00.659> have<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> locking<00:01:01.379> power<00:01:01.769> cable<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.339> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
also have a locking power cable on the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
also have a locking power cable on the
back<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.329> can't<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.839> trip<00:01:04.050> over<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
back so you can't just trip over it and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.469 
back so you can't just trip over it and
pull<00:01:04.620> it<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:05.090> alright<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.210> we're<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
pull it out alright now we're going to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
pull it out alright now we're going to
talk<00:01:06.630> about<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> vop<00:01:07.229> bucket<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.920> power<00:01:08.100> we're

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
talk about the vop bucket of power we're

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
talk about the vop bucket of power we're
going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.610> over<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> feature<00:01:09.240> sets<00:01:09.600> on

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
going to go over all the feature sets on

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.260 
going to go over all the feature sets on
the<00:01:09.960> back<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> speaker's<00:01:11.370> here<00:01:11.400> we're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the back of the speaker's here we're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.640 
the back of the speaker's here we're
going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.479> start<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:12.870> you've<00:01:13.200> got<00:01:13.440> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
going to start right here you've got the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
going to start right here you've got the
low-frequency<00:01:14.719> application<00:01:15.719> switch<00:01:15.990> here

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
low-frequency application switch here

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.560 
low-frequency application switch here
you've<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:17.030> external<00:01:18.030> sub<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.450> you're

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you've got the external sub when you're

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.670 
you've got the external sub when you're
running<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.899> with<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> sudden<00:01:19.350> you've<00:01:19.530> got

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
running it with the sudden you've got

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.969 
running it with the sudden you've got
the<00:01:19.860> normal<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.030> middle<00:01:21.329> here<00:01:21.680> which<00:01:22.680> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the normal in the middle here which is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
the normal in the middle here which is
just<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.490> normal<00:01:23.700> full<00:01:23.969> range<00:01:24.180> application<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
just a normal full range application and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.959 
just a normal full range application and
on<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> bottom<00:01:25.860> you've<00:01:26.189> got<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.490> deep<00:01:26.670> switch

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
on the bottom you've got the deep switch

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.730 
on the bottom you've got the deep switch
what<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.360> does<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.869> allows<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.469> to<00:01:28.619> have

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
what that does is it allows you to have

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
what that does is it allows you to have
a<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.009> bit<00:01:29.189> low<00:01:29.369> end<00:01:29.610> extension<00:01:30.180> kind<00:01:30.659> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
a little bit low end extension kind of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.660 
a little bit low end extension kind of
gives<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.049> more<00:01:31.380> low<00:01:31.680> end<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.100> fuller<00:01:32.340> sound

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
gives you a more low end a fuller sound

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.209 
gives you a more low end a fuller sound
almost<00:01:33.000> kind<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.479> having<00:01:33.719> a<00:01:33.960> sub<00:01:34.229> next

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
almost kind of like having a sub next

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:36.590 
almost kind of like having a sub next
that<00:01:35.369> you've<00:01:35.520> got<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> high<00:01:36.030> frequency

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
that you've got the high frequency

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
that you've got the high frequency
switch<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.049> you've<00:01:37.200> got<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.710> vocal<00:01:38.340> booth

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
switch here you've got a vocal booth

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.649 
switch here you've got a vocal booth
with<00:01:38.700> gives<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.450> more
