00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.519 
people change spark plugs in small
engine<00:00:24.590> equipment<00:00:25.070> like<00:00:25.900> way<00:00:26.900> more<00:00:26.930> up<00:00:27.320> and

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
engine equipment like way more up and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.460 
engine equipment like way more up and
than<00:00:27.619> they<00:00:27.710> need<00:00:27.920> to<00:00:28.930> they<00:00:29.930> sell<00:00:30.200> them<00:00:30.349> in

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
than they need to they sell them in

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.440 
than they need to they sell them in
department<00:00:31.009> stores<00:00:31.250> they<00:00:31.640> sell<00:00:31.670> spark<00:00:32.239> plugs

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
department stores they sell spark plugs

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.069 
department stores they sell spark plugs
everywhere<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.970> yes<00:00:34.970> they<00:00:35.180> follow<00:00:35.480> more<00:00:35.840> than

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
everywhere and yes they follow more than

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.880 
everywhere and yes they follow more than
the<00:00:36.890> spark<00:00:37.160> plug<00:00:37.310> in<00:00:37.399> a<00:00:37.489> car<00:00:37.899> but<00:00:38.899> you<00:00:39.710> don't

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
the spark plug in a car but you don't

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.069 
the spark plug in a car but you don't
have<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:40.130> put<00:00:40.310> a<00:00:40.340> new<00:00:40.489> spark<00:00:40.820> plug<00:00:41.000> in<00:00:41.180> your<00:00:41.390> in

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
have to put a new spark plug in your in

have to put a new spark plug in your in
your<00:00:42.290> small<00:00:42.530> engine<00:00:42.890> every<00:00:43.190> year<00:00:43.430> especially

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
your small engine every year especially

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.670 
your small engine every year especially
on<00:00:44.390> something<00:00:44.720> like<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:44.870> rototiller<00:00:45.320> were<00:00:45.559> you

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
on something like a rototiller were you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.139 
on something like a rototiller were you
just<00:00:45.860> abused<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.340> heck<00:00:46.460> out<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.640> it<00:00:46.820> for<00:00:46.970> four

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
just abused the heck out of it for four

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.470 
just abused the heck out of it for four
hours<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.570> then<00:00:47.660> put<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:47.989> away<00:00:48.609> so<00:00:49.609> what<00:00:50.359> I've

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
hours and then put it away so what I've

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.599 
hours and then put it away so what I've
got<00:00:50.510> then<00:00:50.870> in<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.050> next<00:00:51.320> little<00:00:51.590> video<00:00:51.859> is<00:00:52.219> is

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
got then in this next little video is is

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.599 
got then in this next little video is is
how<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:52.850> tell<00:00:53.390> if<00:00:54.199> a<00:00:54.469> spark<00:00:54.829> plug<00:00:54.920> is<00:00:55.190> actually

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
how to tell if a spark plug is actually

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.340 
how to tell if a spark plug is actually
any<00:00:55.789> good<00:00:56.030> or<00:00:56.149> not<00:00:56.179> and<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:56.690> can<00:00:56.839> use<00:00:57.019> a<00:00:57.050> wire

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
any good or not and you can use a wire

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.310 
any good or not and you can use a wire
brush<00:00:57.379> or<00:00:58.039> a<00:00:58.579> bench<00:00:59.300> grinder<00:00:59.390> with<00:00:59.839> a<00:00:59.870> brush<00:01:00.140> on

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
brush or a bench grinder with a brush on

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.049 
brush or a bench grinder with a brush on
it<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:00.589> cleaning<00:01:00.769> them<00:01:00.920> up<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:01.249> gap<00:01:01.460> them<00:01:01.730> and

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
it and cleaning them up and gap them and

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.020 
it and cleaning them up and gap them and
then<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.170> can<00:01:03.320> use<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.469> an<00:01:04.309> ohm<00:01:04.550> meter<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:05.000> check

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
then you can use a an ohm meter to check

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.880 
then you can use a an ohm meter to check
and<00:01:05.420> see<00:01:05.480> if<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:05.870> spark<00:01:06.140> plug<00:01:06.380> is<00:01:06.410> actually

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
and see if that spark plug is actually

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.880 
and see if that spark plug is actually
okay<00:01:07.190> or<00:01:07.370> not<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:07.850> in<00:01:08.420> this<00:01:08.570> next<00:01:08.890> little

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
okay or not and in this next little

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.990 
okay or not and in this next little
video<00:01:10.730> will<00:01:11.690> show<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:11.990> how<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.409> tell<00:01:12.920> if<00:01:13.100> a

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
video will show you how to tell if a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.800 
video will show you how to tell if a
spark<00:01:14.270> plug<00:01:14.480> is<00:01:14.510> electrically<00:01:15.080> okay<00:01:16.810> now

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
spark plug is electrically okay now

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.870 
spark plug is electrically okay now

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
maybe it's my Scotch back Scottish

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.690 
generations ago but I have a hard time
separating<00:01:24.079> with<00:01:24.530> my<00:01:24.680> money<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.130> it<00:01:25.549> really

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
separating with my money and it really

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.719 
separating with my money and it really
drives<00:01:26.030> me<00:01:26.299> crazy<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.720> people<00:01:26.899> would<00:01:27.700> go<00:01:28.700> to

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
drives me crazy that people would go to

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.600 
drives me crazy that people would go to
fix<00:01:29.030> their<00:01:29.210> own<00:01:29.329> machines<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:31.430> they're

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
fix their own machines and they're

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.179 
fix their own machines and they're
trying<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:31.820> save<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.119> buck<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.540> are<00:01:33.290> essentially

ripped<00:01:34.430> off<00:01:34.610> by<00:01:34.909> replacing<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.600> spark<00:01:35.899> plug

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930

every<00:01:36.380> year<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.430> know<00:01:37.549> a<00:01:38.530> lawnmower<00:01:39.530> might

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
every year you know a lawnmower might

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.300 
every year you know a lawnmower might
have<00:01:41.110> 50<00:01:42.110> hours<00:01:42.409> on<00:01:42.619> it<00:01:42.770> at<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.979> end<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.219> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
have 50 hours on it at the end of the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.050 
have 50 hours on it at the end of the
year<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.240> that's<00:01:44.930> not<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.170> lot<00:01:45.610> so<00:01:46.610> anyway

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
year and that's not a lot so anyway

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.459 
year and that's not a lot so anyway
that's<00:01:47.240> my<00:01:47.450> opinion<00:01:47.689> I'm<00:01:47.960> probably<00:01:48.110> gonna<00:01:48.320> get

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
that's my opinion I'm probably gonna get

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.219 
that's my opinion I'm probably gonna get
some<00:01:48.680> negative<00:01:48.829> feedback<00:01:49.430> on<00:01:49.640> this<00:01:49.789> one<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:50.810> I

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
some negative feedback on this one but I

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.539 
some negative feedback on this one but I
think<00:01:51.680> if<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:51.920> clean<00:01:52.130> them<00:01:52.219> up<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
think if you clean them up and the

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.190 
think if you clean them up and the
electrode<00:01:52.939> doesn't<00:01:53.299> look<00:01:53.450> too<00:01:53.600> grounded<00:01:53.810> off

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
electrode doesn't look too grounded off

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.240 
electrode doesn't look too grounded off
and<00:01:54.939> they<00:01:55.939> test<00:01:56.270> okay<00:01:56.990> electrically<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.799> think

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
and they test okay electrically I think

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.569 
and they test okay electrically I think
that<00:01:58.399> it's<00:01:58.549> okay<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.880> keep<00:01:59.149> using<00:01:59.359> them

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
that it's okay to keep using them

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.440 
that it's okay to keep using them
especially<00:02:01.579> they're<00:02:01.969> really<00:02:02.180> good<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:03.200> know

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
especially they're really good you know

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.590 
especially they're really good you know

like that they are well made heavy plug

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.820 
like that they are well made heavy plug
and<00:02:12.710> they<00:02:13.550> can<00:02:13.730> go<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> long<00:02:14.120> time

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
and they can go a long time

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.750 
and they can go a long time
so<00:02:15.310> bla<00:02:15.640> bla<00:02:15.820> bla<00:02:16.000> bla<00:02:16.060> bla<00:02:16.510> bla<00:02:16.600> bla<00:02:16.930> bla<00:02:17.260> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
so bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.980 
so bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla and
have<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> look<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.120> little<00:02:19.300> video<00:02:19.510> next<00:02:19.750> and

have a look at the little video next and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.940 
have a look at the little video next and
we'll<00:02:20.170> see<00:02:20.380> how<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.560> goes

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
we'll see how it goes

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.930 
we'll see how it goes

do<00:02:28.240> sparkplugs<00:02:29.170> 101<00:02:30.480> we<00:02:31.480> have<00:02:31.630> two<00:02:31.930> spark

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
do sparkplugs 101 we have two spark

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.240 
do sparkplugs 101 we have two spark
plugs<00:02:32.410> here<00:02:32.920> one<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.970> labeled<00:02:34.450> bad<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.320> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
plugs here one is labeled bad and the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.510 
plugs here one is labeled bad and the
other<00:02:36.370> one<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.760> just<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.330> normal<00:02:37.510> good<00:02:37.930> plug

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
other one is just a normal good plug

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.160 
other one is just a normal good plug
neither<00:02:39.520> one<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.850> these<00:02:40.060> plugs<00:02:40.600> are<00:02:40.960> the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
neither one of these plugs are the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.310 
neither one of these plugs are the
resistor<00:02:41.800> model<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:43.330> we'll<00:02:43.570> talk<00:02:43.840> about<00:02:44.110> that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
resistor model so we'll talk about that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.100 
resistor model so we'll talk about that
in<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.560> minute<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.910> first<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.390> all<00:02:46.540> we'll<00:02:46.900> have<00:02:46.930> a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
in a minute so first of all we'll have a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.250 
in a minute so first of all we'll have a
good<00:02:47.440> look<00:02:48.040> at<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.220> good<00:02:48.550> spark<00:02:48.940> plug<00:02:49.260> right

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
good look at a good spark plug right

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.900 
good look at a good spark plug right
here<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.710> my<00:02:50.980> meter<00:02:52.200> we<00:02:53.200> have<00:02:53.910> particular

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
here and my meter we have particular

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.870 
here and my meter we have particular
resistance<00:02:55.360> measurements<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.430> with<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
resistance measurements and with the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.310 
resistance measurements and with the
leads<00:02:58.120> closed<00:03:00.210> we<00:03:01.210> get<00:03:01.420> point<00:03:01.990> one<00:03:02.140> or<00:03:02.170> point

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
leads closed we get point one or point

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.470 
leads closed we get point one or point
two<00:03:02.740> ohms<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.370> that's<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.820> resistance<00:03:04.300> of

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
two ohms and that's the resistance of

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.960 
two ohms and that's the resistance of
the<00:03:04.630> leads<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:08.050> here<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:08.770> on<00:03:08.980> this<00:03:09.700> good

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
the leads so here on this on this good

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.170 
the leads so here on this on this good
little<00:03:10.270> plug<00:03:11.520> we're<00:03:12.520> going<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.790> take<00:03:12.970> a

the electrode inside the spark plug and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.050 
the electrode inside the spark plug and
right<00:03:23.170> there<00:03:23.530> if<00:03:23.890> we<00:03:24.100> touch<00:03:24.280> on<00:03:24.520> that<00:03:24.640> silver

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
right there if we touch on that silver

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:39.630 
right there if we touch on that silver
spot<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:30.489> is<00:03:30.640> hard<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:30.970> do<00:03:31.890> that<00:03:32.890> blood<00:03:33.430> has

Oh<00:03:39.730> point<00:03:40.420> four<00:03:40.720> point<00:03:41.110> three<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.650> very<00:03:41.920> very

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
Oh point four point three so very very

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.520 
Oh point four point three so very very
little<00:03:42.520> resistance<00:03:43.270> in<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.750> it's<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:44.020> good<00:03:44.230> it's

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
little resistance in it it's a good it's

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.199 
little resistance in it it's a good it's
a<00:03:44.650> good<00:03:44.680> spark<00:03:45.130> plug<00:03:47.340> if<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.520> was<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.700> resistor

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
a good spark plug if that was a resistor

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.730 
a good spark plug if that was a resistor
spark<00:03:49.540> plug<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.870> would<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.410> would<00:03:50.530> measure

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
spark plug it would it would measure

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.940 
spark plug it would it would measure
somewhere<00:03:51.340> between<00:03:52.020> 10,000<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.080> 20,000<00:03:53.860> ohms

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 ohms

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.970 
somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 ohms
we'll<00:03:54.250> talk<00:03:54.370> about<00:03:54.520> that<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:54.940> minute<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:56.140> the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
we'll talk about that in a minute so the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.620 
we'll talk about that in a minute so the
way<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.160> check<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.550> spark<00:03:57.970> plug<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.240> see<00:03:58.420> if<00:03:58.510> it's

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
way to check a spark plug to see if it's

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.810 
way to check a spark plug to see if it's
good<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.830> to<00:04:00.040> check<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.430> resistance<00:04:00.959> between

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
good is to check the resistance between

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.410 
good is to check the resistance between
the<00:04:03.820> tip<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.330> plug<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:05.130> ground<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:07.180> if<00:04:07.300> the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
the tip of the plug and ground so if the

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.660 
the tip of the plug and ground so if the
spark<00:04:07.720> plug<00:04:07.959> starts<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.470> leak<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.980> ground

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
spark plug starts to leak to ground

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.090 
spark plug starts to leak to ground
that's<00:04:10.180> what<00:04:10.390> you'll<00:04:10.569> measure<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.440> on<00:04:11.890> this

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
that's what you'll measure and on this

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.370 
that's what you'll measure and on this
one<00:04:12.750> there's<00:04:13.750> no<00:04:14.020> resistance<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:15.390> ground<00:04:16.390> we

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
one there's no resistance to ground we

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.440 
one there's no resistance to ground we
have<00:04:17.560> resistance<00:04:17.890> through<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.700> plug<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:19.329> the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
have resistance through the plug to the

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.710 
have resistance through the plug to the
tip<00:04:19.720> right<00:04:20.709> which<00:04:21.040> is<00:04:21.190> our<00:04:21.310> point<00:04:21.579> three<00:04:21.910> but

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
tip right which is our point three but

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.900 
tip right which is our point three but
no<00:04:22.930> resistance<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.620> ground<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.400> if<00:04:24.760> we

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
no resistance to ground and if we

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.330 
no resistance to ground and if we
measure<00:04:25.090> from<00:04:25.360> ground<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:26.080> here<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:29.190> two<00:04:30.190> that

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
measure from ground to here to two that

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.180 
measure from ground to here to two that
is<00:04:30.640> also<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.360> same<00:04:31.390> thing<00:04:31.600> it's<00:04:31.960> open<00:04:32.320> but<00:04:33.070> if

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
is also the same thing it's open but if

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.590 
is also the same thing it's open but if
we<00:04:33.310> touch<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.640> to<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.880> ground<00:04:34.120> which<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.450> all

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
we touch it to the ground which is all

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.530 
we touch it to the ground which is all
over<00:04:34.810> I'll<00:04:35.200> cut<00:04:35.500> across<00:04:35.590> here<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:36.190> this<00:04:36.310> little

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
over I'll cut across here to this little

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.870 
over I'll cut across here to this little
the<00:04:37.540> ground<00:04:37.750> tip<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.950> plug<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.310> should<00:04:39.550> be

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
the ground tip of the plug it should be

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.200 
the ground tip of the plug it should be
short<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.480> course<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.830> good<00:04:42.040> spark<00:04:42.400> plug<00:04:42.669> has

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
short of course so a good spark plug has

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.360 
short of course so a good spark plug has
no<00:04:43.510> leaking<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.229> ground<00:04:46.680> okay<00:04:47.710> tubers<00:04:48.220> now

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
no leaking to ground okay tubers now

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.100 
no leaking to ground okay tubers now
we're<00:04:48.550> going<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.790> test<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.210> bad<00:04:49.390> spark<00:04:49.840> plug

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
we're going to test the bad spark plug

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.290 
we're going to test the bad spark plug
which<00:04:50.979> is<00:04:51.010> labeled<00:04:51.550> bad<00:04:51.790> right<00:04:52.150> here

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
which is labeled bad right here

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.080 
which is labeled bad right here
excuse<00:04:55.300> me<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:56.350> put<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:57.010> electrical<00:04:57.550> of<00:04:57.790> a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
excuse me and put the electrical of a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.250 
excuse me and put the electrical of a
millimeter<00:04:58.870> on<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.200> top<00:04:59.410> and<00:05:00.840> now<00:05:01.840> we<00:05:01.900> will

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
millimeter on the top and now we will

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.830 
millimeter on the top and now we will
measure<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.490> case<00:05:03.729> of<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.300> spark<00:05:04.540> plug

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
measure to the case of the spark plug

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.600 
measure to the case of the spark plug
and<00:05:06.450> we<00:05:07.450> have<00:05:07.630> eight<00:05:07.870> makes<00:05:08.470> or<00:05:09.010> eight<00:05:09.340> of<00:05:09.580> nine

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
and we have eight makes or eight of nine

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.969 
and we have eight makes or eight of nine
mix<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:11.100> resistance<00:05:13.020> from<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.500> top<00:05:14.710> of<00:05:14.890> the

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
mix of resistance from the top of the

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.980 
mix of resistance from the top of the
plug<00:05:15.220> which<00:05:16.030> would<00:05:16.210> be<00:05:16.330> leaking<00:05:16.630> through<00:05:16.780> to

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
plug which would be leaking through to

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.659 
plug which would be leaking through to
the<00:05:17.110> engine<00:05:17.410> block<00:05:17.530> because<00:05:17.979> this<00:05:18.130> is<00:05:18.310> all<00:05:18.460> one

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
the engine block because this is all one

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.250 
the engine block because this is all one
piece<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.090> it<00:05:19.180> screws<00:05:19.479> into<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.780> engine<00:05:20.140> and

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
piece and it screws into the engine and

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.860 
piece and it screws into the engine and
that<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.550> bad<00:05:21.790> spark<00:05:22.150> plug<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:22.510> changes<00:05:22.840> a

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
that is a bad spark plug it changes a

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.659 
that is a bad spark plug it changes a
little<00:05:23.050> bit<00:05:23.320> because<00:05:23.560> it's<00:05:23.830> a<00:05:23.919> bad<00:05:24.039> blood<00:05:24.400> but

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
little bit because it's a bad blood but

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.040 
little bit because it's a bad blood but
there<00:05:24.820> we<00:05:24.910> go<00:05:25.090> we<00:05:25.210> have<00:05:25.240> nine<00:05:25.570> million<00:05:25.840> ohms

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
there we go we have nine million ohms

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.940 
there we go we have nine million ohms
now<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:27.580> a<00:05:27.610> 20,000<00:05:28.419> volt<00:05:28.600> spark<00:05:29.050> spark

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
now to a 20,000 volt spark spark

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.010 
now to a 20,000 volt spark spark
that's<00:05:30.400> all<00:05:30.640> that's<00:05:30.970> a<00:05:31.180> lot<00:05:31.330> of<00:05:31.360> resistant<00:05:31.930> or

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
that's all that's a lot of resistant or

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.750 
that's all that's a lot of resistant or
that's<00:05:32.200> not<00:05:32.350> much<00:05:32.530> resistance<00:05:32.860> pardon<00:05:33.370> me<00:05:33.520> and

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
that's not much resistance pardon me and

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.909 
that's not much resistance pardon me and
it'll<00:05:34.240> leak<00:05:34.360> through<00:05:34.630> we<00:05:35.289> can<00:05:35.440> also<00:05:35.590> measure

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
it'll leak through we can also measure

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.029 
it'll leak through we can also measure
it<00:05:36.190> from<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:36.970> ground<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.470> little

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
it from the ground to the little

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.200 
it from the ground to the little
electrode<00:05:39.820> in<00:05:40.120> blood<00:05:42.090> there<00:05:43.090> it<00:05:43.210> is

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
electrode in blood there it is

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.969 
electrode in blood there it is
now<00:05:44.720> it's<00:05:44.870> even<00:05:45.110> less<00:05:47.740> we'll<00:05:48.740> try<00:05:48.949> it

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
now it's even less we'll try it

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.890 
now it's even less we'll try it
sometimes<00:05:49.820> it'll<00:05:50.030> pick<00:05:50.210> up<00:05:50.330> your<00:05:50.479> body<00:05:50.630> map

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
sometimes it'll pick up your body map

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.510 
sometimes it'll pick up your body map
but<00:05:51.169> you<00:05:51.770> can<00:05:51.919> measure<00:05:52.039> your<00:05:52.250> body's

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
but you can measure your body's

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.939 
but you can measure your body's
resistance<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:53.150> getting<00:05:53.389> it<00:05:53.539> mixed<00:05:53.900> up<00:05:54.169> but

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
resistance and getting it mixed up but

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.350 
resistance and getting it mixed up but
there<00:05:55.160> we<00:05:55.250> go<00:05:55.370> I'm<00:05:55.460> not<00:05:55.639> touching<00:05:55.940> anything<00:05:56.030> on

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
there we go I'm not touching anything on

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.490 
there we go I'm not touching anything on
this<00:05:56.509> end<00:05:56.750> here<00:05:57.020> so<00:05:57.820> there<00:05:58.820> we<00:05:58.940> go

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
this end here so there we go

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.040 
this end here so there we go
six<00:06:00.500> million<00:06:02.080> ohms<00:06:03.080> from<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:05.090> ground<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:06.020> the

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
six million ohms from the ground to the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.330 
six million ohms from the ground to the
point<00:06:08.080> now<00:06:09.080> it<00:06:09.169> changes<00:06:09.530> a<00:06:09.590> bit<00:06:09.770> see<00:06:10.009> but<00:06:10.220> if

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
point now it changes a bit see but if

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.010 
point now it changes a bit see but if
that's<00:06:10.490> a<00:06:10.820> bad<00:06:10.970> plug<00:06:11.300> and<00:06:11.509> they'll<00:06:11.630> they'll

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
that's a bad plug and they'll they'll

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.170 
that's a bad plug and they'll they'll
mix<00:06:12.380> you<00:06:12.560> up<00:06:12.590> one<00:06:13.400> day<00:06:13.550> it'll<00:06:13.699> work<00:06:13.880> and<00:06:14.060> when

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
mix you up one day it'll work and when

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.659 
mix you up one day it'll work and when
the<00:06:14.270> next<00:06:14.449> day<00:06:14.600> it<00:06:14.690> won't<00:06:15.039> so<00:06:16.039> that<00:06:16.250> is<00:06:16.430> a<00:06:16.460> bad

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
the next day it won't so that is a bad

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:29.469 
the next day it won't so that is a bad

eight<00:06:29.840> million<00:06:30.620> ohms<00:06:30.919> leaking<00:06:31.820> and<00:06:32.539> that's

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
eight million ohms leaking and that's

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.129 
eight million ohms leaking and that's
that's<00:06:34.880> what<00:06:35.210> kills<00:06:35.479> the<00:06:36.160> spark<00:06:37.990> thank<00:06:38.990> you

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
that's what kills the spark thank you

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.790 
that's what kills the spark thank you
very<00:06:39.289> much<00:06:40.360> now<00:06:41.360> on<00:06:41.630> a<00:06:41.660> resistor<00:06:42.229> spark<00:06:42.530> plug

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
very much now on a resistor spark plug

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.070 
very much now on a resistor spark plug

which the RJ in art in RJ 19 LM all that

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.719 
which the RJ in art in RJ 19 LM all that
means<00:06:48.349> is<00:06:48.530> that<00:06:48.590> there's<00:06:48.919> a<00:06:48.979> resistance<00:06:49.580> in

we use a lot of these RJ plugs because

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.899 
we use a lot of these RJ plugs because
we<00:06:58.580> use<00:06:58.729> a<00:06:58.789> lot<00:06:59.030> more<00:06:59.060> radios<00:06:59.659> to<00:07:00.590> communicate

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:00.909 
we use a lot more radios to communicate

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:03.730 
we use a lot more radios to communicate
