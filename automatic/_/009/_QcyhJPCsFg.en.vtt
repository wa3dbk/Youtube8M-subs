Formula One games sort of came back with
codemasters<00:00:26.950> during<00:00:27.220> f1<00:00:27.640> 2010<00:00:28.060> which<00:00:29.670> had<00:00:30.670> its

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
wasn't like a lot of faults with the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.660 
wasn't like a lot of faults with the
last<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.320> with<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.620> previous<00:00:53.920> game<00:00:54.130> but<00:00:54.430> but

last and with the previous game but but
there<00:00:54.850> were<00:00:54.970> some<00:00:55.329> things<00:00:55.750> missing<00:00:56.230> I<00:00:56.620> mean

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
there were some things missing I mean

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.970 
there were some things missing I mean
that<00:00:57.400> a<00:00:58.020> better<00:00:59.020> way<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.260> say<00:00:59.500> it<00:00:59.530> was<00:00:59.770> that

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
that a better way to say it was that

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.160 
that a better way to say it was that
that<00:01:00.190> what<00:01:00.820> what<00:01:01.030> was<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.780> their<00:01:01.899> previous

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
that what what was in their previous

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.790 
that what what was in their previous
game<00:01:02.560> was<00:01:02.829> really<00:01:03.130> good<00:01:03.340> but<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:05.140> also<00:01:05.350> tasted

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
game was really good but it also tasted

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.999 
game was really good but it also tasted
up<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.040> game<00:01:06.220> that<00:01:06.520> had<00:01:07.440> maybe<00:01:08.440> not<00:01:08.680> had<00:01:08.860> the

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
up a game that had maybe not had the

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.219 
up a game that had maybe not had the
development<00:01:09.580> time<00:01:09.790> that<00:01:10.119> it<00:01:10.630> really<00:01:10.930> should

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
development time that it really should

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.160 
development time that it really should
have<00:01:11.790> which<00:01:12.790> mall<00:01:13.330> is<00:01:13.479> corresponds<00:01:13.960> with<00:01:14.050> the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
have which mall is corresponds with the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.859 
have which mall is corresponds with the
time<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:14.710> codemasters<00:01:15.460> actually<00:01:16.090> had<00:01:16.300> the

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
time that codemasters actually had the

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.109 
time that codemasters actually had the
f1<00:01:17.500> license<00:01:17.890> at<00:01:18.070> that<00:01:18.190> point<00:01:18.430> of<00:01:18.520> time<00:01:18.580> but

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
f1 license at that point of time but

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.359 
f1 license at that point of time but
they<00:01:19.270> had<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.509> full<00:01:19.750> year<00:01:20.080> now<00:01:20.229> yes<00:01:20.649> so<00:01:21.070> what's

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
they had a full year now yes so what's

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.900 
they had a full year now yes so what's
new<00:01:21.670> well<00:01:22.330> add<00:01:22.800> addition<00:01:23.800> of<00:01:23.890> course<00:01:24.070> of<00:01:24.369> the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
new well add addition of course of the

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.999 
new well add addition of course of the
new<00:01:25.060> rule<00:01:25.330> set<00:01:25.720> which<00:01:26.200> means<00:01:26.440> addition<00:01:26.920> of

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
new rule set which means addition of

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.010 
new rule set which means addition of
curse<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.550> DRS<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.390> currently<00:01:28.600> tires

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
curse and DRS and you currently tires

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.650 
curse and DRS and you currently tires
and<00:01:29.440> if<00:01:30.039> you're<00:01:30.340> not<00:01:30.459> into<00:01:30.759> phone<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.240> one<00:01:31.420> in

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
and if you're not into phone the one in

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.330 
and if you're not into phone the one in
the<00:01:31.810> first<00:01:31.959> place<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.500> probably<00:01:32.920> sounds<00:01:33.190> like

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
the first place it probably sounds like

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.570 
the first place it probably sounds like
minor<00:01:33.610> details<00:01:34.179> but<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:35.020> really<00:01:35.319> is<00:01:35.679> like<00:01:35.920> it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
minor details but it really is like it's

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.490 
minor details but it really is like it's
it's<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.149> sort<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.509> thing<00:01:37.569> that<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:38.259> would

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
it's the sort of thing that that would

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.219 
it's the sort of thing that that would
in<00:01:38.740> another<00:01:39.369> world<00:01:39.580> for<00:01:40.420> instance<00:01:40.630> in<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
in another world for instance in the

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.440 
in another world for instance in the
world<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.530> soccer<00:01:41.740> mean<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.399> that<00:01:42.910> you<00:01:43.030> would

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
world of soccer mean that that you would

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.770 
world of soccer mean that that you would
have<00:01:43.569> to<00:01:43.720> play<00:01:43.869> with<00:01:44.050> another<00:01:44.350> sort<00:01:44.709> of<00:01:44.800> ball

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
have to play with another sort of ball

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.359 
have to play with another sort of ball
so<00:01:46.780> it's<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:47.410> it's<00:01:47.770> become<00:01:48.069> a<00:01:48.100> much<00:01:48.340> more

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
so it's it's it's become a much more

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.309 
so it's it's it's become a much more
aggressive<00:01:48.670> sport<00:01:49.300> with<00:01:49.539> much<00:01:50.050> more

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
aggressive sport with much more

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.469 
aggressive sport with much more
overtaking<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.250> much<00:01:51.459> more<00:01:51.700> management<00:01:52.360> of

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
overtaking and much more management of

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.480 
overtaking and much more management of
the<00:01:52.630> tires<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.410> also<00:01:53.649> reflects<00:01:54.280> in<00:01:54.369> the

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
the tires and that also reflects in the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.380 
the tires and that also reflects in the
game<00:01:55.319> making<00:01:56.319> it<00:01:56.440> for<00:01:56.649> a<00:01:57.099> more<00:01:57.399> strategic<00:01:57.759> ride

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
game making it for a more strategic ride

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.870 
game making it for a more strategic ride
if<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:58.959> actually<00:01:59.110> set<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.679> up<00:01:59.830> to<00:02:00.250> be<00:02:00.429> played

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
if you actually set it up to be played

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.870 
if you actually set it up to be played
like<00:02:01.209> anything<00:02:01.959> by<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.170> arcade<00:02:02.590> racer

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
like anything by the arcade racer

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.480 
like anything by the arcade racer
okay<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.659> track<00:02:04.930> screen<00:02:05.320> right<00:02:05.649> now<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.310> take

okay the track screen right now so take
a<00:02:06.549> few<00:02:06.820> laps<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.329> get<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.570> tires<00:02:07.780> up

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
a few laps to get the tires up

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.550 
a few laps to get the tires up
temperature<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.920> feel<00:02:09.099> your<00:02:09.250> way<00:02:09.459> around

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.259 

if<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.769> remember<00:02:15.799> right<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.340> last<00:02:16.849> game<00:02:17.090> was

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
if I remember right the last game was

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.789 
if I remember right the last game was
sort<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.480> caught<00:02:17.720> between<00:02:17.900> two<00:02:18.290> chairs<00:02:18.590> of

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
sort of caught between two chairs of

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.039 
sort of caught between two chairs of
being<00:02:19.010> hardcore<00:02:19.640> f1's<00:02:20.060> him<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:20.510> more<00:02:20.959> of

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
being hardcore f1's him and more of

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.140 
being hardcore f1's him and more of
arcadia<00:02:21.590> experience<00:02:22.010> yeah<00:02:22.430> how<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.939> it<00:02:23.060> this

arcadia experience yeah how is it this

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.830 
arcadia experience yeah how is it this
time<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:24.590> better<00:02:24.890> but<00:02:25.819> once<00:02:26.030> again<00:02:26.180> they

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
time it's better but once again they

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.690 
time it's better but once again they
have<00:02:27.019> not<00:02:27.140> managed<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.680> finely<00:02:28.220> tuned<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
have not managed to finely tuned the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.599 
have not managed to finely tuned the
difficulty<00:02:29.629> that<00:02:30.110> was<00:02:30.829> actually<00:02:31.010> sort<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.489> a

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
difficulty that was actually sort of a

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.789 
difficulty that was actually sort of a
small<00:02:32.090> minor<00:02:32.420> mistake<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.140> last<00:02:33.349> one<00:02:33.590> and

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
small minor mistake of the last one and

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.000 
small minor mistake of the last one and
it's<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:34.280> mistake<00:02:34.549> that've<00:02:35.000> like<00:02:35.859> not<00:02:36.859> being

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
it's a mistake that've like not being

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.360 
it's a mistake that've like not being
able<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.400> fix<00:02:37.609> apparently<00:02:38.239> once<00:02:39.049> again<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:40.010> so

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
able to fix apparently once again so so

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.449 
able to fix apparently once again so so
for<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.269> be<00:02:41.569> this<00:02:41.840> simulation<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.189> can

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
for it to be this simulation that it can

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.699 
for it to be this simulation that it can
be<00:02:43.700> or<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.239> closer<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.750> assimilation<00:02:45.230> you

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
be or the closer to assimilation you

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:46.960 
be or the closer to assimilation you
will<00:02:45.799> have<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.069> go<00:02:46.159> in<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.430> actually<00:02:46.519> fine

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
will have to go in and actually fine

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.960 
will have to go in and actually fine
tune<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:49.129> settings<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.819> game

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
tune the the settings of the game

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.089 
tune the the settings of the game
yourself<00:02:50.379> which<00:02:51.379> is<00:02:51.560> kind<00:02:51.829> of<00:02:51.950> disappointing

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
yourself which is kind of disappointing

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.360 
yourself which is kind of disappointing
then<00:02:53.090> again<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.690> if<00:02:54.139> you<00:02:54.889> know<00:02:55.069> what<00:02:55.099> you

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
then again it if you know what you

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.770 
then again it if you know what you
actually<00:02:55.519> do<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.030> doesn't<00:02:56.329> take<00:02:56.359> you<00:02:56.599> much

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
actually do and it doesn't take you much

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.599 
actually do and it doesn't take you much
more<00:02:56.989> than<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.290> couple<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:57.620> minutes<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.370> from

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
more than a couple of minutes and from

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.280 
more than a couple of minutes and from
there<00:02:58.879> you<00:02:58.909> have<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.239> far<00:02:59.659> better<00:02:59.780> experience

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
there you have a far better experience

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.530 
there you have a far better experience
than<00:03:00.859> the<00:03:01.159> last<00:03:01.310> time<00:03:01.459> also<00:03:02.030> when<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.269> comes<00:03:02.420> to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
than the last time also when it comes to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.199 
than the last time also when it comes to
simulation<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:04.159> not<00:03:04.519> at<00:03:04.670> least<00:03:04.760> because<00:03:04.970> of

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
simulation and not at least because of

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.740 
simulation and not at least because of
the<00:03:05.329> new<00:03:05.450> physics<00:03:05.900> which<00:03:06.200> are<00:03:06.950> just<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.750> huge

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
the new physics which are just a huge

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.550 
the new physics which are just a huge
huge<00:03:08.870> huge<00:03:09.879> betterment<00:03:10.879> of<00:03:11.060> last<00:03:11.989> year's<00:03:12.230> so

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
huge huge betterment of last year's so

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.160 
huge huge betterment of last year's so
the<00:03:12.829> driving<00:03:13.129> physics<00:03:13.400> are<00:03:13.730> different

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
the driving physics are different

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.390 
the driving physics are different
they're<00:03:15.170> different<00:03:15.590> they're<00:03:15.980> highly

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
they're different they're highly

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.089 
they're different they're highly
different<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:16.790> would<00:03:16.849> say<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.930> far<00:03:18.859> beta

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
different I would say and far beta

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.250

for instance and qualifying you can

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.270 
for instance and qualifying you can

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
petrol in the tank and a full tank when

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.020 
petrol in the tank and a full tank when
you<00:03:42.260> actually<00:03:42.409> start<00:03:42.590> out<00:03:42.949> the<00:03:43.340> race<00:03:43.519> means

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
you actually start out the race means

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.610 
you actually start out the race means
that<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.750> will<00:03:44.870> have<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.169> attack<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
that that you will have to attack the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.830 
that that you will have to attack the
corners<00:03:45.979> in<00:03:46.250> completely<00:03:47.120> different<00:03:47.269> ways

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
corners in completely different ways

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.559 
corners in completely different ways
which<00:03:48.560> which<00:03:48.919> for<00:03:49.549> me<00:03:49.699> atleast<00:03:49.879> was<00:03:50.180> like<00:03:50.419> a

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
which which for me atleast was like a

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.140 
which which for me atleast was like a
huge<00:03:50.870> huge<00:03:51.139> surprise<00:03:51.590> but<00:03:52.220> also<00:03:52.639> welcome

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
huge huge surprise but also welcome

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.349 
huge huge surprise but also welcome
surprise<00:03:54.129> so<00:03:55.129> we're<00:03:55.340> edging<00:03:55.849> closer<00:03:56.060> but

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
surprise so we're edging closer but

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.050 
surprise so we're edging closer but
still<00:03:56.599> not<00:03:56.930> quite<00:03:57.139> the<00:03:57.409> ultimate<00:03:57.799> AK<00:03:58.430> f1

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
still not quite the ultimate AK f1

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.869 
still not quite the ultimate AK f1
experience<00:03:59.449> yeah<00:03:59.900> I<00:04:00.169> would<00:04:00.290> say<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:00.879> it's

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
experience yeah I would say so it's

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.869 
experience yeah I would say so it's
still<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.629> mean<00:04:03.379> the<00:04:03.680> simulation<00:04:04.579> could<00:04:04.790> be

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
still I mean the simulation could be

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.059 
still I mean the simulation could be
better<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.419> our<00:04:05.690> kid<00:04:05.900> part<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.769> could<00:04:06.949> be

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
better and our kid part of it could be

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.550 
better and our kid part of it could be
better<00:04:07.280> but<00:04:07.479> if<00:04:08.479> you're<00:04:08.900> willing<00:04:09.049> to<00:04:09.229> just

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
better but if you're willing to just

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.149 
better but if you're willing to just
accept<00:04:09.949> that<00:04:10.010> there<00:04:10.250> are<00:04:10.459> no<00:04:10.879> other<00:04:11.949> f1<00:04:12.949> games

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
accept that there are no other f1 games

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.189

stuff<00:04:19.370> like<00:04:19.489> that<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:20.180> really<00:04:20.599> is<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.490> insanely

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
stuff like that it really is a insanely

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.300 
stuff like that it really is a insanely
good<00:04:22.820> formula<00:04:23.150> one<00:04:23.419> game<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:25.010> is<00:04:25.159> the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
good formula one game and it is the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.860 
good formula one game and it is the
complete<00:04:25.639> package<00:04:25.820> I<00:04:26.180> mean<00:04:26.330> it

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
complete package I mean it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.900 
complete package I mean it
it<00:04:26.960> has<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.410> best<00:04:27.590> presentation<00:04:28.250> of<00:04:28.370> any

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
it has the best presentation of any

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.330 
it has the best presentation of any
formula<00:04:29.300> one<00:04:29.449> game<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.780> date<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.620> just

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
formula one game to date and the just

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.250 
formula one game to date and the just
the<00:04:31.460> addition<00:04:31.850> of<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.060> new<00:04:32.090> physics<00:04:32.630> makes<00:04:33.110> it

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
the addition of the new physics makes it

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.950 
the addition of the new physics makes it
a<00:04:33.350> far<00:04:33.590> far<00:04:33.770> better<00:04:33.830> game<00:04:34.220> also<00:04:34.490> co-op<00:04:35.270> which

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
a far far better game also co-op which

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.620 
a far far better game also co-op which
is<00:04:36.169> just<00:04:36.410> like<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:37.639> was<00:04:37.790> naming<00:04:38.030> something<00:04:38.540> I

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
is just like it was naming something I

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.360 
is just like it was naming something I
was<00:04:38.750> expecting<00:04:38.780> from<00:04:39.470> disordered<00:04:39.919> game<00:04:40.100> but

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
was expecting from disordered game but

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.100 
was expecting from disordered game but
addition<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.180> co-op<00:04:41.510> campaign<00:04:41.690> way

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
addition of co-op campaign way

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.900 
addition of co-op campaign way
connection<00:04:42.650> drive<00:04:42.889> for<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.160> same<00:04:43.370> team<00:04:43.610> and

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
connection drive for the same team and

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.060 
connection drive for the same team and
compete<00:04:44.889> for<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:45.979> chance<00:04:46.010> to<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.699> to<00:04:48.070> power

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
compete for the chance to to to power

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.040 
compete for the chance to to to power
the<00:04:49.340> development<00:04:49.850> of<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.030> team<00:04:50.300> it's<00:04:50.750> just

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
the development of the team it's just

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.100 
the development of the team it's just
it's<00:04:51.530> just<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.830> really<00:04:52.310> nice<00:04:52.460> addition<00:04:52.970> uh<00:04:53.120> so

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
it's just a really nice addition uh so

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.990 
it's just a really nice addition uh so
yeah<00:04:54.470> it's<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.740> far<00:04:54.949> better<00:04:55.070> game<00:04:55.340> still<00:04:55.850> not

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
yeah it's a far better game still not

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.300 
yeah it's a far better game still not
perfect<00:04:56.180> but<00:04:56.630> but<00:04:57.199> definitely<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.919> right<00:04:58.100> way

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
perfect but but definitely the right way

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:11.190 
perfect but but definitely the right way
to<00:04:58.370> go

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.260
