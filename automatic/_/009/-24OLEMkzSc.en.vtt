00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hi girls, I'll give you a tip that I 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.179
 I think it is worth you implement 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.090
 This is a new protein on the market. 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.769
 EIPR the imf now action a protein that 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.599
 besides tasty that makes the whole 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.440
 difference for people who take all 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.600
 days 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.560
 This is a specially made protein. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.099
 for you because it has collagen in it. 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.960
 formula and collagen after 20min knows 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.410
 that we have to think and color because 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.190
 but to affirm that she skin leave you 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.989
 turning is more complicated 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.480
 So let's train, let's take a 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.059
 Good quality protein is a protein 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.460
 concentrate but the differential 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.940
 Why does he have to work together in the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.649
 formula that is a powerful antioxidant 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.050
 fighting free radicals is 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.920
 warn that early offensive of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.230
 cells 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.440
 the collagen that will be taking care of the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.270
 elasticity all muscle tone that is the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.460
 that we really seek, right? 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.040
 besides the protein that I take every day 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.710
 after training that already has collagen a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.090
 I reinforce it even more because the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.979
 collagen powder 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.600
 I take it all shots at night 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.450
 before sleeping inside my last 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.580
 pregnancy so far does not stop taking 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.140
 because I started to take it later 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.630
 there is a big difference 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 especially my expression that is 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.060
 something that bothers others and we have the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.100
 two options are popular in the body 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.189
 how much college? 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.290
 in capsule I particularly prefer 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.520
 jump from a pop that he 's more focused on 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.200
 for the skin 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.350
 he also finds the structure of the hair 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.119
 do not nail but he for being more 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.970
 concentrate I think it gives a 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.860
 results better right and the college or 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.470
 capsule for those who were 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.149
 strengthened in the streets of the hair is 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.250
 tip is also a good option 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.560
 more information you will find 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.990

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.810
 underneath and in my social network you go
