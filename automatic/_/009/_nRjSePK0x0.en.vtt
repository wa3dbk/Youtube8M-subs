00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.659
 it's an irony that the colors of this 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.369
 frog seemed to be designed to do 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.759
 a perfect target among its predators 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.979
 and at the same time the neurotoxins that 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.030
 there are enough in your skin to 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.030
 kill an elephant 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.880
 to turn off 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.520

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.980
