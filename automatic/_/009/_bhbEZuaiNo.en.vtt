00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
without a measuring tape you take the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.219 
without a measuring tape you take the
straight<00:01:09.909> edge<00:01:10.119> which<00:01:10.659> is<00:01:10.810> going<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.020> be<00:01:11.110> the

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
straight edge which is going to be the

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.160 
straight edge which is going to be the
opposite<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:12.549> that<00:01:12.759> your<00:01:12.939> which<00:01:13.360> what's<00:01:14.020> going

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
opposite so that your which what's going

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.639 
opposite so that your which what's going
to<00:01:14.259> happen<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.869> is<00:01:17.079> going<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.289> this

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
to happen is that this is going to this

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.550 
to happen is that this is going to this
is<00:01:17.799> going<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.039> wind<00:01:18.249> up<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:19.079> this<00:01:20.079> end<00:01:20.350> like

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
is going to wind up in this end like

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.919 
is going to wind up in this end like
this<00:01:20.590> but<00:01:21.009> to<00:01:21.219> make<00:01:21.670> my<00:01:21.819> cut<00:01:22.119> I'm<00:01:22.389> going<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.689> put

starter rope on the next row coming down
we've<00:01:57.630> come<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.050> most<00:01:58.259> difficult<00:01:58.710> part<00:01:58.920> of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
we've come to the most difficult part of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.120 
we've come to the most difficult part of
the<00:01:59.100> job<00:01:59.460> and<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.360> would<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.140> last<00:02:01.680> row

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the job and that would be the last row

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.690 
the job and that would be the last row
especially<00:02:02.970> coming<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.540> two<00:02:04.340> sections<00:02:05.340> where

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
especially coming up two sections where

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.680 
especially coming up two sections where
you<00:02:05.880> don't<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.920> straight<00:02:07.920> line<00:02:08.690> which

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
you don't have a straight line which

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.930 
you don't have a straight line which
would<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.350> trick<00:02:11.100> mirror<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.940> what

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
would be on the trick mirror and what

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.170 
would be on the trick mirror and what
you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.330> do<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:16.700> take<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> chisel<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:19.260> just

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
you can do is take a chisel and just

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.080 
you can do is take a chisel and just

chisel off the tongue part of this group

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.949 
chisel off the tongue part of this group
section<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.650> then<00:02:26.330> what<00:02:27.330> you'll<00:02:27.510> want<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.750> do

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
section and then what you'll want to do

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.009 
section and then what you'll want to do
is<00:02:29.239> measure<00:02:30.239> your<00:02:30.870> distance<00:02:31.530> here<00:02:33.019> probably

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
is measure your distance here probably

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.080 
is measure your distance here probably
want<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.440> get<00:02:34.590> both<00:02:35.010> measurements<00:02:35.489> just<00:02:35.760> in

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
want to get both measurements just in

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.979 
want to get both measurements just in
case<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.480> not<00:02:36.690> perfectly<00:02:37.500> parallel<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:39.600> then

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
case is not perfectly parallel and then

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.430 
case is not perfectly parallel and then
take<00:02:40.739> those<00:02:40.920> measurements<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:42.290> cut<00:02:43.290> your

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
take those measurements and cut your

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.380 
take those measurements and cut your
board<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.579> that<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> flat

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
board so that you can have a flat

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.930 
board so that you can have a flat
section<00:02:45.930> against<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.799> baseboard<00:02:47.310> here<00:02:47.579> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
section against the baseboard here and

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.340 
the groove side which it's very small
but<00:04:52.830> what<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.580> did<00:04:53.940> was<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.750> what<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:54.960> was<00:04:55.020> saying

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
but what I did was and what I was saying

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.890 
but what I did was and what I was saying
chiseling<00:04:56.010> off<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.220> piece<00:04:56.610> what<00:04:57.330> happens<00:04:57.750> is

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
chiseling off a piece what happens is

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.290 
chiseling off a piece what happens is
that<00:04:57.930> that<00:04:58.260> tongue<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:59.520> tongue<00:04:59.850> kind<00:05:00.180> of

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
that that tongue that tongue kind of

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.320 
that that tongue that tongue kind of
slides<00:05:00.690> into<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.260> groove<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:01.890> then<00:05:02.610> what

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
slides into the groove and then what

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.060 
slides into the groove and then what
happens<00:05:03.720> is<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:03.900> there's<00:05:04.260> this<00:05:04.350> little<00:05:04.560> part

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
happens is that there's this little part

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.580 
happens is that there's this little part
here<00:05:05.130> that<00:05:05.669> makes<00:05:06.120> it<00:05:06.270> snap<00:05:06.600> in<00:05:06.870> place<00:05:07.080> and

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
here that makes it snap in place and

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.010 
here that makes it snap in place and
keeps<00:05:08.190> it<00:05:08.310> together<00:05:08.490> so<00:05:09.210> if<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:09.450> just<00:05:09.600> chisel

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
keeps it together so if you just chisel

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.409 
keeps it together so if you just chisel
off<00:05:10.169> this<00:05:10.410> little<00:05:10.650> piece<00:05:11.010> here<00:05:11.120> what<00:05:12.120> you<00:05:12.270> can

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
off this little piece here what you can

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.870 
off this little piece here what you can
do<00:05:12.570> for<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.930> last<00:05:13.140> run<00:05:13.530> is<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:14.010> slide<00:05:14.490> it<00:05:14.730> in

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
do for that last run is just slide it in

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.390 
do for that last run is just slide it in
as<00:05:15.120> opposed<00:05:15.510> to<00:05:15.690> snapping<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.410> in<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.800> then

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
as opposed to snapping it in and then

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.040 
as opposed to snapping it in and then
that<00:05:17.700> way<00:05:17.880> what<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.150> do<00:05:18.360> is<00:05:18.450> you<00:05:18.510> just<00:05:18.540> lay

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
that way what you do is you just lay

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.340 
that way what you do is you just lay
down<00:05:19.290> a<00:05:19.320> bead<00:05:19.620> of<00:05:19.760> wood<00:05:20.760> glue<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:22.230> then

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
down a bead of wood glue and and then

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.590 
down a bead of wood glue and and then
put<00:05:22.530> some<00:05:22.710> weight<00:05:22.890> on<00:05:22.919> it<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.430> your<00:05:24.030> your<00:05:24.390> last

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
put some weight on it and your your last

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.220 
put some weight on it and your your last
run<00:05:24.900> will<00:05:25.020> stay<00:05:25.200> in<00:05:25.350> place<00:05:26.600> so<00:05:27.600> project

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
run will stay in place so project

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.560 
run will stay in place so project
complete
