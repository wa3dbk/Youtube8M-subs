00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:05.210 

well<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:02.970> think<00:00:03.300> our<00:00:03.780> organization<00:00:04.620> at<00:00:05.069> this

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
well I think our organization at this

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.030 
well I think our organization at this
time<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:05.790> find<00:00:06.029> ourselves<00:00:06.210> pretty<00:00:06.720> deep<00:00:07.040> with

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
time we find ourselves pretty deep with

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.459 
time we find ourselves pretty deep with
defenseman<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.360> we<00:00:09.510> obviously<00:00:09.719> have<00:00:10.200> depth

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
defenseman and we obviously have depth

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.879 
defenseman and we obviously have depth
in<00:00:10.679> goal<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.450> think<00:00:12.450> if<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.809> were<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.110> assess<00:00:13.620> a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
in goal I think if we were to assess a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.530 
in goal I think if we were to assess a
need<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.940> would<00:00:15.089> be<00:00:15.240> for

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
need that we have it would be for

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.890 
need that we have it would be for
forwards<00:00:17.090> perhaps<00:00:18.090> Center<00:00:18.420> Iceland<00:00:18.779> in

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
forwards perhaps Center Iceland in

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.470 
forwards perhaps Center Iceland in

our<00:01:19.409> goaltenders<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> scenario<00:01:20.430> exists

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
our goaltenders is the scenario exists

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.190 
our goaltenders is the scenario exists
under<00:01:22.350> which<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.920> might<00:01:23.040> create<00:01:23.340> Schneider

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
under which you might create Schneider

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.560 
under which you might create Schneider
well<00:01:26.200> I<00:01:27.180> guess<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.210> anything<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.230> possible

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
well I guess that anything is possible

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.300 
well I guess that anything is possible
you<00:01:31.570> know<00:01:31.660> it's<00:01:32.350> not<00:01:32.470> including<00:01:33.220> the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
you know it's not including the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.310 
you know it's not including the
possibility<00:01:34.090> of<00:01:34.330> going<00:01:34.600> forward<00:01:35.050> with<00:01:35.170> both

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
possibility of going forward with both

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.930 
possibility of going forward with both
goaltenders<00:01:35.560> being<00:01:36.190> there<00:01:36.400> you<00:01:36.820> know

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
goaltenders being there you know

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.220 
goaltenders being there you know
everyone<00:01:37.210> seems<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.720> think<00:01:37.840> it's<00:01:38.140> a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
everyone seems to think it's a

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.080 
everyone seems to think it's a
preordained<00:01:38.970> thing<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.360> somebody<00:01:41.050> is<00:01:41.350> going

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
preordained thing that somebody is going

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.060 
preordained thing that somebody is going
but<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.390> know<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.780> scenario<00:01:44.110> does<00:01:44.500> exist<00:01:44.860> as

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
but you know that scenario does exist as

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.250 
but you know that scenario does exist as
well<00:01:45.280> so<00:01:45.880> anything<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:46.630> possible<00:01:46.690> at<00:01:47.140> this

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
well so anything is possible at this

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.310 
well so anything is possible at this
point<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.520> chances<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.150> by<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:49.930> time<00:01:50.140> this

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
point the chances that by the time this

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.520 
point the chances that by the time this
weekend<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:50.830> finished<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.110> one<00:01:53.500> of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
weekend is finished one of you one of

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.040 
weekend is finished one of you one of
your<00:01:53.740> goalies

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
your goalies

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.730 
your goalies
well<00:01:55.620> I<00:01:55.650> don't<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.370> wouldn't<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.000> hedge<00:01:57.210> or

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
well I don't I wouldn't want to hedge or

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.430 
well I don't I wouldn't want to hedge or
make<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> prediction<00:01:59.160> on<00:01:59.490> it<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:01.080> there<00:02:01.320> is

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
make a prediction on it that there is

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.910 
make a prediction on it that there is
interest<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:02.010> that's<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.670> place<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:03.540> now

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
interest that that's in place right now

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.490 
interest that that's in place right now
it<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.460> conceivable<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.990> could<00:02:07.260> make<00:02:07.470> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
