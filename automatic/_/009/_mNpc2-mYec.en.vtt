00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
them very very quickly by supporting a

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.539 
them very very quickly by supporting a
little<00:01:55.079> bit<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.259> boiling<00:01:55.500> water<00:01:55.859> in<00:01:56.069> them<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
little bit of boiling water in them and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.340 
little bit of boiling water in them and
that<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.909> helps<00:01:57.240> them<00:01:57.359> to<00:01:57.539> liquefy<00:01:58.079> more

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that just helps them to liquefy more

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.199 
that just helps them to liquefy more
easily<00:01:58.710> any<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.429> of<00:01:59.490> blender<00:01:59.670> even<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> high
