00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 very good and I'm already in the review 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.660
 of a very interesting and very useful motorbike 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.719
 He calls yuri with his motorcycle and as his name 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.429
 Tells us add 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.940
 unicorns to our minecraft in addition to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.670
 Pegasus and armor very interesting 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.550
 but let's start looking at the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.800
 pegasus and the unicorns understand them by 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.830
 the pieces here are and we're going to put 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.109
 one here perfect here we have our 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.420
 pegasus our winged horse that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.700
 domestic in a very simple way as 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.370
 if it were a normal horse we put here 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.380
 we ride and he throw us 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 but we insist we are some 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.719
 persistent constant people do not 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.879
 Let's see you've just fallen in love 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.260
 some little hearts and that means that 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.660
 he has fallen in love with us so he 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.120
 if we do like this we can put a 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.149
 mount and what happens when you have the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.070
 mount that we can control 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.560
 quietly and if we press the button 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.590
 to jump 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.070
 because our horse side too 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.520
 It can be used to fly by flying 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.730
 worlds minecraft we already clear that if 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.530
 look look look here we have it 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:17.270
 our horse side our pegasus 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:20.090
 flying with us over and 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.780
 now let's see our friend the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.280
 unicorn these pieces and unicorns 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.920
 they just appear as if they were 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.680
 horses or if they were sheep or pigs 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.200
 appear randomly on the map 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.950
 well now let's look at a 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.990
 unicorn here we have our 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.780
 unicorn you see how happy it is there 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.140
 happy smiling then let's try 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.360
 take it also we climb and obviously 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.550
 he pulls us but we want we want 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.550
 your love and we want to give you love so 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.200
 let's get on top of it a little bit 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.450
 more there we have it almost almost almost 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.060
 and they have to go out little hearts there 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.350
 we are waiting for you waiting for you can not be 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.350
 as easy to be a heart as you have 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.030
 seen and now we can put the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.489
 saddle and it's already our little horse 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.400
 squeezing the space the jump button 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.950
 just as with the pegasus we fly we fly 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.910
 by the skies but with a peculiarity 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.840
 which is that we fly over the rainbow 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.440
 the unicorns fly over the rainbow 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.750
 that comes out of his back 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.980
 It is a unicorn that does not eat well and 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.870
 then it shoots rainbow and it is also 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.290
 very useful because it allows us just like the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.720
 pegasus fly through the world of minecraft 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.620
 let's go back to the base because even 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.690
 there are many things to teach you come 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.840
 come come let's land to see 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.030
 see to see we fall justito justito here 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.549
 we are the damage by quality as you see 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.930
 he eats all the horse and therefore 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.689
 we are protected against 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.659
 to all the whole damage from falls that 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.579
 could cause us to make it day 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.670
 perfect and now to see why he lost me 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.909
 a little bit about what the base is 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.799
 there we are great because we got off 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:22.540
 our unicorn and asked me where has 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:25.519
 gone the pegasus the missing piece 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.689
 well, nothing is wrong, wait unicorn 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:32.900
 2020 here we are there we go down 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:36.019
 here we have and nuria and her unicorn 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.510
 Of course, if it's perfect, let's see 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.180
 more things that this mode includes us 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.599
 as for example are the armors we go 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.090
 to take the first one that is done with union 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.689
 and comfort and of course how the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.150
 only then in a unique way do not look 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.590
 do not look at that, that's where we are 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.060
 looking we put the baby here good 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.150
 unicor we will also save your life 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.540
 to see there and be free to be free 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.120
 now we have a single adult and here 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.530
 we have a good iron sword 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.660
 the only full 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.750
 there is embraced by giving a hug 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.049
 intense with the sword to the unicorn we 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.669
 has given two things and only and only one is 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.550
 say unicorn horn and skin 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.350
 unicorn with the skin of the unicorn 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.120
 we can make this armor that like 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.680
 you see the castle is with skin as if 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.190
 it was a normal armor but 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.650
 using it as unicorn skin 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.020
 we put it on and as you can see, it 's a 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.030
 kind of normal armor the truth is not 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.100
 has a lot of secrecy does not give you effects 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.440
 special as you see here does not give anything and 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.600
 well protect us half would be like 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.180
 a kind of armor a little better 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.820
 that leather is worth it now we are going to 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.500
 catch the next the dust armor 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.600
 Fairy as we make the fairy dust 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.510
 for with the unicorn horns the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.090
 we put here and it gives us four of dust 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.770
 fairies is perfect, this is done 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.510
 just like a normal armor but with 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.870
 that fairy dust we've got 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.060
 of the unicorn horns that to me 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.160
 has touched the first but it is difficult 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.880
 you release it good unicorn 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.670
 let's release this and now 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.040
 this here perfect as you see me 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.870
 now I'm in adventure let's get 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.280
 in survival but I'm not in 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.350
 creative right now I 'm not in 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.110
 creative I would have to click here to 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.430
 be creative but with this armor 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.990
 that protects us a little more than the 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:35.460
 earlier we can fly we can fly with 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.550
 this armor through the skies minecraft 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.110
 already us and so we can get much more 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:46.650
 away without having to resort to riding in 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.470
 a pegasus or a unicorn so it's a 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.900
 mod that really besides having these 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.480
 two mythical animals also give you some 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.160
 armor that are very interesting os 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.500
 I leave in the description the mod so that 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.480
 you can download it you know 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.190
