00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:22.050
 we are here in a n 141 5 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.200
 yeah it's him who deals 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.270
 he makes narrow street them 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.980
 yes yes 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.980
 then picking potatoes 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.870
 it's over we do not only me 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.510
 I hurt 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.690
 so there he is a dumpster of 18 in this 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.690
 meaning 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.550
 it's a four-cylinder his wife or 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.950
 with them 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.990
 we are 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.420
 overpowering what works that on the 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.430
 prompt resolution on which 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.370
 marc tochon overpower no 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.930
 it's a shame but we did not take it 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.940
 of strength 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.870
 yeah even in bell on taking 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.870
 they are 29 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.860
 on the road 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.790
 so he's nervous this factor there willy 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.790
 nervous yeah 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.210
 and we have it 40 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.280
 on it 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.580
 when it is cold 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.080
 the tronic team 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.600
 michael security 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.670
 and then I saw speeds that charge 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.650
 in an impasse rg to stop the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.409
 engine 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.789
 the workforce often 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.789
 yeah ok first renoir 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.350
 and we took him to the garage and he did not 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.350
 found why one 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.430
 apparently it would be tinkering witness of 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.990
 temperature boxes bubbles reach 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.259
 m 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.710
 the technique here in good condition so we 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.369
 continue like this 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.959
 but hey it is by a 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.959
 jean ping pong the author will be there 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.739
 and that's when the engine is do 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.939
 not only has me all 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.629
 when it is cold 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.629
 Okay 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.040
 hello am happy because it's a 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.040
 small jig power game 0 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.599
 it is flexible 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.599
 the game 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.060
 so they will have ground as machine 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.250
 z 1700 on the pediment 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.069
 nuclear forces aim for powell 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.950
 10 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.920
 grossemy in front and then those less 23 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.970
 meters 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.610
 he has the abilities funny flashball yes 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.700
 and powerful 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.700
 no 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.590
 you have the purest before hanging here 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.200
 and here again he judges 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.880
 I count myself 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.569
 satisfactory or 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.180
 we are in the hands 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.390
 euros from his pocket 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.910
 but we are a little cautious 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.300
 tractors we feel the difference in 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.610
 freedom 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.400
 better as dante and 163 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.080
 you are 160 cases a decade then 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.600
 after what is there like transmission there 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.180
 it's capital 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.250
 with 3.8 in Strasbourg and after there is a 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.990
 gear reducer or three gear he 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.870
 there is 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.500
 enter 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.290
 a quick yes it's too strong 4 x 3 la 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.579
 dapa 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.659
 and so it's well staged it's 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:58.260
 enough I never have a problem that 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.260
 miss neither head 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.980
 test soon 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.560
 what is it but there is more 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.709
 the stadium to see and be seen 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.709
 terms 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.930
 after what he likes enough 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.080
 fuel efficient 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.680
 they concentrate too much - no then as he 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.969
 there was a big have ten did the 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.840
 full of tranquility for the day 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:33.999
 okay according to ergonomics it's going to obs 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.960
 at the controls all this is not an end 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:39.009
 but you understand it is enough 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.020
 why there are some gaps 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.749
 there are things that are inaccessible 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.099
 your for example put the most of 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:48.610
 force it's interesting anyway 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.659
 always like all balls work it 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.090
 Perhaps behind it is difficult 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.400
 but you have to turn and then it's 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.259
 he who has trouble with the rights of the animal 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.660
 course of accor 6 against it can be canceled 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.500
 here yes 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.280
 we 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.280
 this pretty summary 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.670
 but it's reliable 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.840
 Youtube 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.760
 it lacks a bit of hair before maybe 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.540
 no 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.540
 what is needed in the east 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.090
 lack of wind 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.870
 for stake a focus 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.350
 pahlsson 2 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.969
 I see you manage the acceleration with 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:08.220
 attention now 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.060
 why not the pedal is not in a hurry 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.960
 let's start by specifying 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.960
 of the gap between them 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:20.430
 but as accurate as frutos and 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.910
 yeah so the pedal the sarongs small 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.830
 here is no 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.920
 that's what they're going for they're easy 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.260
 to pass the trucks is a doggie not 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.330
 easily synchronized by cons 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.080
 still speed for more than one jerrican 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.300
 it's hard 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.780
 yes ie out 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.200
 put the range pitt is in neutral 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.920
 the case 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.920
 the debate
