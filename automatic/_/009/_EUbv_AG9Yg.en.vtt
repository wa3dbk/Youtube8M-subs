it's<00:00:36.530> good<00:00:36.710> now<00:00:36.890> I<00:00:36.920> like<00:00:37.160> here<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:37.520> more<00:00:37.699> I've

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's good now I like here the more I've

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.900

driven<00:00:38.149> it

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
driven it

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.380 
driven it
and<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.960> more<00:00:41.170> alike<00:00:41.440> actually<00:00:42.040> it<00:00:42.520> handles

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
and the more alike actually it handles

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.850 
and the more alike actually it handles
better<00:00:43.600> than<00:00:43.840> I<00:00:43.870> thought<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.200> would<00:00:44.380> do<00:00:44.620> I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
better than I thought it would do I

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.160 
better than I thought it would do I
thought<00:00:45.640> it'd<00:00:45.760> be<00:00:45.790> a<00:00:45.910> bit<00:00:46.060> more<00:00:46.210> twitchy<00:00:46.570> yeah

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
thought it'd be a bit more twitchy yeah

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.170 
thought it'd be a bit more twitchy yeah
especially<00:00:47.800> in<00:00:48.130> the<00:00:48.220> corners<00:00:48.700> and<00:00:48.880> especially

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
especially in the corners and especially

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.180 
especially in the corners and especially
as<00:00:49.450> it's<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.840> bit<00:00:49.990> damp<00:00:50.260> today<00:00:50.440> as<00:00:50.740> well<00:00:50.980> but

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
as it's a bit damp today as well but

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.160 
as it's a bit damp today as well but
it's<00:00:51.400> been<00:00:51.640> okay<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:52.660> good<00:00:52.810> to<00:00:52.900> bring<00:00:53.020> this

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
it's been okay so good to bring this

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.570 
it's been okay so good to bring this
home<00:00:53.410> and<00:00:53.440> Dede<00:00:53.830> your<00:00:54.010> family<00:00:54.310> and<00:00:54.430> friends

that<00:00:57.520> fine<00:00:57.870> self<00:00:58.870> not<00:00:59.080> to<00:00:59.110> be<00:00:59.380> I<00:00:59.410> think<00:00:59.650> really

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
that fine self not to be I think really

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.110

I mean like the looks of it alone enough
and<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.390> think<00:01:04.420> as<00:01:05.080> soon<00:01:05.230> as<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.470> go<00:01:05.620> fridge

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.000 
and I think as soon as you go fridge
arriving<00:01:06.370> it

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
arriving it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.790 
arriving it
it<00:01:07.460> does<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:08.060> just<00:01:08.290> puts<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.410> smile<00:01:09.650> on<00:01:09.680> your

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
it does it just puts a smile on your

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.410 
it does it just puts a smile on your
face<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.250> mean<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.460> Opel<00:01:10.760> smile<00:01:11.030> on<00:01:11.150> your<00:01:11.210> face

face I mean the Opel smile on your face
yeah<00:01:11.840> yeah<00:01:12.140> it's<00:01:12.680> hard<00:01:12.860> not<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:13.760> I<00:01:13.790> get<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
yeah yeah it's hard not to but I get the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.760 
yeah yeah it's hard not to but I get the
impression<00:01:14.350> overall<00:01:15.370> that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
impression overall that

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.859 
impression overall that
this<00:01:18.340> really<00:01:18.729> hasn't<00:01:18.939> lived<00:01:19.210> up<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.479> your

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
this really hasn't lived up to your

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.749 
this really hasn't lived up to your
expectations<00:01:20.200> now<00:01:20.979> I<00:01:21.009> don't<00:01:21.159> think<00:01:21.490> it<00:01:21.579> has

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
expectations now I don't think it has

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.969 
expectations now I don't think it has
not<00:01:22.030> completely<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:23.020> maybe<00:01:23.229> that's<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.829> do

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
not completely and maybe that's to do

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.950 
not completely and maybe that's to do
with<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.219> feather<00:01:24.429> that<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.609> old<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:25.299> think

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
with the feather that is old I think

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.160 
with the feather that is old I think
maybe<00:01:26.140> if<00:01:26.289> had<00:01:26.469> a<00:01:26.500> little<00:01:26.740> bit<00:01:26.920> more<00:01:26.950> money<00:01:27.280> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
maybe if had a little bit more money to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.679 
maybe if had a little bit more money to
spend<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.289> it<00:01:29.439> maybe<00:01:29.560> in<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.130> one<00:01:30.689> then

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
spend on it maybe in you and one then

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.499 
spend on it maybe in you and one then
maybe<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:33.009> would<00:01:33.039> be<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.609> persuade<00:01:34.090> me<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.299> bit

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
maybe that would be so persuade me a bit

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.199 
maybe that would be so persuade me a bit
more<00:01:34.750> now<00:01:35.649> over<00:01:35.979> 40<00:01:36.369> years<00:01:36.610> since<00:01:36.759> Porsche

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
lot heavier to drive it sound to me like

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.040 
lot heavier to drive it sound to me like
you're<00:03:40.910> afraid<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.300> say<00:03:41.450> but<00:03:41.510> just<00:03:41.870> slightly

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
you're afraid to say but just slightly

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.350 
you're afraid to say but just slightly
disappointed<00:03:42.739> with<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.040> right<00:03:43.700> yeah<00:03:44.030> maybe

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
disappointed with it right yeah maybe

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.390 
disappointed with it right yeah maybe
slightly<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.140> be<00:03:45.260> honest<00:03:45.530> after<00:03:45.920> all<00:03:46.099> those

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
slightly to be honest after all those

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.119 
slightly to be honest after all those
years<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.879> think<00:03:47.060> if<00:03:47.840> I'd<00:03:48.349> be<00:03:48.530> one<00:03:48.680> over<00:03:48.860> on<00:03:49.010> the

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
years I think if I'd be one over on the

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.220 
years I think if I'd be one over on the
looks<00:03:49.370> more<00:03:49.700> than<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:50.000> drive<00:03:50.269> but<00:03:50.989> after

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
looks more than the drive but after

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.500 
looks more than the drive but after
driving<00:03:51.379> it<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:52.069> think<00:03:52.640> it's<00:03:52.760> as<00:03:52.879> much<00:03:52.910> fun<00:03:53.360> as

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
driving it I think it's as much fun as

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.570 
driving it I think it's as much fun as
the<00:03:53.660> other<00:03:53.780> two<00:03:54.019> all<00:03:54.680> right<00:03:54.860> well<00:03:55.040> listen<00:03:55.370> I've
