00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.670
 those that same city can share their movies format 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.309
 I waited 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.869
 is which we are stopped by the outbreak of the movies 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.809
 so 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.179
 percent is cost of time you were looking for we bought to share 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.749
 this land vehicle 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.249
 portable format 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.539
 I found two problems first 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.929
 active programs dozens more can convert three minutes of study 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.099
 total 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.280
 and which were enough 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.580
 this plan is a very good movie 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.920
 um who with greater or three minutes were ozil 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.080
 and another problem that he 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080
 in six people who has the program 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.250
 they are asking that they applaud are disasters from the form 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.010
 supersubmarina which to give you the program 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.470
 I realized that my salary 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.479
 so 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.100
 I shut up obfuscated at this plan because it does not follow 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 and is that justice is not seen anymore 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.170
 opine or competitor 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.380
 number 6 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.220
 arocha 6 better said 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.060
 but I do not know how much stamina we're going to the point 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.970
 I'm going to leave you a link with the projection of him 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.409

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.370
 the one who waits for time if they do not have the 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.530
 the prize charges 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.300
 like others for free 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.330
 many we see then points 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.640
 maybe yes six floor commit their wines to the species 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.120
 and is ready enjoy 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.950
 the child fish employment points 57 55 - so we may wait to download it 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.900
 they will be as always done 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.900
 I want I have stepped 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.850
 this way towers 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.230
 much success 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.320
 right report have been acquired as administrator of simply as 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.320
 we say left doubleclick program and you're 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.150
 here we see a folder that is more 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.529
 is indicating 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.159
 that has as many Haitians as the program 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.049
 the serial we are going to place 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.799
 that is the username i this fact is license code 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.059
 we copy this both 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.489
 and we are going to do it when the program asks us first 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.789
 let's overcome it 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.109
 in it they have been approved because I have it well but as always any 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.159

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.109
 does not prescribe 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.979
 do not forget that you have to change the language of Spain 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.489
 and we closed the program 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.409
 and here is the pro 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.409

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.649
 here we will be able to see the profile 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:33.529
 we'll see 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.769

 even for xbox pc sitting 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.410
 here there are many 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.879
 this 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.879
 compression format for up to one we can also have it 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.669
 so by the way was lending nintendo 10 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:03:59.689
 dt g video 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.689
 ep and refresh that eric puyol up and the second 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:07.109
 is the most appropriate as lived listing for 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.839
 this program that deals with water kovic 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.129
 tolosa 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.990
 for today 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.320
 nintendo day the system that allows us to see the videos and listen to our 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.419
 music 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.719
 and yesterday chosen 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:19.779
 so 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.889
 is the profile 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.230
 where are we going to place this the happy ones and had with her help 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.039
 even license code 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.860
 you know what we copied 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 we had it here unusual and the license 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.650
 and we no longer have records 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.949
 as I have it registered 3 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.279
 you have to see your craters that I do is like this 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:45.460
 and now that you plan 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.110
 the successful cycle here says that he agreed to buy 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.509
 Pakistan 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.509
 the 50 that works very well 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.189
 let's see how to convert a video 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.189
 let's go men to the crisis 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.139
 here we are 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.120
 yúber I have my folder e 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.330
 desktop 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
 I'm going to look for it for 26 days 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.319
 conventional puellés 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.319
 here I have the movie and without a weight of 1 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.849
 48 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.849
 we do not accept 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:25.229
 here it is 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.659
 now we go fast 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.799
 after that we're going to get in even though the size of the official video 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.839
 because for example 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:33.930
 before afip 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.980
 create video 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.979
 realize this effect is in a joke tone 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.979
 points 7 megas the format of 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.830
 now if I put it in that standard so I put it a larger size 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.819
 increased 4 63 points 2 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.110
 in quality of life 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.479
 yes that procrea de paolis de normal 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:52.729
 high 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:53.930
 621 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.240
 in all medias 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.410
 and if you have time that divides your video 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.830
 I really have not done it 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.110
 total 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.330
 this eclipse perpetrate 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.040
 to be able to convert videos we simply give you the pleasure 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.249
 dc with precipitation 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:12.770
 and they are no longer alone 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.650
 in time of driving Tenerife the amount 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.099
 because we are going to fight 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.099
 this was extended that lasts 2 hours 30 coupons tickets 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:24.379
 firecrackers that is like 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.999
 for immediacy maybe a little more 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:29.659
 it depends on your life 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:31.129
 we are going to 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.659
 the encounter lived 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:33.729
 and here is 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:34.590
 closet 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.590
 and that are 620 million 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:41.610
 guido which he signed that we had here is 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.210
 and in 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.689
 he would comply with the scalpel to him 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:48.689
 do not ask here for these to see the videos that 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.879
 what is this that you thank me Jesus

 here occupy 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.089
 the video that kept them from scholarships 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:57.189

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:58.869
 here nobody in lakes 

00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:00.599
 this style and taste 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:01.869
