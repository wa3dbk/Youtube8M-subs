00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.099
 all good health today 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.910
 New Year's holidays, I decided to pickle 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.650
 pink salmon and recipe want to share with 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.650
 you really 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.230
 salted red fish well, in general, rome fish 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.869
 possible in various ways 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.570
 but to me this one which I will now 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.609
 use the most like 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.890
 only one salt is used in 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.469
 resulting in a fish bite so bright 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.969
 pronounced nothing clogged by any 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:40.719
 strangers taste and as such 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:45.930
 I actually have one pink salmon 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:47.100
 kilogram and I start to sprinkle it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.629
 carefully 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.570
 the usual coarse salt I do it on 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:00.039
 a tray because it is convenient for me to sleep 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.460
 will crumble don't use 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:07.590
 iodized salt is better to take ordinary 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:14.590
 stone food from me is such salt 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:18.720
 Ukrainian salt necessarily absolute I 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:23.159
 Salt with my head so tasty 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.159
 inside the salt, too, need to pour 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:45.990
 fish I turned the other side and 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:50.490
 here I repeat the procedure after 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.979
 how i rub the fish with salt i want to shift 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.430
 him on another tray but pre I 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.220
 fish zamo you in foil as it turned out 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.190
 foil and we had no she 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.680
 over so I decided to go 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.149
 another the other way i use the sleeve 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.289
 for baking 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.830
 I first measured the length of the fish 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:17.360
 here somewhere so here we cut off 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.170
 I packed the fish in the sleeve now around the edges 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.950
 one side 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.140
 of 2 whose hand is in the lightly tied up principle 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.140
 and so thought that in the sleeve maybe 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.019
 even better because you can see inside 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.519
 happens as fish salted 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.640
 maybe before what I will 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.920
 months olga use precisely hands 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.180
 Well, as if all the fish I already 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.910
 neatly packed everything well further 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.640
 I'm in the fridge there she is 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.100
 will spend five six days through this time 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.720
 it is already ready for use that is 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.239
 just in time for the New Year's table 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.180
 this pink salmon will be ready for her 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.540
 eat in principle that's all yes 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.310
 I think there is no reason to shoot a video because 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.890
 that everything is clear 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.739
 and by the way I want to say that it is possible 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.830
 what is flowing out of fish is some kind of liquid and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.270
 You can want to merge and I do not 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.050
 changing anything without merging 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.290
 as there is and keep the fridge 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.290
 see you bye
