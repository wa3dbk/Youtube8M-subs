little container bookshelf and then you

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.750 
little container bookshelf and then you
know<00:02:58.109> all<00:02:58.349> controls<00:02:58.889> not<00:02:59.159> much<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.699> on

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760

too cluttered and stuff and that's

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.059 
too cluttered and stuff and that's
basically<00:03:08.219> it

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
basically it

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.899
