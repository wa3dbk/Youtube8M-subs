00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 nutritious light pause rich in taste 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.629
 the same time then why not now 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.379
 carve out a small space for everything 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.349
 we 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.049
 I would like to prepare a smoothie with bananas 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.700
 and strawberries yes but the aim has not taken off 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.760
 is that of a simple and trivial 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.970
 smoothie because in fact we will prepare it 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.500
 with natural ingredients and reporters for 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.260
 stock up on mineral salt vitamins 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.130
 nutrients we will see different ingredients 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.279
 100 g of banana pulp 200 250 grams 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.040
 of fresh strawberries 200 milliliters approximately 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.239
 of hemp seed milk 15 grams of 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.430
 stevia 31 half lemon juice is 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.020
 optional some mint leaves 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.520
 like any self-respecting smoothie 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.309
 obviously the simple preparation 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.610
 simple but I have chosen with care 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.879
 basic ingredients to make mine 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.670
 raw food smoothie milk is a milk 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.489
 raw vegetable obviously prepared in 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.890
 starting from the seeds of cannabis sativa that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.359
 offers a side with water you can find 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.159
 the recipe then superimposed 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.979
 I will also put the link at the end of the video 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.960
 this year hemp milk 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.460
 sweetened here are the strawberries that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.290
 are the seasons and also the bananas 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 because in my opinion they contrast banana 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.790
 strawberry is excellent 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:25.860
 then we begin to peel the Roman 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.900
 let 's put the slices of banal immediately 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.509
 lemon juice to prevent 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.829
 the rapid oxidation of bananas a 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.659
 contact with the air is also the lemon there 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.659
 some strawberries are fine 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.490
 well washed, dry with a cloth and 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.100
 founded and then cut even small pieces 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.710
 then as a sweetener you can put it 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.590
 as I suggest the stevia ho 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.420
 used a stevia 31 means that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.100
 a teaspoon of stevia corresponds to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.070
 three teaspoons of sugar of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.020
 reference or sucrose if 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.490
 strawberries are very sweet you can too 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.590
 avoid putting this sweetener 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.600
 or to replace it with maybe with the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.330
 mister oppo da gava 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:18.450
 we put our seed milk of 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:21.290
 hemp lyon ray a touch of freshness 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.650
 with a few leaves of fresh mint 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.650
 we find everything 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.239
 here we are in a flash our 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.430
 based on ready see this is the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.010
 consistency that I like with not too much 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.810
 liquid a lot at power you can adapt it 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.090
 according to your tastes by increasing or 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.390
 decreasing the amount of vegetable milk 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.430
 con dista to put the advice that you 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 I can give is to take it immediately 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.330
 so don't leave it there too long 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.250
 otherwise active ingredients oxidize 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.549
 in this way, fill up on vitamins 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.549
 and mineral salts
