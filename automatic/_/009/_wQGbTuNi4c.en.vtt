hair<00:01:19.950> came<00:01:20.250> out<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.810> wonderful

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
hair came out I think really wonderful

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.779 
hair came out I think really wonderful
this<00:01:22.950> doll<00:01:23.220> had<00:01:23.700> been<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.590> box<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.640> her

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
this doll had been in a box with her

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.840 
this doll had been in a box with her
hair<00:01:27.149> as<00:01:27.390> ugly<00:01:27.959> as<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.319> before<00:01:28.580> for<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.610> long

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
hair as ugly as it was before for a long

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.529 
hair as ugly as it was before for a long
time

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
time

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:37.749 
time
so<00:01:31.580> my<00:01:34.220> my<00:01:35.220> idea<00:01:35.819> is<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.270> came<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.840> pretty<00:01:37.020> good

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
so my my idea is it came out pretty good

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
so my my idea is it came out pretty good
considering<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.209> was<00:01:39.500> now<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:40.619> sure

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
considering what it was now I'm sure

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.100 
considering what it was now I'm sure
that<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.580> doll<00:01:41.910> whose<00:01:42.690> heroes

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that if you have a doll whose heroes

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.380 
that if you have a doll whose heroes
messed<00:01:43.379> up<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.769> bad<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.160> this<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.580> that<00:01:45.149> hasn't

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
messed up as bad as this one that hasn't

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.089 
messed up as bad as this one that hasn't
been<00:01:45.629> sitting<00:01:46.019> around<00:01:46.080> as<00:01:46.349> long<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.860> one

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:47.099 
been sitting around as long as this one

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:49.699 
been sitting around as long as this one
was<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.940> know<00:01:48.030> work<00:01:48.209> even<00:01:48.479> better<00:01:48.629> but<00:01:49.440> in<00:01:49.530> all

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
was you know work even better but in all

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.669 
was you know work even better but in all
cases<00:01:50.179> this<00:01:51.179> one<00:01:51.450> pretty<00:01:51.690> much<00:01:51.840> looks<00:01:52.289> good<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
cases this one pretty much looks good to

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.229 
cases this one pretty much looks good to
me<00:01:53.479> again<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.660> formula<00:01:55.019> was<00:01:55.410> 2<00:01:56.239> tablespoons

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
me again the formula was 2 tablespoons

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.609 
me again the formula was 2 tablespoons
of<00:01:57.509> fabric<00:01:58.080> softener<00:01:58.349> and<00:01:59.090> a<00:02:00.090> 3<00:02:00.539> ounce<00:02:00.810> bottle

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
of fabric softener and a 3 ounce bottle

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.740 
of fabric softener and a 3 ounce bottle
