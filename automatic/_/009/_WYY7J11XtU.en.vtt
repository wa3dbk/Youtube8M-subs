turn I just think it's a it's a really
great<00:03:40.840> twist<00:03:41.140> for<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.470> arc<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.950> figured<00:03:42.730> she

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
great twist for the arc I figured she

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.580 
great twist for the arc I figured she
was<00:03:43.060> dead<00:03:43.300> for<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.600> longest<00:03:44.080> time<00:03:44.200> I<00:03:44.350> thought

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
was dead for the longest time I thought

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.750 
was dead for the longest time I thought
there<00:03:44.860> was<00:03:44.950> going<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.130> be<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.250> scene<00:03:45.490> where<00:03:45.670> they

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
there was going to be a scene where they

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.950 
there was going to be a scene where they
would<00:03:45.880> just<00:03:45.910> find<00:03:46.240> her<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.540> they<00:03:46.600> find<00:03:46.810> out

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
would just find her and they find out

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.990 
would just find her and they find out
she<00:03:47.110> was<00:03:47.230> dead<00:03:47.500> but<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.370> really<00:03:48.850> nice

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
she was dead but this is a really nice

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.480 
she was dead but this is a really nice
twist<00:03:49.390> which<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:50.080> know<00:03:50.110> it's<00:03:50.980> crazy<00:03:51.280> that

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
twist which is you know it's crazy that

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.190 
twist which is you know it's crazy that
they're<00:03:51.760> deciding<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.330> throw<00:03:52.570> this<00:03:52.750> in<00:03:52.960> you

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
they're deciding to throw this in you

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.680
