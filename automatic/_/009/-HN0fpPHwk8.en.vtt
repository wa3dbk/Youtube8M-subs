 m 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.960
 mathis bagdad walsh and 10 km 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.810
 hello everyone is marc leroy on 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.240
 is found today for a whole 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.160
 new video on destiny then 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.080
 today exceptionally I do not 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.070
 I will not offer you as I 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.950
 did it every week 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.500
 the challenge realization video that 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.850
 you proposed me since ben I did not 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.400
 not had the time it is especially that 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.530
 I had information 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.840
 concerning the future of the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.200
 content of decines and I really 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.820
 wanted to introduce it to you now for 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.290
 that a lot that you are aware 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.900
 as quickly as possible and more 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.410
 easily possible and so today 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.750
 it will be a video on the content either 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.960
 saying future content or banners 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.710
 of farm that will be March 17 and so 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.710
 according to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.909
 a modder a hacker that gives all 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.170
 information about different 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.000
 forums and websites 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.030
 so maybe you already have some 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.610
 heard about this mega man x 4 and so 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.740
 according to him there you have the screen to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.450
 the screen so in fact according to him it will be 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.580
 all the one where you have who will be in the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.380
 next way to do so he has one 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.450
 have the boots as we had this week 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.540
 and then it will be the torso the hammer 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.130
 of silva's holder and anger so is 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.050
 what is true or not for the moment 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 we admit nothing is 100% safe so 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.350
 it's really what you need to remember 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.050
 it's just codes of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.770
 assumptions but after often follow 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.350
 below that megaman offers balance 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.080
 an idea often it's just right 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.479
 we'll see on February 17th, March 17th 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.369
 excuse me but it should be okay 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.170
 to be helped saber that for the blow I you 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.909
 shows other two other little ones 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.000
 screenshots just to see the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.619
 stats for example martrou le dolder 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.040
 so clearly if you have the opportunity 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.110
 of 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.030
 to do a few banners to do the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.629
 March 17th from March 17th during 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.640
 the whole week 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.819
 do it since the holder hammer 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.760
 is really 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.950
 very good very good gun 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.239
 thresher it's really a lot of 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.370
 damage as you can see with the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.769
 rate of fire and impact between mode 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.230
 stability so so me I you the 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.719
 advise a lot if you can 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.180
 wash do it so that will be seen order 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:41.420
 from the previous screenshot it should be 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.670
 the hammer djoser high rank 4 of the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.500
 banner to do and so for the shot 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.139
 as we now see the anger of 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.239
 orange cinema 5 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.590
 so I'm going to say so much better because 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.359
 that anger of figs really march 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.769
 not at all an assault rifle that 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.870
 interest me since as you can 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.209
 see him alain tiny impact so 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.129
 women definitely do not know 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.579
 a lot of damage that can be I 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.840
 would say as sous souge that we will say 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.180
 like a machine gun not really 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.500
 physio plus a machine gun but that 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.329
 will not be a lot of very fat gags 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.010
 rate of fire so to interest me 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.560
 really much less so me I you 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.969
 really advise to do the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.099
 banner to do for the match the 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.689
 holder hammer and so that's it 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.840
 all for this little video 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.359
 information about the future content of the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.879
 future way of doing so we're going 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.530
 hope that it will prove true and then 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.069
 This is everything to me and I tell you a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.069
 more everyone
