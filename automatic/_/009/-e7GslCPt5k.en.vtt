but<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> first<00:00:47.610> thing<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.789> always<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:48.149> when<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
but the first thing I always do when I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.549 
but the first thing I always do when I
pick<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.600> cameras<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.110> check<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> shutter

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
pick up the cameras I check the shutter

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.970 
pick up the cameras I check the shutter
speeds<00:00:49.980> an<00:00:50.280> eighth<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.120> second<00:00:51.980> should

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
speeds an eighth of a second should

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.160 
speeds an eighth of a second should
sound<00:00:53.280> different<00:00:53.789> from<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:55.260> half<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.530> second<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
sound different from a half a second and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.500 
sound different from a half a second and
it<00:00:58.170> does<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:59.100> should<00:00:59.910> sound<00:01:00.149> different<00:01:00.480> than

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it does and should sound different than

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.960 
it does and should sound different than
a<00:01:00.660> 250<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.379> does<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.460> seems<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> have

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
a 250 and it does so that seems to have

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.250 
a 250 and it does so that seems to have
shutters<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.689> working<00:01:07.020> that's<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
shutters that are working that's the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.700 
shutters that are working that's the
first<00:01:07.470> thing<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:10.380> has<00:01:10.680> a

there's no obvious marks on it we can
test<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.880> see<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.390> working<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.229> far<00:01:43.740> as

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the apertures are closing down

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930 
the apertures are closing down
that<00:02:12.640> closed<00:02:12.819> down<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.120> f-16<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.760> should<00:02:15.760> close

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
that closed down the f-16 I should close

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.570 
that closed down the f-16 I should close
down<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.239> F<00:02:16.390> for<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.049> little<00:02:17.170> bit<00:02:17.580> and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
down the F for just a little bit and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.649 
down the F for just a little bit and
hopefully<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.120> see<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.599> the

since I picked this up and brought it
back<00:02:53.970> again<00:02:55.440> inside<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:57.040> should<00:02:57.220> be<00:02:57.280> able<00:02:57.370> to

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
back again inside you should be able to

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.699 
back again inside you should be able to
see<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.760> shutter<00:02:58.030> working<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.049> it<00:02:59.409> should<00:02:59.590> be

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
see the shutter working and it should be

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.300 
see the shutter working and it should be
changing<00:03:00.159> at<00:03:00.340> different<00:03:00.909> shutter<00:03:01.060> speeds<00:03:02.310> it

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
changing at different shutter speeds it

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.559 
changing at different shutter speeds it
should<00:03:03.670> be<00:03:03.760> going<00:03:03.879> all<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.150> way<00:03:04.180> across<00:03:04.359> and

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
should be going all the way across and

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.030 
should be going all the way across and
not<00:03:04.840> stopping<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:07.620> advanced<00:03:08.620> area

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
not stopping the advanced area

not stopping the advanced area
everything<00:03:09.250> looks<00:03:09.489> like<00:03:09.579> it's<00:03:09.700> turning

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
everything looks like it's turning

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.430 
everything looks like it's turning
properly<00:03:10.629> and<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.780> looks<00:03:10.900> rather<00:03:11.049> clean

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
properly and it looks rather clean

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.099 
properly and it looks rather clean
inside<00:03:11.829> I<00:03:12.180> don't<00:03:13.180> see<00:03:13.299> any<00:03:13.450> little<00:03:13.720> bits<00:03:13.959> of

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
inside I don't see any little bits of

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.020 
inside I don't see any little bits of
broken<00:03:14.409> film<00:03:14.920> or<00:03:15.129> anything<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.639> inside<00:03:15.910> so

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
broken film or anything on the inside so

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.140 
broken film or anything on the inside so
that<00:03:16.060> seems<00:03:16.359> like<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.510> good<00:03:16.660> thing<00:03:18.150> again

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
that seems like a good thing again

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.339 
that seems like a good thing again
through<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.480> viewfinder<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:20.109> viewfinder

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
through the viewfinder the viewfinder

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.729 
through the viewfinder the viewfinder
looks<00:03:20.769> clear<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.480> very<00:03:22.660> basic<00:03:23.319> camera

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
looks clear this is a very basic camera

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.280 
looks clear this is a very basic camera
it's<00:03:24.010> kind<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.370> Pentax<00:03:24.730> k1000<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:26.169> a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
it's kind of like a Pentax k1000 it's a

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.949 
it's kind of like a Pentax k1000 it's a
workhorse<00:03:26.739> it's<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.669> first<00:03:27.940> camera<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:28.450> any

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
workhorse it's the first camera that any

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.650 
workhorse it's the first camera that any
leave<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.650> its<00:03:29.799> work<00:03:29.980> with<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.639> it's<00:03:31.299> kind<00:03:31.629> of

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
leave of its work with so it's kind of

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.830 
leave of its work with so it's kind of
got<00:03:31.870> some<00:03:32.079> legacy<00:03:32.440> as<00:03:32.739> far<00:03:32.769> as<00:03:33.190> who<00:03:33.970> has<00:03:34.480> used

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
got some legacy as far as who has used

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.909 
got some legacy as far as who has used
them<00:03:35.079> in<00:03:35.139> alta<00:03:35.760> SRT<00:03:36.760> camera<00:03:37.590> there's<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.680> depth

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
them in alta SRT camera there's a depth

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.689 
them in alta SRT camera there's a depth
of<00:03:39.069> field<00:03:39.250> preview<00:03:39.549> button<00:03:41.489> like<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.549> said

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
of field preview button like I said

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.240 
of field preview button like I said
there's<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:42.879> mirror<00:03:43.150> lock-up<00:03:43.329> on<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.250> it's

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
there's a mirror lock-up on the it's

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.349 
there's a mirror lock-up on the it's
right<00:03:45.430> there<00:03:45.669> on<00:03:45.699> the<00:03:47.849> upgraded<00:03:48.849> models<00:03:49.209> with

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
right there on the upgraded models with

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.470 
right there on the upgraded models with
an<00:03:49.480> extra<00:03:49.840> one<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.790> most<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:52.000> us<00:03:52.060> up<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.239> won't

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
an extra one and most of us up you won't

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.390 
an extra one and most of us up you won't
ever<00:03:52.599> really<00:03:52.900> need<00:03:53.109> but<00:03:53.500> if<00:03:53.889> you<00:03:54.069> are<00:03:54.190> shooting

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
ever really need but if you are shooting

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.159 
ever really need but if you are shooting
a<00:03:54.579> landscape<00:03:55.060> or<00:03:55.299> you<00:03:55.780> want<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.019> shoot

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
a landscape or you want to shoot

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.509 
a landscape or you want to shoot
something<00:03:56.410> where<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.739> can<00:03:56.919> really<00:03:57.220> make<00:03:57.310> sure

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
something where you can really make sure

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.300 
something where you can really make sure
that<00:03:57.699> there's<00:03:57.879> no<00:03:58.060> camera<00:03:58.629> shake<00:03:59.440> from<00:04:00.160> the

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
that there's no camera shake from the

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.680 
that there's no camera shake from the
mirror<00:04:00.609> flipping<00:04:01.000> up<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.329> would<00:04:01.419> be<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.540> good

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
mirror flipping up that would be a good

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.650 
mirror flipping up that would be a good
way<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.870> check<00:04:02.079> it<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:02.910> this<00:04:03.910> is<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.090> good<00:04:04.329> camera

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
way to check it so this is a good camera

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.229 
way to check it so this is a good camera
I'd<00:04:04.750> recommend<00:04:05.199> the<00:04:05.680> minolta<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.699> heaviest

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
I'd recommend the minolta it's heaviest

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.500 
I'd recommend the minolta it's heaviest
can<00:04:07.449> be<00:04:07.629> it's<00:04:08.410> solid<00:04:09.129> feeling<00:04:09.699> I<00:04:09.910> like<00:04:10.359> them<00:04:10.480> a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
can be it's solid feeling I like them a

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.330 
can be it's solid feeling I like them a
lot<00:04:10.690> better<00:04:10.930> than<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.639> modern<00:04:13.049> 90s<00:04:14.340> Minolta

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340

J's that came out right before them

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.959 
J's that came out right before them
those<00:04:20.709> have<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:20.919> lot<00:04:21.039> more<00:04:21.070> plastic<00:04:21.669> on<00:04:21.789> and

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969

this one has a lot
a very<00:04:24.130> solid<00:04:24.580> feel<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.350> this<00:04:26.350> would<00:04:26.500> be<00:04:26.620> my

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
a very solid feel and this would be my

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.860 
a very solid feel and this would be my

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
compartment turn it on and see if it

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.390 
compartment turn it on and see if it
works<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:50.620> haven't<00:04:50.860> even<00:04:50.920> had<00:04:51.100> a<00:04:51.160> chance<00:04:51.190> to

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
works I haven't even had a chance to

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.340 
works I haven't even had a chance to
check<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.790> if<00:04:52.240> it<00:04:52.480> does<00:04:52.660> work<00:04:52.870> you'll<00:04:53.080> see<00:04:53.230> the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
check it if it does work you'll see the

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.200 
check it if it does work you'll see the
meter<00:04:53.530> moving<00:04:53.980> as<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:54.610> point<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:54.970> towards

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
meter moving as you point it towards

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.240 
meter moving as you point it towards
light<00:04:55.450> and<00:04:55.600> away<00:04:55.750> from<00:04:55.990> light<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.410> if<00:04:57.130> it

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
light and away from light and if it

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.640 
light and away from light and if it
doesn't<00:04:57.670> then<00:04:58.540> you<00:04:58.720> have<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.960> guess<00:04:59.140> exposure

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
doesn't then you have to guess exposure

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.430 
doesn't then you have to guess exposure
which<00:05:00.460> again<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:01.300> would<00:05:01.540> say<00:05:01.720> if<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:02.020> went<00:05:02.260> and

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
which again I would say if you went and

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.550 
which again I would say if you went and
took<00:05:02.560> this<00:05:02.740> lens<00:05:03.040> a<00:05:03.400> 50<00:05:04.120> millimeter<00:05:04.350> 1.4<00:05:05.350> and

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
took this lens a 50 millimeter 1.4 and

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.060 
took this lens a 50 millimeter 1.4 and
you<00:05:06.310> took<00:05:06.520> it<00:05:06.700> inside<00:05:07.030> any<00:05:07.360> pub<00:05:08.290> at<00:05:08.560> night<00:05:08.770> with

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
you took it inside any pub at night with

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.880 
you took it inside any pub at night with
a<00:05:09.100> band<00:05:09.430> playing<00:05:09.790> if<00:05:10.450> you<00:05:10.720> shot<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.140> at<00:05:11.260> a<00:05:11.290> 60<00:05:11.800> at

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
a band playing if you shot it at a 60 at

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.790 
a band playing if you shot it at a 60 at
F<00:05:12.040> 1.4<00:05:12.850> and<00:05:13.120> focus<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.230> hold<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.500> camera

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
F 1.4 and focus it and hold the camera

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.850 
F 1.4 and focus it and hold the camera
still<00:05:15.040> you<00:05:15.760> would<00:05:15.880> get<00:05:16.030> an<00:05:16.150> image<00:05:16.440> on<00:05:17.440> film

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
still you would get an image on film

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.420 
still you would get an image on film
like<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.970> four<00:05:19.270> hundred<00:05:19.390> speed<00:05:19.750> film<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:20.340> lot<00:05:21.340> of

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
like a four hundred speed film a lot of

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.770 
like a four hundred speed film a lot of
times<00:05:21.580> people<00:05:21.760> really<00:05:22.120> get<00:05:22.240> bogged<00:05:22.450> down<00:05:22.570> by

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
times people really get bogged down by

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.300 
times people really get bogged down by
the<00:05:22.840> metering<00:05:23.200> and<00:05:23.350> I<00:05:23.470> think<00:05:23.680> that<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:24.220> know

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
the metering and I think that you know

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.860 
the metering and I think that you know
most<00:05:24.520> of<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.730> time<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:25.090> can<00:05:25.240> get<00:05:25.360> away<00:05:25.510> with

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
most of the time you can get away with

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.750 
most of the time you can get away with
just<00:05:25.900> guessing<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.680> metering<00:05:27.010> there's<00:05:27.669> a

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
just guessing the metering there's a

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.120 
just guessing the metering there's a
rule<00:05:28.060> called<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.390> sunny<00:05:28.600> 16<00:05:28.870> rule<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.890> would

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
rule called a sunny 16 rule and I would

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.850 
rule called a sunny 16 rule and I would
highly<00:05:30.730> recommend<00:05:30.840> learning<00:05:31.840> it<00:05:32.169> it's<00:05:32.410> simple

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
highly recommend learning it it's simple

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.320 
highly recommend learning it it's simple
it's<00:05:33.160> something<00:05:33.700> that<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:33.940> can<00:05:34.090> easily

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
it's something that you can easily

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.720 
it's something that you can easily
remember<00:05:34.870> and<00:05:35.230> then<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:35.860> makes<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:36.370> work<00:05:36.550> so

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
remember and then it makes it work so

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.130 
remember and then it makes it work so
that<00:05:36.820> you<00:05:36.910> can<00:05:37.060> use<00:05:37.210> a<00:05:37.240> camera<00:05:37.540> like<00:05:37.750> this<00:05:37.810> when

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
that you can use a camera like this when

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.760 
that you can use a camera like this when
you<00:05:38.260> have<00:05:38.290> no<00:05:39.220> working<00:05:39.730> meter<00:05:39.940> but<00:05:40.510> again<00:05:40.930> once

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
you have no working meter but again once

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.980 
you have no working meter but again once
I<00:05:41.860> put<00:05:42.010> a<00:05:42.040> battery<00:05:42.220> in<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.700> battery<00:05:42.880> may<00:05:43.330> work

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
I put a battery in the battery may work

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.110 
I put a battery in the battery may work
the<00:05:44.169> meter<00:05:44.350> just<00:05:44.650> fine<00:05:44.890> anyway<00:05:45.790> that's<00:05:46.060> a

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
the meter just fine anyway that's a

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.140 
the meter just fine anyway that's a
