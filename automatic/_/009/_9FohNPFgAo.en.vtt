WrestleMania I think the best feature
that<00:01:01.909> I've<00:01:02.030> experienced<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:02.659> far<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.989> game<00:01:03.170> is

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
that I've experienced so far the game is

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.590 
that I've experienced so far the game is
just<00:01:03.559> how<00:01:03.799> realistic<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.549> I<00:01:04.820> mean<00:01:05.149> some<00:01:05.540> of

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
just how realistic is I mean some of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.929 
just how realistic is I mean some of
these<00:01:05.659> guys<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.259> even<00:01:06.530> my<00:01:06.710> character<00:01:07.220> which

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
these guys and even my character which

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.639 
these guys and even my character which
is<00:01:08.060> always<00:01:08.299> weird<00:01:08.509> playing<00:01:08.930> yourself<00:01:09.140> in<00:01:09.590> a

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
is always weird playing yourself in a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.560 
is always weird playing yourself in a
video<00:01:09.890> game<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.549> graphics<00:01:10.850> never<00:01:11.390> has

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
video game the graphics never has

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.270 
video game the graphics never has
improved<00:01:11.899> so<00:01:12.140> much<00:01:12.200> they're<00:01:12.560> almost<00:01:12.680> lifelike

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
improved so much they're almost lifelike

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.450 
improved so much they're almost lifelike
I<00:01:13.490> think<00:01:14.060> 2k14<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.229> best<00:01:15.500> feature<00:01:15.830> is<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:16.159> fact

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
I think 2k14 is best feature is the fact

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.490 
I think 2k14 is best feature is the fact
that<00:01:16.549> you<00:01:16.729> can<00:01:16.909> play<00:01:17.149> all<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:17.899> WrestleMania
