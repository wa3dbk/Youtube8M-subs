00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.300 

this<00:00:20.870> engine<00:00:21.290> you<00:00:21.470> know<00:00:21.620> specifically<00:00:22.160> for

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
this engine you know specifically for

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.700 
this engine you know specifically for
powerful<00:00:22.640> three<00:00:22.850> originally<00:00:23.779> and<00:00:24.020> then<00:00:24.529> you

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
powerful three originally and then you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.290 
powerful three originally and then you
know<00:00:24.830> we<00:00:24.950> came<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.250> conclusion<00:00:25.430> of<00:00:25.820> other

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
know we came to conclusion of other

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.000 
know we came to conclusion of other
people<00:00:26.600> actually<00:00:26.660> have<00:00:26.930> used<00:00:27.170> for<00:00:27.380> this<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:27.770> I

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
people actually have used for this and I

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.470 
people actually have used for this and I
think<00:00:28.220> it's<00:00:28.340> pretty<00:00:28.640> amazing<00:00:28.820> that<00:00:29.060> you<00:00:29.450> know

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
think it's pretty amazing that you know

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.510 
think it's pretty amazing that you know
you<00:00:29.570> guys<00:00:29.869> are<00:00:30.290> making<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.590> racing<00:00:30.890> game<00:00:30.920> of<00:00:31.220> our

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
you guys are making a racing game of our

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.299 
you guys are making a racing game of our
engine<00:00:31.940> it<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:32.750> definitely<00:00:33.379> because<00:00:33.650> you<00:00:34.220> know

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
engine it is definitely because you know

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.490 
engine it is definitely because you know
without<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.610> engine<00:00:35.030> we<00:00:35.330> we<00:00:36.110> wouldn't<00:00:36.350> have

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
without the engine we we wouldn't have

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.770 
without the engine we we wouldn't have
been<00:00:36.590> able<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.860> deliver<00:00:37.129> our<00:00:37.460> concept<00:00:37.910> using

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
been able to deliver our concept using

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.299 
been able to deliver our concept using
the<00:00:38.870> key<00:00:39.140> technologies<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.070> engine

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
the key technologies to the engine

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.210 
the key technologies to the engine
provides<00:00:44.020> powerful<00:00:45.020> for<00:00:45.350> it<00:00:45.410> is<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.920> true

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
provides powerful for it is the true

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.430 
provides powerful for it is the true
successful<00:00:46.760> bathroom<00:00:47.150> too<00:00:47.390> we<00:00:47.839> need<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.140> make

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
successful bathroom too we need to make

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.200 
successful bathroom too we need to make
everything<00:00:48.710> bigger<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.430> better<00:00:49.550> basically

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
everything bigger and better basically

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.509 
everything bigger and better basically
so<00:00:50.360> we<00:00:50.480> need<00:00:50.659> to<00:00:50.809> develop<00:00:51.050> new<00:00:51.230> technology<00:00:52.010> for

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
so we need to develop new technology for

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.860 
so we need to develop new technology for
doing<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.180> one<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.330> those<00:00:53.479> things<00:00:53.690> is

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
doing that so one of those things is

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.049 
doing that so one of those things is
streaming<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.979> contents<00:00:55.489> into<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.820> maps

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
streaming the contents into the maps

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.000 
streaming the contents into the maps
with<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.780> we<00:00:56.930> can<00:00:57.110> build<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.440> biggest<00:00:57.739> part

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
with that we can build the biggest part

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.399 
with that we can build the biggest part
where<00:00:58.129> we<00:00:58.339> ever<00:00:58.489> done<00:00:58.850> before<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.720> I<00:01:00.199> think

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
where we ever done before and I think

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.420 
where we ever done before and I think
that<00:01:00.530> that's<00:01:00.680> something<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:01.040> you<00:01:01.159> also

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
that that's something that you also

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.610 
that that's something that you also
benefit<00:01:02.150> from<00:01:02.360> right<00:01:02.750> definitely<00:01:03.409> we<00:01:03.589> need

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
benefit from right definitely we need

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.410 
benefit from right definitely we need
for<00:01:03.920> speed<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.670> concept<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:05.059> we<00:01:05.180> went<00:01:05.360> with

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
for speed the concept that we went with

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.420 
for speed the concept that we went with
the<00:01:05.659> coast-to-coast<00:01:05.930> race<00:01:06.409> really<00:01:07.100> couldn't

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
the coast-to-coast race really couldn't

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.070 
the coast-to-coast race really couldn't
been<00:01:07.549> built<00:01:07.760> without<00:01:08.030> scale<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.750> order<00:01:08.900> to

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
been built without scale in order to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.690 
been built without scale in order to
pull<00:01:09.290> off<00:01:09.440> what<00:01:09.680> we<00:01:09.799> need<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.070> do<00:01:10.220> we<00:01:10.430> basically

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
pull off what we need to do we basically

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.340 
pull off what we need to do we basically
doubled<00:01:11.120> the<00:01:11.240> length<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.540> our<00:01:11.630> tracks<00:01:11.930> we

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
doubled the length of our tracks we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.380 
doubled the length of our tracks we
quadrupled<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:13.400> number<00:01:13.520> of<00:01:13.640> textures<00:01:14.060> you

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
quadrupled the number of textures you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.060 
quadrupled the number of textures you
know<00:01:14.510> four<00:01:14.840> times<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.170> number<00:01:15.260> of<00:01:15.440> objects<00:01:15.799> so

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
know four times the number of objects so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.399 
know four times the number of objects so
the<00:01:16.610> scale<00:01:16.909> for<00:01:17.150> us<00:01:17.210> just<00:01:17.659> wasn't<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.049> team<00:01:18.229> boil

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
the scale for us just wasn't a team boil

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.289 
the scale for us just wasn't a team boil
on<00:01:18.530> our<00:01:18.619> old<00:01:18.740> edge

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
on our old edge

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:20.849 
on our old edge
and<00:01:19.420> it's<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.020> terrain<00:01:20.289> system<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.799> you

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
and it's the terrain system that you

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.560 
and it's the terrain system that you
guys<00:01:21.009> developed<00:01:21.219> obviously<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:21.909> allows<00:01:22.149> us<00:01:22.179> to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
guys developed obviously it allows us to

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.999 
guys developed obviously it allows us to
basically<00:01:22.689> have<00:01:23.049> our<00:01:23.170> vistas<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.679> we<00:01:23.829> have

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
basically have our vistas that we have

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.469 
basically have our vistas that we have
you<00:01:24.549> know<00:01:24.670> when<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:24.939> drive<00:01:25.119> down<00:01:25.179> the

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
you know when you drive down the

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.999 
you know when you drive down the
highways<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:25.780> can<00:01:26.049> see<00:01:26.200> for<00:01:26.409> miles<00:01:26.590> over<00:01:26.979> the

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
highways you can see for miles over the

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.440 
highways you can see for miles over the
desert<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.579> secret<00:01:27.880> miles<00:01:28.060> out<00:01:28.270> their

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
desert the secret miles out their

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.510 
desert the secret miles out their
mountains<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.530> really<00:01:29.740> sells<00:01:30.009> that<00:01:30.189> sense<00:01:30.429> of

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
mountains it really sells that sense of

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.899 
mountains it really sells that sense of
journey<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:35.229> disruption<00:01:35.799> enables<00:01:36.310> us<00:01:36.490> now<00:01:36.850> to

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
journey the disruption enables us now to

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.359 
journey the disruption enables us now to
do<00:01:37.179> think<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:37.659> no<00:01:38.289> one<00:01:38.409> else<00:01:38.649> is<00:01:38.829> able<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.189> do

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
do think that no one else is able to do

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.850 
do think that no one else is able to do
really<00:01:39.700> like<00:01:39.909> just<00:01:40.450> seeing<00:01:40.840> other<00:01:41.020> plays<00:01:41.409> from

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
really like just seeing other plays from

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.260 
really like just seeing other plays from
other<00:01:42.039> playing<00:01:42.369> of<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.610> shooters<00:01:42.969> coming

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
other playing of the shooters coming

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.059 
other playing of the shooters coming
into<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.569> bell<00:01:43.689> field<00:01:43.990> where<00:01:44.500> you<00:01:44.799> know<00:01:44.950> why

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
into the bell field where you know why

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:46.889 
into the bell field where you know why
not<00:01:45.219> play<00:01:45.459> back<00:01:45.729> then<00:01:45.969> now<00:01:46.119> it's<00:01:46.360> natural<00:01:46.869> for

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
not play back then now it's natural for

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.169 
not play back then now it's natural for
me<00:01:47.079> to<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:47.380> go<00:01:47.530> through<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.130> wall<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.909> if<00:01:49.060> I

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
me to just go through the wall so if I

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.240 
me to just go through the wall so if I
driving<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.689> tank<00:01:49.959> and<00:01:50.319> someone<00:01:50.709> hiding<00:01:50.979> behind

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
driving a tank and someone hiding behind

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.010 
driving a tank and someone hiding behind
the<00:01:51.520> wall<00:01:51.640> there's<00:01:51.759> life<00:01:52.209> or<00:01:52.420> somewhere<00:01:52.720> far

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
the wall there's life or somewhere far

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.839 
the wall there's life or somewhere far
away<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:53.500> just<00:01:54.039> take<00:01:54.220> out<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.520> whole<00:01:54.640> building

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
away I just take out the whole building

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
really has allowed us to set the bar a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.420 
really has allowed us to set the bar a
little<00:02:38.440> bit<00:02:38.620> higher<00:02:38.799> as<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.160> racing<00:02:39.609> game

we're out the hole rendering engine from

we're out the hole rendering engine from
scratch<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:46.849> enables<00:02:47.420> us<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.629> have<00:02:48.010> more

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
scratch and that enables us to have more

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.800 
scratch and that enables us to have more
light<00:02:49.220> sources<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.849> make<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.120> more<00:02:50.329> cinematic

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
light sources to make it more cinematic

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.809 
light sources to make it more cinematic
we<00:02:51.140> can<00:02:51.319> do<00:02:51.890> both<00:02:52.069> indoor<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:52.610> outdoor

we can do both indoor and outdoor
lighting<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.019> see<00:02:54.319> actually<00:02:54.739> real

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
lighting so you see actually real

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.309

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
shadows going around the game and just

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.289 
shadows going around the game and just
with<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.129> destruction<00:02:58.730> we<00:02:58.819> have<00:02:59.000> all<00:02:59.180> these

to<00:03:25.129> some<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.519> smaller<00:03:25.819> pieces<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.750> I

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
to some of the smaller pieces and I

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.149 
to some of the smaller pieces and I
think<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.079> players<00:03:27.319> will<00:03:27.470> pick<00:03:27.650> up<00:03:27.769> on<00:03:27.980> which

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
think the players will pick up on which

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.099 
think the players will pick up on which
is<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.819> know<00:03:28.909> the<00:03:29.120> tire<00:03:29.299> spray<00:03:29.659> going<00:03:29.930> through

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
is you know the tire spray going through

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.050 
is you know the tire spray going through
a<00:03:30.200> thunderstorm<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:31.189> the<00:03:31.430> plains<00:03:31.700> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
a thunderstorm and the plains and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.479 
a thunderstorm and the plains and
picking<00:03:32.329> up<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:32.540> lighting<00:03:32.750> off<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.489> Chicago

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
picking up the lighting off that Chicago

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.429 
picking up the lighting off that Chicago
there's<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:35.329> know<00:03:35.359> blasting<00:03:35.900> pillars<00:03:36.230> and

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
there's you know blasting pillars and

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.559 
there's you know blasting pillars and
dust<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.310> picking<00:03:37.849> up<00:03:37.939> the<00:03:38.060> lights<00:03:38.299> of

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
dust and and picking up the lights of

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.089 
dust and and picking up the lights of

of the key elements for immersion is

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.960 
of the key elements for immersion is
obviously<00:04:01.770> sound<00:04:04.550> everything<00:04:05.550> has<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.820> be

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
obviously sound everything has to be

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.030 
obviously sound everything has to be
done<00:04:06.510> dynamically<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.590> that's<00:04:07.860> what<00:04:08.010> our

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
done dynamically and that's what our

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.580 
done dynamically and that's what our
engine<00:04:08.520> actually<00:04:08.670> does<00:04:09.030> with<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.450> audio<00:04:09.750> so

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
engine actually does with the audio so

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.740 
engine actually does with the audio so
you<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.800> actually<00:04:11.190> distinguish<00:04:11.820> what<00:04:12.390> gonna

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
you can actually distinguish what gonna

you can actually distinguish what gonna
the<00:04:13.080> sound<00:04:13.500> comes<00:04:13.740> from<00:04:13.830> what<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.400> does<00:04:14.670> what

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
the sound comes from what this does what

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.940 
the sound comes from what this does what
direction<00:04:15.240> is<00:04:15.570> coming<00:04:15.900> from<00:04:18.739> building<00:04:19.739> from

the bigger beats of the the journey you

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.270 
the bigger beats of the the journey you

what<00:04:33.800> it's<00:04:33.949> allowed<00:04:34.129> us<00:04:34.189> to<00:04:34.339> do<00:04:34.550> is<00:04:34.699> basically

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:34.999 
what it's allowed us to do is basically

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:36.999 
what it's allowed us to do is basically
build<00:04:35.330> more<00:04:35.629> and<00:04:35.659> more<00:04:35.809> layers<00:04:36.199> of<00:04:36.379> sounded

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
build more and more layers of sounded

the<00:04:42.529> distance<00:04:42.709> that<00:04:43.099> it<00:04:43.219> feels<00:04:43.459> the<00:04:43.610> writing

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
the distance that it feels the writing

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.639 
the distance that it feels the writing
it<00:04:43.879> feels<00:04:44.089> balanced<00:04:44.539> ting<00:04:44.749> and<00:04:45.199> you<00:04:45.319> get<00:04:45.499> the

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:45.649 
it feels balanced ting and you get the

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:46.929 
it feels balanced ting and you get the
perception<00:04:46.009> and<00:04:46.369> that<00:04:46.429> everything<00:04:46.849> is

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:46.939 
perception and that everything is

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:57.890 
perception and that everything is
working<00:04:47.240> as<00:04:47.509> a<00:04:47.929> package

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.390 

this<00:04:58.900> porch<00:04:59.200> game<00:04:59.440> actually<00:04:59.650> looks<00:05:00.070> looking

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
this porch game actually looks looking

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.880 
this porch game actually looks looking
at<00:05:00.490> FIFA<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.270> Madden<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:02.350> what<00:05:02.470> they've<00:05:02.680> done

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
at FIFA and Madden and what they've done

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.050 
at FIFA and Madden and what they've done
but<00:05:03.040> it<00:05:03.190> players<00:05:03.430> when<00:05:03.790> they're<00:05:03.940> running

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
but it players when they're running

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.490 
but it players when they're running
around<00:05:04.330> you<00:05:04.660> know<00:05:04.750> keeping<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.140> ball<00:05:05.320> it

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
around you know keeping the ball it

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.870 
around you know keeping the ball it
looks<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:06.010> realistic

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
looks so realistic

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.360 
looks so realistic
and<00:05:07.120> imagine<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:07.990> we<00:05:08.140> took<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.800> animation

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
and imagine that we took that animation

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.130 
and imagine that we took that animation
system<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:10.030> brought<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.450> into<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:10.870> shooter

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
system and brought that into a shooter

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.960 
system and brought that into a shooter
game<00:05:11.200> so<00:05:11.770> when<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.130> soldiers<00:05:12.610> are<00:05:12.700> running

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
game so when the soldiers are running

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.130 
game so when the soldiers are running
around<00:05:13.090> gunning<00:05:13.720> each<00:05:13.810> other

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
around gunning each other

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.800 
around gunning each other
it<00:05:14.620> looks<00:05:14.920> so<00:05:15.160> fluid<00:05:15.640> so<00:05:15.970> realistic<00:05:16.510> and<00:05:16.660> then

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
it looks so fluid so realistic and then

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.720 
it looks so fluid so realistic and then
for<00:05:17.050> us<00:05:17.170> you<00:05:17.470> know<00:05:17.560> we<00:05:17.710> start<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.220> game<00:05:18.250> it's<00:05:18.670> a

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
for us you know we start the game it's a

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.910 
for us you know we start the game it's a
very<00:05:18.940> tense<00:05:19.350> cinematic<00:05:20.350> moment<00:05:20.770> and

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
very tense cinematic moment and

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.130 
very tense cinematic moment and
frostbite<00:05:21.490> basically<00:05:22.060> has<00:05:22.540> allowed<00:05:22.870> us<00:05:22.930> to

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
frostbite basically has allowed us to

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.170 
frostbite basically has allowed us to
create<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:23.830> very<00:05:24.070> human<00:05:24.460> aspect<00:05:24.880> which<00:05:25.030> was

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
create that very human aspect which was

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.430 
create that very human aspect which was
going<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.390> our<00:05:25.510> key<00:05:25.660> tenants<00:05:26.050> from<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.230> game

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
going to our key tenants from the game

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.080 
going to our key tenants from the game
and<00:05:26.710> really<00:05:26.980> bring<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.190> emotion<00:05:27.610> out<00:05:27.700> in<00:05:27.850> Jack

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
and really bring the emotion out in Jack

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.900 
and really bring the emotion out in Jack
as<00:05:28.330> he<00:05:28.780> opens<00:05:29.350> the<00:05:29.500> game<00:05:29.650> up<00:05:29.890> and<00:05:30.100> beyond<00:05:30.700> that

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
as he opens the game up and beyond that

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.730 
as he opens the game up and beyond that
I<00:05:31.150> mean<00:05:31.210> as<00:05:31.570> we've<00:05:32.020> described<00:05:32.380> some<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.620> the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
I mean as we've described some of the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.470 
I mean as we've described some of the
moments<00:05:32.920> to<00:05:33.160> go<00:05:33.310> through<00:05:33.550> over<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:34.000> course<00:05:34.030> a

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
moments to go through over the course a

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480 
moments to go through over the course a
lot<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:34.900> them<00:05:35.140> are<00:05:35.260> very<00:05:35.410> animated<00:05:35.770> moments<00:05:36.340> in

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
lot of them are very animated moments in

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.400 
lot of them are very animated moments in
so<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.910> animation<00:05:37.420> engine<00:05:37.570> of<00:05:37.840> frostbite<00:05:38.290> is

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
so the animation engine of frostbite is

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.290 
so the animation engine of frostbite is
it<00:05:38.530> allowed<00:05:38.770> us<00:05:38.800> to<00:05:39.010> pull<00:05:39.370> off<00:05:39.520> some<00:05:39.790> of<00:05:39.820> these

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
it allowed us to pull off some of these

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.390 
it allowed us to pull off some of these
moments<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:40.960> these<00:05:41.110> these<00:05:41.530> epic<00:05:41.890> beats<00:05:42.130> and

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
moments and these these epic beats and

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.740 
moments and these these epic beats and
the<00:05:42.490> part<00:05:42.790> of<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:42.910> journey<00:05:43.090> that<00:05:43.360> that<00:05:43.630> we

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
the part of the journey that that we

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.370 
the part of the journey that that we
wouldn't<00:05:43.960> have<00:05:44.080> been<00:05:44.200> otherwise<00:05:44.560> able<00:05:44.890> to<00:05:44.980> are

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.810 

that<00:05:50.380> we've<00:05:50.560> made<00:05:50.920> this<00:05:51.100> end<00:05:51.340> you<00:05:51.430> know<00:05:51.610> then

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
that we've made this end you know then

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.670 
that we've made this end you know then
be<00:05:52.060> able<00:05:52.120> to<00:05:52.270> share<00:05:52.360> it<00:05:52.840> so<00:05:53.110> with<00:05:53.260> other<00:05:53.380> teams

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
be able to share it so with other teams

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.950 
be able to share it so with other teams
and<00:05:53.950> just<00:05:53.980> like<00:05:54.370> focus<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.510> actually<00:05:55.780> making

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
and just like focus and actually making

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.020 
and just like focus and actually making
the<00:05:56.170> game<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.650> not<00:05:56.920> the<00:05:56.980> technology<00:05:57.340> just

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
the game and not the technology just

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.000 
the game and not the technology just
that<00:05:58.180> we<00:05:58.420> actually<00:05:58.570> got<00:05:58.840> stuff<00:05:59.410> back<00:05:59.650> from<00:05:59.860> you

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
that we actually got stuff back from you

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.730 
that we actually got stuff back from you
guys<00:06:00.190> we<00:06:00.670> have<00:06:00.970> roads<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.600> they<00:06:01.870> built<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.290> tool

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
guys we have roads and they built a tool

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.860 
guys we have roads and they built a tool
for<00:06:03.070> building<00:06:03.640> roads<00:06:03.790> or<00:06:04.420> actually<00:06:04.690> could

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
for building roads or actually could

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.660 
for building roads or actually could
bring<00:06:05.110> that<00:06:05.260> tool<00:06:05.500> back<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.830> BALCO<00:06:06.040> so<00:06:06.370> we<00:06:06.460> can

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
bring that tool back to BALCO so we can

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.490 
bring that tool back to BALCO so we can
feel<00:06:06.880> roads<00:06:07.420> faster<00:06:09.570> and<00:06:10.570> then<00:06:10.780> for<00:06:10.990> us<00:06:11.110> we

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
feel roads faster and then for us we

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.870 
feel roads faster and then for us we
knew<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:11.830> game<00:06:11.950> we<00:06:12.130> wanted<00:06:12.340> to<00:06:12.460> make<00:06:12.640> we

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
knew the game we wanted to make we

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
knew the game we wanted to make we
looked<00:06:13.060> at<00:06:13.180> a<00:06:13.210> number<00:06:13.330> of<00:06:13.450> different<00:06:13.780> options

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
looked at a number of different options

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.230 
looked at a number of different options
and<00:06:14.380> frost<00:06:15.100> went<00:06:15.310> to<00:06:15.490> was<00:06:15.730> the<00:06:15.760> one<00:06:16.030> that

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
and frost went to was the one that

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.090 
and frost went to was the one that
allowed<00:06:16.510> us<00:06:16.540> to<00:06:16.750> develop<00:06:17.200> the<00:06:17.500> concept<00:06:17.920> and

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
allowed us to develop the concept and

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.410 
allowed us to develop the concept and
build<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.610> game<00:06:18.760> that<00:06:19.030> we

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
build the game that we

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.360 
build the game that we
you<00:06:20.020> know<00:06:20.170> what<00:06:20.560> we've<00:06:20.710> delivered<00:06:20.950> this<00:06:21.190> year

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
you know what we've delivered this year

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.460 
you know what we've delivered this year
we're<00:06:21.490> very<00:06:21.670> proud<00:06:21.880> of<00:06:22.090> what<00:06:22.900> we<00:06:23.050> see<00:06:23.260> even

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
we're very proud of what we see even

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.810 
we're very proud of what we see even
greater<00:06:23.710> things<00:06:24.010> in<00:06:24.130> the<00:06:24.220> future<00:06:24.370> you<00:06:24.700> know

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
greater things in the future you know

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.640 
greater things in the future you know
that<00:06:25.270> the<00:06:25.510> run<00:06:25.690> is<00:06:25.840> just<00:06:25.870> the<00:06:26.170> start<00:06:26.440> of<00:06:26.500> what

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
that the run is just the start of what

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.850 
that the run is just the start of what
we<00:06:26.770> think<00:06:26.890> we<00:06:27.010> can<00:06:27.190> do<00:06:27.280> is<00:06:27.430> frostbite
