of<00:00:26.300> base<00:00:26.480> coats<00:00:26.779> is<00:00:26.980> particularly<00:00:27.980> this<00:00:28.189> one

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
of base coats is particularly this one

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.190 
of base coats is particularly this one
it<00:00:28.700> prevents<00:00:29.149> my<00:00:29.239> nails<00:00:29.419> from<00:00:29.599> breaking<00:00:30.020> it

it prevents my nails from breaking it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.630 
it prevents my nails from breaking it
strengthens<00:00:30.649> them<00:00:30.860> and<00:00:31.009> it<00:00:31.099> also<00:00:31.219> prevents

strengthens them and it also prevents
them<00:00:31.790> from<00:00:31.820> yellowing<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:32.509> it's<00:00:32.660> pretty<00:00:32.750> much

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
them from yellowing so it's pretty much

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.959 
them from yellowing so it's pretty much
like<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.140> triple<00:00:33.440> whammy<00:00:33.680> there's<00:00:34.399> no<00:00:34.640> reason

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
like a triple whammy there's no reason

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.270
