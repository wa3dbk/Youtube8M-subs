00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 the people imagine that dream is not the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.230
 Bakery dream is to put a liter of 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.320
 water said one liter of water in the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.179
 car and roll 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.210
 one thousand kilometers 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.270
 that same ingrid put water in 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.800
 in fact it is the hydrogen of water that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.859
 do this miracle 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.650
 the car moved to superpower spending it 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.310
 up to rocket is an experiment that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.800
 Let's meet now looking fast. 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.260
 It looks like a car like any other. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.100
 nothing more is not even then an axis 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.160
 tank 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 Wait, this is water since the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.290
 Water makes the car walk walk walk like this 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.700
 only with hydrogen we ran in the band 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 of a thousand kilometers 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 're only a half liters of water not 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.520
 The water is over but that's what we 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.340
 placed 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.800
 It's this year, but what makes the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.260
 engine is not the water but rather the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.180
 hydrogen that is in it is that it 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.460
 installed a mechanism on the vehicle that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 releasing gas in the water system 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.869
 seemingly simple with a 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.060
 reservoir for 1 liter and 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.850
 motorzinho there and some hoses 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.040
 water flows from the reservoir to the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.619
 generator goes through generator where generator 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.530
 does the hydrolysis it breaks the particles 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.080
 right of h2o and trans or split and the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.240
 hydrogen comes in this way that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.520
 get in the car where the car does 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.640
 and it is not that the car is really 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.189
 has no change in speed and until the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.740
 engine is quieter the idea of 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.530
 Roberto is saving on gasoline and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.320
 to help the environment and the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.229
 of this mechanism is what comes out 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.520
 here in the unloading of the vehicle as people 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.220
 can you see the car's look is being 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.000
 accelerated and what falls here in my hand 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.640
 it's just water with no pollutants 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.040
 There you should see everything. 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.500
 wary wondering if your car 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.140
 will not ruin your henrique who is from 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.180
 automotive sector ensures that it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.070
 no injury even because the engine of the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 vehicle it works with combustion 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.209
 internal work with the yo-yo 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.190
 can work with gnv to work 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.130
 with gas 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.390
 with alcohol or flex system and can 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.700
 quietly work with any 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.920
 type of gas which also does not bring injury 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.260
 nature and hydrogen is an excellent 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.350
 fuel to move the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.920
 low cost the roberto spent only 400 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.020
 real 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.600
 but you have to be careful when it comes to 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.780
 install the mechanism since hydrogen 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.970
 is a very potent gas opposed this idea 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.150
 is that it takes the rockets through the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.070
 hamas storage care production 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
 what you should really have can not be 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.150
 by amateur have to be a professional 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.250
 to be there and he is a very 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.320
 efficient for us to finish vain 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.910
 make a test then practice that gives a 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.910
 spin the vehicle but we 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.300
 the agent of the real future now contact 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.680
 a liter of gasoline more or less in 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.440
 average on 3 29 3 39 3 49 and put in water 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.750
 then it goes to 5 reais a liter of 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.180
 Water 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.770
 Roberto explained that the conversion to 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.520
 hydrogen can be made with all 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.650
 study caution but the law does not allow 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.920
 be done commercially 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.350
 so for us simple mortals continues 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.160
 Being a dream, I do not want to be simple. 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.160
 deadly but not
