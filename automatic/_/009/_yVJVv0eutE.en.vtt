you just here this is where the optical
bays<00:03:52.609> are<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:53.510> can<00:03:53.630> actually<00:03:53.750> remove

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
bays are and you can actually remove

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.199 
bays are and you can actually remove
this<00:03:54.530> black<00:03:54.950> cover<00:03:55.250> this<00:03:55.640> keeps<00:03:55.940> everything

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
this black cover this keeps everything

this black cover this keeps everything
nice<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.890> sort<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:58.010> neat<00:03:58.250> inside<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:58.970> we<00:03:59.060> can

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
nice and sort of neat inside so we can

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.930 
nice and sort of neat inside so we can
remove<00:03:59.450> that<00:03:59.510> nice<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.500> easily<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.010> then<00:04:01.910> you

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
remove that nice and easily and then you

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.420 
remove that nice and easily and then you
