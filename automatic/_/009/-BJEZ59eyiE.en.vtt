00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
often a lot of people ask what's the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.320 
often a lot of people ask what's the
best<00:00:09.509> area<00:00:09.959> to<00:00:10.200> find<00:00:10.410> squid<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:10.919> and<00:00:11.129> yes<00:00:12.030> you

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
best area to find squid in and yes you

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.270 
best area to find squid in and yes you
do<00:00:12.509> need<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.809> find<00:00:13.049> wedi<00:00:13.440> bottoms<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.070> that's

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
do need to find wedi bottoms but that's

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.160 
do need to find wedi bottoms but that's
just<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:14.639> part<00:00:14.669> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> answer<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.959> need<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
just one part of the answer you need to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.019 
just one part of the answer you need to
find<00:00:16.439> where<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> weed<00:00:16.980> actually<00:00:17.580> meets<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
find where the weed actually meets the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.849 
find where the weed actually meets the
sand<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> bottom<00:00:19.019> because<00:00:19.380> that's<00:00:19.679> where

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
sand on the bottom because that's where

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.109 
sand on the bottom because that's where
the<00:00:19.980> squid<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.369> living<00:00:20.640> they're<00:00:20.789> actually

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the squid are living they're actually

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.300 
the squid are living they're actually
swimming<00:00:21.390> from<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.929> weed<00:00:22.109> out<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> Santa

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
swimming from the weed out to the Santa

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.370 
swimming from the weed out to the Santa
feed<00:00:23.550> then<00:00:23.939> back<00:00:24.210> into<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> weed<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.929> hide<00:00:25.109> so

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
feed then back into the weed to hide so

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.169 
feed then back into the weed to hide so
it's<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.769> important<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.910> find

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
it's really important that you find

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.999 
it's really important that you find
those<00:00:27.390> edges<00:00:27.929> and<00:00:28.080> work<00:00:28.560> them<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:28.890> your

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
those edges and work them with your

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.859 
those edges and work them with your
loads<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:29.910> today<00:00:30.150> we're<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.570> using

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
loads now today we're going to be using

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.750 
loads now today we're going to be using
a<00:00:30.929> selection<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.470> new<00:00:31.679> Accardo<00:00:32.280> jigs<00:00:32.550> from

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
a selection of new Accardo jigs from

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.260 
a selection of new Accardo jigs from
Rapala

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
Rapala

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.020 
Rapala
which<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.990> great<00:00:34.050> new<00:00:34.980> weight<00:00:35.550> system

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
which have a great new weight system

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.820 
which have a great new weight system
where<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.630> actually<00:00:36.810> change<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> weight

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
where you can actually change the weight

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.430 
where you can actually change the weight
of<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.400> head<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:38.820> per<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.900> conditions<00:00:40.320> you're

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
of the head as per the conditions you're

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.660 
of the head as per the conditions you're
fishing<00:00:40.740> so<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:40.980> we're<00:00:41.130> fishing<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.580> shallow

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
fishing so if we're fishing in shallow

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.940 
fishing so if we're fishing in shallow
water<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.660> use<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> lighter<00:00:43.080> weight<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.740> we're

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
water we use a lighter weight if we're

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.040 
water we use a lighter weight if we're
fishing<00:00:44.430> deeper<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:45.150> use<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> heavier<00:00:45.870> weight

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
fishing deeper we use a heavier weight

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
fishing deeper we use a heavier weight
so<00:00:46.680> I'll<00:00:46.740> just<00:00:46.920> run<00:00:47.070> through<00:00:47.130> quickly<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:47.790> we

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
so I'll just run through quickly how we

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.550 
so I'll just run through quickly how we
put<00:00:48.120> them<00:00:48.240> on<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> how<00:00:48.810> they<00:00:48.960> work<00:00:49.230> so

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
put them on and how they work so

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.280 
put them on and how they work so
basically<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.880> get<00:00:51.000> your<00:00:51.150> way<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:51.960> because

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
basically you get your way now because

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.080 
basically you get your way now because
there's<00:00:52.500> not<00:00:52.620> much<00:00:52.800> wind<00:00:53.100> today<00:00:53.310> we're<00:00:53.970> going

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
there's not much wind today we're going

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.250 
there's not much wind today we're going
to<00:00:54.150> be<00:00:54.240> working<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:54.630> eggs<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> little

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to be working these eggs with a little

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
to be working these eggs with a little
bit<00:00:55.350> lighter<00:00:55.770> weight<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:56.970> slide<00:00:57.240> it<00:00:57.360> on

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
bit lighter weight so we slide it on

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.600 
bit lighter weight so we slide it on
like<00:00:58.110> so<00:00:58.850> we<00:00:59.850> get<00:00:59.970> our<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.240> clip<00:01:01.490> and<00:01:02.490> we

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
like so we get our little clip and we

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.599 
like so we get our little clip and we
put<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:02.970> like<00:01:03.720> that<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:07.399> click<00:01:08.399> it<00:01:08.520> on

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:08.609 
put that on like that and click it on

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:10.490 
put that on like that and click it on
like<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:09.899> will<00:01:10.109> happen<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.469> that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
like that now what will happen is that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.319 
like that now what will happen is that
jig<00:01:10.829> will<00:01:10.979> actually<00:01:11.280> allow<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.090> swim

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
jig will actually allow it to swim

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.389 
jig will actually allow it to swim
freely<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.869> won't<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.200> weighted<00:01:13.619> down<00:01:13.829> like

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
freely it won't be weighted down like

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.099 
freely it won't be weighted down like
some<00:01:14.640> other<00:01:14.789> laws<00:01:14.939> where<00:01:15.179> the<00:01:15.299> actual<00:01:15.899> weight

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
some other laws where the actual weight

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.469 
some other laws where the actual weight
is<00:01:16.289> attached<00:01:16.679> to<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.249> law<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.270> swim

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
is attached to the law so that can swim

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.929 
is attached to the law so that can swim
along<00:01:18.749> happy<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.259> Larry<00:01:19.499> and<00:01:19.789> hopefully<00:01:20.789> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
along happy is Larry and hopefully a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.060 
along happy is Larry and hopefully a
Swede<00:01:21.240> will<00:01:21.420> come<00:01:21.539> and<00:01:21.689> nail<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.020> now<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
Swede will come and nail it now the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.560 
Swede will come and nail it now the
squid<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.520> actually<00:01:23.880> hit<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> way

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
squid will actually hit it on the way

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.319 
squid will actually hit it on the way
back<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.649> what<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.149> after

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
back down so what we want to do is after

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.450 
back down so what we want to do is after
we<00:01:27.570> give<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.749> a<00:01:27.810> flick<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.770> wait<00:01:29.039> there

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
we give it a flick just wait there

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.849 
we give it a flick just wait there
let<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> line<00:01:30.060> sink<00:01:30.390> pay<00:01:31.200> attention<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
let the line sink pay attention to the

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:43.310 
let the line sink pay attention to the
rod<00:01:31.979> tip<00:01:32.189> from<00:01:32.429> wait<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.819> to<00:01:32.909> load<00:01:33.030> up

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.570 

we've<00:01:44.310> got<00:01:44.520> our<00:01:44.700> first<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.600> squid<00:01:45.930> here

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
we've got our first little squid here

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.950 
we've got our first little squid here
because<00:01:47.580> he's<00:01:47.730> just<00:01:48.000> caught<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.420> tentacle

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
because he's just caught on tentacle

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.770 
because he's just caught on tentacle
there<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:50.030> there<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.150> go<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.420> did<00:01:54.690> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
there and there you go so really did the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.720 
there and there you go so really did the
trick<00:01:54.810> now<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.620> can<00:01:55.830> see<00:01:55.980> there's<00:01:56.160> no<00:01:56.280> barbs

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
trick now you can see there's no barbs
