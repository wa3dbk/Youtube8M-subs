you<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.220> see<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.520> stream<00:00:19.520> this<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
you can see in the stream this is the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.720 
you can see in the stream this is the
server<00:00:20.970> part<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.410> application<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.490> can't

server part of the application I can't
show<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.090> because<00:00:24.570> I'm<00:00:24.689> not<00:00:24.810> remoted

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
into this one from my stream PC but I

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
into this one from my stream PC but I
could<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> client<00:00:28.560> side<00:00:28.849> the

could show you the client side the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
could show you the client side the
hardest<00:00:30.150> part<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.510> synergy<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.109> actually

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
hardest part with synergy is actually

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.440 
hardest part with synergy is actually
configuring<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.430> get<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.700> work<00:00:32.910> it's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
configuring it to get it to work it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.630 
configuring it to get it to work it's
pretty<00:00:33.899> confusing<00:00:34.219> if<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.399> ask<00:00:35.520> me<00:00:37.640> basically

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
pretty confusing if you ask me basically

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.639 
pretty confusing if you ask me basically
what<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.790> looks<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.809> I'll<00:00:40.410> switch

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
what it looks like here is I'll switch

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.030 
what it looks like here is I'll switch
to<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.430> mind<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.530> my

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to this one now mind you we are on my

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.610 
to this one now mind you we are on my
stream<00:00:44.370> PC<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> bunch<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.289> junk

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
stream PC which I have a bunch of junk

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
stream PC which I have a bunch of junk
open<00:00:47.239> but<00:00:48.739> while<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.890> running<00:00:50.570> you'll<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
open but while it's running you'll see a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.350 
open but while it's running you'll see a
little<00:00:51.930> icon<00:00:52.050> down<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:52.760> it<00:00:53.760> says<00:00:53.820> connected

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little icon down here it says connected

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
little icon down here it says connected
to<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.600> Davis<00:00:57.440> it's<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.190> full<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to see Davis it's just that it's full of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
to see Davis it's just that it's full of
all<00:00:59.640> basically<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.750> can't<00:01:01.230> even<00:01:01.320> show<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
all basically I can't even show you to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.579 
all basically I can't even show you to
configure<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.250> right<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:03.239> basically

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
configure it right now but basically

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.920 
configure it right now but basically
once<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.680> got<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> set<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.299> use<00:01:06.540> one

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
once you got to set up you can use one

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.620 
once you got to set up you can use one
keyboard<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.650> mouse<00:01:07.799> off<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:08.909> main<00:01:09.090> pc

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
keyboard and mouse off of your main pc

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.620 
keyboard and mouse off of your main pc
to<00:01:10.409> control<00:01:10.830> another<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.640> haven't<00:01:12.420> set<00:01:12.600> up

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to control another one I haven't set up

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.190 
to control another one I haven't set up
so<00:01:12.960> once<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.439> drag<00:01:15.439> once<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.590> drag<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:17.100> mouse<00:01:17.280> from

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
so once I drag once I drag my mouse from

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.490 
so once I drag once I drag my mouse from
the<00:01:19.200> right<00:01:19.439> monitor<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:22.229> keeps

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the right monitor here and it keeps

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.660 
the right monitor here and it keeps
going<00:01:22.680> over<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:25.049> second<00:01:25.439> computer

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
going over to the second computer

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.530 
going over to the second computer
and<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.299> also<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:29.180> just<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.330> show<00:01:30.509> you

and then also I have just to show you
real<00:01:30.840> quick<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.200> my<00:01:34.500> monitor

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
real quick the way I have my monitor

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.420 
real quick the way I have my monitor
setup<00:01:36.740> one<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:37.890> matter<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> wall<00:01:39.020> is

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
setup one that's matter on the wall is

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.279 
setup one that's matter on the wall is
monitor<00:01:41.430> number<00:01:41.670> two<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.630> dragging<00:01:43.200> around

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
monitor number two just dragging around

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.830 
monitor number two just dragging around
wherever<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.399> monitor<00:01:44.729> physically<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
wherever the monitor physically is and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.859 
wherever the monitor physically is and
since<00:01:46.289> it's<00:01:46.440> up<00:01:46.590> above<00:01:47.360> once<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.479> hit<00:01:48.600> apply

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
since it's up above once I hit apply

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.670 
since it's up above once I hit apply
once<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.979> drag<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.369> mouse<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.049> top<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.409> this

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
once I drag my mouse to the top of this

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.760 
once I drag my mouse to the top of this
screen<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.159> goes<00:01:53.340> directly<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.810> screen<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
screen it goes directly to the screen on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.410 
screen it goes directly to the screen on
the<00:01:55.860> wall<00:01:55.890> which<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.580> where<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.090> my<00:01:57.240> hot

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the wall which is where you see my hot

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:09.370 
the wall which is where you see my hot
air<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.759> that's<00:02:05.880> basically<00:02:07.489> synergy<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.519> kinda

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
air and that's basically synergy I kinda

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.720 
air and that's basically synergy I kinda
wish<00:02:10.380> I<00:02:10.590> facade<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.220> wish<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.459> could<00:02:11.580> show<00:02:11.700> you

wish I facade I wish I could show you
guys<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.560> server<00:02:13.830> part<00:02:14.160> about<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.610> because

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
guys the server part about it because

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.880 
guys the server part about it because
it's<00:02:16.350> pretty<00:02:16.650> tough<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.239> figure<00:02:18.239> out<00:02:18.890> but

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
it's pretty tough to figure out but

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.270 
it's pretty tough to figure out but
anyways<00:02:21.049> there<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.170> go<00:02:22.290> trice<00:02:22.650> energy<00:02:23.130> out

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
anyways there you go trice energy out

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.010 
anyways there you go trice energy out
it's<00:02:23.549> sy<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.660> II<00:02:25.010> rgy
