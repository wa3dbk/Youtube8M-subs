00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
combo and slightly tell them to switch

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.620 
combo and slightly tell them to switch
and<00:00:24.160> I'm<00:00:24.279> gonna<00:00:24.460> work<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:24.760> defense<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:25.570> the

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
and I'm gonna work the defense and the

and I'm gonna work the defense and the
counters<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.199> it<00:00:26.350> this<00:00:27.340> should<00:00:27.519> be<00:00:27.640> a<00:00:27.670> fairly

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
counters to it this should be a fairly

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.029 
counters to it this should be a fairly
slow<00:00:28.210> drill<00:00:28.689> especially<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.230> start<00:00:29.560> just<00:00:29.949> so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
slow drill especially to start just so

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.320 
slow drill especially to start just so
you<00:00:30.099> feel<00:00:30.189> comfortable<00:00:30.519> with<00:00:30.849> reading<00:00:31.300> the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
you feel comfortable with reading the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.540 
you feel comfortable with reading the
body<00:00:31.630> language<00:00:32.019> of<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.290> partner<00:00:32.739> so<00:00:33.370> you<00:00:33.460> have

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
body language of the partner so you have

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.640 
body language of the partner so you have
a<00:00:33.610> little<00:00:33.790> bit<00:00:33.879> of<00:00:33.970> time<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.330> think<00:00:34.530> once<00:00:35.530> you

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
a little bit of time to think once you

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.850 
a little bit of time to think once you
get<00:00:35.830> more<00:00:35.980> comfortable<00:00:36.040> with<00:00:36.610> some<00:00:36.880> specific

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
get more comfortable with some specific

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.920 
get more comfortable with some specific
defenses<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:39.100> counters<00:00:39.520> then<00:00:40.270> you<00:00:40.750> might

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
defenses and counters then you might

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.049 
defenses and counters then you might
pick<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.260> pace<00:00:41.440> up<00:00:41.469> a<00:00:41.680> little<00:00:41.860> bit<00:00:42.070> for<00:00:42.910> now

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
pick the pace up a little bit for now

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.360 
pick the pace up a little bit for now

I'm gonna tell Jessie just to throw some
jabs<00:00:45.550> at<00:00:45.850> me<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.059> demonstrate

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
jabs at me to demonstrate

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.500 
jabs at me to demonstrate
and<00:00:47.680> I'm<00:00:47.890> gonna<00:00:48.010> practice<00:00:48.760> some<00:00:49.000> different

and I'm gonna practice some different
defenses<00:00:50.110> and<00:00:50.829> some<00:00:51.100> counters<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.850> jab

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
defenses and some counters to the jab

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.360 
defenses and some counters to the jab
once<00:00:53.289> again<00:00:53.590> there<00:00:53.770> would<00:00:53.860> be<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:54.010> lot<00:00:54.219> more

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
once again there would be a lot more

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.369 
once again there would be a lot more
movement<00:00:54.820> than<00:00:54.850> what<00:00:55.090> you<00:00:55.210> see<00:00:55.420> here<00:00:55.449> we're

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
movement than what you see here we're

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.110 
movement than what you see here we're
just<00:00:56.530> trying<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.829> keep<00:00:56.980> everything<00:00:57.610> in<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
just trying to keep everything in the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.110 

plus<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:25.280> kind<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.730> drove<00:01:26.000> around

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
plus it's kind of the drove around

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.120 
plus it's kind of the drove around
practicing<00:01:26.780> some<00:01:27.020> defense<00:01:27.440> encounters<00:01:28.010> with

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
practicing some defense encounters with

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.490 
practicing some defense encounters with
the<00:01:28.220> jab<00:01:28.490> we<00:01:29.390> would<00:01:29.600> once<00:01:29.840> again<00:01:29.930> be<00:01:30.110> moving

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the jab we would once again be moving

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.030 
the jab we would once again be moving
around<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.830> lot<00:01:30.950> more<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.910> can<00:01:32.780> add<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.230> a<00:01:33.260> jab<00:01:33.590> you

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
around a lot more I can add to a jab you

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.320 
around a lot more I can add to a jab you
know<00:01:34.160> I<00:01:34.190> can<00:01:34.370> say<00:01:34.490> alright<00:01:34.700> let's<00:01:34.910> go<00:01:35.060> with<00:01:35.210> the
