being on mid corner and corner exits we

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.509 
being on mid corner and corner exits we
thought<00:00:10.200> we'd<00:00:10.380> work<00:00:10.590> on<00:00:10.769> one<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
thought we'd work on one of the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.580 
thought we'd work on one of the
important<00:00:12.330> things<00:00:12.509> which<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.900> breaking<00:00:13.410> into

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
a into a right-hander where we will

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
a into a right-hander where we will
focusing<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.250> rear<00:00:38.700> brake<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.390> front

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
right in the using the rear brake for a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.500 
right in the using the rear brake for a
lot<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> speed<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.850> well<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> front

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
lot of the speed as well as the front

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
lot of the speed as well as the front
but<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.840> carry<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> front<00:00:49.440> through<00:00:50.129> the

but we carry the front through the
through<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> first<00:00:51.120> stage<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.690> corner

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
through the first stage of the corner

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
through the first stage of the corner
just<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> keep<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> front<00:00:53.940> grounded<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:55.500> then

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
of maximum Mountain speed obviously the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
of maximum Mountain speed obviously the
front<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.689> still<00:01:12.869> important<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.710> much

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
front is still important but not as much

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.130 
front is still important but not as much
in<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.150> sketchy<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
in that because it's very sketchy the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.890 
in that because it's very sketchy the
grounds<00:01:16.590> hard<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.159> soft<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> be

grounds hard and soft and you want to be

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.109 
grounds hard and soft and you want to be
very<00:01:19.110> careful<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:20.520> using<00:01:20.670> too<00:01:20.909> much<00:01:21.060> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
very careful on not using too much of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.420 
very careful on not using too much of
the<00:01:21.330> front<00:01:21.509> brake<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.619> yeah<00:01:22.770> same<00:01:23.040> thing<00:01:23.070> we
