00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello everyone here is a little tutorial 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.929
 could please more than one 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 contrary to popular belief in this 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.389
 does not require any operation at the level 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.250
 of the motor 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.100
 you do not need to switch a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.310
 support as well as a radiator 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 it does not matter if you just 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.760
 remove the three bis if ben on the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.660
 side cheeks between the tank and 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:37.230
 the side covers did the operation 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.420
 on both sides afterwards we have access to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.120
 the part a little more interesting years 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.829
 girls is concerned at least to access 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.510
 candles we come to the left 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.940
 once we said on the bike side 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.620
 left so in order to be able to remove the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.620
 famous dust cover that prevents us 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.359
 to access his pencils who themselves 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.439
 give access where I have the cache 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.119
 dust to 11 in bed so what is 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.950
 servette slide up or 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.710
 could leverage on you that black 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:17.670
 for lovely place with a pretty screwdriver 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:22.619
 long and slow we go out and if we have 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 Finally, the view of the pencils that 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.900
 will just come unlock in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.900
 levering 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.310
 do not hesitate to go there gently 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.869
 to take out the pencil there a base one 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.479
 rubber so lets you have a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.770
 quite enough game to get a 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.470
 times out we have direct access to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.810
 candles we recover the famous trilogy 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.869
 from kawasaki so this one is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.720
 articulated so for introducing 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.410
 easily must she is absolutely 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.679
 necessary for the installation and removal of 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.679
 candles 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.069
 so we produced the key once in 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.110
 place we see it far exceeds 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.330
 instead of putting a click and that's it 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.349
 we're going to do we take a click and with 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.739
 a noodle of 14 and we go all 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.930
 just start unlocking the 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.080
 candle so you can finish at the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.080
 hand 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.829
 so we unscrewed by hand so in 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.750
 mouth is at the end of the race 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.909
 we will remove the key this one not 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.870
 just keep the mud I saw 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.879
 that they have a sleeve that was 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.439
 to start risk absolutely nothing for 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.849
 put the candle back on exactly the same 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.859
 thing in a product before the candle 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.989
 in the key and then the key goes to the 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.689
 well, otherwise there is a risk of damaging 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.859
 ags advocates so here's the operation is 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.109
 quite simple it is not necessary 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.010
 simply switch a radiator or 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:20.010
 undo media to the wise 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.010
