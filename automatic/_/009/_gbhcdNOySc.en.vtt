00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
inside this frame and we glue them in

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.150 
inside this frame and we glue them in
place<00:01:36.390> easy<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:40.420> this<00:01:41.259> example<00:01:41.470> we<00:01:41.890> are<00:01:41.920> going

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
place easy in this example we are going

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.710 
place easy in this example we are going
to<00:01:42.340> bend<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.119> EPS<00:01:43.600> around<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:44.050> corner<00:01:45.360> eps<00:01:46.360> foam

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
to bend the EPS around a corner eps foam

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.330 
to bend the EPS around a corner eps foam
will<00:01:47.050> bend<00:01:47.789> XPS<00:01:48.789> from<00:01:49.390> video<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:50.080> will<00:01:50.800> not

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.580 

the<00:01:54.700> secret<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.299> bend<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.630> EPS<00:01:56.109> a<00:01:56.140> little

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
the secret is to bend the EPS a little

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.490 
the secret is to bend the EPS a little
at<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> time<00:01:57.329> you'll<00:01:58.329> bend<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.719> too<00:01:58.929> much<00:01:59.200> or<00:01:59.409> it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
at a time you'll bend it too much or it

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.219 
at a time you'll bend it too much or it
will<00:01:59.649> break<00:02:00.060> remember<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.149> EPS<00:02:01.659> is<00:02:01.929> still

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
will break remember the EPS is still

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.560 
will break remember the EPS is still
brittle<00:02:02.799> beneath<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.340> plastic<00:02:03.819> coating

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.840 

just<00:02:07.230> keep<00:02:07.409> bending<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.920> until<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.310> holds<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
just keep bending it until it holds a

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.880 
just keep bending it until it holds a
curved<00:02:09.330> shape<00:02:09.920> then<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.160> fit<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.490> into<00:02:11.640> place

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
curved shape then and fit it into place
