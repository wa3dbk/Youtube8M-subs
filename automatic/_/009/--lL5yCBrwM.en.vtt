00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the final card is a Mike Neal from the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.170 
the final card is a Mike Neal from the
Green<00:00:43.649> Bay<00:00:43.800> Packers<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.489> we're<00:00:44.610> already<00:00:44.940> two

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
Green Bay Packers so we're already two

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420 
Green Bay Packers so we're already two
packs<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.960> there's<00:00:46.620> not<00:00:46.800> much<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.039> on

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
packs in and there's not much going on

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
packs in and there's not much going on
so<00:00:47.489> maybe<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.940> third<00:00:48.149> pack<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:49.110> change<00:00:49.410> our

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so maybe the third pack will change our

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.650 
so maybe the third pack will change our
luck<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.160> our<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.340> football<00:00:51.000> outsiders

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
luck we get our first football outsiders

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.229 
luck we get our first football outsiders
of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> year<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.620> that's<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.340> mica<00:00:53.760> high<00:00:53.940> from

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
of the year and that's a mica high from

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.970 
of the year and that's a mica high from
the<00:00:54.270> Packers<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.989> get<00:00:55.110> Maurice<00:00:55.469> jones-drew

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the Packers we get Maurice jones-drew

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.000 
the Packers we get Maurice jones-drew
and<00:00:56.520> not<00:00:57.510> much<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.710> pack

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and not much going on in this pack

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.479 
and not much going on in this pack
either<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.090> hopefully<00:01:00.600> our<00:01:00.629> luck<00:01:00.899> will<00:01:01.440> change

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
either so hopefully our luck will change

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
either so hopefully our luck will change
