00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
I thought that was a nice combination I

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.220 
I thought that was a nice combination I
thought<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.250> was<00:02:33.340> maybe<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.820> little<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.480> little

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
thought it was maybe a little a little

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.940 
thought it was maybe a little a little
thin<00:02:35.710> in<00:02:35.740> some<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> lower<00:02:37.150> mid-range

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
thin in some of the lower mid-range

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.320 
thin in some of the lower mid-range
which<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.190> kind<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.030> surprise<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.970> still

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
which was kind of a surprise but still

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.670 
which was kind of a surprise but still
all<00:02:43.510> around<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:44.020> nice<00:02:44.530> combination<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:50.290> we<00:02:50.350> and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
all around a nice combination and we and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.960 
all around a nice combination and we and
obviously<00:02:51.010> we're<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.430> splitting<00:02:51.760> hairs

and when you know and when I was really

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
the speaker's dig in they were like I'm

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.260 
the speaker's dig in they were like I'm
with<00:03:50.740> you<00:03:50.860> buddy<00:03:51.040> I'm<00:03:51.220> with<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.490> there<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.820> mean

with you buddy I'm with you there I mean
that's<00:03:52.959> what<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.200> dug<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.980> as<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:55.030> player

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
that's what I dug and as a player

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.490 
that's what I dug and as a player
sometimes<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:57.450> feel<00:03:58.450> can<00:03:58.900> make<00:03:59.110> as<00:03:59.260> big<00:03:59.470> a

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
sometimes a feel can make as big a

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.770 
sometimes a feel can make as big a
difference<00:03:59.890> on<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.190> amp<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.209> speaker<00:04:01.600> is

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
difference on the amp and the speaker is

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.740 
difference on the amp and the speaker is
just<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:02.920> tone<00:04:03.160> if<00:04:03.490> it's<00:04:03.880> close<00:04:04.240> but<00:04:04.570> one

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
just the tone if it's close but one

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.330 
just the tone if it's close but one
feels<00:04:05.050> better<00:04:05.380> than<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.740> other<00:04:05.920> under<00:04:06.190> your

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
feels better than the other under your

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.190 
feels better than the other under your
fingers<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.780> can<00:04:08.500> be<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.920> deciding<00:04:09.130> factor

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
fingers that can be the deciding factor

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.500 
fingers that can be the deciding factor
makes<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.320> fun<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.500> play<00:04:11.739> yeah<00:04:12.220> but<00:04:13.150> well<00:04:13.330> then

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
makes it fun to play yeah but well then

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.449 
makes it fun to play yeah but well then
you'll<00:04:13.690> get<00:04:13.810> better<00:04:13.989> tones<00:04:14.410> because<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.010> feels

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
you'll get better tones because it feels

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.590 
you'll get better tones because it feels
better<00:04:15.850> with<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.440> right<00:04:17.440> right<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.910> and

better with the right right and the and

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.630 
better with the right right and the and
the<00:04:19.810> last<00:04:20.049> combination<00:04:20.680> that<00:04:20.830> that<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.250> wanted

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
the last combination that that I wanted

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
the last combination that that I wanted
to<00:04:21.760> talk<00:04:21.910> about<00:04:21.940> if<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.270> guys<00:04:22.360> got<00:04:22.540> anything

to add that's cool but is was the

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.850 
to add that's cool but is was the
surprising<00:04:25.840> combination<00:04:26.080> for<00:04:26.650> me

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
surprising combination for me

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.640 
surprising combination for me
the<00:04:27.159> last<00:04:27.400> thing<00:04:27.669> we<00:04:27.789> did<00:04:28.060> was<00:04:28.840> we<00:04:29.050> put<00:04:29.379> the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
the last thing we did was we put the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.119 
the last thing we did was we put the
American<00:04:30.449> g12<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.780> ceramic<00:04:32.259> version<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:32.949> top

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
American g12 the ceramic version on top

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.790 
American g12 the ceramic version on top
of<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.370> ET<00:04:33.669> 65<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.569> what<00:04:35.110> blew<00:04:35.289> me<00:04:35.439> away<00:04:35.469> about

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
of the ET 65 and what blew me away about

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.249 
of the ET 65 and what blew me away about
that<00:04:35.919> is<00:04:36.069> I<00:04:36.189> was<00:04:36.340> expecting<00:04:36.969> I<00:04:37.180> was<00:04:37.840> expecting

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
that is I was expecting I was expecting

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.600 
that is I was expecting I was expecting
to<00:04:38.379> really<00:04:38.620> really<00:04:38.830> really<00:04:39.099> liked<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.400> clean

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
to really really really liked the clean

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.980 
to really really really liked the clean
so<00:04:39.819> it's<00:04:39.969> expecting<00:04:40.449> you<00:04:40.659> know<00:04:40.750> sort<00:04:40.960> of

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
so it's expecting you know sort of

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.679 
so it's expecting you know sort of
offender<00:04:41.469> sparkly<00:04:42.069> clean<00:04:42.370> on<00:04:42.819> top<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.509> the

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
offender sparkly clean on top of the

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.950 
offender sparkly clean on top of the
little<00:04:43.930> bit<00:04:44.050> warmer<00:04:45.180> more<00:04:46.180> low<00:04:46.389> inside<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:46.900> the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
little bit warmer more low inside of the

little bit warmer more low inside of the
ET<00:04:47.199> 65<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:48.370> was<00:04:48.490> thinking<00:04:48.699> I'm<00:04:48.819> probably

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
ET 65 and I was thinking I'm probably

gonna<00:04:49.240> really<00:04:49.419> like<00:04:49.539> this<00:04:49.689> in<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.900> clean

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
gonna really like this in the clean

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.689 
gonna really like this in the clean
setting<00:04:50.319> but<00:04:50.919> I<00:04:50.949> bet<00:04:51.189> you<00:04:51.250> I'm<00:04:51.340> gonna<00:04:51.460> hate<00:04:51.669> it

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
setting but I bet you I'm gonna hate it

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.790 
setting but I bet you I'm gonna hate it
on<00:04:51.909> the<00:04:52.060> dirty<00:04:52.240> setting<00:04:52.689> and<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.289> interesting

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
on the dirty setting and the interesting

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.399 
on the dirty setting and the interesting
thing<00:04:53.830> was<00:04:54.189> that<00:04:54.520> that<00:04:55.000> I<00:04:55.539> really<00:04:56.050> liked<00:04:56.229> it<00:04:56.319> on

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
thing was that that I really liked it on

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.589 
thing was that that I really liked it on
the<00:04:56.469> dirty<00:04:56.949> setting<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.639> like<00:04:58.120> doing<00:04:58.449> the

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
the dirty setting it like doing the

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.459 
the dirty setting it like doing the
ac/dc<00:04:59.110> classic<00:04:59.830> rock<00:05:00.069> stuff<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:01.000> was<00:05:01.180> like

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
ac/dc classic rock stuff it was like

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.469 
ac/dc classic rock stuff it was like
beautiful<00:05:02.469> it<00:05:02.949> was<00:05:03.069> it<00:05:03.340> was<00:05:03.460> throw<00:05:03.849> it<00:05:04.150> had<00:05:04.330> the

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
beautiful it was it was throw it had the

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.540 
beautiful it was it was throw it had the
it<00:05:04.690> had<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.930> feel<00:05:05.259> of<00:05:05.289> like<00:05:05.710> an<00:05:05.889> old<00:05:06.039> Celestion

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
it had the feel of like an old Celestion

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.029 
it had the feel of like an old Celestion
blue<00:05:06.819> and<00:05:07.180> it's<00:05:07.300> kind<00:05:07.509> of<00:05:07.569> really<00:05:07.960> at<00:05:08.259> writing

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
blue and it's kind of really at writing

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.480 
blue and it's kind of really at writing
jagged<00:05:09.550> edge<00:05:09.699> you<00:05:10.030> know<00:05:11.250> but<00:05:12.250> interestingly

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
jagged edge you know but interestingly

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.860 
jagged edge you know but interestingly
enough<00:05:12.969> the<00:05:13.629> combination<00:05:14.259> for<00:05:14.560> cleans<00:05:15.870> didn't

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
enough the combination for cleans didn't

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.390 
enough the combination for cleans didn't
work<00:05:17.050> because<00:05:17.229> quite<00:05:17.560> honestly<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:18.190> didn't

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
work because quite honestly it didn't

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.269 
work because quite honestly it didn't
want<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.580> clean<00:05:18.729> up<00:05:18.759> the<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:19.960> g12<00:05:20.469> kept

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.279 
want to clean up the the g12 kept

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.490 
want to clean up the the g12 kept
wanting<00:05:21.969> to<00:05:22.150> sort<00:05:22.389> of<00:05:22.479> give<00:05:22.629> that<00:05:22.840> that<00:05:23.110> on<00:05:23.319> the

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
wanting to sort of give that that on the

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.040 
wanting to sort of give that that on the
ragged<00:05:23.740> edge<00:05:24.009> sound<00:05:24.849> so<00:05:25.629> that's<00:05:25.870> a

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
ragged edge sound so that's a

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.390 
ragged edge sound so that's a
combination<00:05:26.259> that<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:26.860> think<00:05:27.069> I<00:05:27.099> can<00:05:27.250> now

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
combination that I think I can now

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.610 
combination that I think I can now
recommend<00:05:27.969> for<00:05:28.419> folks<00:05:28.629> especially<00:05:29.259> if

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
recommend for folks especially if

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.050 
recommend for folks especially if
they're<00:05:29.740> going<00:05:29.979> after<00:05:30.099> just<00:05:30.550> straight-up

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
they're going after just straight-up

got some of that out of that however the
et<00:06:04.089> 65<00:06:04.659> almost<00:06:05.469> seemed<00:06:05.770> to<00:06:05.860> sort<00:06:06.099> of<00:06:06.190> overwhelm

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
et 65 almost seemed to sort of overwhelm

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.869

the the green beret and so he didn't get

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.119 
the the green beret and so he didn't get
as<00:06:10.000> much<00:06:10.029> of<00:06:10.629> that<00:06:10.659> sort<00:06:11.110> of<00:06:11.199> throaty<00:06:11.560> breakup

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
as much of that sort of throaty breakup

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:17.100 
as much of that sort of throaty breakup
he<00:06:12.279> sound<00:06:12.580> but<00:06:13.419> with<00:06:13.719> the<00:06:14.259> G<00:06:14.710> 12<00:06:15.129> on<00:06:15.580> top<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.930> G

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
he sound but with the G 12 on top the G

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.839 
he sound but with the G 12 on top the G
12<00:06:17.289> seemed<00:06:17.589> to<00:06:17.710> actually<00:06:18.099> sort<00:06:18.310> of<00:06:18.370> overwhelm

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
12 seemed to actually sort of overwhelm

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.110 
12 seemed to actually sort of overwhelm
the<00:06:19.060> 65<00:06:19.659> and<00:06:20.139> so<00:06:20.770> we<00:06:20.889> got<00:06:21.069> more<00:06:21.370> of<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.699> G<00:06:21.849> 12

the 65 and so we got more of the G 12

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.100 
the 65 and so we got more of the G 12
son<00:06:22.360> in<00:06:22.479> less<00:06:22.629> than<00:06:22.779> 65<00:06:24.210> anyway<00:06:25.210> so<00:06:25.539> so<00:06:25.870> yeah<00:06:26.080> I
