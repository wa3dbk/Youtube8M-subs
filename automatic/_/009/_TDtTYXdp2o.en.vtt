00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

body<00:00:00.420> performers<00:00:00.870> personal<00:00:01.230> training<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:01.829> I

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
body performers personal training and I

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.300 
body performers personal training and I
think<00:00:02.669> this<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.909> gonna<00:00:03.030> be<00:00:03.290> my<00:00:04.290> last<00:00:04.560> deadlift

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
think this is gonna be my last deadlift

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.010 
think this is gonna be my last deadlift
variation<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:06.089> I'm<00:00:06.210> gonna<00:00:06.390> film<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.930> I'll

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
variation that I'm gonna film and I'll

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.459 
variation that I'm gonna film and I'll
be<00:00:07.589> moving<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.309> some<00:00:08.519> other<00:00:08.870> exercises<00:00:09.870> and

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
be moving on to some other exercises and

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.629 
be moving on to some other exercises and
exercise<00:00:10.830> variations<00:00:11.599> so<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.639> deadlifts

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
exercise variations so this is deadlifts

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.390 
exercise variations so this is deadlifts
from<00:00:14.820> blocks<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:16.199> we've<00:00:16.379> done<00:00:16.560> Ted<00:00:16.800> lists<00:00:17.070> from

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
from blocks so we've done Ted lists from

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.460 
from blocks so we've done Ted lists from
the<00:00:17.490> deficit<00:00:18.150> where<00:00:18.330> you're<00:00:18.600> standing<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
the deficit where you're standing on the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.950 
the deficit where you're standing on the
blocks<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.920> raise<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.060> bar

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
blocks to raise you up so that the bar

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.630 
blocks to raise you up so that the bar
is<00:00:21.990> actually<00:00:22.289> lower<00:00:22.769> than<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.160> normally<00:00:23.279> would

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
is actually lower than it normally would

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.670 
is actually lower than it normally would
be<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.420> essentially<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> opposite

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
be so this is essentially the opposite

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.269 
be so this is essentially the opposite
where<00:00:26.000> I've<00:00:27.000> set<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> barbell<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.800> some

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
where I've set the barbell up on some

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.269 
where I've set the barbell up on some
some<00:00:29.880> platform<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.720> about<00:00:30.990> four<00:00:31.980> inches

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
some platform so it's about four inches

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.540 
some platform so it's about four inches
up<00:00:32.460> off<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.850> ground<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.780> puts<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.550> bar

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
up off the ground and that puts the bar

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.389 
up off the ground and that puts the bar
at<00:00:35.910> about<00:00:36.239> mid<00:00:37.140> Shin<00:00:37.500> level<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.219> below

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
at about mid Shin level or just below

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.299 
at about mid Shin level or just below
the<00:00:38.640> knee<00:00:38.820> level<00:00:39.079> as<00:00:40.079> opposed<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:41.040> you're

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the knee level as opposed to if you're

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
the knee level as opposed to if you're
in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> bottom<00:00:41.969> position<00:00:42.149> regular<00:00:43.020> bottom

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
in the bottom position regular bottom

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.220 
in the bottom position regular bottom
position<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> puts<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.399> both<00:00:44.899> mid<00:00:45.899> shin<00:00:46.200> or

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
position it puts you both mid shin or

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.549 
position it puts you both mid shin or
just<00:00:46.530> slightly<00:00:46.710> below<00:00:47.100> mid-shin<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.440> you<00:00:49.440> can

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
just slightly below mid-shin so you can

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.700 
just slightly below mid-shin so you can
use<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.059> variation<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.239> people<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.840> are

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
use this variation with people that are

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.959 
use this variation with people that are
maybe<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.219> starting<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> learn<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
maybe just starting to learn the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.869 
maybe just starting to learn the
deadlift<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> they're<00:00:54.809> having<00:00:55.879> flexibility

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
deadlift and they're having flexibility

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.610 
deadlift and they're having flexibility
issues<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.449> can't<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.989> themselves

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
issues and they can't get themselves

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.619 
issues and they can't get themselves
down<00:00:58.829> into<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> proper<00:00:59.699> position<00:00:59.850> when<00:01:00.510> they

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
down into the proper position when they

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.030 
down into the proper position when they
try<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.170> down<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> bar<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
try and get down to the to the bar and

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.260 
try and get down to the to the bar and
if<00:01:05.040> they're<00:01:05.189> not<00:01:05.339> flexible<00:01:05.610> enough<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
if they're not flexible enough in the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.670 
if they're not flexible enough in the
hamstrings<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> stuff<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.470> they'll

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
hamstrings and stuff and then they'll

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100 
hamstrings and stuff and then they'll
start<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.159> round<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.880> they<00:01:09.479> try<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:10.049> down

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
start to round as they try and get down

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
start to round as they try and get down
into<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.710> position<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.610> by<00:01:12.119> bringing<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
into that position so by bringing the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.350 
into that position so by bringing the
bar<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.530> higher<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.280> them<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
bar up a little bit higher for them to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.230 
bar up a little bit higher for them to
get<00:01:15.540> them<00:01:15.720> started<00:01:16.200> off<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.090> get

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
get them started off you can you can get

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
get them started off you can you can get
them<00:01:18.390> pulling<00:01:18.630> from<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.990> proper<00:01:19.380> position<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
them pulling from a proper position and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.130 
them pulling from a proper position and
then<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.090> increase<00:01:21.270> their<00:01:21.689> strength<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
then as you increase their strength and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.940 
then as you increase their strength and
flexibility<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.520> get<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.909> down<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
flexibility you can get them down to the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.350 
flexibility you can get them down to the
proper<00:01:26.340> position<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.850> usually<00:01:27.119> doesn't<00:01:27.240> take

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
proper position it usually doesn't take

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.249 
proper position it usually doesn't take
very<00:01:27.509> long<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.950> progression<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
very long to to do that progression and

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.210 
very long to to do that progression and
so<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.409> would<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.770> somebody<00:01:31.979> that's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
so that would be for somebody that's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.580 
so that would be for somebody that's
just<00:01:32.460> starting<00:01:32.640> out<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.000> has<00:01:33.590> limited

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
just starting out or has limited

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.859 
just starting out or has limited
mobility<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:35.310> whatever<00:01:35.549> reason<00:01:36.150> coming<00:01:36.689> back

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
mobility for whatever reason coming back

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.560 
mobility for whatever reason coming back
from<00:01:37.110> an<00:01:37.200> injury<00:01:37.640> whatever<00:01:38.640> whatever<00:01:39.210> have

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
from an injury whatever whatever have

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.480 
from an injury whatever whatever have
you<00:01:39.600> use<00:01:39.990> whatever<00:01:40.560> tools<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.100> need<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you use whatever tools you need at the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.240 
you use whatever tools you need at the
time<00:01:42.500> some<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> that's<00:01:43.649> trying<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> build

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
time some of that's trying to build

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.429 
time some of that's trying to build
strength<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.899> people<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
strength a lot of people would have the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.920 
strength a lot of people would have the
misconception<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:48.509> higher

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
misconception because this is up higher

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.139 
misconception because this is up higher
off<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.290> ground<00:01:49.579> that<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.729> actually<00:01:51.060> going

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
off the ground that it's actually going

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.510 
off the ground that it's actually going
to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.329> easier<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.619> some<00:01:52.920> people<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.340> will

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to be easier and for some people it will

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.730 
to be easier and for some people it will
be<00:01:53.579> they'll<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.479> able<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.720> pull<00:01:54.990> more<00:01:55.680> weight

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
be they'll be able to pull more weight

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.280 
be they'll be able to pull more weight
from<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.340> position<00:01:56.689> but<00:01:57.689> there's<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.229> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
from this position but there's going to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.249 
from this position but there's going to
be<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.439> lot<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.740> people<00:01:58.950> too<00:01:59.310> that<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.899> find

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
be a lot of people too that they find

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.050 
be a lot of people too that they find
they<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.590> pull<00:02:01.799> less<00:02:02.100> from<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.579> position

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
they can pull less from this position

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.899 
they can pull less from this position
because<00:02:03.240> when<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> bar<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.610> started<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
because when the bar is started on the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.180 
because when the bar is started on the
ground<00:02:06.090> where<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> normally<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:07.170> your<00:02:07.860> legs

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
ground where it normally is your legs

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.290 
ground where it normally is your legs
are<00:02:08.429> much<00:02:08.640> more<00:02:08.910> bent<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.770> allows<00:02:10.770> you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
are much more bent and that allows you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.290 
are much more bent and that allows you
to<00:02:12.300> get

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
to get

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.600 
to get
more<00:02:13.690> leg<00:02:14.020> drive<00:02:14.350> off<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.860> floor<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.370> then

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
more leg drive off of the floor and then

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.180 
more leg drive off of the floor and then
continue<00:02:16.210> that<00:02:16.420> momentum<00:02:17.110> through<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.040> if

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
continue that momentum through so if

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.920 
continue that momentum through so if
someone<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> good<00:02:18.850> fast<00:02:19.180> puller<00:02:19.540> off<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
someone is a good fast puller off the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.420 
someone is a good fast puller off the
floor<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.350> they<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.560> drive<00:02:20.770> hard<00:02:21.100> with<00:02:21.250> their

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
floor and they can drive hard with their

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.450 
floor and they can drive hard with their
legs<00:02:21.640> they<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.750> get<00:02:22.930> through<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.620> kind<00:02:24.310> of

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
legs they can get through that kind of

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.860 
legs they can get through that kind of
mid<00:02:24.730> sticking<00:02:25.180> point<00:02:25.420> that's<00:02:25.600> right<00:02:25.750> around

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
mid sticking point that's right around

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.090 
mid sticking point that's right around
the<00:02:26.110> knee<00:02:26.320> region<00:02:27.360> other<00:02:28.360> people<00:02:28.900> if<00:02:29.200> they<00:02:29.800> are

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
the knee region other people if they are

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.900 
the knee region other people if they are
not<00:02:30.990> particularly<00:02:32.190> fast<00:02:33.190> off<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.610> floor<00:02:33.880> or

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
not particularly fast off the floor or

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.760 
not particularly fast off the floor or
they<00:02:34.240> don't<00:02:34.360> push<00:02:34.690> as<00:02:34.930> hard<00:02:34.990> as<00:02:35.440> they<00:02:35.560> could

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
they don't push as hard as they could

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.830 
they don't push as hard as they could
with<00:02:35.980> their<00:02:36.160> legs<00:02:36.430> they're<00:02:37.330> going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.570> find

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
with their legs they're going to find

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.230 
with their legs they're going to find
when<00:02:38.080> they<00:02:38.230> get<00:02:38.410> into<00:02:38.790> into<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.970> position

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
when they get into into that position

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.570 
when they get into into that position
that<00:02:41.170> they're<00:02:41.350> not<00:02:41.500> as<00:02:41.680> strong<00:02:41.800> through<00:02:42.460> the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
that they're not as strong through the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.250 
that they're not as strong through the
middle<00:02:42.850> there<00:02:42.880> either<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:43.420> when<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.050> take

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
middle there either so when you take

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.020 
middle there either so when you take
when<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.500> pick<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.980> bar<00:02:45.220> off<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.610> floor<00:02:45.820> like

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
when you pick the bar off the floor like

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.230 
when you pick the bar off the floor like
this<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.990> put<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.410> up<00:02:47.530> on<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.770> blocks<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.430> then

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
this to put it up on the blocks and then

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.790 
this to put it up on the blocks and then
they<00:02:49.390> try<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.840> pull<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.230> well<00:02:50.410> their<00:02:50.560> leg

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
they try and pull it well their leg

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.700 
they try and pull it well their leg
drive<00:02:51.220> momentum<00:02:51.970> has<00:02:52.090> basically<00:02:52.630> been<00:02:52.990> taken

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
drive momentum has basically been taken

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
drive momentum has basically been taken
away<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.880> instead<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.420> having<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:57.130> bar<00:02:57.400> down

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
away so instead of having the bar down

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.120 
away so instead of having the bar down
here<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.450> being<00:02:59.020> able<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.320> drive<00:02:59.740> with<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
here and being able to drive with the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.610 
here and being able to drive with the
legs<00:03:00.310> more<00:03:00.640> now<00:03:01.120> it's<00:03:01.360> here<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:02.080> your<00:03:02.200> legs<00:03:02.410> are

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
legs more now it's here so your legs are

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.280 
legs more now it's here so your legs are
much<00:03:02.800> more<00:03:03.040> much<00:03:03.760> straight<00:03:04.210> or<00:03:04.360> right<00:03:04.540> off<00:03:05.140> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
much more much straight or right off the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.060 
much more much straight or right off the
very<00:03:05.470> start<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.210> lower<00:03:07.450> back<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.800> and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
very start so the lower back and the and

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.690 
very start so the lower back and the and
the<00:03:09.280> hips<00:03:09.960> take<00:03:10.960> a<00:03:11.020> lot<00:03:11.350> more<00:03:11.710> of<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.340> strain

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
the hips take a lot more of the strain

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.890 
the hips take a lot more of the strain
so<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:14.110> someone<00:03:14.560> gets<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.040> position<00:03:15.610> and

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
so if someone gets to this position and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.120 
so if someone gets to this position and
lifts<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:16.990> up<00:03:17.050> on<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.350> blocks<00:03:17.590> like<00:03:17.740> this<00:03:17.890> and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
lifts it up on the blocks like this and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.820 
lifts it up on the blocks like this and
realizes<00:03:18.670> that<00:03:18.850> they're<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> lot<00:03:20.170> weaker<00:03:20.470> in

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
realizes that they're a lot weaker in

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.370 
realizes that they're a lot weaker in
this<00:03:21.190> position<00:03:21.820> well<00:03:22.270> that's<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.630> weak<00:03:22.810> point<00:03:23.140> a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
this position well that's a weak point a

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.410 
this position well that's a weak point a
weak<00:03:23.980> link<00:03:24.250> in<00:03:24.400> their<00:03:24.580> chain<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:25.060> they<00:03:25.240> can

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
weak link in their chain that they can

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.750 
weak link in their chain that they can
work<00:03:25.600> on<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.110> they<00:03:26.260> could<00:03:26.320> strengthen<00:03:27.280> up<00:03:27.580> this

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
work on so they could strengthen up this

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.610 
work on so they could strengthen up this
part<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.270> lift<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.720> they're<00:03:29.440> going<00:03:29.560> to

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
part of the lift and they're going to

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.130 
part of the lift and they're going to
get<00:03:29.740> a<00:03:29.800> good<00:03:29.950> carry<00:03:30.280> over<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.910> pulling<00:03:31.810> off<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
get a good carry over to pulling off the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.530 
get a good carry over to pulling off the
floor<00:03:32.440> if<00:03:32.950> this<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.400> if<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.090> weak<00:03:34.300> link

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
floor if this is if this is a weak link

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.480 
floor if this is if this is a weak link
in<00:03:34.690> their<00:03:34.840> chain<00:03:35.050> so<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.950> might<00:03:36.130> be<00:03:36.250> something

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
in their chain so it might be something

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.690 
in their chain so it might be something
worthwhile<00:03:36.820> giving<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.660> try<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:39.340> you're<00:03:39.610> a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
worthwhile giving a try if you're a

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
worthwhile giving a try if you're a
beginner<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.900> need<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.350> extra<00:03:41.770> bit<00:03:41.890> of

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
beginner and you need that extra bit of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.840 
beginner and you need that extra bit of
mobility<00:03:43.720> work<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.770> that<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.310> get<00:03:45.490> yourself

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
mobility work on that and get yourself

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
how your strength level is there then

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.510 
how your strength level is there then
get<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.959> bar<00:04:02.170> up<00:04:02.350> a<00:04:02.470> little<00:04:02.620> bit<00:04:02.830> see<00:04:03.490> how

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
get the the bar up a little bit see how
