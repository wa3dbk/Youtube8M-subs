00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
just let almost see a cut half an hour

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:37.270 
just let almost see a cut half an hour
so<00:00:20.050> far<00:00:20.349> that<00:00:21.160> way<00:00:21.369> I'm<00:00:21.580> not<00:00:21.640> half<00:00:22.090> with<00:00:22.330> you

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.990 

forgot<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:38.180> say<00:00:38.420> it's<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:39.520> about<00:00:40.520> an<00:00:40.670> hour<00:00:40.820> to

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
forgot to say it's a about an hour to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.709 
forgot to say it's a about an hour to
cut<00:00:41.390> that<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.840> probably<00:00:43.329> about<00:00:44.329> an<00:00:44.480> hour<00:00:44.600> to

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
cut that and probably about an hour to

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.990 
cut that and probably about an hour to
figure<00:00:44.960> out<00:00:45.170> where<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.379> go<00:00:45.589> where<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.010> cut<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:46.940> I

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
figure out where to go where to cut so I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.810 
figure out where to go where to cut so I
by<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:47.379> little<00:00:48.379> machine<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:49.070> help<00:00:49.219> me<00:00:49.489> do<00:00:49.670> the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
by this little machine to help me do the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.479 
by this little machine to help me do the
tiles<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.660> of<00:00:51.500> course<00:00:51.739> with<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.010> lack<00:00:52.219> that<00:00:52.430> I

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
tiles and of course with the lack that I

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.280 
tiles and of course with the lack that I
have<00:00:52.899> the<00:00:53.899> blade<00:00:54.320> ended<00:00:54.800> up<00:00:54.920> being<00:00:55.250> off<00:00:55.489> center

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
have the blade ended up being off center

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.610 
have the blade ended up being off center
with<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.670> lips<00:00:58.670> body<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.329> machine<00:00:59.719> just

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
with the lips body of the machine just

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.880 
with the lips body of the machine just
check<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:01.070> out<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.699> what<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.969> blade<00:01:02.299> says

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
check that out and what a blade says

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.450 
check that out and what a blade says
look<00:01:03.890> how<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.190> sits<00:01:05.200> see<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.350> thing<00:01:06.740> here<00:01:07.070> what

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
look how it sits see the thing here what

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.520 
look how it sits see the thing here what
does<00:01:07.640> that<00:01:07.790> bottom<00:01:08.090> eighth<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.390> an<00:01:08.540> inch<00:01:08.659> and

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
does that bottom eighth of an inch and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.020 
does that bottom eighth of an inch and
look<00:01:09.679> will<00:01:09.830> be<00:01:09.860> here<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.250> way<00:01:10.399> it's<00:01:10.550> rubbing

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
look will be here the way it's rubbing

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.480 
look will be here the way it's rubbing
right<00:01:11.060> up<00:01:11.360> against<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.750> metal<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:13.009> see<00:01:13.250> that

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
right up against the metal you see that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.399 
right up against the metal you see that
so<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.649> ended<00:01:15.649> up<00:01:15.740> cutting<00:01:15.950> my<00:01:16.190> tiles

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
so it ended up cutting my tiles

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.779 
so it ended up cutting my tiles
extremely<00:01:18.409> crooked<00:01:18.679> as<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.429> can<00:01:19.610> possibly

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
extremely crooked as you can possibly

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.790 
extremely crooked as you can possibly
imagine<00:01:20.149> that<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:20.960> if<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.289> could<00:01:21.440> see<00:01:21.649> that

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
imagine that and if you could see that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.880 
imagine that and if you could see that
tile<00:01:22.159> see<00:01:23.030> how<00:01:23.240> while<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.929> is<00:01:24.110> here<00:01:24.440> compared

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
tile see how while it is here compared

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.790 
tile see how while it is here compared
to<00:01:25.069> their<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.729> had<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.179> point<00:01:26.450> this<00:01:26.690> out<00:01:26.929> and<00:01:27.649> I'm

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
to their I had to point this out and I'm

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.380 
to their I had to point this out and I'm
going<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.009> attempt<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.340> take<00:01:28.550> this<00:01:28.700> back<00:01:29.000> so

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
going to attempt to take this back so

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.669 
going to attempt to take this back so
after<00:01:29.659> destroying<00:01:30.170> two<00:01:30.380> tiles<00:01:30.649> I<00:01:30.920> realized

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
after destroying two tiles I realized

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.320 
after destroying two tiles I realized
they<00:01:33.679> make<00:01:33.890> this<00:01:34.039> can<00:01:34.250> possibly<00:01:34.429> happen<00:01:34.909> where

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
they make this can possibly happen where

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.330 
they make this can possibly happen where
a<00:01:35.360> brand-new<00:01:35.810> machine<00:01:36.050> has<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.860> blade<00:01:37.610> set<00:01:38.060> in

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
a brand-new machine has the blade set in

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.319 
a brand-new machine has the blade set in
so<00:01:40.340> crooked<00:01:41.020> they<00:01:42.020> just<00:01:42.229> got<00:01:42.409> in<00:01:42.590> your<00:01:42.710> machine

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:56.560 

there<00:01:47.329> we<00:01:47.509> look<00:01:47.780> at<00:01:47.899> that<00:01:48.110> way<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.860> street

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:07.430 

this<00:01:57.570> data<00:01:57.930> works<00:01:58.260> oh<00:02:03.620> boy<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.960> see<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.290> red

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
this data works oh boy you see that red

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.080 
this data works oh boy you see that red
line<00:02:07.710> laser<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.250> finally<00:02:11.610> got<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.910> pretty

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
line laser so I finally got it pretty

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.770 
line laser so I finally got it pretty
much<00:02:12.300> straight<00:02:12.630> with<00:02:12.810> all<00:02:12.990> my<00:02:13.170> titles<00:02:14.780> she

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
much straight with all my titles she

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:28.930 
much straight with all my titles she
could<00:02:15.959> see<00:02:16.200> it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.390 

the<00:02:29.940> first<00:02:30.240> row<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.480> tiles<00:02:31.160> let's<00:02:32.160> see<00:02:32.280> what

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
the first row of tiles let's see what

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.180 
the first row of tiles let's see what
happens<00:02:35.600> let<00:02:36.600> me<00:02:36.690> tell<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.760> hard

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
and so we see the defects the next day I

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.240 
and so we see the defects the next day I
spent<00:03:03.150> 4<00:03:03.390> out<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.569> line<00:03:03.959> let's<00:03:04.260> see<00:03:04.500> make<00:03:05.220> sure

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
spent 4 out of line let's see make sure
