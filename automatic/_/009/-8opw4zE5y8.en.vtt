tutorial<00:00:15.030> started<00:00:18.230> begin<00:00:19.230> by<00:00:19.380> cleaning<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
tutorial started begin by cleaning the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.130 
tutorial started begin by cleaning the
skin<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.520> alcohol<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.330> step<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
skin with alcohol this step is going to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.810 
skin with alcohol this step is going to
allow<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> makeup<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> adhere<00:00:23.220> better<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
allow the makeup to adhere better to the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.859 
allow the makeup to adhere better to the
skin<00:00:25.310> for<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> bite<00:00:26.580> marks<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.150> using<00:00:27.390> rigid

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
skin for the bite marks I'm using rigid

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.540 
skin for the bite marks I'm using rigid
collodion<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.590> lip<00:00:28.769> liner<00:00:28.800> pencils

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
collodion and lip liner pencils

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
collodion and lip liner pencils
I<00:00:29.640> chose<00:00:30.000> rigid<00:00:30.449> collodion<00:00:30.599> specifically

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
I chose rigid collodion specifically

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.410 
I chose rigid collodion specifically
because<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.460> product<00:00:32.820> dries<00:00:33.090> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
because as the product dries it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.569 
because as the product dries it
constricts<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.230> creates<00:00:34.559> indentations<00:00:35.370> in

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
constricts and creates indentations in

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.030 
constricts and creates indentations in
the<00:00:35.640> skin<00:00:36.030> which<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.899> perfect<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:37.710> teeth

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the skin which is perfect for teeth

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.240 
the skin which is perfect for teeth
marks<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:39.500> sketched<00:00:40.500> out<00:00:40.710> where<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.890> wanted<00:00:41.129> my

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
marks I sketched out where I wanted my

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.340 
marks I sketched out where I wanted my
bite<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.760> using<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> pencils<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:43.290> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
bite to be using the pencils for a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
bite to be using the pencils for a
healing<00:00:43.800> wound<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.370> would<00:00:44.700> use<00:00:44.910> lighter

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
healing wound I would use lighter

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.990 
healing wound I would use lighter
pencils<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:46.050> you're<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
pencils if you're going for like a you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.610 
pencils if you're going for like a you
know<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.420> wound<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:48.930> almost<00:00:49.200> healed<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
know a wound that's almost healed you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.779 
know a wound that's almost healed you
would<00:00:49.770> use<00:00:49.920> lighter<00:00:50.160> pencils<00:00:50.579> because

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
would use lighter pencils because

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.479 
would use lighter pencils because
typically<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:52.199> skin<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.710> healing<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
typically when skin is healing it is a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
typically when skin is healing it is a
little<00:00:53.760> bit<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> lighter<00:00:54.449> color<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.530> here

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
little bit of a lighter color but here

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.439 
little bit of a lighter color but here
I'm<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> fresh<00:00:56.640> bite<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.270> I'm<00:00:57.329> going

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
I'm going for a fresh bite so I'm going

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479 
I'm going for a fresh bite so I'm going
to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.600> using<00:00:57.870> red<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.350> mauve<00:00:58.859> colored<00:00:59.280> lip

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to be using red and mauve colored lip

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
to be using red and mauve colored lip
pencils<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.140> drew<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> teeth

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
pencils and I just drew in the teeth

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.830 
pencils and I just drew in the teeth
marks<00:01:02.129> using<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.820> red<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.480> mauve<00:01:03.690> color

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
marks using the red and the mauve color

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.300 
marks using the red and the mauve color
now<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> outline<00:01:08.280> my

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
now as you can see here I outline my

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.700 
now as you can see here I outline my
bite<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> white<00:01:09.240> eyeliner<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.990> did<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
bite with a white eyeliner I did this

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
bite with a white eyeliner I did this
ticket<00:01:11.159> myself<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> border<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.150> when<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> apply

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
ticket myself a border for when I apply

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.750 
ticket myself a border for when I apply
the<00:01:12.689> rigid<00:01:13.229> collodion<00:01:13.460> because<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.610> really

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the rigid collodion because it's really

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
the rigid collodion because it's really
hard<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> clear<00:01:15.659> product<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.290> when<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
hard it's a clear product so when it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.760 
hard it's a clear product so when it
dries<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.610> pretty<00:01:18.060> invisible<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.619> white

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
dries it's pretty invisible so the white

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.330 
dries it's pretty invisible so the white
line<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.220> helps<00:01:20.490> give<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.850> border<00:01:22.340> next

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
line really helps give you a border next

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
line really helps give you a border next
I<00:01:23.430> applied<00:01:23.700> 7<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.119> 8<00:01:24.210> coats<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> rigid

I applied 7 or 8 coats of the rigid
collodion<00:01:25.320> focusing<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> kind<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
collodion focusing it kind of in the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.840 
collodion focusing it kind of in the
teeth<00:01:27.270> marks<00:01:27.710> this<00:01:28.710> product<00:01:29.070> constricts<00:01:29.670> as

very<00:01:46.049> neat<00:01:46.229> effect<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:48.619> wanted<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:49.829> more

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
very neat effect I wanted a little more

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.679 
very neat effect I wanted a little more
dimension<00:01:50.189> around<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> wound<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> applied

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
dimension around the wound so I applied

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.350 
dimension around the wound so I applied
a<00:01:51.720> thin<00:01:51.899> amount<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.500> nose<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.979> scar<00:01:53.130> wax<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.030> I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
a thin amount of nose and scar wax and I

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.910 
a thin amount of nose and scar wax and I
just<00:01:54.570> did<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.869> using<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.320> spatula

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
just did this using a spatula

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130 
just did this using a spatula
I<00:01:55.979> built<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.369> wax<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:56.850> closest<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> actual

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
I built the wax up closest to the actual

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200 
I built the wax up closest to the actual
teeth<00:01:58.350> marks<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.950> then<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.520> tapered<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
teeth marks and then kind of tapered the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.630 
teeth marks and then kind of tapered the
wax<00:02:00.420> downwards<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.290> outwards<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.219> just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
wax downwards and outwards and just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.770 
wax downwards and outwards and just
blended<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> down<00:02:03.270> into<00:02:03.479> my<00:02:03.630> skin

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.510 

the<00:02:09.780> wax<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.170> get<00:02:10.319> very<00:02:10.530> sticky<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.310> best

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the wax can get very sticky so it's best

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.309 
the wax can get very sticky so it's best
to<00:02:11.640> use<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> sculpting<00:02:12.720> tool<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
to use it with a sculpting tool like the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.650 
to use it with a sculpting tool like the
spatula<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.489> also<00:02:14.640> smooth<00:02:15.239> out<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> wax

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
spatula you can also smooth out the wax

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.510 
spatula you can also smooth out the wax
using<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.110> little<00:02:16.319> lotion<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:17.069> I'm<00:02:17.190> actually

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
using a little lotion here I'm actually

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.890 
using a little lotion here I'm actually
dipping<00:02:17.760> my<00:02:17.790> finger<00:02:18.180> into<00:02:18.330> some<00:02:18.630> hand<00:02:18.840> lotion

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
dipping my finger into some hand lotion

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.440 
dipping my finger into some hand lotion
and<00:02:19.470> rubbing<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.370> into<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.730> wax<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.330> is

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and rubbing it into the wax and this is

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.330 
and rubbing it into the wax and this is
gonna<00:02:21.599> create<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.959> smoother<00:02:22.410> transition<00:02:22.590> from

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
gonna create a smoother transition from

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.830 
gonna create a smoother transition from
wax<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.150> skin<00:02:26.239> at<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.360> point<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:27.750> could

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
wax to skin at this point you could

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.030 
wax to skin at this point you could
probably<00:02:28.019> stop<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.650> have<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.769> pretty

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
probably stop and have a pretty

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.460 
probably stop and have a pretty
realistic<00:02:29.400> bite<00:02:29.790> scar<00:02:30.150> but<00:02:30.840> I'm<00:02:31.050> going<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
realistic bite scar but I'm going for a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.300 
realistic bite scar but I'm going for a
fresh<00:02:31.739> wound

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
fresh wound

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.949 
fresh wound
so<00:02:32.459> now<00:02:32.640> I'm<00:02:32.880> coloring<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> teeth<00:02:33.630> marks

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
so now I'm coloring in the teeth marks

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.780 
so now I'm coloring in the teeth marks

rotation around the wound

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.620 
rotation around the wound
I<00:02:46.380> used<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.799> q-tip<00:02:47.220> dipped<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.640> alcohol<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.360> dab

the wound the great thing about these

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.990 
the wound the great thing about these
paints<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.100> can<00:02:53.220> easily<00:02:53.459> dissolve

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
paints is that you can easily dissolve

you can easily diffuse it out with a
little<00:02:59.580> bit<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.819> alcohol<00:03:01.280> next<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.400> use<00:03:02.549> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
little bit of alcohol next I use the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.309 
little bit of alcohol next I use the
paint<00:03:02.880> brush<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.269> dab<00:03:03.390> fake<00:03:03.750> blood<00:03:03.989> into<00:03:04.230> the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
wound with water and just see how the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.699 
wound with water and just see how the
blood<00:03:18.150> kind<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.540> reacts<00:03:18.900> or<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.380> fake<00:03:19.530> blood

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
blood kind of reacts or the fake blood

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.530 
blood kind of reacts or the fake blood
reacts<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.940> create<00:03:21.239> kind<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.480> a

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
reacts it's going to create kind of a

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.599 
reacts it's going to create kind of a
more<00:03:21.660> organic<00:03:22.019> look<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.799> actual<00:03:23.220> blood

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
more organic look like the actual blood

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.160 
more organic look like the actual blood
