00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.480 

my<00:00:14.080> fifth-grade<00:00:14.410> art<00:00:14.769> teacher<00:00:15.009> taught<00:00:15.309> me<00:00:15.400> to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
my fifth-grade art teacher taught me to

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.679 
my fifth-grade art teacher taught me to
draw<00:00:15.669> this<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:17.230> all<00:00:17.410> straight<00:00:17.740> lines

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.590 

how<00:00:22.689> can<00:00:22.900> straight<00:00:23.140> lines<00:00:23.380> make<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:23.920> curve

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:42.100 

it's<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:27.289> same<00:00:27.500> way<00:00:27.650> string<00:00:27.980> art<00:00:28.160> works

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.270 

maybe<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.320> curve<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.769> just<00:00:43.800> an<00:00:44.309> illusion<00:00:46.280> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
maybe the curve is just an illusion it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.680 
maybe the curve is just an illusion it
looks<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> curve<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.180> might<00:00:48.329> use<00:00:48.539> in

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
looks like a curve we might use in

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.560 
looks like a curve we might use in
algebra<00:00:49.640> could<00:00:50.640> there<00:00:50.789> possibly<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:51.480> an

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
algebra could there possibly be an

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.719 
algebra could there possibly be an
equation<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.440> general<00:00:53.010> form<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.370> Gomez

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
equation for that general form of Gomez

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.670 
equation for that general form of Gomez
and<00:00:54.299> to<00:00:54.449> pick<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.809> Portland<00:00:55.229> single

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and to pick one Portland single

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
and to pick one Portland single

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
reflection values lines between a whole

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
reflection values lines between a whole
number<00:00:57.930> tiny<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.979> half

number tiny and a half

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.450 
number tiny and a half
that<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.719> 11<00:01:01.110> an<00:01:01.290> equation<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> curve

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that was 11 an equation for the curve

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.600 
that was 11 an equation for the curve

line graph X lines there is why the

real<00:01:29.340> numbers<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.020> could<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.200> keep<00:01:31.350> adding
