00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.429
If it's a quiet night at the beach, and
your ex old lady suddenly out of nowhere

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.640
shows up with a story about

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:17.476
her current billionaire
land developer boyfriend

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.811
and his wife and her boyfriend,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.065
and a plot to kidnap that billionaire
and throw him in a loony bin...

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.566
I need your help, Doc.

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:26.985
... maybe you should just
look the other way.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.744
But if you're Doc, it may all start
to get a little peculiar after that.

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:37.663
Michael Z. Wolfmann...

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.039
Mickey Wolfmann.

00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:42.501
- ... has vanished.
- So where would I find him?

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.295
He's technically Jewish
but wants to be a Nazi.

00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:48.548
And a girl wouldn't necessarily want to
get into difficulties with those folks.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:51.456
Do you have a spare picture
I could borrow?

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:56.014
Well, maybe you're better off
with the Nazis.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.936
- Are you all right?
- Am I?

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:01.687
Are you?

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.772
Ordinarily, we're the ones
asking the questions.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.191
And your question is,
which side am I on?

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:07.901
- Good question.
- Wrong answer.

00:01:42.613 --> 00:01:43.603
Did I get you?

00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:50.694
Doc may not be a do-gooder,
but he's done good.

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:02.664
Good luck, Doc.
