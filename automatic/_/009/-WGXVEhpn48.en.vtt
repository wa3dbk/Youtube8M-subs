00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.250
 at minute 7 the first to bay a 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.260
 good combination very fast by the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.110
 center the appearance of emanuel 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.619
 biancucchi and it is extraordinary the 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.900
 Solomon's reaction libman for 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.910
 stretch how long it is and avoid the 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.489
 first goal of the game but he played better 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.760
 the césar vallejo from then on and 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.789
 he had a couple of clear chances here 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.769
 and how he never had to finish or 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.079
 not even here but after the 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.079
 I kept pando and pando again 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.510
 the taco de chávez aguanta wins and 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.250
 maintains its position to return to 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.549
 enable 7 that fails to define well 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.990
 before the very quick rapid emptying of 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.790
 lomba 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.150
 but in the 56 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.460
 let's highlight is 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.830
 the leo gago auction the figure of the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.830
 party that is going astray 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:20.040
 62 minutes and another chance for the local 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.280
 is with the ball under the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.210
 arch fa he 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.400
 the team has slept in it 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.750
 right sector after the free throw the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.390
 ejecting your chip 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.490
 I think it was correct yellow 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.750
 although he does not touch it, it is very imprudent as 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.410
 goes 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.260
 and here is the next move where 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.610
 arrives 1 to 0 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.040
 the ball to the area 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.100
 and nobody marks it at &amp; t and I think if 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.580
 was that I had to follow it because it's very 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.040
 curious that a central marker the abc 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.250
 of the blade the ball has no 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.440
 type of player that hinders you 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.410
 when one minus this was the clearest 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.810
 Chávez who did grand slam in the area and 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:15.180
 could not define and in the 75 another 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.160
 and the one who finishes is leo gago the left-hander who 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.860
 he found well very well and well 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.830
 79 minute had just entered the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.320
 court in frames aurelio the one that has the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.210
 chance another one of those who had entered and 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.570
 william bar saw meets that 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.670
 bounce on the first ball he touched 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.980
 for 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.280
 and get a much more result 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.190
 important I would not say bulky but yes 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.819
 quite decisive because it did not receive 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.700
 goals against and you can speculate with 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.590
 this when I visited trujillo scoring a 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.970
 Only bolus forces the Caesar Vallejo to 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.970
 score 4 in the rematch
