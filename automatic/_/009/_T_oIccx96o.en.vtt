00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
back to the back here we've got two

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.830 
back to the back here we've got two
zeros<00:01:40.410> coming<00:01:41.250> from<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> front<00:01:41.820> back<00:01:42.479> here

zeros coming from the front back here

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.490 
zeros coming from the front back here
and<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:45.660> two<00:01:47.509> zeros<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.780> back<00:01:48.960> side<00:01:49.229> we'll

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
and the two zeros on the back side we'll

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.760 
and the two zeros on the back side we'll
feed<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> two<00:01:50.039> amps<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.780> subs<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.619> then

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
feed the two amps for the subs and then

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.230 
feed the two amps for the subs and then
we<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.160> two<00:01:53.369> four<00:01:53.640> gauges<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
we have the two four gauges in the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.050 
we have the two four gauges in the
middle<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:55.440> will<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.740> feeding<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.310> four<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
middle that will be feeding the four to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.420 
middle that will be feeding the four to
four<00:01:57.360> channel<00:01:57.720> amps<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.310> be

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
four channel amps and will be

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.370 
four channel amps and will be
shrink-wrapping<00:01:59.910> this<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.509> getting

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
shrink-wrapping this and getting

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.910 
shrink-wrapping this and getting
insecure<00:02:05.450> I'm<00:02:06.450> working<00:02:06.720> on<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.680> Rings

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
insecure I'm working on that the Rings

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.940 
insecure I'm working on that the Rings
for<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> subs<00:02:08.549> here<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.799> to<00:02:10.860> be

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
for the subs here this is going to be

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.780 
for the subs here this is going to be
like<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.370> outer<00:02:11.549> ring<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.530> then<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:14.489> will

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
like the outer ring and then this will

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.350 
like the outer ring and then this will
be

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
be

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.270 
be
you<00:02:16.930> cut<00:02:17.500> out<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> subt<00:02:19.480> amount<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:21.190> what

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
you cut out for the subt amount and what

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.510 
you cut out for the subt amount and what
I'll<00:02:21.400> do<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.610> glue<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.630> back<00:02:22.900> on

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
I'll do is glue this back on

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.280 
I'll do is glue this back on
and<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.120> would<00:02:25.240> give<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.570> countersink

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
and I would give it that countersink

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.050 
and I would give it that countersink
looked<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.370> that's<00:02:27.520> what<00:02:27.640> I'm<00:02:27.730> working<00:02:28.000> on

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
looked so that's what I'm working on

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:56.220 
looked so that's what I'm working on
right<00:02:28.120> now

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.530 

so<00:02:57.230> here's<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.560> starting<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.070> box

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
so here's the starting of the box

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.560 
so here's the starting of the box
basically<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:00.890> going<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.100> swoop<00:03:01.310> up<00:03:01.580> up

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
basically so it's going to swoop up up

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.120 
basically so it's going to swoop up up
to<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.870> roof<00:03:03.050> line<00:03:05.350> with<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.500> Rings<00:03:06.740> and

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
to the roof line with the Rings and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.600 
to the roof line with the Rings and
these<00:03:08.050> would<00:03:09.050> just<00:03:09.080> be<00:03:09.380> kind<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.770> positioned

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
these would just be kind of positioned

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.650 
these would just be kind of positioned
like<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:11.120> all<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.720> way<00:03:11.810> up<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:14.480> what<00:03:14.600> i'm

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
like that all the way up so what i'm

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.090 
like that all the way up so what i'm
doing<00:03:14.780> here<00:03:14.960> is<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:16.670> putting<00:03:17.150> together<00:03:17.330> this

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
doing here is is putting together this

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.370 
doing here is is putting together this

trim piece as you can see it's been

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.950 
trim piece as you can see it's been
grooved<00:03:21.620> out<00:03:21.800> so<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.160> it<00:03:22.280> it'll<00:03:22.820> bend<00:03:23.090> and

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
grooved out so that it it'll bend and

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.170 
grooved out so that it it'll bend and
bend<00:03:24.200> around<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.530> corner<00:03:24.860> some<00:03:25.730> will<00:03:25.880> work<00:03:26.000> on

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
bend around the corner some will work on

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.350 
bend around the corner some will work on
that<00:03:26.210> top<00:03:26.570> section<00:03:26.840> up<00:03:27.230> here<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:29.000> i<00:03:29.090> got<00:03:29.240> my

getting it prepped sanded and put some
body<00:04:26.939> filler<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.509> and<00:04:28.110> get<00:04:28.229> it<00:04:28.319> ready<00:04:28.379> for

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
body filler on and get it ready for

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.769

paint

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:33.779 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.549 

and<00:04:34.289> didn't<00:04:34.499> they<00:04:34.559> start<00:04:34.949> these<00:04:35.099> doors

00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:36.559 
and didn't they start these doors

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:40.219 
and didn't they start these doors
basically<00:04:37.559> I'm<00:04:37.679> just<00:04:38.449> masking<00:04:39.449> off<00:04:39.629> the<00:04:39.839> area

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
basically I'm just masking off the area

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.369 
basically I'm just masking off the area
I'm<00:04:40.889> just<00:04:41.069> kind<00:04:41.309> of<00:04:41.779> putting<00:04:42.779> a<00:04:42.929> line<00:04:43.139> around

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
I'm just kind of putting a line around

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.379 
I'm just kind of putting a line around
just<00:04:43.919> kind<00:04:44.129> of<00:04:44.159> give<00:04:44.279> me<00:04:44.369> a<00:04:44.459> general<00:04:44.699> idea<00:04:45.089> of

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
just kind of give me a general idea of

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.169 
just kind of give me a general idea of
what<00:04:45.569> these<00:04:45.749> are<00:04:46.019> going<00:04:46.229> to<00:04:46.319> look<00:04:46.439> like

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:47.179 
what these are going to look like

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:49.909 
what these are going to look like
basically<00:04:48.179> it's<00:04:48.389> going<00:04:48.509> to<00:04:48.569> be<00:04:48.689> three<00:04:49.409> pair<00:04:49.649> of

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
basically it's going to be three pair of

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.009 
basically it's going to be three pair of
six-and-a-half<00:04:50.399> components<00:04:51.179> in<00:04:51.299> each<00:04:51.539> door

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:52.019 
six-and-a-half components in each door

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:56.899 
six-and-a-half components in each door
panel<00:04:53.749> so<00:04:54.749> we'll<00:04:54.989> just<00:04:55.339> start<00:04:56.339> fiberglassing

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
panel so we'll just start fiberglassing

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.149 
panel so we'll just start fiberglassing
this<00:04:57.209> on<00:04:58.159> show<00:04:59.159> you<00:04:59.249> that<00:04:59.399> next

okay so here's all the fiberglass roof

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.819 
okay so here's all the fiberglass roof
panels<00:05:05.009> basically<00:05:05.789> roughed<00:05:06.029> out<00:05:06.649> just<00:05:07.649> still

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:07.829 
panels basically roughed out just still

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:09.679 
panels basically roughed out just still
got<00:05:07.979> to<00:05:08.039> cut<00:05:08.219> them<00:05:08.309> out<00:05:08.459> and<00:05:08.519> get<00:05:08.939> them<00:05:09.059> prepped

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:09.689 
got to cut them out and get them prepped

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.239 
got to cut them out and get them prepped
and<00:05:09.899> all<00:05:10.249> on<00:05:11.249> the<00:05:11.429> Rings<00:05:11.699> I<00:05:12.199> use<00:05:13.199> for<00:05:14.129> this

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:14.249 
and all on the Rings I use for this

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.329 
and all on the Rings I use for this
particular<00:05:14.569> application<00:05:15.829> in<00:05:16.829> order<00:05:17.069> to<00:05:17.159> get

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339 
particular application in order to get

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.600 
particular application in order to get
that<00:05:17.519> recessed<00:05:18.089> look<00:05:18.860> some<00:05:19.860> hard<00:05:20.129> cardboard

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
that recessed look some hard cardboard

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.110 
that recessed look some hard cardboard
stop<00:05:21.289> and<00:05:22.289> it's<00:05:22.469> just<00:05:22.709> trimmed

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
stop and it's just trimmed

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.970 
stop and it's just trimmed
by<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.750> inch<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.169> three-eighths<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:27.980> when

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
by the inch and three-eighths and when

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.900 
by the inch and three-eighths and when
you<00:05:29.070> put<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.370> grill<00:05:29.669> down<00:05:30.380> like<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.910> it

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
you put the grill down like that it

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.990 
you put the grill down like that it
gives<00:05:33.120> it<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.300> countersink<00:05:34.080> look<00:05:34.850> so<00:05:35.850> this

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
gives it that countersink look so this

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.490 
gives it that countersink look so this
is<00:05:36.150> a<00:05:36.180> technique<00:05:36.630> that<00:05:36.690> I've<00:05:36.960> used<00:05:37.260> in<00:05:37.410> the

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
is a technique that I've used in the

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:47.120 
is a technique that I've used in the
past<00:05:37.530> it's<00:05:38.100> kind<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.370> old-school<00:05:45.800> I've<00:05:46.800> got

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
past it's kind of old-school I've got

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.010 
past it's kind of old-school I've got
the<00:05:47.220> first<00:05:47.430> layer<00:05:47.730> of<00:05:48.090> fiberglass<00:05:48.480> on<00:05:48.840> our

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
the first layer of fiberglass on our

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.950 
the first layer of fiberglass on our
panels<00:05:49.440> and<00:05:49.860> this<00:05:50.760> is<00:05:50.940> just<00:05:51.090> more<00:05:51.720> or<00:05:51.810> less

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
panels and this is just more or less

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.320 
panels and this is just more or less
make<00:05:52.200> out<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.650> shape<00:05:52.820> that<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:53.940> panel<00:05:54.270> is

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
make out the shape that the panel is

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.070 
make out the shape that the panel is
going<00:05:54.450> to<00:05:54.510> wind<00:05:54.720> up<00:05:54.840> being<00:05:56.780> just<00:05:57.780> let<00:05:57.930> this

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
going to wind up being just let this

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.640 
going to wind up being just let this
