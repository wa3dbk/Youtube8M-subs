00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
wraps to sink the fly so we don't have

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.530 
wraps to sink the fly so we don't have
it<00:01:24.310> sitting<00:01:24.520> out<00:01:24.700> there<00:01:24.880> like<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:25.090> powder<00:01:25.330> puff

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.830 
it sitting out there like a powder puff
on<00:01:25.750> top<00:01:25.960> of<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.140> water<00:01:30.330> there's<00:01:31.330> six<00:01:31.600> wraps

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
on top of the water there's six wraps

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.690 
on top of the water there's six wraps
just<00:01:32.080> enough<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.680> get<00:01:32.800> that<00:01:33.010> head<00:01:33.280> this<00:01:33.550> will

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
just enough to get that head this will

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.970 
just enough to get that head this will
also<00:01:33.909> give<00:01:34.510> it<00:01:34.690> just<00:01:34.840> a<00:01:35.140> bit<00:01:35.350> of<00:01:35.560> jigging

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
also give it just a bit of jigging

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.610 
also give it just a bit of jigging
action<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.780> know<00:01:37.870> I've<00:01:37.930> had<00:01:38.050> questions<00:01:38.500> in

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
action you know I've had questions in

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.350 
action you know I've had questions in
the<00:01:38.710> past<00:01:38.920> well<00:01:39.130> one<00:01:39.280> she's<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.640> bead<00:01:39.850> well<00:01:40.090> I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
the past well one she's a bead well I

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.969 
the past well one she's a bead well I
don't<00:01:40.659> like<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.930> be<00:01:41.050> because<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:41.350> usually<00:01:41.530> find

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
don't like to be because I usually find

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.490 
don't like to be because I usually find
that<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:42.190> makes<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.640> fly<00:01:42.820> sink<00:01:43.210> too<00:01:43.390> fast<00:01:43.690> what

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
that it makes the fly sink too fast what

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.800 
that it makes the fly sink too fast what
I<00:01:44.530> like<00:01:44.800> about<00:01:45.010> this<00:01:45.310> this<00:01:45.790> pattern<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:46.780> I

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
I like about this this pattern is that I

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.020 
I like about this this pattern is that I
can<00:01:47.020> cast<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:47.530> out<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.950> can<00:01:48.250> let<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.520> fly<00:01:48.700> sit

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
can cast it out I can let the fly sit

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.640 
can cast it out I can let the fly sit
out<00:01:49.150> there<00:01:49.330> for<00:01:49.479> an<00:01:49.540> extended<00:01:49.960> period<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.409> time

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.279 
tail make a little bit more realistic
bugs<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:06.909> what<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.090> typically<00:02:07.540> do<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:07.810> I'll<00:02:08.110> take

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
bugs so what I typically do is I'll take

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.899 
bugs so what I typically do is I'll take
the<00:02:08.349> feather<00:02:08.799> with<00:02:09.039> my<00:02:09.190> right<00:02:09.399> hand<00:02:09.429> I'll

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
the feather with my right hand I'll

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.880 
the feather with my right hand I'll
measure<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.420> tail<00:02:10.629> to<00:02:10.869> be<00:02:10.989> approximately<00:02:11.739> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
measure the tail to be approximately the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.339 
measure the tail to be approximately the
same<00:02:12.099> size<00:02:12.430> as<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.879> hook<00:02:13.060> shank<00:02:13.360> once<00:02:14.170> I've

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
same size as the hook shank once I've

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.930 
same size as the hook shank once I've
got<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.590> measurement<00:02:15.099> down<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> do<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.730> little

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
got that measurement down I do a little

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.899 
got that measurement down I do a little
hand<00:02:16.180> switch<00:02:16.540> use<00:02:17.409> my<00:02:17.590> scissors<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.099> snip<00:02:18.430> off

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
hand switch use my scissors to snip off

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.589 
hand switch use my scissors to snip off
the<00:02:18.940> excess<00:02:19.569> feather

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
the excess feather

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.140 
the excess feather
and<00:02:22.599> I'll<00:02:22.690> make<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:23.379> half<00:02:23.920> dozen<00:02:24.459> or<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:24.610> ramps

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
and I'll make a half dozen or so ramps

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.930 
and I'll make a half dozen or so ramps
on<00:02:25.269> there<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.659> enough<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.930> lock<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.440> down<00:02:26.940> so

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
on there just enough to lock it down so

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.080 
on there just enough to lock it down so
at<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:28.810> point<00:02:29.080> I'm<00:02:29.290> going<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.950> take<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.580> piece

thread forward towards the eye now I'm

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.880 
thread forward towards the eye now I'm
going<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.859> take<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.750> chenille<00:03:16.750> I'm<00:03:17.739> gonna

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
going to take that chenille I'm gonna

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.800 
going to take that chenille I'm gonna
wrap<00:03:18.099> that<00:03:18.280> forward<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.150> again<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:19.569> is<00:03:19.750> very

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
wrap that forward and again this is very

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.899 
wrap that forward and again this is very
gantu<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:20.709> you've<00:03:20.920> got<00:03:21.159> an<00:03:21.280> illusion<00:03:21.819> of

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
gantu so you've got an illusion of

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.440 
gantu so you've got an illusion of
movement<00:03:22.530> due<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.769> coloration<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.579> think

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
movement due to the coloration I think

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.180 
movement due to the coloration I think
that<00:03:25.599> sometimes<00:03:25.870> just<00:03:26.260> sitting<00:03:26.530> still<00:03:26.560> and

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
still looking like it's moving is a big

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.740
