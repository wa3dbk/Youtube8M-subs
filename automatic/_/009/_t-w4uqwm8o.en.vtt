00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Kenta: How about me and you in this rain?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.300
Kenta: Don’t tell me you’re scared of the rain?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.300
Takumi: Sure, why not?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.100
Keisuke: Hold it.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.800
Takeshi: No one can stop it now.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.200
Takumi: Itsuki, do you mind sitting in the back?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.700
Itsuki: I’m going, too?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.400
Takumi: Let’s just race down and go straight home.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.100
Takumi: I can’t go too fast in the rain, so I’ll drive normally.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.800
Kenta: I’ll widen the gap.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.000

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.500
Itsuki: Help! I’m not ready to die!

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.000
Itsuki: Stop that ringing!

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.800
Kenta: What?! The Eight-Six is on my tail.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.000
Kenta: I can’t keep up.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.300
Takeshi: The Eight-Six is even fast in the rain.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.200
Kyoichi: There are differences between a car for fun and a car for speed. I’ll clarify them for you.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.700
Keisuke: The EvoⅢ’s noisy backfire didn’t sound normal.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.500
Takumi: That firing sound is so noisy!

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.500
Kyoichi: I’ll end this shortly.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.500
Takumi: He’s fast! I can’t keep up! Can I catch up?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.200
Kyoichi: The engine is completely toasted.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.200
Kyoichi: We’ll race again when you have a machine.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.500
Takumi: My precious Eight-Six…

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.700
Bunta: Hey

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.400
Takumi: Dad!

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.400
Takumi: Dad, I…

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.400
Bunta: We’ll talk later. We’ll tow the car.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.140
My AE86 Levin
