weren't<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:41.520> project<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.329> nowhere

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
weren't the project was going nowhere

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.389 
weren't the project was going nowhere
until<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.320> enlisted<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.010> help<00:00:44.129> of

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
until they enlisted the help of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.520 
until they enlisted the help of
Rockefeller<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> Carnegie<00:00:45.480> whether<00:00:46.410> they

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
Rockefeller and Carnegie whether they

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.810 
Rockefeller and Carnegie whether they
were<00:00:46.620> running<00:00:46.770> out<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.950> money<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.370> AMA<00:00:47.670> was

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
were running out of money the AMA was

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.799 
were running out of money the AMA was
actually<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> very<00:00:48.390> impoverished

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
actually a very impoverished

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.860 
actually a very impoverished
organization<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.950> time<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
organization at that time and

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.639 
organization at that time and
Rockefeller<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.960> Carnegie<00:00:52.230> had<00:00:52.469> deep

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
Rockefeller and Carnegie had deep

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.290 
Rockefeller and Carnegie had deep
pockets<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:53.489> agreed<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.789> fund<00:00:54.120> this

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
pockets so they agreed to fund this

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
pockets so they agreed to fund this
project<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:55.140> go<00:00:55.260> ahead<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.500> rank<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
project to go ahead and rank all of the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.150 
project to go ahead and rank all of the
medical<00:00:56.460> schools<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.559> caveat<00:00:58.559> was<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.010> they

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
medical schools the caveat was that they

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.950 
medical schools the caveat was that they
could<00:00:59.340> set<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> criteria<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.539> ranking

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
could set the criteria for the ranking

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.619 
could set the criteria for the ranking
and<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:01.949> did<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.699> set<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.480> was

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and so what did they do to set what was

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
and so what did they do to set what was
their<00:01:03.780> criteria<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:05.040> determine<00:01:05.460> which

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
their criteria to determine which

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.609 
their criteria to determine which
medical<00:01:06.000> schools<00:01:06.270> were<00:01:06.810> teaching<00:01:07.260> sound

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
medical schools were teaching sound

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.160 
medical schools were teaching sound
medicine<00:01:08.130> well<00:01:08.340> Carnegie<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.360> Rockefeller

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
medicine well Carnegie and Rockefeller

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.160 
medicine well Carnegie and Rockefeller
were<00:01:10.380> tycoons<00:01:10.890> right<00:01:11.189> Carnegie<00:01:12.170> Rockefeller

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
were tycoons right Carnegie Rockefeller

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
wanted to monopolize the chemical

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.030 
wanted to monopolize the chemical
industry<00:01:19.110> which<00:01:19.530> later<00:01:19.740> became<00:01:19.979> a

industry which later became a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.399 
industry which later became a

his axiom that he lived by was

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420 
his axiom that he lived by was
competition<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> thin<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.890> Rockefeller

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
competition is the thin so Rockefeller

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.090 
competition is the thin so Rockefeller
saw<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.360> opportunity<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.259> eliminate

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
saw this as an opportunity to eliminate

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
saw this as an opportunity to eliminate
his<00:01:29.280> competition<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> chemical<00:01:30.659> industry

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
his competition in the chemical industry

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.560 
his competition in the chemical industry
and<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.290> did<00:01:31.470> Carnegie<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.030> did<00:01:33.119> they<00:01:33.180> do

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and so did Carnegie so what did they do

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.350 
and so did Carnegie so what did they do
they<00:01:33.810> heard<00:01:34.020> Abraham<00:01:34.500> Flexner<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.360> based

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
they heard Abraham Flexner and based

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.819 
they heard Abraham Flexner and based
