professor ware and myself had been

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.360 
professor ware and myself had been
writing<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.840> book<00:02:43.079> for<00:02:43.290> nearly<00:02:43.440> 30<00:02:43.709> years

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
writing this book for nearly 30 years

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.390 
writing this book for nearly 30 years
so<00:02:44.940> over<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> last<00:02:45.630> 30<00:02:45.989> years<00:02:46.170> CT<00:02:47.040> scanning

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
so over the last 30 years CT scanning

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400 
so over the last 30 years CT scanning
MRI<00:02:47.880> scanning<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.660> all<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.019> nuclear

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
MRI scanning and all the nuclear

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.890 
MRI scanning and all the nuclear
medicine<00:02:49.709> has<00:02:50.310> been<00:02:50.640> changed<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.390> measurably

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
medicine has been changed and measurably

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.319 
medicine has been changed and measurably
and<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.650> we've<00:02:52.860> seen<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.459> kept<00:02:53.670> abreast<00:02:53.970> of

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
and so we've seen and kept abreast of

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.569 
and so we've seen and kept abreast of
how<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.540> changes<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.230> ante<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.129> modern

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
how the changes of ante in modern

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.190 
how the changes of ante in modern
medicine<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.569> think<00:02:57.599> that's<00:02:57.959> what's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
medicine and I think that's what's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.750 
medicine and I think that's what's
special<00:02:58.290> about<00:02:58.680> what<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.250> other<00:02:59.430> thing

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
special about what the other thing

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.520 
special about what the other thing
that's<00:02:59.879> special<00:03:00.239> about<00:03:00.329> book<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.049> simple

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
that's special about book it is simple

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.440 
that's special about book it is simple
it<00:03:02.220> goes<00:03:02.549> through<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.030> body

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
it goes through the body

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.839 
it goes through the body
anatomically<00:03:04.260> taking<00:03:05.040> each<00:03:05.250> part<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.730> the

anatomically taking each part of the

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.350 
anatomically taking each part of the
body<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.629> have<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:07.140> instance<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:09.090> heart

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
body so we have for instance the heart

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.390 
body so we have for instance the heart
area<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.200> here<00:03:10.349> we've<00:03:10.500> got<00:03:10.650> magnificent

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
system is throughout this book so

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.089 
system is throughout this book so
literally<00:03:54.000> every<00:03:54.209> single<00:03:54.799> structure<00:03:55.799> in<00:03:55.950> the

literally every single structure in the
human<00:03:56.489> body<00:03:56.669> is<00:03:57.180> labeled<00:03:57.989> in<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.349> simple<00:03:58.799> form

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
human body is labeled in a simple form

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.690 
human body is labeled in a simple form
for<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.730> student<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.329> learn<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.780> normal

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
for the student to learn the normal

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.230 
for the student to learn the normal
radiological<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.760> active

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
radiological and active

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:11.480 
radiological and active
I<00:04:09.230> think<00:04:10.230> one<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.590> hot<00:04:10.800> trends<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.460> that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
I think one of the hot trends is that

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.590 
I think one of the hot trends is that
this<00:04:11.790> book<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.210> also<00:04:12.420> now<00:04:12.900> on<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.530> iPad<00:04:14.070> so<00:04:14.600> we

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
this book is also now on the iPad so we

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.380 
this book is also now on the iPad so we
can<00:04:15.810> see<00:04:16.080> here<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.800> we<00:04:16.950> can<00:04:17.160> go<00:04:17.190> into<00:04:17.730> the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
can see here that we can go into the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.250 
can see here that we can go into the
iPad<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.260> all<00:04:19.500> 1000<00:04:20.430> pictures<00:04:20.670> are<00:04:21.600> up<00:04:21.900> there

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
iPad and all 1000 pictures are up there

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.990 
iPad and all 1000 pictures are up there
and<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.960> can<00:04:25.200> see<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:25.710> because<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.310> iPad<00:04:26.790> is

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
and you can see that because the iPad is

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.480 
and you can see that because the iPad is
very<00:04:27.270> good<00:04:27.540> at<00:04:27.630> enlarging<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.470> moving<00:04:29.040> we<00:04:29.460> can

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
very good at enlarging of moving we can

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.090 
very good at enlarging of moving we can
put<00:04:29.850> labels<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.570> we<00:04:30.900> could<00:04:31.140> take<00:04:31.350> labels<00:04:31.830> off

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
put labels on we could take labels off

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.850 
put labels on we could take labels off
we<00:04:32.700> can<00:04:32.880> actually<00:04:33.120> take<00:04:33.810> away<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.410> labels

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
we can actually take away the labels

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.670 
we can actually take away the labels
completely<00:04:35.610> we<00:04:36.060> can<00:04:36.300> move<00:04:36.510> through<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:36.960> series

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
completely we can move through a series

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.280 
completely we can move through a series
of<00:04:37.710> scan<00:04:38.190> so<00:04:38.640> we<00:04:38.670> can<00:04:39.000> go<00:04:39.210> through<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.810> look<00:04:40.080> at

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
of scan so we can go through and look at

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.320 
of scan so we can go through and look at
the<00:04:40.350> structures<00:04:40.980> changing<00:04:41.610> as<00:04:41.760> we<00:04:41.880> go<00:04:42.060> through

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
the structures changing as we go through

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.660 
the structures changing as we go through
the<00:04:42.510> heart<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.960> chest<00:04:42.990> also<00:04:43.830> because<00:04:44.490> it's

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
the heart and chest also because it's

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.000 
the heart and chest also because it's
got<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:44.850> search<00:04:45.180> facility<00:04:45.960> any<00:04:46.380> single

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
got a search facility any single

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.830 
got a search facility any single
structure<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.580> we<00:04:47.700> want<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.030> we<00:04:48.330> can<00:04:48.480> find

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
structure that we want to we can find

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.620 
structure that we want to we can find
and<00:04:49.200> immediately<00:04:49.770> see<00:04:50.490> all<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:51.030> images<00:04:51.600> that

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
and immediately see all the images that

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.210 
and immediately see all the images that
that<00:04:51.960> particular<00:04:52.320> structure<00:04:52.920> is<00:04:53.280> on<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.740> you

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
that particular structure is on and you

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.370 
that particular structure is on and you
can<00:04:56.430> see<00:04:56.640> each<00:04:56.910> chapter<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.720> different<00:04:58.170> part

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
can see each chapter is a different part

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.410 
can see each chapter is a different part
of<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.710> body<00:04:58.980> it's<00:04:59.220> anatomically<00:04:59.970> arranged

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
of the body it's anatomically arranged

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.780 
of the body it's anatomically arranged
so<00:05:01.020> there<00:05:01.230> we<00:05:01.380> can<00:05:01.500> go<00:05:01.650> into<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.010> abdomen<00:05:02.190> and

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
so there we can go into the abdomen and

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.430 
so there we can go into the abdomen and
you<00:05:02.850> can<00:05:03.000> see<00:05:03.180> we<00:05:03.330> can<00:05:03.450> flick<00:05:03.660> through<00:05:03.690> all<00:05:04.170> the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
you can see we can flick through all the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.160 
you can see we can flick through all the
images<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.310> abdomen<00:05:05.670> we<00:05:06.180> click<00:05:06.420> on<00:05:06.600> one<00:05:06.630> up

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
images of the abdomen we click on one up

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.410 
images of the abdomen we click on one up
they<00:05:07.410> come<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.980> we<00:05:08.250> can<00:05:08.400> label<00:05:08.880> them<00:05:09.000> or<00:05:09.240> put

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
they come and we can label them or put

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.650 
they come and we can label them or put
the<00:05:09.540> labels<00:05:09.930> on<00:05:10.110> etc<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.240> a
