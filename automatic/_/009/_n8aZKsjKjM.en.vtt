now<00:00:41.880> I<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.240> some<00:00:42.450> clothes<00:00:42.780> pins<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.680> got

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
now I have some clothes pins that I got

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.590 
now I have some clothes pins that I got
from<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.160> dollar<00:00:44.370> store<00:00:44.520> you're<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.420> need

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
from a dollar store you're going to need

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
from a dollar store you're going to need
to<00:00:45.780> also<00:00:46.670> paint<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:48.000> into<00:00:48.960> green<00:00:49.920> colors

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
to also paint these into green colors

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.630 
to also paint these into green colors
and<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.780> decided<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.830> make<00:00:53.010> different<00:00:53.370> shades

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and I decided to make different shades

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.820 
and I decided to make different shades
but<00:00:54.150> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.480> stick<00:00:54.720> with<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:55.080> color<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
but you can stick with one color if you

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.970 
but you can stick with one color if you
want<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.780> make<00:00:57.780> sure<00:00:58.080> to<00:00:58.290> spread<00:00:58.590> them<00:00:58.830> out

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
want and make sure to spread them out

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.110 
want and make sure to spread them out
evenly<00:01:00.020> my<00:01:01.020> clothes<00:01:01.620> pins<00:01:01.980> were<00:01:02.370> actually<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
evenly my clothes pins were actually a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.570 
evenly my clothes pins were actually a
bit<00:01:03.480> too<00:01:03.900> close<00:01:04.199> together<00:01:04.770> so<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.339> should

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
bit too close together so you should

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.790 
bit too close together so you should
give<00:01:05.760> each<00:01:06.030> clothespin<00:01:06.690> more<00:01:06.960> space<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
give each clothespin more space if you

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.310 
give each clothespin more space if you
can<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:08.460> I'm<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.210> using<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.660> glue<00:01:09.869> gun<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
can and I'm just using the glue gun to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.700 
can and I'm just using the glue gun to
glue<00:01:10.440> down<00:01:10.760> these<00:01:11.760> clothes<00:01:12.510> pins<00:01:12.810> make<00:01:13.440> sure

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
glue down these clothes pins make sure

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.300 
glue down these clothes pins make sure
that<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.970> clips<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.200> facing<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.890> right<00:01:17.070> way

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that the clips are facing the right way

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:53.200 
that the clips are facing the right way
so<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.380> actually<00:01:19.920> hold<00:01:21.050> cards

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
pearls and red beets just to make it

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.990 
pearls and red beets just to make it
more<00:02:03.990> pretty<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.610> decorate<00:02:05.759> your

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
more pretty and you can decorate your

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.580 
more pretty and you can decorate your
wreath<00:02:06.360> however<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.080> like

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
wreath however you like

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.100 
wreath however you like
you<00:02:07.710> could<00:02:07.890> even<00:02:08.099> leave<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.640> plain<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.239> that's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you could even leave it plain and that's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.050 
you could even leave it plain and that's
basically<00:02:10.590> yet<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.160> if<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.819> hang

basically yet but if you want to hang
your<00:02:12.540> wreath<00:02:12.950> which<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.280> think<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.030> should<00:02:15.300> tie

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
your wreath which I think you should tie

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.130 
your wreath which I think you should tie
a<00:02:16.319> piece<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:17.010> ribbon<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.730> put<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.690> at<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.110> top

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
a piece of ribbon and put it at the top

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.860 
a piece of ribbon and put it at the top
of<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.130> wreath<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:21.030> will<00:02:21.209> allow<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.569> to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
of the wreath and that will allow you to

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:34.809 
of the wreath and that will allow you to
hang<00:02:22.650> up<00:02:22.920> your<00:02:23.280> wreath

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.489 

so<00:02:35.819> that's<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.359> I<00:02:36.510> hope<00:02:36.749> you<00:02:36.930> enjoyed<00:02:37.290> watching
