watts<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.270> runs<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> 12-volt<00:01:01.500> system

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
watts and it runs on a 12-volt system

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.240 
watts and it runs on a 12-volt system
now<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.120> cut<00:01:03.780> these<00:01:04.019> every<00:01:04.589> two<00:01:04.769> inches

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
now you can cut these every two inches

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.130 
now you can cut these every two inches
there's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> diode<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.180> cut<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> can

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
there's a diode you can cut so you can

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.050 
there's a diode you can cut so you can
do<00:01:07.290> custom<00:01:07.500> lengths<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.640> also<00:01:08.820> has<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
do custom lengths it also has a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.899 
do custom lengths it also has a
waterproof<00:01:09.720> jacket<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:11.369> good<00:01:11.580> outdoors

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
waterproof jacket so it's good outdoors

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.969 
waterproof jacket so it's good outdoors
of<00:01:12.060> course<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.930> when<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:13.350> cut<00:01:13.830> it

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
of course but when you actually cut it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
of course but when you actually cut it
to<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.130> custom<00:01:14.580> length<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> reseal

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
to the custom length you have to reseal

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.580 
to the custom length you have to reseal
it<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.500> regain<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> weatherproof<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.470> we

something<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.050> or<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.670> instance

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
something like that or in a instance

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.690 
something like that or in a instance
where<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.420> don't<00:02:27.510> actually<00:02:27.690> need<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.080> dim<00:02:28.380> it

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
where you don't actually need to dim it

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.090 
where you don't actually need to dim it
so<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.360> Flex<00:02:30.690> tape<00:02:30.900> single<00:02:31.260> color<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.710> lot

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
so with the Flex tape single color a lot

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.740 
so with the Flex tape single color a lot
of<00:02:32.130> people<00:02:32.250> do<00:02:32.640> want<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.270> dimming

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
of people do want to have dimming

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.080 
of people do want to have dimming
capabilities<00:02:33.950> over<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.070> tape<00:02:35.310> now<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.030> is

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
capabilities over the tape now this is

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.460 
capabilities over the tape now this is
easily<00:02:36.390> achieved<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.080> couple<00:02:37.350> different

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
easily achieved in a couple different

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.620 
easily achieved in a couple different
ways<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.610> way<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.730> have<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> set<00:02:39.180> up<00:02:39.240> right<00:02:39.480> now

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
ways the way I have it set up right now

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.950 
ways the way I have it set up right now
is<00:02:39.900> with<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.530> AL<00:02:41.250> dimmer<00:02:41.580> one<00:02:42.000> pro<00:02:42.450> from<00:02:42.870> a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
is with the AL dimmer one pro from a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.880 
is with the AL dimmer one pro from a
claim<00:02:43.230> now<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.490> single<00:02:45.150> channel

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
claim now this is a single channel

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.700 
claim now this is a single channel
dimmer<00:02:46.890> with<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.340> DMX<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.630> out<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.350> we're

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
dimmer with a DMX in and out so we're

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.850 
dimmer with a DMX in and out so we're
dimming<00:02:50.010> via<00:02:50.160> DMX<00:02:50.930> DC<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.560> power<00:02:52.710> is

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
dimming via DMX DC in so the power is

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.490 
dimming via DMX DC in so the power is
actually<00:02:53.040> going<00:02:53.370> through<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:54.660> ex<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.230> AL

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
actually going through the ex the AL

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.290 
actually going through the ex the AL
dimmer<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:56.010> then<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:56.640> have<00:02:56.790> your<00:02:56.820> load<00:02:57.120> on

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
dimmer and then you have your load on

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.050 
dimmer and then you have your load on
the<00:02:57.420> other<00:02:57.570> side<00:02:57.870> too<00:02:58.230> hot<00:02:58.470> too<00:02:58.860> cold<00:02:58.940> as<00:02:59.940> you

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the other side too hot too cold as you

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.550 
the other side too hot too cold as you
can<00:03:00.180> see<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.390> have<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.750> cool<00:03:00.930> white<00:03:01.170> set<00:03:01.440> up

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
can see I have the cool white set up

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.699 
can see I have the cool white set up
right<00:03:01.740> here<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.610> single<00:03:02.910> channel<00:03:03.270> dimmer

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
right here on a single channel dimmer

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.699 
right here on a single channel dimmer
and<00:03:04.709> we<00:03:04.860> have<00:03:05.100> full<00:03:06.020> dimming<00:03:07.020> capability

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
and we have full dimming capability

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.090 
and we have full dimming capability
right<00:03:07.860> here<00:03:08.270> now<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.330> have<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.860> Flex

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
right here now I have this on the Flex

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.449 
right here now I have this on the Flex
psu<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> right<00:03:12.540> now<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.080> since<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.709> 4000

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
psu for a right now so since it's a 4000

psu for a right now so since it's a 4000
milliamp<00:03:14.989> power<00:03:15.989> supply<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.680> only<00:03:16.860> run<00:03:17.160> one

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
milliamp power supply I can only run one

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.400 
milliamp power supply I can only run one
tape<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.450> next<00:03:18.630> I'm<00:03:18.780> going<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.989> show<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.170> how

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
tape so next I'm going to show you how

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.870 
tape so next I'm going to show you how
to<00:03:19.470> run<00:03:19.680> multiple<00:03:20.010> tapes

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.520 

so<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.210> lot<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.390> cases<00:03:27.690> people<00:03:27.990> want<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.410> do

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
so in a lot of cases people want to do

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.160 
so in a lot of cases people want to do
more<00:03:28.800> than<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.520> tape<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.570> want<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.870> do<00:03:30.990> that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
more than one tape you want to do that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.950 
more than one tape you want to do that
you<00:03:31.410> have<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.590> upgrade<00:03:31.860> your<00:03:32.250> power<00:03:32.490> supply

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
you have to upgrade your power supply

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.290 
you have to upgrade your power supply
generally<00:03:33.960> what<00:03:34.050> we<00:03:34.110> recommend<00:03:34.350> is<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.280> S<00:03:35.460> 150

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
generally what we recommend is the S 150

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.990 
generally what we recommend is the S 150
12<00:03:36.780> here<00:03:37.260> I've<00:03:37.680> got<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.070> little<00:03:38.310> wired<00:03:38.790> up

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
12 here I've got it a little wired up

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.530 
12 here I've got it a little wired up
already<00:03:39.330> but<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:40.650> guy<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.310> 150<00:03:42.120> watt<00:03:42.270> power

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
already but this guy is a 150 watt power

these are the outputs right here so here

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.450 
these are the outputs right here so here
are<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.640> inputs<00:03:53.850> for<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.630> s-1<00:03:55.020> 5012<00:03:55.620> here<00:03:56.310> you

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
are the inputs for the s-1 5012 here you

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.670 
are the inputs for the s-1 5012 here you
have<00:03:56.610> your<00:03:56.640> AC<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.080> what<00:03:58.230> powers<00:03:58.560> in

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
have your AC in this is what powers in

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.500 
have your AC in this is what powers in
the<00:03:58.710> unit<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.250> have<00:03:59.490> your<00:03:59.520> live<00:03:59.910> neutral

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
the unit so you have your live neutral

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.449 
the unit so you have your live neutral
and<00:04:00.750> ground<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.380> here<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.220> have<00:04:02.250> your

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
and ground and here you have your

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.510 
and ground and here you have your
outputs<00:04:03.360> your<00:04:03.510> DC<00:04:03.840> outputs<00:04:04.260> too<00:04:04.980> hot<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.459> too

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
outputs your DC outputs too hot and too

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.690 
outputs your DC outputs too hot and too
cold<00:04:06.450> right<00:04:07.380> here<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.860> have<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.280> indicator

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
cold right here you have the indicator

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.220 
cold right here you have the indicator
light<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.300> lets<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.570> know<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.900> unit

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
light that lets you know that the unit

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.490 
light that lets you know that the unit
is<00:04:10.380> powered<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.100> up

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.110 

so<00:04:18.500> in<00:04:18.739> some<00:04:18.949> instances<00:04:19.519> you<00:04:19.579> want<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.000> have

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
so in some instances you want to have

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.210 
so in some instances you want to have
different<00:04:20.569> control<00:04:21.109> over<00:04:21.829> different

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
different control over different

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.370 
different control over different
sections<00:04:22.639> of<00:04:22.819> your<00:04:22.850> tape<00:04:23.150> light<00:04:23.419> in<00:04:23.960> order<00:04:24.139> to

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
sections of your tape light in order to

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.170 
sections of your tape light in order to
achieve<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:24.949> basically<00:04:25.490> all<00:04:25.759> you<00:04:25.940> have<00:04:25.970> to

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
achieve this basically all you have to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.320 
achieve this basically all you have to
do<00:04:26.360> is<00:04:26.630> add<00:04:27.080> more<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.949> AL<00:04:28.280> dinner<00:04:28.550> one<00:04:28.910> pro

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
do is add more of the AL dinner one pro

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.680 
do is add more of the AL dinner one pro
so<00:04:29.960> here<00:04:30.169> I<00:04:30.199> have<00:04:30.289> to<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:32.030> dip<00:04:32.210> switches<00:04:32.330> on

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
so here I have to the dip switches on

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.990 
so here I have to the dip switches on
this<00:04:32.840> one<00:04:33.020> are<00:04:33.139> set<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.530> address<00:04:33.889> one<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.520> then

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
this one are set to address one and then

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.790 
this one are set to address one and then
the<00:04:35.120> dip<00:04:35.780> switches<00:04:35.990> on<00:04:36.319> this<00:04:36.470> one<00:04:36.650> are

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
the dip switches on this one are

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.379 
the dip switches on this one are
addressed<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.550> address<00:04:38.090> two<00:04:38.479> so<00:04:39.349> now<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.889> have

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
addressed to address two so now I have

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.480 
addressed to address two so now I have
individual<00:04:41.389> control<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:42.220> each<00:04:44.979> this<00:04:45.979> is<00:04:46.130> ideal

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
individual control of each this is ideal

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.460 
individual control of each this is ideal
if<00:04:46.669> you<00:04:46.759> have<00:04:46.910> two<00:04:47.120> sides<00:04:47.360> of<00:04:47.569> the<00:04:47.690> room<00:04:47.900> or

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
if you have two sides of the room or

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.529 
if you have two sides of the room or
maybe<00:04:48.770> two<00:04:49.099> different<00:04:49.699> rooms<00:04:50.030> that<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.419> are

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
maybe two different rooms that you are

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:51.879 
maybe two different rooms that you are
all<00:04:50.750> home<00:04:50.990> running<00:04:51.259> back<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.710> same

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
all home running back to the same

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.860 
all home running back to the same
controller<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:53.180> just<00:04:53.419> like<00:04:53.539> in<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.750> last

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
controller so just like in the last

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.560 
controller so just like in the last
configuration<00:04:54.320> we<00:04:54.860> have<00:04:54.889> Rs<00:04:55.400> 150<00:04:55.820> 12<00:04:56.270> which<00:04:56.539> is

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
configuration we have Rs 150 12 which is

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.980 
configuration we have Rs 150 12 which is
powering<00:04:57.050> both<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:58.099> our<00:04:58.460> al<00:04:58.910> Denver<00:04:59.270> one<00:04:59.570> pros

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
powering both of our al Denver one pros

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.670 
powering both of our al Denver one pros
we've<00:05:00.349> only<00:05:00.530> added<00:05:00.800> one<00:05:01.610> ailed<00:05:01.880> over<00:05:02.180> one<00:05:02.360> pro

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
we've only added one ailed over one pro

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.200 
we've only added one ailed over one pro
the<00:05:03.680> only<00:05:03.889> real<00:05:04.039> difference<00:05:04.280> is<00:05:04.699> that<00:05:04.729> now

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
the only real difference is that now

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.010 
the only real difference is that now
we're<00:05:05.960> jumping<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:07.250> DMX<00:05:08.090> from<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.479> out<00:05:08.659> on

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
we're jumping the DMX from the out on

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.060 
we're jumping the DMX from the out on
the<00:05:09.229> first<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.750> DMX<00:05:11.750> in<00:05:11.930> on<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.440> second<00:05:12.830> al

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
the first to the DMX in on the second al

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.100 
the first to the DMX in on the second al
Denver<00:05:13.430> one<00:05:13.580> pro<00:05:13.940> so<00:05:14.539> that<00:05:14.720> gives<00:05:14.900> us

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
Denver one pro so that gives us

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.180 
Denver one pro so that gives us
individual<00:05:15.770> control<00:05:16.159> of<00:05:16.460> each<00:05:17.470> now<00:05:18.470> you<00:05:19.039> can

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
individual control of each now you can

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.580 
individual control of each now you can
actually<00:05:19.430> jump<00:05:19.880> however<00:05:20.300> many<00:05:20.479> you<00:05:21.020> need<00:05:21.289> as

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
actually jump however many you need as

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.520 
actually jump however many you need as
far<00:05:21.620> as<00:05:21.830> DMX<00:05:22.310> goes<00:05:22.639> the<00:05:23.210> limitation<00:05:24.080> comes<00:05:24.349> in

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
far as DMX goes the limitation comes in

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.189 
far as DMX goes the limitation comes in
your<00:05:24.650> power<00:05:24.919> since<00:05:25.430> we<00:05:25.550> can<00:05:25.729> run<00:05:25.940> five<00:05:26.690> tapes

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
unit it has 8 outputs each one will have

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.600 
unit it has 8 outputs each one will have
its<00:06:08.690> own<00:06:08.840> address<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.590> of<00:06:10.190> course<00:06:10.219> you<00:06:10.430> have

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
its own address and of course you have

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.610 
its own address and of course you have
your<00:06:10.639> DMX<00:06:11.150> in<00:06:11.360> and<00:06:11.690> out<00:06:11.990> so<00:06:12.199> that<00:06:12.349> you<00:06:12.469> can

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
your DMX in and out so that you can

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.439 
your DMX in and out so that you can
daisy-chain<00:06:12.979> them<00:06:13.340> and<00:06:13.969> then<00:06:14.060> you<00:06:14.150> also<00:06:14.300> have

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
daisy-chain them and then you also have

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.029 
daisy-chain them and then you also have
your<00:06:14.690> dip<00:06:14.930> switches<00:06:15.199> so<00:06:15.620> that<00:06:15.650> you<00:06:15.889> can

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
your dip switches so that you can

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.200 
your dip switches so that you can
address<00:06:16.250> them

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
address them

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.320 
address them
now<00:06:17.810> this<00:06:17.990> isn't<00:06:18.199> always<00:06:18.530> the<00:06:18.710> ideal<00:06:19.250> I'm<00:06:19.940> set

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
now this isn't always the ideal I'm set

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.809 
now this isn't always the ideal I'm set
up<00:06:20.470> for<00:06:21.470> installation<00:06:22.100> sometimes<00:06:22.490> it<00:06:22.639> works

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
up for installation sometimes it works

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.420 
up for installation sometimes it works
out<00:06:23.000> great<00:06:23.210> the<00:06:23.930> issue<00:06:24.350> that<00:06:24.500> you<00:06:24.710> may<00:06:24.949> have<00:06:24.979> is

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
out great the issue that you may have is

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.730 
out great the issue that you may have is
that<00:06:25.639> every<00:06:26.300> tape<00:06:26.539> has<00:06:26.810> to<00:06:26.930> be<00:06:27.020> home<00:06:27.259> run<00:06:27.530> back

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
that every tape has to be home run back

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.520 
that every tape has to be home run back
to<00:06:27.949> this<00:06:28.160> point<00:06:28.759> now<00:06:29.509> a<00:06:29.539> lot<00:06:29.840> of<00:06:29.870> people<00:06:30.020> ask<00:06:30.319> me

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
to this point now a lot of people ask me

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.219 
to this point now a lot of people ask me
what<00:06:30.979> the<00:06:31.099> distance<00:06:31.580> is<00:06:31.789> between<00:06:32.120> the<00:06:32.990> tape

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
what the distance is between the tape

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.100 
what the distance is between the tape
and<00:06:33.500> where<00:06:33.830> has<00:06:34.039> to<00:06:34.190> be<00:06:34.250> home<00:06:34.430> ran<00:06:34.789> so<00:06:35.389> how<00:06:35.840> far

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
and where has to be home ran so how far

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.499 
and where has to be home ran so how far
can<00:06:36.319> you<00:06:36.470> go<00:06:36.500> that<00:06:37.400> is<00:06:37.580> all<00:06:37.759> dependent<00:06:38.240> on<00:06:38.360> the

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:38.509 
can you go that is all dependent on the

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.960 
can you go that is all dependent on the
gauge<00:06:38.780> cable<00:06:39.139> that<00:06:39.500> you<00:06:39.620> use<00:06:39.889> generally<00:06:40.849> with

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
gauge cable that you use generally with

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.540 
gauge cable that you use generally with
what<00:06:41.210> comes<00:06:41.539> with<00:06:41.990> here<00:06:42.169> with<00:06:42.500> this<00:06:42.710> you<00:06:43.340> can't

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
what comes with here with this you can't

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.980 
what comes with here with this you can't
really<00:06:43.759> go<00:06:43.880> incredibly<00:06:44.360> far<00:06:44.599> since<00:06:44.840> we're

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
really go incredibly far since we're

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.589 
really go incredibly far since we're
working<00:06:45.289> with<00:06:45.410> 12<00:06:45.680> volts<00:06:46.250> however<00:06:46.669> if<00:06:46.910> you<00:06:47.389> do

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 
working with 12 volts however if you do

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:49.629 
working with 12 volts however if you do
need<00:06:47.810> to<00:06:47.960> jump<00:06:48.289> them<00:06:48.440> farther<00:06:48.770> you<00:06:49.400> can

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
need to jump them farther you can

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.050 
need to jump them farther you can
essentially<00:06:50.300> make<00:06:51.490> extension<00:06:52.490> cables<00:06:52.880> with

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
essentially make extension cables with

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.570 
essentially make extension cables with
the<00:06:53.180> lower<00:06:53.360> gauge<00:06:53.750> cable<00:06:54.110> anywhere<00:06:54.620> from<00:06:54.800> 14

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
the lower gauge cable anywhere from 14

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.320 
the lower gauge cable anywhere from 14
to<00:06:55.610> 18<00:06:56.530> so<00:06:57.530> that<00:06:57.650> you<00:06:57.740> can<00:06:57.860> essentially<00:06:58.250> run<00:06:59.240> it

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
to 18 so that you can essentially run it

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.749 
to 18 so that you can essentially run it
longer<00:06:59.720> we<00:07:00.440> generally<00:07:00.830> suggest<00:07:01.250> to<00:07:01.340> give<00:07:01.490> us<00:07:01.610> a

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 
longer we generally suggest to give us a

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.070 
longer we generally suggest to give us a
call<00:07:01.940> for<00:07:02.270> that<00:07:02.389> kind<00:07:02.449> of<00:07:02.630> a<00:07:02.720> recommendation

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
call for that kind of a recommendation

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.339 
call for that kind of a recommendation
though<00:07:03.880> now<00:07:04.880> all<00:07:05.210> of<00:07:05.539> these<00:07:05.630> methods<00:07:06.169> that<00:07:06.289> I

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:06.349 
though now all of these methods that I

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:08.830 
though now all of these methods that I
have<00:07:06.560> shown<00:07:06.830> you<00:07:06.889> to<00:07:07.520> dim<00:07:07.849> the<00:07:08.120> single<00:07:08.659> color

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
have shown you to dim the single color

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.460 
have shown you to dim the single color
tape<00:07:09.169> is<00:07:09.349> using<00:07:10.099> DMX<00:07:10.820> dimming<00:07:11.419> now<00:07:11.990> in<00:07:12.199> some

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470 
tape is using DMX dimming now in some

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.469 
tape is using DMX dimming now in some
cases<00:07:12.740> you<00:07:13.039> want<00:07:13.310> to<00:07:13.490> be<00:07:13.610> able<00:07:13.699> to<00:07:13.909> use<00:07:14.150> a

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
cases you want to be able to use a

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:16.990 
cases you want to be able to use a
conventional<00:07:14.810> AC<00:07:15.380> dimmer<00:07:15.979> we<00:07:16.490> also<00:07:16.699> have<00:07:16.970> a

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 
conventional AC dimmer we also have a

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.320 
conventional AC dimmer we also have a
solution<00:07:17.330> for<00:07:17.539> that<00:07:17.750> we<00:07:18.470> do<00:07:18.710> also<00:07:18.919> have<00:07:19.330> some

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
solution for that we do also have some

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.680 
solution for that we do also have some
magnetic<00:07:21.159> DC<00:07:22.159> transformer<00:07:22.550> so<00:07:23.270> that<00:07:23.419> you<00:07:23.539> can

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:23.690 
magnetic DC transformer so that you can

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.790 
magnetic DC transformer so that you can
use<00:07:24.020> and<00:07:24.259> a<00:07:24.770> conventional<00:07:25.759> AC<00:07:25.940> dimmer<00:07:26.800> well

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
use and a conventional AC dimmer well

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.680 
use and a conventional AC dimmer well
that<00:07:28.130> just<00:07:28.250> about<00:07:28.400> does<00:07:28.699> it<00:07:28.759> for<00:07:28.909> our<00:07:29.090> single

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:29.690 
that just about does it for our single

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.689 
that just about does it for our single
