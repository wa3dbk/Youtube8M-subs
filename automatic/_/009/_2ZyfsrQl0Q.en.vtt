like live performances and the oceans
and<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:49.310> first<00:02:49.579> thing<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.120> accept<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:51.099> way

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
and the first thing is to accept the way

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.650 
and the first thing is to accept the way
that<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.400> are<00:02:52.430> accept<00:02:53.120> your<00:02:53.239> limitations

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
involves a lot of improvisation so if

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.729 
involves a lot of improvisation so if
you<00:02:59.150> don't<00:02:59.359> access<00:02:59.690> yourself<00:03:00.349> you're<00:03:00.590> always

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
you don't access yourself you're always

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
judging what you do and if you just

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.470 
judging what you do and if you just
