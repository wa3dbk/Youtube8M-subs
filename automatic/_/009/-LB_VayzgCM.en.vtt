00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
what I wanted to kind of maybe go into

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.030 
what I wanted to kind of maybe go into
actually<00:03:05.019> what<00:03:05.140> some<00:03:05.319> of<00:03:05.350> those<00:03:05.470> rules<00:03:05.769> are

actually what some of those rules are
and<00:03:06.250> I'm<00:03:06.730> going<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:06.970> go<00:03:07.030> on<00:03:07.209> memory<00:03:07.540> here<00:03:07.750> so

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
and I'm going to go on memory here so

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.270 
and I'm going to go on memory here so
I'm<00:03:08.049> sure<00:03:08.200> I'm<00:03:08.350> going<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.500> miss<00:03:08.650> part<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.100> so

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
I'm sure I'm going to miss part of it so

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.979 
I'm sure I'm going to miss part of it so
let<00:03:09.790> me<00:03:09.880> know<00:03:09.970> where<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.150> went<00:03:10.299> wrong<00:03:10.420> here<00:03:10.840> I

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
let me know where I went wrong here I

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.229 
let me know where I went wrong here I
think<00:03:11.650> one<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.100> first<00:03:12.310> rules<00:03:12.519> on<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.060> benz

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
think one of the first rules on the benz

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.750 
think one of the first rules on the benz
rule<00:03:13.450> list<00:03:13.780> was<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.590> fact<00:03:14.799> that<00:03:14.980> you

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
rule list was the fact that you

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.550 
rule list was the fact that you
shouldn't<00:03:16.360> be<00:03:16.450> able<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.690> come<00:03:16.810> on<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.530> a

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
shouldn't be able to come on to a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.430 
shouldn't be able to come on to a
racetrack<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:19.060> practice<00:03:19.570> without<00:03:19.989> a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
racetrack and I practice without a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.490 
racetrack and I practice without a
parent<00:03:20.920> or<00:03:21.070> guardian<00:03:21.489> present<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.470> also<00:03:23.470> I

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
parent or guardian present and also I

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.930 
parent or guardian present and also I
think<00:03:23.650> one<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.130> rules<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.609> read<00:03:24.820> about

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
think one of the rules that I read about

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.630 
think one of the rules that I read about
and<00:03:25.209> there<00:03:25.329> also<00:03:25.540> was<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.350> fact<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.739> that

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
and there also was the fact that that

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.180 
and there also was the fact that that
not<00:03:27.850> only<00:03:27.970> does<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:29.410> parent<00:03:29.709> or<00:03:29.799> guardian

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
not only does the the parent or guardian

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.920 
not only does the the parent or guardian
need<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.640> be<00:03:30.760> present<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.540> parent<00:03:31.870> or

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
need to be present but that parent or

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.300 
need to be present but that parent or
guardian<00:03:32.290> can't<00:03:32.530> just<00:03:32.709> come<00:03:32.859> up<00:03:32.950> here<00:03:33.190> and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
guardian can't just come up here and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.130 
guardian can't just come up here and
sign<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.700> kid<00:03:33.910> up<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.269> drop<00:03:34.450> him<00:03:34.630> off<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:34.989> is

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
done to the track here it looks like it

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.180 
done to the track here it looks like it
shows<00:03:46.660> some<00:03:46.840> similarities<00:03:47.440> some

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
shows some similarities some

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.550 
shows some similarities some
similarities<00:03:48.880> excuse<00:03:49.209> me<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.810> what<00:03:50.320> NASCAR

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
similarities excuse me to what NASCAR

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.310 
similarities excuse me to what NASCAR
does<00:03:51.010> in<00:03:51.220> essence<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:51.790> that's<00:03:51.940> basically

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
does in essence and that's basically

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.720 
does in essence and that's basically
I've<00:03:53.320> noticed<00:03:53.620> throughout<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.250> track<00:03:54.489> we

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
I've noticed throughout the track we

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.720 
I've noticed throughout the track we
basically<00:03:54.970> have<00:03:55.350> yellow<00:03:56.350> lights<00:03:56.620> that<00:03:57.070> that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
basically have yellow lights that that

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.920 
basically have yellow lights that that
can<00:03:57.910> be<00:03:58.000> turned<00:03:58.209> on<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.540> from<00:03:58.810> what<00:03:58.900> I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
can be turned on and from what I

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.300 
can be turned on and from what I
understand<00:03:59.350> they<00:03:59.470> can<00:03:59.620> be<00:03:59.709> turned<00:03:59.920> on<00:04:00.100> from

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
understand they can be turned on from

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.430 
understand they can be turned on from
several<00:04:00.730> different<00:04:00.819> locations<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:02.140> track

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
several different locations of the track

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.120 
several different locations of the track
so<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.930> looks<00:04:05.140> like<00:04:05.200> it's<00:04:05.530> it's<00:04:05.739> it's<00:04:06.040> a

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
so it it looks like it's it's it's a

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.160 
so it it looks like it's it's it's a
good<00:04:06.340> thing<00:04:06.609> obviously<00:04:06.940> because<00:04:07.630> we<00:04:07.810> need<00:04:07.989> to

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
good thing obviously because we need to

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.009 
good thing obviously because we need to
know<00:04:08.670> motocross<00:04:09.670> has<00:04:09.910> changed<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.329> lot<00:04:10.480> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
know motocross has changed a lot the

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.780 
know motocross has changed a lot the
jumps<00:04:11.530> are<00:04:11.620> bigger<00:04:11.829> back<00:04:12.220> in<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:12.700> eyes

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
jumps are bigger back in you and eyes

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
yellow and red lights just to make sure

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.260 
yellow and red lights just to make sure
that<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.140> writers<00:04:37.560> are<00:04:37.890> seeing<00:04:38.160> them<00:04:38.370> okay

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
that the writers are seeing them okay

on<00:04:43.710> this<00:04:43.830> track<00:04:44.130> now<00:04:44.310> Ben<00:04:44.490> we<00:04:44.640> talked<00:04:44.850> earlier

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
on this track now Ben we talked earlier

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.430 
on this track now Ben we talked earlier
we<00:04:45.270> have<00:04:45.450> pretty<00:04:45.660> much<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.990> standard<00:04:46.170> issue

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
we have pretty much the standard issue

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.200 
we have pretty much the standard issue
caution<00:04:46.980> light<00:04:47.130> like<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.430> would<00:04:47.550> see<00:04:47.760> on<00:04:47.910> a

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
caution light like you would see on a

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.150 
caution light like you would see on a
traffic<00:04:48.570> light<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:49.560> we<00:04:49.710> were<00:04:49.830> talking<00:04:50.100> about

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
traffic light and we were talking about

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.980 
traffic light and we were talking about
maybe<00:04:50.280> enhancing<00:04:51.000> that<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.360> generate<00:04:51.960> a

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
maybe enhancing that to generate a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.020 
maybe enhancing that to generate a
little<00:04:52.140> bit<00:04:52.230> more<00:04:52.350> visibility<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:53.880> is

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
little bit more visibility so this is

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.330 
little bit more visibility so this is
what<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.330> guys<00:04:54.450> have<00:04:54.660> come<00:04:54.810> up<00:04:54.840> with<00:04:55.140> how<00:04:56.130> is

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
what you guys have come up with how is

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.560 
what you guys have come up with how is
this<00:04:56.460> good<00:04:56.670> as<00:04:56.760> it's<00:04:56.880> going<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.030> be<00:04:57.150> powered

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
this good as it's going to be powered

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.810 
this good as it's going to be powered
off<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.840> existing<00:04:58.350> current<00:04:58.860> or<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.430> this<00:04:59.580> how

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
off the existing current or is this how

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.550 
off the existing current or is this how
we<00:05:00.270> going<00:05:00.420> to<00:05:00.480> work<00:05:00.540> these<00:05:00.720> you'll<00:05:01.110> be<00:05:01.230> powered

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
we going to work these you'll be powered

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.590 
we going to work these you'll be powered
off<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.830> same<00:05:02.040> current<00:05:02.460> we're<00:05:03.210> going<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.480> put

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
off the same current we're going to put

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.920 
off the same current we're going to put
this<00:05:03.950> strobe<00:05:05.090> above<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.240> red<00:05:06.420> in<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.750> yellow

this strobe above the red in the yellow

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.410 
this strobe above the red in the yellow
light<00:05:07.230> just<00:05:07.860> for<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.610> get<00:05:08.790> your<00:05:08.940> attempt<00:05:09.270> and

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
we're also going to put a sound device

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.990 
we're also going to put a sound device
that<00:05:16.410> will<00:05:16.500> make<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.710> loud<00:05:17.340> enough<00:05:17.640> sound

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
that will make a loud enough sound

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.700 
that will make a loud enough sound
they'll<00:05:18.270> get<00:05:18.480> your<00:05:18.600> attention<00:05:18.750> right<00:05:19.260> we're

they'll get your attention right we're
going<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.950> try<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.160> get<00:05:20.370> this<00:05:20.580> light<00:05:21.300> turned<00:05:21.930> on

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
going to try to get this light turned on

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.350 
going to try to get this light turned on
within<00:05:22.500> five<00:05:23.010> seconds<00:05:23.550> of<00:05:23.700> somebody<00:05:24.060> going

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
within five seconds of somebody going

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.020 
within five seconds of somebody going
down<00:05:24.570> so<00:05:25.200> I<00:05:25.230> guess<00:05:25.380> when<00:05:26.100> my<00:05:26.280> head<00:05:26.490> flagman

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
down so I guess when my head flagman

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.720 
down so I guess when my head flagman
puts<00:05:27.450> a<00:05:27.510> Black<00:05:27.690> Flag<00:05:27.870> out<00:05:28.170> the<00:05:29.130> excuse<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.610> I

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
puts a Black Flag out the excuse of I

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.190 
puts a Black Flag out the excuse of I
