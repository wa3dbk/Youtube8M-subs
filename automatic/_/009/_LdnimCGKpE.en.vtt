we're<00:00:24.330> taking<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.600> look<00:00:24.689> at<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> SMR<00:00:25.680> or<00:00:26.010> an

we're taking a look at the SMR or an
alternative<00:00:27.090> would<00:00:27.210> be<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.630> FAL<00:00:28.140> they're

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
alternative would be the FAL they're

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.849 
alternative would be the FAL they're
both<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.460> semi<00:00:29.820> shot<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:31.529> thing<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.830> I

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
both the semi shot and the thing that I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.260 
both the semi shot and the thing that I
want<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> focus<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.850> video

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
want to focus on in this video

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.080 
want to focus on in this video
particularly<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.190> select<00:00:35.910> fire

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
particularly is the select fire

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.479 
particularly is the select fire
attachment<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.649> allows<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> set<00:00:38.399> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
attachment and that allows you to set it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
attachment and that allows you to set it
to<00:00:38.579> full<00:00:38.820> auto<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:40.110> really<00:00:40.350> makes<00:00:40.590> these

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
to full auto and it really makes these

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.860 
to full auto and it really makes these
guns<00:00:41.010> quite<00:00:41.670> fun<00:00:42.629> quite<00:00:43.050> awesome<00:00:44.010> quite

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
guns quite fun quite awesome quite

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.700 
guns quite fun quite awesome quite
amazing<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.020> don't<00:00:46.200> even<00:00:46.289> know<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.620> say

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
amazing I don't even know what to say

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.709 
amazing I don't even know what to say
about<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.190> they're<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.910> don't<00:00:48.539> know

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
about it they're just I don't know

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.389 
about it they're just I don't know
really<00:00:48.930> powerful<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.890> don't<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.219> worry

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
really powerful you don't have to worry

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.920 
really powerful you don't have to worry
about<00:00:50.550> constant<00:00:51.090> pressure<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> trigger<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
about constant pressure on the trigger I

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
about constant pressure on the trigger I
think<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> rate<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> fire<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.460> full<00:00:53.850> auto<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
think the rate of fire on full auto is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.910 
think the rate of fire on full auto is
just<00:00:54.899> shy<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.469> could<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.890> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
just shy of what you could do if you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.529 
just shy of what you could do if you
were<00:00:56.100> pushing<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> trigger<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.030> quickly<00:00:57.329> as

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
were pushing the trigger as quickly as

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.080 
were pushing the trigger as quickly as
you<00:00:57.629> possibly<00:00:57.660> good<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.460> act<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.850> pulling

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you possibly good but the act of pulling

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.970 
you possibly good but the act of pulling
the<00:01:00.390> trigger<00:01:00.570> would<00:01:00.960> screw<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.800> aim

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the trigger would screw up your aim

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.500 
the trigger would screw up your aim
whether<00:01:02.609> you're<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.030> 360<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:03.930> ps3<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.710> pc<00:01:05.040> or

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
whether you're on a 360 or ps3 or pc or

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
whether you're on a 360 or ps3 or pc or
eventually<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> feeling

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
eventually the way you I have a feeling

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.100 
eventually the way you I have a feeling
that<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.150> effort<00:01:09.510> required<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that you know the effort required to

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.950 
that you know the effort required to
pull<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> trigger<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.860> fast<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.820> could<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
pull a trigger as fast as you could to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.170 
pull a trigger as fast as you could to
get<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> faster<00:01:13.560> than<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.830> full<00:01:14.100> auto<00:01:14.280> would

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
get it faster than this full auto would

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.170 
get it faster than this full auto would
subtract<00:01:15.720> from<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> accuracy<00:01:16.909> but<00:01:17.909> anyway

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
subtract from the accuracy but anyway

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
routes to the point more so than it

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.879 
routes to the point more so than it
would<00:03:43.910> be<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.090> take<00:03:44.389> a<00:03:44.419> point<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.139> keep<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.739> in

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
would be to take a point so keep that in
