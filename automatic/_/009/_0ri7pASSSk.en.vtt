to<00:04:43.679> your<00:04:43.889> PSP<00:04:44.489> emulator<00:04:45.709> if<00:04:46.709> you<00:04:46.949> don't<00:04:47.129> have

00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:47.309

want the free version and I have the
gold<00:04:53.219> version<00:04:54.439> so<00:04:55.439> it<00:04:56.479> doesn't<00:04:57.479> really<00:04:57.569> matter

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:58.519 
gold version so it doesn't really matter

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:04.359 
gold version so it doesn't really matter
doesn't<00:04:59.519> actually<00:04:59.819> affect<00:05:00.119> the<00:05:00.449> game<00:05:02.149> so

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:04.369 
doesn't actually affect the game so

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:08.299 
doesn't actually affect the game so
