have the mini version of that VW van up
there<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> air<00:00:32.700> side

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
there and then I have on the air side

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.569 
there and then I have on the air side
this<00:00:33.090> Ferrari<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:35.070> car<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> actually

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
this Ferrari and this car I actually

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
this Ferrari and this car I actually
built<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.420> while<00:00:36.630> back<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.350> did<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
built it a while back I think I did a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.139 
built it a while back I think I did a
video<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.579> was<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:38.879> different

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
video on it it was a little different

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.900 
video on it it was a little different
then<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.260> did<00:00:40.710> tweak<00:00:41.070> some<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> colors

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
then now I did tweak some of the colors

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.330 
then now I did tweak some of the colors
to<00:00:42.239> try<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> colors<00:00:43.739> more<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.100> line

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
to try to get the colors more in line

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.720 
to try to get the colors more in line
with<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> larger<00:00:45.149> Ferrari<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.430> think<00:00:47.640> it

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
with the larger Ferrari and I think it

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.369 
with the larger Ferrari and I think it
looks<00:00:47.879> pretty<00:00:48.270> good<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.660> mean<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.050> hard<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
looks pretty good I mean it's hard to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.970 
looks pretty good I mean it's hard to
get<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> same<00:00:51.780> scale<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.770> did

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
get that to the same scale and I did

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.060 
get that to the same scale and I did
take<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.489> sticker<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.449> smaller<00:00:55.289> race

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
take the sticker off of the smaller race

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
take the sticker off of the smaller race
car<00:00:56.340> version<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.649> car<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.090> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
car version of this and this car is the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.139 
car version of this and this car is the
basic<00:01:00.750> build<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.379> comes<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> F<00:01:02.820> back

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
basic build of it comes I got the F back

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.170 
basic build of it comes I got the F back
there<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.510> yellow<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.320> Ferrari<00:01:04.939> but<00:01:05.939> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
there in yellow for the Ferrari but this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
there in yellow for the Ferrari but this
there's<00:01:06.750> another<00:01:06.840> youtuber<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:08.100> it's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
there's another youtuber I think it's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.179 
there's another youtuber I think it's
like<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.729> brick<00:01:09.030> lab<00:01:09.330> I'll<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
like the brick lab I'll put it in the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.240 
like the brick lab I'll put it in the
description<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.880> he<00:01:12.000> did<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> tutorial<00:01:12.720> on

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
description and he did a tutorial on

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.539 
description and he did a tutorial on
kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.430> car<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.549> roughly

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
kind of a car like this and roughly

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
kind of a car like this and roughly
based<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.479> that's<00:01:18.600> where<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> built

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
based like this and that's where I built

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.039 
based like this and that's where I built
most<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.580> same<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.840> one

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
most of this the same with like this one

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.710 
most of this the same with like this one
here<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:23.130> guys<00:01:23.310> probably<00:01:24.030> saw<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.360> one

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
here you guys probably saw that one

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.800 
here you guys probably saw that one
before<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.380> white<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.509> did<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
before the white and I just did the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.410 
before the white and I just did the
white<00:01:27.990> down<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> middle<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.329> obviously<00:01:30.329> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
white down in the middle and obviously I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
white down in the middle and obviously I
tweaked<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.170> bit<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:32.400> not

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
tweaked it a little bit it's not

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
tweaked it a little bit it's not
identical<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:33.720> he<00:01:33.869> did<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.110> his<00:01:34.320> video

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
identical to what he did in his video

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.010 
identical to what he did in his video
but<00:01:35.400> I'll<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.240> car<00:01:36.479> thing<00:01:36.780> watch

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
but I'll put that in the car thing watch

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.350 
but I'll put that in the car thing watch
this<00:01:37.320> tutorial<00:01:37.799> video<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.000> basically

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that's basically it means it's just

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.789 
that's basically it means it's just
black<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.380> tear<00:01:53.210> just<00:01:54.210> had<00:01:55.140> myself<00:01:55.350> take<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
black and tear just had myself take a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.330 
black and tear just had myself take a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
dive there and you know like I said it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
dive there and you know like I said it's
hard<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.659> gonna<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.960> hard<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
hard to get you it's gonna be hard to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
hard to get you it's gonna be hard to
get<00:02:01.380> these<00:02:01.560> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.979> nice<00:02:02.670> angles<00:02:03.180> at<00:02:03.329> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
get these kind of nice angles at this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.709 
get these kind of nice angles at this
scale<00:02:04.700> well<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.729> think<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.299> looks<00:02:06.450> pretty

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
scale well I think that looks pretty

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960 
scale well I think that looks pretty
good<00:02:06.810> from<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.799> distance<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> looks<00:02:08.670> right<00:02:08.910> on

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
good from a distance that looks right on
