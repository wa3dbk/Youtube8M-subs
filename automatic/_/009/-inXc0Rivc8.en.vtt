00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.300 
that you want the next step is just to
remove<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.840> paper<00:01:51.049> off<00:01:51.439> of<00:01:51.470> each<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.159> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
remove the paper off of each of the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.730 
remove the paper off of each of the
crayons<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.270> once<00:01:53.479> you've<00:01:53.659> done<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:54.470> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
crayons so once you've done that to the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.039 
crayons so once you've done that to the
peons<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.640> can<00:01:55.820> break<00:01:56.030> them<00:01:56.240> into<00:01:56.420> pieces<00:01:56.689> and

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
peons you can break them into pieces and

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.140 
peons you can break them into pieces and
put<00:01:57.200> them<00:01:57.229> in<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.680> glass<00:01:57.890> bowl<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.490> then<00:01:58.970> the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
put them in the glass bowl and then the

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.569 
put them in the glass bowl and then the
next<00:01:59.420> step<00:01:59.630> would<00:01:59.900> be<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.380> fill<00:02:00.619> up<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:01.040> pot<00:02:01.310> of

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
next step would be to fill up a pot of

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.120 
next step would be to fill up a pot of
water<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.630> then<00:02:02.780> put<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.140> on<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.530> stove<00:02:03.799> on<00:02:04.040> a

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
water and then put it on the stove on a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.580 
water and then put it on the stove on a
low<00:02:04.610> heat<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:05.240> once<00:02:05.750> you've<00:02:05.990> done<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:06.259> you

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
low heat and once you've done that you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.560 
low heat and once you've done that you
can<00:02:06.740> take<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.250> glass<00:02:07.640> bowl<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.000> place<00:02:08.299> it

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
can take the glass bowl and place it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.810 
can take the glass bowl and place it
into<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.929> pot<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.350> water<00:02:09.590> now<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.250> next<00:02:10.610> step

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
into the pot of water now the next step

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.970 
into the pot of water now the next step
is<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.390> coconut<00:02:11.780> oil<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.530> can<00:02:12.799> add

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980
