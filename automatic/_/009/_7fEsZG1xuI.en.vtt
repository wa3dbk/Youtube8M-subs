when<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.520> see<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> board<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.649> a<00:01:10.950> little

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
when you see the board so be a little

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.300 
when you see the board so be a little
bit<00:01:14.840> common<00:01:15.840> mistakes<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> kickflip<00:01:16.920> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
bit common mistakes of the kickflip is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.010 
bit common mistakes of the kickflip is
how<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> actually<00:01:17.729> control<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.240> board<00:01:18.570> in

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
how to actually control your board in

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:29.020 
how to actually control your board in
other<00:01:19.140> words<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.440> yo-yo<00:01:19.710> foot<00:01:19.920> too<00:01:20.100> far<00:01:20.130> up

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.150 

basic<00:01:30.030> stop<00:01:30.660> this<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.440> a<00:01:31.470> good<00:01:31.679> balance<00:01:32.039> of

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
basic stop this so a good balance of

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.130 
basic stop this so a good balance of
your<00:01:32.250> front<00:01:32.520> foot<00:01:32.580> have<00:01:33.330> it<00:01:33.420> about<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> bottom

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
your front foot have it about the bottom

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.169 
your front foot have it about the bottom
bolt<00:01:34.289> there<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.940> have<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
bolt there that's what I like to have it

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.809 
bolt there that's what I like to have it
at<00:01:36.330> diagonal<00:01:36.810> angle<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:38.160> with<00:01:38.700> your

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
at diagonal angle and then with your

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.160 
at diagonal angle and then with your
back<00:01:39.000> foot<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.539> want<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.929> it<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
back foot you want to have it at the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.529 
back foot you want to have it at the
opposite<00:01:40.590> side<00:01:40.649> so<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.789> boards<00:01:42.030> bouncing

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
opposite side so your boards bouncing

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.290 
opposite side so your boards bouncing
out<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:43.709> have<00:01:44.009> kind<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.090> keep

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
out and then have kind of like just keep

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.440 
out and then have kind of like just keep
balanced<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.679> it's<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.459> back<00:01:48.209> foot

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
balanced so it's like this back foot

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.050 
balanced so it's like this back foot
their<00:01:48.660> front<00:01:49.140> foot<00:01:49.319> there<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:50.310> you'll<00:01:50.910> get<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
their front foot there then you'll get a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.469 
their front foot there then you'll get a
nice<00:01:51.179> kickflip<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> another<00:01:56.880> mistake<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
nice kickflip so another mistake with a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.350 
nice kickflip so another mistake with a
kickflip<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.789> actually<00:01:59.789> getting<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.030> steps

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
kickflip is actually getting the steps

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.300 
kickflip is actually getting the steps
wrong<00:02:00.740> basically<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.830> pork

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
wrong basically you pork

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.120 
wrong basically you pork
you<00:02:03.060> don't<00:02:03.240> instantly<00:02:03.750> flick<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.349> because

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
you don't instantly flick out because

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.300 
you don't instantly flick out because
it's<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.819> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> go

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.280 

so<00:02:09.310> basically<00:02:09.850> that's<00:02:10.690> what<00:02:10.990> most<00:02:11.200> people

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
so basically that's what most people

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.550 
so basically that's what most people
miss<00:02:11.680> out<00:02:11.890> need<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.910> pop<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:14.230> not<00:02:14.350> one

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
miss out need to pop up it's not one

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.190 
miss out need to pop up it's not one
simple<00:02:14.950> motion<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:15.790> most<00:02:16.030> people<00:02:16.420> say<00:02:16.660> it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
simple motion like most people say it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.990 
simple motion like most people say it
doesn't<00:02:17.500> actually<00:02:17.620> like<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.490> got<00:02:18.640> up<00:02:18.850> a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
doesn't actually like that you got up a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.720 
doesn't actually like that you got up a
bit<00:02:19.180> then<00:02:19.840> slide<00:02:20.319> out<00:02:20.470> with<00:02:20.590> your<00:02:20.680> ankle<00:02:21.100> no

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
bit then slide out with your ankle no

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.699 
bit then slide out with your ankle no
membrane<00:02:22.270> your<00:02:22.420> most<00:02:22.600> important<00:02:23.080> bit<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.500> your

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
membrane your most important bit is your

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.160 
membrane your most important bit is your
ankle<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.880> kind<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.180> like<00:02:25.360> swishing<00:02:26.050> out

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
ankle just kind of like swishing out

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.650 
ankle just kind of like swishing out
it's<00:02:26.590> just<00:02:26.920> yeah<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.730> kind<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.420> over

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
it's just yeah you kind of get it over

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.270 
it's just yeah you kind of get it over
time<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.440> it's<00:02:29.530> basically<00:02:29.770> just<00:02:29.890> timing

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
time so it's basically just timing

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.610 
time so it's basically just timing
practice<00:02:30.820> into<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.240> kickflip<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:32.410> then<00:02:32.500> you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
practice into the kickflip and then you

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.410 
practice into the kickflip and then you
eventually<00:02:32.890> land<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.910> progress<00:02:34.060> on

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.580
