00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
 it is a sad story that we tell you the story with in the center 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.490
 still a poor animal perhaps these sad images would be enough for 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.370
 tell everything what can be said in front of a little dog 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.520
 who is about to die 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.789
 a shawl yacht that still lives 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.470
 they had chosen him as a garbage dump tombon 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.189
 but here's what happened 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.050
 This viewer reports to our report in the late morning today 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 the presence of a little dog inside the bins full of garbage 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.499
 dicondra from daniela 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.820
 signaling that the intervening urban police are also being addressed 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.130
 that bring the animal into the municipal car park and then into a clinic 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.699
 veterinary at belpasso illetta ignorino will die soon after for he was not there 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.309
 nothing to do remains only one and generous attempt to save it missing one 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.970
 someone's attempt to get rid of him in a way that is not normal 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.440
 but we hear the keeper of the municipal car park in Abano 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.220
 preview of the cost of the fleet the turn of the traffic wardens to bring this 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.020
 doggie 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.760
 be is you are colleagues and have brought this fourth place with calculate 1 1 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.520
 chart 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.420
 eh already I saw that this dog is the poor I do not think he makes it 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.460
 it is surely the owner saw that there was dying and threw it pendo 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.100
 this garbage bins 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.950
 which is not right also because an animal that I respect say with one 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.150
 human person 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.369
 video l 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.079
 to me the animals make me tenderness I am sorry for them I don't think that makes it 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.930
 also that he is a veterinarian 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.780
 already it is a bite that is dying or his poor another 10 minutes of life a dead person 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.270
 of oridine damosso 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.410
 now we hope that colleagues come or maybe I love the vet on not 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.330
 believe that he does it I hope this will help because 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.250
 the animal we look for animal cn my paper i love animals i'm sorry about 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.400
 all this debates have told me to stay here a bit aspect of Wednesday 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.510
 and then I know 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.130
 as mentioned the little dog died in the clinic 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 a death perhaps inevitable for this someone got rid of him 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.649
 concerteza what we know and that a death like that could be avoided 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.700
 sad and melancholy and uncivilized it was the case to throw a little dog 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.450
 still alive among heaps of rubbish in a house I put a little dog in it and don't throw it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.400
 let alone even a dying man let alone imagine if he still breathes what is done in these cases 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.389
 surely you do not do what was done in the garbage you throw the 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.799
 junk the last breaths of this little dog 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.989
 we seem to remember something animals are men to us
