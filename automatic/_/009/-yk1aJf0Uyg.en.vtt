so here I just wrapped it and I did a

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.000 
so here I just wrapped it and I did a
little<00:03:32.730> loop<00:03:33.440> like<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.640> um<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.590> I'll<00:03:37.770> show

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
little loop like that um and I'll show

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:57.209 
little loop like that um and I'll show
you<00:03:38.040> another<00:03:38.280> way<00:03:38.430> right<00:03:38.790> now

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
you can do it in a loop like this or you

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.750 
you can do it in a loop like this or you
could<00:04:07.400> tie<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.700> little<00:04:08.120> bow<00:04:09.370> or<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.549> could<00:04:10.730> just

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
tied it in a loop and then through the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.529 
tied it in a loop and then through the
loop<00:04:38.150> i<00:04:38.330> pull<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.660> ends<00:04:39.229> in<00:04:40.130> through<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:42.130> okay

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
it and then you know loop it through you

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.930 
it and then you know loop it through you
can<00:05:46.659> put<00:05:46.840> it<00:05:46.960> as<00:05:47.080> your<00:05:47.110> on<00:05:47.740> ahead<00:05:48.280> of<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.699> head

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
can put it as your on ahead of the head

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.990 
can put it as your on ahead of the head
wrap<00:05:49.289> you<00:05:50.289> can<00:05:50.470> do<00:05:50.620> all<00:05:50.650> kinds<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:51.430> things<00:05:51.490> with
