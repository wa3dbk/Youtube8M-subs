00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
all you do is you hang your net over the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.910 
all you do is you hang your net over the
bridge<00:00:39.239> now<00:00:40.239> what<00:00:40.390> you<00:00:40.510> try<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:40.930> get<00:00:41.170> over<00:00:41.200> here

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.910 

alright<00:00:44.920> so<00:00:45.190> what<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:45.370> hold<00:00:45.900> you<00:00:46.900> hold<00:00:47.110> the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
alright so what you hold you hold the

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.390 
alright so what you hold you hold the
horn<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.550> net<00:00:48.820> in<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.480> right<00:00:49.660> hand<00:00:49.930> okay

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
horn of the net in the right hand okay

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.369 
horn of the net in the right hand okay
now<00:00:51.400> all<00:00:51.550> you're<00:00:51.730> going<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:51.910> do<00:00:52.090> is<00:00:52.329> spin<00:00:52.660> it<00:00:52.690> as

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
now all you're going to do is spin it as

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.030 
now all you're going to do is spin it as
fast<00:00:53.739> as<00:00:53.980> you<00:00:54.040> can<00:00:54.430> with<00:00:55.120> wide<00:00:55.420> terms<00:00:56.040> and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
fast as you can with wide terms and

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.310 
fast as you can with wide terms and
right<00:00:57.309> as<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.640> net<00:00:57.820> starts<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.269> open<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:59.050> pop

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
right as the net starts to open you pop

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.369 
right as the net starts to open you pop
it<00:00:59.500> up<00:00:59.650> and<00:00:59.830> it<00:01:00.280> opens<00:01:00.900> so<00:01:01.900> let's<00:01:02.050> give<00:01:02.230> it<00:01:02.260> a

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
it up and it opens so let's give it a

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:11.670 
it up and it opens so let's give it a
try<00:01:02.500> say<00:01:02.800> we<00:01:02.920> can't<00:01:03.160> get<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.370> open

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:21.529 

turns<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.290> open<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.760> I<00:01:15.850> top<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.120> up

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.770 

you<00:01:22.539> just<00:01:22.750> let<00:01:22.899> it<00:01:22.930> sink<00:01:23.289> now<00:01:24.600> you're<00:01:25.600> going<00:01:25.719> to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
you just let it sink now you're going to

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.350 
you just let it sink now you're going to
get<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:25.930> good<00:01:26.140> workout<00:01:26.649> in<00:01:26.710> doing<00:01:27.220> that<00:01:27.399> but

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
get a good workout in doing that but

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.480 
get a good workout in doing that but
it's<00:01:29.229> a<00:01:29.259> lot<00:01:29.409> easier<00:01:29.740> than<00:01:29.890> trying<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.280> force

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
it's a lot easier than trying to force

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.590 
it's a lot easier than trying to force
the<00:01:30.729> net<00:01:30.909> throw<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.470> since<00:01:32.470> you're<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:32.710> high<00:01:32.860> up

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the net throw it since you're so high up

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.609 
the net throw it since you're so high up
oftentimes<00:01:34.600> when<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.840> try<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.049> throw<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.350> when

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
oftentimes when you try to throw it when

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.950 
oftentimes when you try to throw it when
you're<00:01:35.740> this<00:01:35.860> far<00:01:36.070> up<00:01:36.450> people<00:01:37.450> find<00:01:37.689> that<00:01:37.810> it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
you're this far up people find that it

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.260 
you're this far up people find that it
closes<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:39.130> net<00:01:39.340> closes<00:01:39.819> because<00:01:39.939> they<00:01:40.119> don't

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
closes the net closes because they don't

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.630 
closes the net closes because they don't
have<00:01:40.329> a<00:01:40.450> whole<00:01:40.630> lot<00:01:40.659> of<00:01:40.869> rope<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:42.340> starts

have a whole lot of rope and it starts

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.160 
have a whole lot of rope and it starts
to<00:01:42.729> close<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.210> net<00:01:43.420> before<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.899> hits<00:01:44.079> the

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
to close the net before it hits the

to close the net before it hits the
water
