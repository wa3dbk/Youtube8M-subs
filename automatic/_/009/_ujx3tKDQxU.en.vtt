00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and if it did not work it just tries a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.779 
and if it did not work it just tries a
new<00:00:55.230> signal<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> second<00:00:56.219> time<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.550> worked

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
but overall the Wii U's saying very very

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.539 
but overall the Wii U's saying very very
successful<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.740> far<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.130> pretty<00:01:35.340> nice<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
successful so far it's pretty nice so

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.690 
successful so far it's pretty nice so
far<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.509> came<00:01:36.810> out<00:01:36.930> today<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
far I just came out today so this how I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
far I just came out today so this how I
was<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> little<00:01:39.270> iffy<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.770> know

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
was a little iffy on it but you know

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
was a little iffy on it but you know
it's<00:01:41.040> proving<00:01:41.490> them<00:01:41.579> very<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:41.939> right<00:01:42.180> now

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it's proving them very well right now

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.260 
it's proving them very well right now
I<00:01:42.619> assume<00:01:43.619> test<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.850> pretty<00:01:45.060> sure<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
I assume test it and I'm pretty sure I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.139 
I assume test it and I'm pretty sure I
show<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:45.990> actually<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.149> didn't

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
show it right here actually I didn't

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
show it right here actually I didn't
want<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> live<00:01:48.509> narrate<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.470> my

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
want to live narrate this because my

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.359 
want to live narrate this because my
webcam<00:01:50.130> mic<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.610> pretty<00:01:51.240> crappy<00:01:51.630> compared<00:01:52.369> but

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
webcam mic is pretty crappy compared but

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.569 
webcam mic is pretty crappy compared but
it<00:01:53.640> ends<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.030> working<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.600> hit<00:01:54.780> input<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.579> input

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
it ends up working I hit input and input

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.950 
it ends up working I hit input and input
basically<00:01:57.329> what<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.540> means<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.930> just

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
basically what it means is just

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530 
basically what it means is just
basically<00:01:58.530> turning<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> channel<00:01:59.369> so<00:02:00.119> after<00:02:00.479> I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
basically turning the channel so after I

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.910 
basically turning the channel so after I
get<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> words<00:02:01.350> before<00:02:01.710> all<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
get it all the words before all the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.139 
get it all the words before all the
steps<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.399> here's<00:02:02.790> where<00:02:02.969> I'm<00:02:03.060> actually

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
steps and here's where I'm actually

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.540 
steps and here's where I'm actually
gonna<00:02:03.420> show<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> working

and<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:37.230> channel<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.770> changed<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.790> but

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
and the channel I changed it to it but

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.880

the<00:02:39.060> input<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.930> channel<00:02:40.230> button<00:02:40.410> I'm<00:02:40.650> not

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the input in the channel button I'm not

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.430 
the input in the channel button I'm not
sure<00:02:41.070> if<00:02:41.220> fully<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:41.610> that's<00:02:41.730> work<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.380> may<00:02:43.380> be

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
sure if fully but that's work it may be

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.140 
sure if fully but that's work it may be
for<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.770> actual<00:02:44.070> dish<00:02:44.310> because<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:44.790> not<00:02:44.910> set

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
for the actual dish because it's not set

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.970 
for the actual dish because it's not set
to<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.330> right<00:02:45.540> now<00:02:45.570> but<00:02:46.440> as<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.800> see<00:02:46.890> the

to that right now but as you can see the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.650 
to that right now but as you can see the
input<00:02:47.130> button<00:02:47.610> turns<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.000> right<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.300> my<00:02:48.420> TV

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660

works very well you see in the left

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.750 
works very well you see in the left
corner<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.959> actually<00:02:52.230> did<00:02:52.620> record<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.250> screen

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
corner I actually did record the screen

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.670 
corner I actually did record the screen
of<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.000> Wii<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:54.990> some<00:02:55.170> reason<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.590> did

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
of the Wii but for some reason it did

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.230 
of the Wii but for some reason it did
not<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:56.070> did<00:02:56.190> not<00:02:56.340> look<00:02:56.520> too<00:02:56.730> well<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.120> was

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
not it did not look too well and it was

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.160 
not it did not look too well and it was
really<00:02:57.510> laggy<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.250> want<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.990> see<00:03:00.990> some

that as well

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.170 
that as well
you<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.160> need<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> certain<00:03:08.580> capture<00:03:08.910> card<00:03:09.120> or

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.270 
you just need a certain capture card or
whatnot<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:10.560> now<00:03:10.680> you're<00:03:10.860> just<00:03:10.980> basically

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
