00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone with you sapsan in front of you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.230
 the device that uses the most 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.139
 new technologies to achieve this shore 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.450
 them or as we call the people tetris 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.650
 snake is installed here by me 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.900
 we will begin the review 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.260
 there are on / off buttons 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.630
 devices music start a new game 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.269
 treating reduced complexity and customization 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.910
 automatic increase in complexity 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.789
 go the game well and start button, let's we 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.189
 turn on the device captions it is written and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.090
 we can already control this device 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.309
 presses a button let's start the game 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.399
 we see here the little family is blinking and now she 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.489
 will go here she went now speed 5 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.620
 maximum 10 minimum day and we 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.050
 slowly move to food and to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.690
 spawn in absolutely random place well 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.210
 and let's tell you how to control the snake 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.260
 no need to go anywhere you just need 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.109
 turn your head very simply want 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.930
 at first you will be uncomfortable but after 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.000
 how do you get used it will be 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.189
 so comfortable that large 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.780
 speeds you can very clearly 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.659
 manage the media how does it turn 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.150
 here goes well at the same time almost 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.130
 at the same time poland from physics and miscalculation 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.340
 out rendering image rendering in 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.140
 the moment when physics is processed 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.840
 that is, the movement of the snake is checked 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.939
 where are we rotated if we rotate 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.729
 right next to the snake physics miscalculation 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.700
 will them and move to the right if left 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:50.189
 then left and so to turn 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:54.570
 need to do turn your head in front 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.659
 turn after you get the hang of it 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.030
 it will be very comfortable we see the same 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.299
 The speed is high, that is, auto occurs 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.140
 v 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.479
 auto increase speed well and 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.119
 let's show some more features for 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.880
 of this we click on the pause for this 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.150
 need to look down 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.790
 and now it is included in the repair we 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.110
 can fly on let's first reduce 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.260
 speed turn off auto attraction 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.750
 Difficulties and reduce speed 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.170
 up to 8 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.870
 Well, we can continue, that is, we can 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.910
 any time press pause change 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.010
 the settings that we need that we 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.510
 do not like to continue to play if we 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.720
 Of course, we will naturally lose. 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.500
 let's try it spelled and you lose this 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.170
 another 14 and starts automatically new 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.290
 the game and of course it's boring to play 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.890
 just move and nothing 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.000
 and just move for more interesting 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.480
 gameplay 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.150
 there is music let's turn on the music 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.180
 click and hear standard music 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.580
 Tetris to make it louder 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.450
 we can go to the clarification settings here 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.780
 sound settings and customize music 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.780
 blogs 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.819
 I â€™ll show you a little now 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.569
 there is a cool button behind the back 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.940
 which allows you to open the lid and 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.830
 see what's inside there i did 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.110
 so that everything is as close as possible to 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.989
 the insides of our real tetris we 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.610
 see two boards board for screen board 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:04.120
 for from the keyboard there we see wires and 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.890
 We look here like a screen 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.790
 liquid crystal these pins for 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.250
 screens that go to the plateau 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.739
 Well, here we see the wiring and 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.150
 microcircuits about how this device 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.010
 done i will tell then here well in 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.680
 Basically this is all a map you can 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.240
 download in the description since it is very 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.960
 epic and device then you just have to 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.180
 like and tell friends 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.110
 here's all the best with you 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.110
 there was a peregrine falcon
