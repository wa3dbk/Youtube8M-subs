00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.750
 The bicycle trip which still continues 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.440
 Guide and goodbye was headed near the Kutcharo Lake 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.440
 Youth Guest House 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:29.640
 It has a reputation for enjoying a cozy space at a reasonable price . 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.640
 The aim of this time is the food that the owner himself works 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.000
 The ingredients used are Hokkaido unique deer meat 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.550
 First you'll have broiled here sika deer meat 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:57.129
 Instead of putting it on charcoal for a while, I would like to shift the scent of ink 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.230
 JANJUNYON A moment or leave and avenge 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.340
 It does anymore that day 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.340
 What was it ? 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:22.850
 It's a bit softer as it is a step, but I'm still moist 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:25.470
 In yet calories and still compared with will it is a refreshing taste Toko in March 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.970
 Fat has become clearer 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.970
 Above all, the Lord's request 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.470
 I do not like the owner of Youth Guesthouse 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.730
 Yamamoto's Culinary Arts Chakusugata 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.960
 I used to eat Japanese food before 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:50.990
 Commitment to food once a week 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.990
 Among them deer meat does not use only good meat freshness that was purchased from the acquaintance of Hunter 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.790
 Hokkaido 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.930
 That big city 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.650
 Ten years from the race that extracts the blessings of nature to the whole body 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.210
 Come on, don't eat anything 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.190
 Meat was finished eating natural water plants 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.970
 It is no exaggeration to say that this is eating Hokkaido 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.970
 Have a cigarette 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:22.170
 Yes , another confident work of Mr. Yamamoto Yamamoto is here 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:28.380
 It is a shabu-shabu of sika deer meat 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:33.280
 It's pretty unusual-it's like you can do it on a lap 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.850
 Consumers are also moving but it is not good for June 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.950
 I will go to extreme light 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.150
 All right 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:46.740
 This meat also has a very majestic color, isn't it? 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.300
 Instinct to color It is Khan House no happy curtain around the 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.300
 It is cell unevenness 1 wants copy 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:07.990
 This is also a delicious fluffy high Ne-hard I think I will not miss it is very soft 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:12.280
 I heard shabu spreads out child venison good smell of meat 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:17.410
 High class restaurant with lessons 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:23.430
 Glide is pretty good, but I'll say it's the meat I've got. 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:26.930
 If you get such a line and have more fun with that child, tee 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.930
 I'm also thinking this guy of 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:36.680
 This venison cuisine can also be enjoyed at lunch 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:39.579
 By the way, 10% off the charge when you present the eco passport 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.579
 On this occasion
