psychosocial model of care and it really

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.260

journey to recovery moving through the
healing<00:01:56.060> process<00:01:56.509> so<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:56.930> think<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.619> intent<00:01:57.979> of

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
healing process so I think the intent of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.880 
healing process so I think the intent of
the<00:01:58.220> design<00:01:58.580> was<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.030> create<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.659> facility<00:01:59.899> that

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
the design was to create a facility that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.070 
the design was to create a facility that
had<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.100> journey<00:02:01.550> from<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.420> house<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:03.050> a

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
had a journey from a house to a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.109 
had a journey from a house to a
neighborhood<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:04.009> this<00:02:04.159> lively<00:02:04.460> downtown

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
neighborhood to this lively downtown

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.999 
neighborhood to this lively downtown
area<00:02:05.570> as<00:02:05.750> part<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.409> journey<00:02:06.649> of<00:02:06.770> recovery

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
area as part of that journey of recovery

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.160 
area as part of that journey of recovery
and<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:07.850> in<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.090> design<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.750> building<00:02:09.050> we

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
and so in the design of the building we

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.630 
and so in the design of the building we
were<00:02:09.200> trying<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.619> create<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.310> environment

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
were trying to create that environment

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.850 
were trying to create that environment
here<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.810> would<00:02:11.959> have<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.410> sense<00:02:12.680> of

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
here that would have that sense of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.830 
here that would have that sense of
normalization<00:02:13.459> we've<00:02:13.910> introduced<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.480> lot<00:02:14.690> of

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
normalization we've introduced a lot of

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.509 
normalization we've introduced a lot of
natural<00:02:15.230> light<00:02:15.410> into<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.800> building<00:02:16.220> by

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
natural light into the building by

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.210 
natural light into the building by
having<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.989> know<00:02:18.019> light<00:02:18.440> income<00:02:18.800> coming

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
having a you know light income coming

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.210 
having a you know light income coming
from<00:02:19.340> above<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.209> then<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:20.870> used<00:02:21.500> color<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.160> a

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
from above and then we used color and a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.610 
from above and then we used color and a
really<00:02:22.550> kind<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:22.970> significant<00:02:23.750> way<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.989> help

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
really kind of significant way to help

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.380 
really kind of significant way to help
with<00:02:24.830> wayfinding<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> building<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:26.180> also

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
with wayfinding in the building but also

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.199 
with wayfinding in the building but also
to<00:02:26.630> kind<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.470> give<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.069> characteristic<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
to kind of give a characteristic to the

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.970 
to kind of give a characteristic to the
building<00:02:29.569> that's<00:02:29.780> quite<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> bit<00:02:30.650> different

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
building that's quite a bit different

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.520 
building that's quite a bit different
than<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.130> kind<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:31.940> typical<00:02:32.090> sterile<00:02:32.870> Hospital

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530
