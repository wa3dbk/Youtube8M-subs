materials in there they need evenly

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.649 
materials in there they need evenly
distributed<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:53.739> we<00:00:54.670> need<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:55.030> maintain<00:00:55.269> a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
distributed so we need to maintain a

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.630 
distributed so we need to maintain a
field<00:00:56.110> for<00:00:56.379> various<00:00:56.799> reasons<00:00:57.250> we<00:00:57.400> need<00:00:57.549> to

maintain<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:58.180> veal<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.680> aesthetics<00:01:00.190> cuz

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
maintain the veal for the aesthetics cuz

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.859 
maintain the veal for the aesthetics cuz
it<00:01:00.489> looks<00:01:00.699> nice<00:01:00.909> and<00:01:01.150> when<00:01:01.269> it's<00:01:01.390> maintained

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:01.869 
it looks nice and when it's maintained

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.079 
it looks nice and when it's maintained
we<00:01:02.229> need<00:01:02.470> to<00:01:02.710> maintain<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:03.220> field<00:01:03.549> for<00:01:04.030> the

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
we need to maintain a field for the

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.240 
we need to maintain a field for the
longevity<00:01:04.269> because<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:05.260> will<00:01:05.409> last<00:01:05.619> longer<00:01:05.979> if

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
longevity because it will last longer if

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.550 
longevity because it will last longer if
it's<00:01:06.369> correctly<00:01:06.729> maintained<00:01:07.299> but<00:01:08.260> most

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
it's correctly maintained but most

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.109 
it's correctly maintained but most
importantly<00:01:09.130> from<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.340> football-playing

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
importantly from the football-playing

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.480 
importantly from the football-playing
perspective<00:01:10.840> if<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.619> field<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.010> maintained

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
perspective if a field is maintained

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.520 
perspective if a field is maintained
correctly<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:13.869> you<00:01:14.049> have<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.259> situation

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
correctly then you have a situation

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.200 
correctly then you have a situation
where<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.100> ball<00:01:15.369> will<00:01:15.549> respond<00:01:16.000> correctly

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
where the ball will respond correctly

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.289 
where the ball will respond correctly
the<00:01:17.049> players<00:01:17.380> interact<00:01:18.250> with<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.670> surface

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
the players interact with the surface

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.120 
the players interact with the surface
correctly<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.049> therefore<00:01:20.619> all<00:01:20.859> these

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
correctly and therefore all these

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.849 
correctly and therefore all these
benefit<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.299> performance<00:01:22.960> of<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.350> field<00:01:23.590> in

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
benefit the performance of the field in

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.660 
benefit the performance of the field in
the<00:01:24.250> long<00:01:24.430> term

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.390 

the<00:01:29.600> research<00:01:30.020> program<00:01:30.590> has<00:01:30.740> been<00:01:30.950> designed

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
the research program has been designed

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.640 
the research program has been designed
in<00:01:31.610> such<00:01:31.790> a<00:01:31.850> way<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.150> we<00:01:32.420> split<00:01:32.870> each<00:01:33.080> field

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
in such a way that we split each field

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.149 
in such a way that we split each field
into<00:01:34.640> four<00:01:34.850> quadrants<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.140> each<00:01:36.500> different

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
into four quadrants so each different

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.550 
into four quadrants so each different
technique<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:38.080> responsible<00:01:39.080> for<00:01:39.110> each

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
technique is responsible for each

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.800 
technique is responsible for each
different<00:01:40.280> quadrant<00:01:40.820> therefore<00:01:41.540> we<00:01:41.659> would

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
different quadrant therefore we would

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.660 
different quadrant therefore we would
test<00:01:42.229> each<00:01:42.560> quadrant<00:01:43.720> before<00:01:45.280> afterwards<00:01:46.280> and

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
test each quadrant before afterwards and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.760 
test each quadrant before afterwards and
one<00:01:47.270> month<00:01:47.509> later<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.520> we<00:01:49.640> know<00:01:49.880> how<00:01:50.210> each

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
one month later so that we know how each

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.240 
one month later so that we know how each
individual<00:01:52.150> set<00:01:53.150> of<00:01:53.390> apparatus<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.650> going<00:01:55.040> to

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
individual set of apparatus is going to

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.399 
individual set of apparatus is going to
interact<00:01:55.940> with<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.240> surface<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.259> can

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
interact with the surface so we can

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.590 
interact with the surface so we can
clearly<00:01:57.710> see<00:01:58.070> from<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:59.000> effects<00:01:59.509> of

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
clearly see from that the effects of

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.320 
clearly see from that the effects of
different<00:02:00.050> types<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:01.130> maintenance<00:02:01.369> on<00:02:01.910> the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
different types of maintenance on the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.540 
different types of maintenance on the
field<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.810> then<00:02:03.740> we'll<00:02:03.890> be<00:02:04.070> able<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.369> give

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
field and then we'll be able to give

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.999 
field and then we'll be able to give
advice<00:02:04.820> out<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.470> member<00:02:06.740> associations

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
advice out to the member associations

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.990 
advice out to the member associations
and<00:02:07.910> facility<00:02:08.750> owners<00:02:09.110> which<00:02:09.769> allows<00:02:10.280> them<00:02:10.759> to

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
and facility owners which allows them to

and facility owners which allows them to
make<00:02:11.209> their<00:02:11.420> own<00:02:11.450> decisions<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:12.560> we'll<00:02:12.980> be

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
make their own decisions but we'll be

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.699 
make their own decisions but we'll be
able<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.400> demonstrate<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:14.060> the

able to demonstrate that the
improvements<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.070> achieve<00:02:16.220> with<00:02:17.000> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
improvements you can achieve with the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.570 
improvements you can achieve with the
different<00:02:17.600> techniques<00:02:18.050> then<00:02:18.800> they<00:02:18.980> can<00:02:19.280> come

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
different techniques then they can come

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.520 
different techniques then they can come
to<00:02:19.790> their<00:02:19.940> final<00:02:20.269> decision<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:21.019> what

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
to their final decision on what

to their final decision on what
maintenance<00:02:22.160> they<00:02:22.400> can<00:02:23.180> afford<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.870> do<00:02:24.050> but

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
maintenance they can afford to do but

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.940 
maintenance they can afford to do but
overall<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.780> crucial<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.560> this

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
overall it is crucial that this
