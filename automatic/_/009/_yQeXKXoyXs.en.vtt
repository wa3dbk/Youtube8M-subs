 be good to discuss this game and I 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.449
 I have to say that you're going to take your 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.149
 conclusions in itself for those who like 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.219
 of a long game game that has things 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.679
 to be sure of 23 but if the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.379
 its beach to give you an idea it 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.479
 is a great year rpg is that rpg only 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.719
 Talk and lots of action. 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.860
 I'll beat a lot of blood in the game. 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.880
 same game, right? 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.560
 and he is an RPG that brings a lot to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.470
 you do a lot for you to explore 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 with giant maps for you to have 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.190
 an idea do you know the game the elder 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.410
 simple carmen scrolls certainly not 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.600
 must know and creator of the best game 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.850
 of the year 2011 its launch the game 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.990
 has a huge map the map that has a lot 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.570
 thing to do 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.120
 It is a game that you already miss good from 20 to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.850
 30 hours to finish the game so if 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.890
 you do not everything is still possible 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.560
 make a game that goes beyond 40 hours 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.260
 playing and and that if you want to believe 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.090
 23 only one of the maps that 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.330
 compose an open world of play only 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.940
 one of the maps is already bigger than the world 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.090
 whole says meat to you to have an idea 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.330
 so we can expect a lot 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.490
 to make many hours a lot fun 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.590
 game is being very well worked out and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.480
 it has been delayed for sure it will be 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.490
 some bug fixes some bugs 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.440
 the game will be taken something 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.510
 gameplay graphics to bring a 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.050
 sure product from first to 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.209
 people 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.080
 the launch of this Sunday will be March 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.760
 next year 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.230
 in February or March next year but 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.390
 I 'm always in the first half of the year. 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.190
 that comes and surely a game waiting 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.430
 One more game I'm sure I'll 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.450
 buy i arrived in 2011 the witcher 2 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.760
 but this third game promises a lot 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.040
 the same you can see through the inter-sm 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.550
 score playing background for you there it is 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.920
 an extremely well detailed scenario 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.709
 very cute his thing graphics 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.209
 so before you hardly see and I 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.500
 I believe that from this game to 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.140
 from next year, which will be the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.720
 great games of the new generation that 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.000
 we will see here actually came this 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.519
 this new generation of consoles so do not 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.280
 with groups as 23 with how much one 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.959
 break is another excellent game that 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.030
 I'm sure I'll catch this one too. 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.470
 subject for another video I'll bring 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.849
 some videos shows you some 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.790
 of my expectations for the year that 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.590
 comes and sure must have 3 is a look 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.579
 It's just cool for you guys to see the effects. 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.170
 in the water 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.079
 the lighting effect of the game it is 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.090
 very well worked anyway and it is not 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.799
 to stick to the graph so the 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.230
 game narrative to what it all indicates 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.040
 seems to be very well told very well 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.349
 treated 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.730
 the combats in random combats 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.900
 fighting with bosses 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.610
 so there is one thing very well is 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.040
 threaded in the game if a thing very well 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.930
 made very nicely embedded moments in the 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.489
 dialogue game tension moment one 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.470
 moment of combat 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.840
 all I've seen so far no team 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.670
 gigantic these days did not miss 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.079
 more than half an hour 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.180
 gameplay 23 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:45.590
 I watched the barber from start to finish. 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.670
 because it mixes many is is places 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.579
 different cities several forests 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.519
 various characters is way of you 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.650
 face an enemy and a very 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.959
 cool nap 8:13 the next of 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.239
 you hunt the monsters is to have a 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.760
 gameplay 1 already must have seen the mp him 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.099
 hunt a very nice griffin even you go 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.440
 follow his blood trail through the 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.780
 forest until you find it after 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.220
 epic battle against him so the scenery 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.560
 very influences 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.299
 You're very cool, even playing the game. 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.459
 awesome for myself with 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.900
 sure as I said sometimes I 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.389
 I'm a goal nowadays I consider myself a 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.220
 difficult topic to be amazed games 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.090
 so for sure 23 years surprised 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.580
 too much 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.289
 I'm sure a lot of people, too. 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.090
 That's not my opinion. You want to know the 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.440
 What do you think about this game? 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.820
 catch this next game 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.249
 If you're waiting for this game that I 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.869
 protects 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.519
 the new generation save the money that 

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:40.589
 it's worth you to buy this game and 

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:42.839
 buy a new generation console 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:44.159
 but where is the video I hope you have 

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:46.229
 just liked my opinions 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.939
 respect of 2013 and I'm sure I'll get it 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.219
 I'm already specifically joining him 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.049
 for me it can cost up to 400 reais in 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.729
 next year that this game makes a point of 

00:04:52.049 --> 00:04:55.109
 and I'm sure it's going to be a 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.629
 very good investment investment 

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:59.669
 right for me in the year 2015 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.079
 but I know the video today the next video 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.819
 Talk a little about how much a break 

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:04.799
 after the metal gear solid 5 are 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.599
 two other games that made by far the 

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:08.249
 next year and I'm sure I'll get it 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.449
 further 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:10.649
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.059
 anything you say comments 

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:14.459
 found the game you will also get 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:17.429
 What do you expect next year too? 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.509
 2015, well, anything you commit and 

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:21.110
 to the next 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.110
 I speak
