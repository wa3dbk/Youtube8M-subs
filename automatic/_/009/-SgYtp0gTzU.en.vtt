 and then Blüm 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.060
 of course further quoted 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.380

 Feinberg used 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.420
 and he could form 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.290
 why he

 Carrier Assembly 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.250
 then just nice little hair clips 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.630
 most strikingly against the trend 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 so on the first day has made even more exciting 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.620
 otherwise that works 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.970
 This could also be a quarter so lichen is not necessarily the case 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.650
 rotate 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.310
