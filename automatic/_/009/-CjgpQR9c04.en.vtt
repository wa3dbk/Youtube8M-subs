again everyone this is a quick test to
see<00:00:08.360> how<00:00:09.360> stable<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.260> can<00:00:10.530> get<00:00:11.099> with<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.429> NEX

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
see how stable I can get with the NEX

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.919 
see how stable I can get with the NEX
six<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.099> 16<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.190> 50<00:00:14.610> kit<00:00:14.910> lens<00:00:15.179> because

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
six and the 16 to 50 kit lens because

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.500 
six and the 16 to 50 kit lens because
it's<00:00:16.080> an<00:00:16.379> image<00:00:16.619> stabilized<00:00:17.220> system<00:00:18.119> which<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
it's an image stabilized system which is

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.050 
it's an image stabilized system which is
a<00:00:18.680> really<00:00:19.680> compact<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.490> for<00:00:20.670> running<00:00:20.910> gun

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
a really compact so for running gun

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.689 
a really compact so for running gun
shooting<00:00:21.619> this<00:00:22.619> could<00:00:22.859> be<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> really<00:00:23.550> great

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
shooting this could be a really great

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.970 
shooting this could be a really great
option<00:00:25.609> I've<00:00:26.609> set<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:26.970> up<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.920> sort<00:00:28.920> of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
option I've set it up with the sort of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.670 
option I've set it up with the sort of
the<00:00:29.340> DIY<00:00:31.790> whatever<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:32.969> called<00:00:33.120> pocket<00:00:33.680> reg

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the DIY whatever it's called pocket reg

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.950 
the DIY whatever it's called pocket reg
thing<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.210> basically<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.559> know

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
thing and it's basically just you know

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.619 
thing and it's basically just you know
photography<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.050> cinema<00:00:40.399> pnc<00:00:41.480> friction<00:00:42.480> arm

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
photography and cinema pnc friction arm

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.410 
photography and cinema pnc friction arm
and<00:00:43.100> then<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> super<00:00:44.610> clamp<00:00:44.789> at<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.000> end<00:00:45.180> which

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and then a super clamp at the end which

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.130 
and then a super clamp at the end which
holds<00:00:45.930> sponge<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> bit<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.460> comfort

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
holds sponge just for a bit of comfort

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
holds sponge just for a bit of comfort
and<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.289> basically<00:00:49.770> creating<00:00:50.370> because

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and that's basically creating because

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.869 
and that's basically creating because
this<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.449> such<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> lightweight<00:00:51.930> camera<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:53.280> find

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
this is such a lightweight camera I find

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.850 
this is such a lightweight camera I find
that<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.210> quite<00:00:54.539> usable<00:00:55.020> especially

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that this is quite usable especially

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
that this is quite usable especially
since<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.370> close<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> body<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.239> find

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
since it's this close to the body I find

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.349 
since it's this close to the body I find
quite<00:00:58.469> usable<00:00:58.980> without<00:00:59.039> a<00:01:00.079> counterweight<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
quite usable without a counterweight and

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.350 
quite usable without a counterweight and
I'll<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> test<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.890> whether<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
I'll do a test and see whether this I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.649 
I'll do a test and see whether this I
mean<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.140> far<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.439> I've<00:01:07.590> seen<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.430> far<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
mean as far as I've seen so far this is

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.990 
mean as far as I've seen so far this is
an<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> big<00:01:10.380> improvement<00:01:10.740> from<00:01:11.340> just

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
an a big improvement from just

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.649 
an a big improvement from just
hand-holding<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.920> or<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.430> using<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.030> with

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
hand-holding it or just using it with

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.390 
hand-holding it or just using it with
the<00:01:16.460> viewfinder<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:19.530> allows<00:01:19.770> me<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> walk<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the viewfinder it allows me to walk a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.870 
the viewfinder it allows me to walk a
little<00:01:20.759> bit<00:01:20.909> smoother<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.490> yeah<00:01:23.490> overall

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
little bit smoother and yeah overall

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
little bit smoother and yeah overall
it's<00:01:24.240> pretty<00:01:24.479> nice<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:28.200> yeah<00:01:28.320> pretty<00:01:28.500> nice

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
it's pretty nice and yeah pretty nice

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.990 
it's pretty nice and yeah pretty nice
and<00:01:28.920> usable<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.340> now<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> cool

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and usable and now what are the cool

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
and usable and now what are the cool
things<00:01:30.210> about<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.409> were<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
things about this is what if you were to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.789 
things about this is what if you were to
undo<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.780> then<00:01:33.780> you've<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> clamp<00:01:34.500> here

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
undo this then you've got a clamp here

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.230 
undo this then you've got a clamp here
and<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.270> tripod<00:01:38.240> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and you can use this as a tripod you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.580 
and you can use this as a tripod you
just<00:01:39.450> clamp<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> whatever<00:01:40.140> you've<00:01:40.380> got

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
just clamp it to whatever you've got

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.310 
just clamp it to whatever you've got
around<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.130> you've<00:01:41.280> got<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
around and you've got you know a

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
around and you've got you know a
positionable<00:01:43.320> tripod<00:01:43.890> obviously<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
positionable tripod obviously not with a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.210 
positionable tripod obviously not with a
fluid<00:01:45.240> head<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.920> wanted<00:01:47.159> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
fluid head but if you really wanted to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.039 
fluid head but if you really wanted to
then<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.700> could<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.329> suppose<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.869> could

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
then you could I suppose you could

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.319 
then you could I suppose you could
position<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.500> small<00:01:49.710> fluid<00:01:49.950> head<00:01:50.220> right<00:01:51.119> here

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
position a small fluid head right here

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.090 
position a small fluid head right here
so<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.750> sort<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.290> shoulder<00:01:52.530> egg<00:01:52.799> slash

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
so you have sort of a shoulder egg slash

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.219 
so you have sort of a shoulder egg slash
tripod<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:54.720> could<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.930> pretty<00:01:55.110> cool<00:01:57.079> if<00:01:58.079> i

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
tripod that could be pretty cool if i

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.359 
tripod that could be pretty cool if i
zoom<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.009> 15<00:01:59.610> millimeter<00:02:00.979> then<00:02:01.979> we're<00:02:02.219> sort

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
zoom in to 15 millimeter then we're sort

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.550 
zoom in to 15 millimeter then we're sort
of<00:02:02.460> really<00:02:03.119> pushing<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.079> limits<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
of really pushing the limits of the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.480 
of really pushing the limits of the
image<00:02:07.560> stabilization<00:02:09.619> but

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
image stabilization but

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.870 
image stabilization but
it<00:02:13.490> still<00:02:13.850> works<00:02:14.090> pretty<00:02:14.450> damn<00:02:14.840> well<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.770> know

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.880 

almost<00:02:19.880> looks<00:02:20.540> like<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.780> tripod<00:02:21.260> shop<00:02:21.500> which<00:02:21.740> is

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
almost looks like a tripod shop which is

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.540 
almost looks like a tripod shop which is
really<00:02:22.100> cool<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.430> see<00:02:23.800> but<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:25.250> know<00:02:25.340> if<00:02:25.430> I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
really cool to see but you know if I

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.000 
really cool to see but you know if I
were<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.670> walk<00:02:25.970> then<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:27.350> would<00:02:27.530> introduce<00:02:27.800> a
