are<00:02:01.530> four<00:02:01.740> different<00:02:02.100> players<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.700> run

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
are four different players you can run

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.749 
are four different players you can run
as<00:02:03.149> loads<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:04.020> boost<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.740> upgrade<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
as loads of boost you can upgrade and

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.570 
as loads of boost you can upgrade and
you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.719> environment<00:02:07.320> changes<00:02:07.860> over

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you can see the environment changes over

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.119 
you can see the environment changes over
and<00:02:08.729> over<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.629> boost<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.170> very<00:02:10.440> helpful<00:02:10.770> it's

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
and over the boost is very helpful it's

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.900 
and over the boost is very helpful it's
probably

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
probably

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.960 
probably
the<00:02:11.970> best<00:02:12.440> powerup<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.590> my<00:02:13.770> opinion<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.520> I

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
the best powerup in my opinion because I

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.360 
the best powerup in my opinion because I
get<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.320> then<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.860> green

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
get it there and then I have it green

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.980 
get it there and then I have it green
there<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.850> when<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.000> come<00:02:18.240> out<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.840> get

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
there so when I come out of it I can get

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.260 
there so when I come out of it I can get
it<00:02:19.140> again<00:02:19.440> nice<00:02:20.040> watch<00:02:20.400> out<00:02:20.610> for<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.910> flames

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
it again nice watch out for the flames

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.420 
it again nice watch out for the flames
unless<00:02:21.660> you're<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.020> boost<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.620> then<00:02:23.100> keep

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
unless you're in the boost and then keep

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.610 
unless you're in the boost and then keep
on<00:02:23.640> running<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.570> see<00:02:24.750> your<00:02:24.930> score<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.530> the
