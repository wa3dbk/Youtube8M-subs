milkshakes<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> looks<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.610> big<00:00:56.910> sweet

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
milkshakes now it looks like a big sweet

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420 
milkshakes now it looks like a big sweet
potato<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.469> remember<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.949> was<00:00:58.980> sitting<00:00:59.340> on

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
potato and I remember it was sitting on

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.150 
potato and I remember it was sitting on
the<00:00:59.579> counter<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:01.170> thought<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.010> really

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the counter and I thought it was really

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.830 
the counter and I thought it was really
bad<00:01:02.460> because<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.940> was<00:01:03.059> kind<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.329> wrinkly<00:01:03.600> but

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
bad because it was kind of wrinkly but

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960 
bad because it was kind of wrinkly but
they<00:01:03.930> said<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.439> has<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.979> very<00:01:05.220> soft<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.880> at

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
they said it has to be very soft or at

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270 
they said it has to be very soft or at
least<00:01:06.180> soft<00:01:06.619> before<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.890> eat<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.070> because

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
least soft before you eat it because

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.300 
least soft before you eat it because
it's<00:01:08.610> actually<00:01:08.820> hard<00:01:09.299> before<00:01:09.799> you<00:01:10.799> eat<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:10.979> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it's actually hard before you eat it so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.590 
it's actually hard before you eat it so
basically<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:13.770> tastes<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> combination

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
basically it tastes like a combination

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.210 
basically it tastes like a combination
of<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.740> think<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.540> sweet<00:01:18.540> potato<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.860> pumpkin

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
of I think a sweet potato and a pumpkin

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.570 
of I think a sweet potato and a pumpkin
pie<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:21.479> absolutely<00:01:22.049> amazing<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:23.159> when<00:01:23.460> we

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pie it's absolutely amazing but when we

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
pie it's absolutely amazing but when we
cut<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.880> open<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> we'll<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.409> has<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
cut it open and we'll see it has a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.670 
cut it open and we'll see it has a
consistency<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.610> an<00:01:26.939> avocado<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> very
