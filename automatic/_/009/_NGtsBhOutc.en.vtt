00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
end of your run let's take a look at

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.630 
end of your run let's take a look at
some<00:00:31.179> angles<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:31.720> body<00:00:31.900> position<00:00:32.439> I<00:00:32.650> get<00:00:33.520> the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
some angles and body position I get the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.250 
some angles and body position I get the
weight<00:00:33.850> on<00:00:34.060> the<00:00:34.210> outside<00:00:34.240> ski<00:00:34.930> with<00:00:35.110> the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
weight on the outside ski with the

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.990 
weight on the outside ski with the
pressure<00:00:35.500> on<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.830> tip<00:00:36.070> through<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:36.520> flex<00:00:36.820> of

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
pressure on the tip through the flex of

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.390 
pressure on the tip through the flex of
the<00:00:37.120> ankle<00:00:37.510> my<00:00:38.470> knee<00:00:38.530> is<00:00:38.740> flexed<00:00:38.890> so<00:00:39.250> that<00:00:39.340> I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
the ankle my knee is flexed so that I

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.640 
the ankle my knee is flexed so that I
stand<00:00:39.610> that<00:00:39.910> leduc<00:00:40.330> body<00:00:40.540> position<00:00:41.110> and<00:00:41.290> also

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
stand that leduc body position and also

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.140 
stand that leduc body position and also
to<00:00:41.710> compensate<00:00:42.340> for<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.610> forward<00:00:42.940> pressure

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
to compensate for the forward pressure

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.660 
to compensate for the forward pressure
I've<00:00:43.420> applied<00:00:43.720> through<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.170> ankle<00:00:44.530> my<00:00:45.460> lower

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
I've applied through the ankle my lower

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.340 
I've applied through the ankle my lower
body<00:00:45.910> position<00:00:46.420> keeps<00:00:46.630> my<00:00:46.720> weight<00:00:46.990> forward

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
body position keeps my weight forward

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.800 
body position keeps my weight forward
and<00:00:47.590> on<00:00:47.740> to<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.010> tip<00:00:48.250> of<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.490> heart<00:00:48.700> f17<00:00:49.510> World

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.870 
Cup ski upper and lower body separation
has<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.170> occur<00:00:53.470> for<00:00:53.860> efficient<00:00:54.340> mobile<00:00:54.610> skiing
