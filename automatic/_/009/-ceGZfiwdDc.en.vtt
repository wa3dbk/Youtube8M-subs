00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello, I want to come in very quickly today 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.620
 Face of the day I'll go straight away 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.500
 gone and therefore I have a little more 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.580
 pretty much even as a foundation 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.720
 I have applied the essence same day 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.529
 long lasting make up in ten software 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.900
 I already have in the region 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.670
 made i link you in the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.650
 infobox I think that's great 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.230
 I always take it when I am 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.860
 go away in the evening as concealer I have 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:40.469
 the milani secret cover concealer cream 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.690
 01 bombay looks like this is very much 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.340
 firm cream of the consistency so 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 little to compare with the just do 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.739
 you finish concealer from mac 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.820
 I looked in the eye 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:01:00.980
 when brother finds the mac minis child 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:05.850
 natural in media space then I have 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.380
 applied this bush was bronze the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.020
 There are in the UK 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 he looks like a chocolate like that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.990
 derrick totally delicious after vanilla then 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.880
 I think that's really great 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.140
 I use that very often too 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:30.869
 milan inside splash in color 202 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:33.659
 Sunset Beach The color looks like this 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.670
 a loud chorale so a bit 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:42.810
 brown , very, very nice 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.939
 very warm day and as a highlight 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.840
 I used the cut giant luminator 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:56.420
 this limited edition baroque something 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.540
 in the baroque on the eyes I have 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.619
 First apply this kajal 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.579
 can you really some dark 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.430
 take kajal 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:11.129
 this is the pc from the limited edition 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.920
 your wild thing kajal in 0 30 central 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.260
 brown 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.970
 So if you have that I have 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.400
 use his kg color with one 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.569
 you can get a bit metallic shimmer 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.390
 also somebody needs sound or 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.290
 Green tone then I take too 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.069
 worn this manhattan multi effect 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.930
 EichstÃ¤tt in 350 black but I believe 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.000
 not that it still exists so the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.840
 I have very very very very very 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.670
 long it just an old black one 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.760
 eyeshadow I applied one 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.769
 until the eyelet folds and the kohl comes 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.330
 but you can see it out very well 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.180
 actually pretty good too 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.920
 and then I'm blinded by that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:03.010
 katri sensation eyeshadow looks like that 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.780
 from the color c02 swimmer bay 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.980
 that's just a dodgy thing 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.280
 medium brown 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.440
 so if you have the 28 nude palette 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.450
 there are and honey has thousands of 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.610
 this sound 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.400
 I just took it then 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.410
 I have my waterline down like that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.269
 a bit rest of the kajal I 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.430
 Show you now and then instead 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.609
 alone I have the one more time 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.140
 used and that I am correct 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:35.900
 enthusiastic about the milani liquified 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.510
 Metallica lineup island is not a color 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.230
 hat is just black and he is the one 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.390
 absolute hammer so I have already 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.220
 years ago I have seen reviews and am 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.640
 just so glad now those products the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.269
 I always wanted to finally have somehow 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.299
 to order 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.850
 and that has the make up if you like 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.220
 who knows who has raved about them 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.209
 and those too with those somehow cache 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.470
 compared to all the pencils and I believe 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.940
 they even won in their test 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.700
 So I'm here on the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.319
 waterline exceptionally kohl 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.459
 and that did not go off at all before 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.590
 why did I still such a 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.510
 bit of rest but it looks quite 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.239
 good 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.560
 as mascara I used the 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.490
 maybelline false eyelashes volume 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.090
 I like express mascara 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.949
 really really good 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.530
 does not make so much volume but nice 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:33.750
 much longer and definition and mine 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.229
 eyebrows I filled in with the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.490
 red in wales woman carla in set so i 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.970
 think that's the brightest color 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.729
 something worth it or something is easy 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.470
 build such a bright then I am about it 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.860
 gone with the transparent 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.669
 eyebrow gel from alverde lipstick 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:58.020
 that is so that means yes that is the 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:02.610
 by aion is the one lipstick and the one 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.490
 means you perfection looks like this is 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.600
 just such a newton but one 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.240
 a little bit darker and he has such a whole 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.520
 very slight shimmer and the while 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.960
 the face totally open and I have 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.240
 the now longer and the 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.620
 Feels very supple on 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.010
 my nails I have just such a 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.830
 experiment these are two colors of p2p 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:29.360
 2 I'll be there now if I am 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.889
 I've finished a review 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.110
 yes the clothes are all not up to date 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.370
 That's why I do not need to say that though 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:41.690
 I have a high carded black 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:46.320

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:57.500
 as always come from davidson and oh so 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.610
 I wear otherwise only this jewelry 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.500
 Pearl earrings are so pink gorgeous 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.450

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.910

 and yes , you write like that 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.260
 I like to see something more often 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.320
 and if so have something to reviews 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.830

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.830
 the infobox
