 Hey, I'm ZC ... Your Splinter Cell Community Developer ... 0: 00: 16.480.0: 00: 20.540 In this week's Blacklist ComDev video, we're talking to those who have the features 0: 00: 20.540.0: 00: 25,910 from both the mind and the panther ... The stealth fans who, when they decide to attack, do so from the shadow ... 0: 00: 25,910,0: 00: 31,390 And not being noticed. We start on this wet roof ... 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.859
 A good place to show the variation of non-lethal shutdowns. 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.210
 We look at the Assault approach - deadly and very action-oriented - in the coming months. 0: 00: 40.210.0: 00: 41.620 But for now we keep it quiet. 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:01:20.390
 K: What we are aiming for is to make everything run smoothly. 0: 00: 50.530.0: 00: 56.410 Sam, the environment and its movements. 0: 00: 56.410.0: 01: 00.540 We try to show that Sam has an action for every situation. 0: 01: 00.540.0: 01: 02.420 We take many things into account: 0: 01: 02.420.0: 01: 08.400 the position where Sam is, the situation Sam is in, whether it is deadly or not. 0: 01: 08,400,0: 01: 12,830 Then we all put that together ... and then you see all our 0: 01: 12,830,0: 01: 15,990 unique movements. 0: 01: 15.990.0: 01: 20.390 When you turn up behind someone, you naturally want to eliminate him quickly and efficiently. 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.400
 So we found a good way to do this. Go for the nerves at the back of the neck. 0: 01: 25,400.0: 01: 30,670 We also go for the kidneys. Again, without making a sound. 0: 01: 30.670.0: 01: 35.890 In short, it gives Sam a little more time to do what he has to do. 0: 01: 35.890.0: 01: 40.570 But the first action will always be a way of suppressing. 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.000
 We have combat, we have stealth, we have deadly, non-deadly, we have eliminations 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.090
 that are combat and stealth, deadly and non-deadly. 0: 01: 50.090.0: 01: 56.010 Then we have open shackles that are deadly or non-lethal and combat or stealth, so in numbers, 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.010
 I think we have more than 90 promotions. 0: 02: 08.759.0: 02: 12.769 The idea behind the shutdowns, I think, fits perfectly with Splinter Cell. 0: 02: 12.769.0: 02: 17.930 I mean Sam is jumping out of the shade; he attacks from the shadow. So what better way to do this than to use coverage 0: 02: 17,930.0: 02: 24,930 And make coverage your weapon. 0: 02: 26.689.0: 02: 30.969 With the stealth shutdowns, the philosophy is always to work from a coverage. 

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:36.340
 So Sam tries to hide the body, suppress it or keep it still. 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.489
 With the combat eliminations, Sam is not concerned with hiding the body, because he has already been noticed. 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.489
 It is about bringing down the body as efficiently as possible.
