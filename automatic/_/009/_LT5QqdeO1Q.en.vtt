00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.470
 hello to all this the nail art that you 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.210
 I propose today that the nail art puzzle 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.460
 as you've seen lately I'm 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.130
 trying to show you all the nails again 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.230
 art trend so all of them nail art 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.260
 that go a lot that always go 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.050
 above all and which are simple to 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.090
 to achieve this peace here or in art 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.210
 he really always loves it 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.090
 very much also because it is very tasty and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.100
 the method I will show you in the tutorial is 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.469
 one of the simplest I know of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 realize it and make it come more 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.300
 states that this is obviously possible 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.960
 much more precise than we can 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.329
 do doing the hand except people who 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 they are particularly skilled if of course 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.960
 think that maybe we want to do it again 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.699
 also on the other hand with this method 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.399
 certainly succeeds because not 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.470
 in short, we must make the least effort 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.390
 then once we hang the technique we will be 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.780
 us to decide the amount of stars 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.950
 enter such quantities, etc. 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.210
 however I played with these colors 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.170
 here because I like them a lot 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.439
 together 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.509
 and you as always take it as a starting point 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.920
 to indulge you based on yours 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.810
 fantasy 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.310
 I really hope you like it I leave you 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.080
 to the tutorial which is very fast 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.090
 very simple and send you a big kiss 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.070
 hello I have already applied my base e 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.340
 this time used that filler from 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.799
 collistar now I'm going to apply first 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.380
 this light green only on ring finger e 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.750
 This little finger here is with the effect already 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.009
 of dark but the color will tell it at the end 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.600
 because I had forgotten to say it 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.810
 therefore simply the single color only 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.520
 on ring finger and light green little finger number 56 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.409
 now I go to the other long ones 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.170
 this blue always agenda lines this is 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.180
 the number 54 of both colors o 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.009
 same before a first pass and then 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.570
 donated to be revised with the second for 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.380
 get the most out of color is this 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.380
 here is the result 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.930
 at this point to speed up a 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.850
 I need a little drying time 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.060
 of the fast drider ops that are of the 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.850
 drops dries enamel now look like it 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.069
 nail polish is perfectly dry cut 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.440
 two small pieces of Scotch but must 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.120
 to be crooked therefore I am to be that is 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.660
 the corner must be just a corner 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.980
 straight and apply them on the nail as 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.750
 see from the images to create your own 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.840
 of the squares then divided as yes 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.550
 divided the nail into four parts 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.040
 I take the blue color then that of 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.060
 darker and simply go to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.110
 pass again on the nail and with the enamel 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.790
 still wet 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.790
 I'm going to remove the bits of scotch 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.830
 and these will be nothing has the seat of 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.420
 dry puzzle for me it can happen to you that 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.000
 there was a bubble of air that therefore 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.590
 he blew out some polish 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.090
 I intervened with a penalty now gis 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.180
 born to remove excess now I take 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.830
 this tray from the number one kit 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.510
 first I take the blue enamel with the doctor 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.340
 which always comes from the number one kit of 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.690
 dark and with the biggest and then the tip 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.860
 obviously it also depends on the size 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.890
 of your nails as they are 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.560
 the pieces of the puzzle have grown up and 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.459
 I'm going to do those two little bits that 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.760
 they are used precisely to insert the plugs 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.470
 obviously with colors in contrast with i 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.880
 lighter gets stuck in with the dark and 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.670
 with the darker it fits into the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.440
 very simple clear piece waiting for a 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.810
 let these points begin 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.130
 dry and pass this to the top coat 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.810
 using the tebi gel play 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.310
 the very first time I used it 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.170
 so I can't tell you yet how to do it 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.720
 I find one thing I can tell you not 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.609
 pass over the nail too many times 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.470
 this one decorated otherwise risked 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.630
 to drag you to the enamel because yes 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.280
 it could melt anyway I hope so much 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.600
 you enjoyed it with this is all there 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.380
 I send a kiss and give us a neighbor 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.380
 hello video
