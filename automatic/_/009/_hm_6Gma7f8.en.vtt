00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
for a long time like all over the world

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
did is we actually created an amp that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.179 
did is we actually created an amp that
has<00:01:21.360> two<00:01:21.750> channels<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:22.890> set<00:01:23.159> up

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
has two channels that you can set up

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.710 
has two channels that you can set up
independently<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.390> them<00:01:24.540> as

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
independently so you can have them as

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.820 
independently so you can have them as
different<00:01:25.229> volumes

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
different volumes

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.070 
different volumes
it<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> boost<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> second<00:01:27.869> channel

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
it now has a boost on the second channel

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
it now has a boost on the second channel
and<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.979> doesn't<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> overdrive<00:01:29.790> so

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and it doesn't have the overdrive so

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.359 
and it doesn't have the overdrive so
it's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> much<00:01:30.329> more<00:01:30.509> totally<00:01:30.990> pure<00:01:31.320> sound<00:01:31.650> okay

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
he's designed this amazing pick up the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.980 
he's designed this amazing pick up the
houses<00:02:22.020> clarity<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:24.030> sound<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.750> low

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
houses clarity and sound to it it's low

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.400 
houses clarity and sound to it it's low
output<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.430> also<00:02:26.580> has<00:02:26.970> no<00:02:27.630> wax<00:02:27.840> potting<00:02:28.260> so

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
output and it also has no wax potting so

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.320 
output and it also has no wax potting so
it's<00:02:28.560> got<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.740> really<00:02:29.070> really<00:02:29.280> nice<00:02:29.520> top-end

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
it's got a really really nice top-end

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.510 
it's got a really really nice top-end
sometimes<00:02:30.690> pickups<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.380> humbuckers<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.430> be

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
sometimes pickups that humbuckers can be

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.800 
sometimes pickups that humbuckers can be
a<00:02:32.550> little<00:02:32.700> too<00:02:32.820> mid-range<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.300> lose<00:02:33.630> on<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
a little too mid-range you lose on the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.880 
a little too mid-range you lose on the
top<00:02:34.080> end

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
top end

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.410 
top end
the<00:02:35.130> other<00:02:35.250> cool<00:02:35.430> thing<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:35.910> we've

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
the other cool thing is that we've

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.080 
the other cool thing is that we've
designed<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.990> pot<00:02:37.340> on<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.520> volume<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.060> that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
designed this pot on the volume so that

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.760 
designed this pot on the volume so that
when<00:02:39.330> you're<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> bridge<00:02:39.900> pickup<00:02:40.230> it's

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
when you're on the bridge pickup it's

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.560 
when you're on the bridge pickup it's
five<00:02:40.980> hour<00:02:41.130> case<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.670> retain<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.150> brightness

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
five hour case you retain the brightness

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.440 
five hour case you retain the brightness
you<00:02:42.780> go<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.130> single<00:02:44.460> coil<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:44.880> 250

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
you go to the the single coil it's 250

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.030 
you go to the the single coil it's 250
so<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.900> retain<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.350> clarity<00:02:46.860> as<00:02:46.920> well

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
so then you retain that clarity as well

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.830 
so then you retain that clarity as well
because<00:02:47.520> that's<00:02:47.670> always<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.030> thing<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.810> a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
because that's always the thing it is a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.600 
because that's always the thing it is a
thing<00:02:49.170> you're<00:02:49.470> always<00:02:49.620> compromising<00:02:50.520> you

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
thing you're always compromising you

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.210 
thing you're always compromising you
don't<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.270> that's<00:02:52.140> really<00:02:52.410> cool

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
don't have to do that that's really cool

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.650 
don't have to do that that's really cool
