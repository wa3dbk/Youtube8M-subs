00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.740 

okay<00:00:10.640> your<00:00:10.970> first<00:00:11.360> step<00:00:11.770> in<00:00:12.770> solving<00:00:13.120> 84<00:00:14.120> x<00:00:14.390> 4

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
okay your first step in solving 84 x 4

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.930 
okay your first step in solving 84 x 4
is<00:00:15.670> solving<00:00:16.670> these<00:00:17.200> centerpieces<00:00:18.200> as<00:00:19.040> you<00:00:19.790> can

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
is solving these centerpieces as you can

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.620 
is solving these centerpieces as you can
tell<00:00:20.000> there<00:00:20.690> is<00:00:20.930> no<00:00:21.230> said<00:00:21.650> centerpiece<00:00:22.360> so<00:00:23.360> we

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
tell there is no said centerpiece so we

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.890 
tell there is no said centerpiece so we
had<00:00:23.869> to<00:00:24.170> figure<00:00:25.010> out<00:00:25.400> how<00:00:26.029> we<00:00:26.090> can<00:00:26.419> get<00:00:26.599> the

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
had to figure out how we can get the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.279 
had to figure out how we can get the
centerpieces<00:00:27.619> in<00:00:27.800> there

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
centerpieces in there

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.679 
centerpieces in there
and<00:00:29.410> it's<00:00:29.829> basically<00:00:30.820> common<00:00:31.480> knowledge

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
and it's basically common knowledge

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.280 
and it's basically common knowledge
right<00:00:32.320> here<00:00:32.710> you<00:00:33.070> have<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.870> there<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.260> a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
right here you have to but there is a

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.850 
right here you have to but there is a
rule<00:00:35.559> you<00:00:35.800> have<00:00:35.980> to<00:00:36.040> solve<00:00:36.460> two<00:00:37.860> opposite

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
rule you have to solve two opposite

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.439 
rule you have to solve two opposite
sides<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:40.000> these<00:00:40.660> two<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:42.219> these<00:00:42.760> two<00:00:43.000> or<00:00:43.180> the

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
sides so these two or these two or the

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.850 
sides so these two or these two or the
other<00:00:43.570> one<00:00:43.890> either<00:00:44.890> way<00:00:45.190> works<00:00:46.589> but<00:00:47.589> they<00:00:47.710> have

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
other one either way works but they have

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.549 
other one either way works but they have
to<00:00:47.890> be<00:00:48.129> opposite<00:00:48.729> colors<00:00:49.089> so<00:00:49.510> yellow<00:00:50.199> and

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
to be opposite colors so yellow and

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.450 
to be opposite colors so yellow and
white<00:00:51.570> red<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:52.600> orange<00:00:52.960> or<00:00:53.409> green<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.040> blue<00:00:54.250> I

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
white red and orange or green and blue I

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.290 
white red and orange or green and blue I
prefer<00:00:55.059> green<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.720> blue<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.370> we'll<00:00:57.909> start<00:00:58.030> on

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
prefer green and blue so we'll start on

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.829 
prefer green and blue so we'll start on
that<00:00:58.449> we<00:00:59.320> find<00:01:00.120> look<00:01:01.120> we<00:01:01.269> have<00:01:01.420> two<00:01:01.600> blue

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
that we find look we have two blue

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.180 
that we find look we have two blue
pieces<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.460> they're<00:01:03.790> not

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
pieces but they're not

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.070 
pieces but they're not
where<00:01:05.850> they're<00:01:06.060> supposed<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.510> they're<00:01:06.840> not

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
where they're supposed to be they're not

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.100 
where they're supposed to be they're not
we<00:01:07.740> want<00:01:07.980> them<00:01:08.160> to<00:01:08.190> be<00:01:08.340> paired<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:09.090> either<00:01:09.750> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
we want them to be paired up either this

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.190 
we want them to be paired up either this
way<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.800> way<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.490> way<00:01:11.550> or<00:01:11.940> this<00:01:12.090> way

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
way or this way or this way or this way

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.010 
way or this way or this way or this way
however<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.310> top<00:01:14.550> layer<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.810> blue

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
however on the top layer we have a blue

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.690 
however on the top layer we have a blue
piece<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.810> this

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
piece and because this that's with this

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.050 
piece and because this that's with this
we<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.910> line<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.120> up<00:01:22.460> now<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.940> work

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
we just line it up now we have to work

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
we just line it up now we have to work
for<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> other<00:01:24.510> blue<00:01:24.780> piece<00:01:25.020> which<00:01:25.260> is<00:01:25.380> right

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
for the other blue piece which is right

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.470 
for the other blue piece which is right
here<00:01:26.690> now<00:01:27.690> if<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.800> that<00:01:29.070> we've<00:01:30.060> broken

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
here now if we just do that we've broken

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.210 
here now if we just do that we've broken
this<00:01:31.320> last<00:01:32.070> section<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.750> did<00:01:34.050> so<00:01:34.800> we

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
this last section that we just did so we

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.610 
this last section that we just did so we
line<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.760> then<00:01:36.690> we<00:01:36.810> push<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.140> out<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
line it up then we push it out of the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.320 
line it up then we push it out of the
way<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.360> then<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.540> line<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.860> air<00:01:41.220> back<00:01:41.550> up<00:01:41.790> so

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
way and then we line this air back up so

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.130 
way and then we line this air back up so
we<00:01:42.450> now<00:01:42.660> have<00:01:42.690> two<00:01:43.140> pairs<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.470> blue<00:01:44.750> now<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
we now have two pairs of blue now you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
we now have two pairs of blue now you
want<00:01:46.410> them<00:01:46.620> to<00:01:47.690> be<00:01:48.690> on<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:50.070> side<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.479> order

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
want them to be on one side so in order

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.380 
want them to be on one side so in order
to<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:53.190> select<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.640> side<00:01:53.940> so

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to do this you just select the side so

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
to do this you just select the side so
let's<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.440> blue<00:01:55.620> is<00:01:55.800> closer<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> each

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
let's get the blue is closer to each

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.800 
let's get the blue is closer to each
other<00:01:57.080> so<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.470> put<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.160> one<00:01:59.370> layer

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
other so you just put it up to one layer

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.219 
other so you just put it up to one layer
clothes<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.740> within<00:02:02.370> one<00:02:02.820> side<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
clothes right one within one side of the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.160 
clothes right one within one side of the
other<00:02:04.440> pair<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
other pair and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.650 
other pair and
then<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.830> make<00:02:08.490> sure<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.940> they<00:02:09.090> line<00:02:09.390> up

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
then you make sure that they line up

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.430 
then you make sure that they line up
they<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.470> line<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:11.959> otherwise<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.230> won't

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
they have to line up otherwise it won't

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.860 
they have to line up otherwise it won't
work<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.730> new<00:02:14.880> algorithm<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.810> I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
work and it's a new algorithm and I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.449 
work and it's a new algorithm and I
don't<00:02:16.080> have<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.260> piece<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> paper<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.280> i'll<00:02:17.400> just

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
don't have a piece of paper so i'll just

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.440 
don't have a piece of paper so i'll just
edit<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.270> i<00:02:19.400> will<00:02:20.400> with<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> other<00:02:20.880> ones<00:02:21.150> so

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
edit it in i will with the other ones so

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.250 
edit it in i will with the other ones so
the<00:02:22.349> algorithm<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.830> new<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
the algorithm is and this is new and

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.030 
the algorithm is and this is new and
when<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.290> say<00:02:29.150> when<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> say<00:02:30.239> prime<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:31.680> going

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
when I say when I say prime it's going

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.370 
when I say when I say prime it's going
to<00:02:32.130> mean<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.580> two<00:02:33.540> layers<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.200> it's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
to mean the two layers that it's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.690 
to mean the two layers that it's
connected<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.890> its<00:02:35.100> not<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.280> going<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.640> be

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
connected to its not just going to be

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.190 
connected to its not just going to be
the<00:02:35.819> outer<00:02:36.120> layer<00:02:36.450> but<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.810> also<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.140> to

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the outer layer but it's also going to

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.130 
the outer layer but it's also going to
be<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.470> inner<00:02:37.680> later<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.640> if<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.819> say<00:02:39.030> L<00:02:39.720> prime

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
be the inner later so if I say L prime

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.080 
be the inner later so if I say L prime
which<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.709> what<00:02:40.980> we're<00:02:41.100> going<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.400> we're

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
which is what we're going to do we're

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.280 
which is what we're going to do we're
going<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.540> do<00:02:42.720> L<00:02:43.019> prime<00:02:43.410> inverted<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.290> L

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
going to do L prime inverted so L

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.670 
going to do L prime inverted so L
inverted<00:02:46.799> looks<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:48.200> L<00:02:49.200> prime

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
inverted looks like this L prime

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.820 
inverted looks like this L prime
inverted<00:02:50.220> looks<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:52.680> we<00:02:52.739> have

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
inverted looks like this so now we have

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.130 
inverted looks like this so now we have
the<00:02:53.010> blue<00:02:53.190> on<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.489> top<00:02:53.700> layer<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.440> do<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:56.310> you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
the blue on the top layer we do to you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.640 
the blue on the top layer we do to you
so<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:58.350> just<00:02:58.650> switched<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.459> up<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:01.319> did<00:03:01.470> up

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
so we just switched it up so we did up

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.670 
so we just switched it up so we did up
twice<00:03:02.239> then<00:03:03.239> we<00:03:03.600> do<00:03:03.780> L<00:03:04.140> prime<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:05.209> there<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.330> is

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
twice then we do L prime and there it is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.100 
twice then we do L prime and there it is
now<00:03:07.680> we<00:03:07.739> need<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.010> find<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.640> Greens<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.690> match

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
now we need to find the Greens to match

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.980 
now we need to find the Greens to match
on<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.739> layer<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:12.000> make<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.209> opposite

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
on this layer to make it opposite

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.700 
on this layer to make it opposite
here's<00:03:14.650> one<00:03:14.890> there's<00:03:15.820> another<00:03:16.180> but<00:03:17.020> if<00:03:17.260> we<00:03:17.290> do

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
here's one there's another but if we do

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.700 
here's one there's another but if we do
this<00:03:18.270> that's<00:03:19.270> not<00:03:19.540> going<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.990> line<00:03:20.170> up<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.620> we

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
this that's not going to line up so we

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.340 
this that's not going to line up so we
have<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.070> move<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.490> where<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.790> will<00:03:21.970> line<00:03:22.240> up

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
have to move it where it will line up

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.610 
have to move it where it will line up
and<00:03:23.350> we<00:03:24.250> just<00:03:24.520> broke<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.760> off<00:03:25.240> so<00:03:25.840> we<00:03:26.350> want<00:03:26.560> to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
and we just broke that off so we want to

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.590 
and we just broke that off so we want to
move<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:26.920> green<00:03:27.130> out<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.670> way<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.150> move

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
move the green out of the way and move

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.100 
move the green out of the way and move
the<00:03:28.840> blue<00:03:29.230> back<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.940> now<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:31.150> find<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.900> other

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
the blue back so now we find the other

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.680 
the blue back so now we find the other
green<00:03:32.560> which<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.100> right<00:03:33.310> here

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.710 

now<00:03:38.320> they're<00:03:38.650> paired<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.970> we<00:03:40.270> didn't<00:03:40.510> mess

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
now they're paired and we didn't mess

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.590 
now they're paired and we didn't mess
any<00:03:40.960> of<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.260> up<00:03:41.760> now<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:42.820> have<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.210> line<00:03:43.450> up

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
any of this up now you have to line up

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.930 
any of this up now you have to line up
the<00:03:43.690> Greens<00:03:43.960> so<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.070> that<00:03:45.310> will<00:03:45.400> be<00:03:45.520> lined<00:03:45.790> up

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
the Greens so that that will be lined up

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.160 
the Greens so that that will be lined up
and<00:03:46.210> then<00:03:46.690> it'll<00:03:46.870> take<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.380> spot<00:03:48.360> due<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.810> you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
and then it'll take it spot due to you

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.350 
and then it'll take it spot due to you
and<00:03:50.730> then<00:03:51.730> our<00:03:52.330> prime<00:03:52.750> inverted<00:03:53.290> so<00:03:54.360> that's

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
and then our prime inverted so that's

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.200 
and then our prime inverted so that's
pretty<00:03:55.660> much<00:03:55.870> common<00:03:56.260> sense<00:03:56.290> as<00:03:56.740> it<00:03:56.890> is<00:04:00.210> your

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
pretty much common sense as it is your

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.840 
pretty much common sense as it is your
next<00:04:01.480> step<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.840> solving<00:04:02.050> these<00:04:02.850> middle

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
next step to solving these middle

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.930 
next step to solving these middle
sections<00:04:04.810> these<00:04:05.170> metal<00:04:05.500> layers<00:04:05.740> because<00:04:06.310> you

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
sections these metal layers because you

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.690 
sections these metal layers because you
have<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.570> you<00:04:08.200> do<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.800> put<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.430> two

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
have and you do this you put the two

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.340 
have and you do this you put the two
salt<00:04:10.060> sides<00:04:10.930> centers<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.570> outside<00:04:14.020> you

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
salt sides centers on the outside you

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.310 
salt sides centers on the outside you
want<00:04:14.560> them<00:04:14.650> in<00:04:14.830> your<00:04:14.890> hands<00:04:15.370> like<00:04:16.209> this<00:04:16.320> now

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
want them in your hands like this now

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.610 
want them in your hands like this now
you<00:04:17.350> want<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.950> solve<00:04:18.190> these<00:04:18.670> centerpieces<00:04:19.620> so

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
you want to solve these centerpieces so

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.530 
you want to solve these centerpieces so
you<00:04:20.680> find<00:04:21.400> them<00:04:21.640> but<00:04:21.850> you<00:04:21.940> have<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.150> match<00:04:22.330> them

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
you find them but you have to match them

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.290 
you find them but you have to match them
up<00:04:22.630> pretty<00:04:22.900> good<00:04:23.140> like<00:04:23.560> this<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.550> red<00:04:25.030> and

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
up pretty good like this is a red and

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.840 
up pretty good like this is a red and
this<00:04:25.450> is<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:25.630> yellow<00:04:25.990> now<00:04:26.560> if<00:04:26.680> we<00:04:26.830> find<00:04:27.100> red<00:04:27.610> and

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
this is a yellow now if we find red and

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.450 
this is a yellow now if we find red and
yellow<00:04:28.650> we<00:04:29.650> must<00:04:30.060> move<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.920> it<00:04:33.220> works

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
yellow we must move it so that it works

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.240 
yellow we must move it so that it works
now<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.000> pair<00:04:34.420> them<00:04:34.570> up<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.890> move<00:04:36.100> them

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
now you pair them up and you move them

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.670 
now you pair them up and you move them
out<00:04:36.400> of<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.580> way<00:04:36.730> so<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.390> if<00:04:37.630> i<00:04:37.750> do<00:04:37.810> this<00:04:38.230> it

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
out of the way so that if i do this it

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.340 
out of the way so that if i do this it
won't<00:04:39.310> break<00:04:39.580> them<00:04:39.760> up<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.780> might<00:04:40.990> have<00:04:41.170> to

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
won't break them up you might have to

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.290 
won't break them up you might have to
break<00:04:41.590> them<00:04:41.740> up<00:04:41.919> occasionally<00:04:42.280> in<00:04:42.910> order<00:04:43.150> to

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
break them up occasionally in order to

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.020 
break them up occasionally in order to
get<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.660> whole<00:04:43.840> entire<00:04:44.310> part<00:04:45.310> of<00:04:45.460> its<00:04:45.640> salt

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
get the whole entire part of its salt

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.590 
get the whole entire part of its salt
on<00:04:47.410> you'll<00:04:48.410> get<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:49.360> now<00:04:50.360> we're<00:04:50.570> on<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:52.600> solving

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
on you'll get it now we're on to solving

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.590 
on you'll get it now we're on to solving
these<00:04:54.460> new<00:04:55.460> centerpieces<00:04:56.180> they're<00:04:56.390> all

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
these new centerpieces they're all

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.930 
these new centerpieces they're all
paired<00:04:56.930> but<00:04:57.740> they're<00:04:57.920> not<00:04:58.070> in<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.430> right<00:04:58.580> spot

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
paired but they're not in the right spot

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
start with the white side so there's a

white sign and there's a white side so
you<00:05:07.580> line<00:05:07.940> them<00:05:08.120> up

now<00:05:24.840> here's<00:05:25.710> how<00:05:25.800> I<00:05:25.949> think<00:05:26.070> of<00:05:26.400> it<00:05:26.550> when<00:05:26.789> you

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
now here's how I think of it when you

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.350 
now here's how I think of it when you
have<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.300> white<00:05:27.600> on<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:27.990> top<00:05:29.210> because<00:05:30.210> you

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
have the white on the top because you

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.540 
have the white on the top because you
want<00:05:30.570> these<00:05:30.840> sides<00:05:31.289> in<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:31.860> right<00:05:32.039> spot<00:05:32.370> you

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
want these sides in the right spot you

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.980 
want these sides in the right spot you
don't<00:05:32.789> want<00:05:32.970> them<00:05:33.090> in<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.270> wrong<00:05:33.449> spot<00:05:33.780> it's

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
don't want them in the wrong spot it's

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.689 
don't want them in the wrong spot it's
very<00:05:34.199> important<00:05:35.750> white<00:05:36.750> is<00:05:36.900> on<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.139> top<00:05:37.320> and

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
very important white is on the top and

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.340 
very important white is on the top and
we<00:05:38.699> should<00:05:38.940> be<00:05:39.060> facing<00:05:39.570> you<00:05:39.870> towards<00:05:40.289> your

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
we should be facing you towards your

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.120 
we should be facing you towards your
right<00:05:40.620> side<00:05:40.919> towards<00:05:41.759> your<00:05:42.210> right<00:05:42.509> hand<00:05:43.130> red

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
right side towards your right hand red

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.400 
right side towards your right hand red
is<00:05:44.520> in<00:05:44.820> your<00:05:45.030> left<00:05:45.479> facing<00:05:46.199> hand<00:05:46.680> so<00:05:47.580> this

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
is in your left facing hand so this

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.460 
is in your left facing hand so this
decide

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:06:01.170 

so<00:05:52.070> you<00:05:52.130> find<00:05:52.460> written<00:05:52.990> there's<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.080> red

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.420 

now<00:06:01.720> we<00:06:01.780> didn't<00:06:02.169> mess<00:06:02.289> up<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:02.620> white<00:06:02.770> side<00:06:03.039> but

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
now we didn't mess up the white side but

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.340 
now we didn't mess up the white side but
we<00:06:03.610> still<00:06:03.850> don't<00:06:04.000> have<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.449> red<00:06:04.690> so<00:06:05.050> we<00:06:05.199> have

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
we still don't have the red so we have

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.529 
we still don't have the red so we have
to<00:06:05.500> line<00:06:05.830> up<00:06:06.160> the<00:06:06.190> Reds<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:09.240> put<00:06:10.240> them<00:06:10.419> in

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
to line up the Reds and put them in

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:16.260 
to line up the Reds and put them in
place<00:06:12.960> now<00:06:13.960> because<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:15.370> top<00:06:15.610> layer<00:06:15.850> is<00:06:16.030> white

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
place now because the top layer is white

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.740 
place now because the top layer is white
the<00:06:16.780> bottom<00:06:17.139> layer<00:06:17.320> has<00:06:17.560> to<00:06:17.740> be<00:06:17.889> yellow<00:06:18.490> so<00:06:18.850> we

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
the bottom layer has to be yellow so we

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.290 
the bottom layer has to be yellow so we
move<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.620> oranges<00:06:22.259> into<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:24.610> last<00:06:24.910> fitting

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
move the oranges into the last fitting

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.360 
move the oranges into the last fitting
spot<00:06:25.539> and<00:06:26.430> all<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.580> centers<00:06:27.880> are<00:06:28.030> solved
