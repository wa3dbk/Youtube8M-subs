00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
sleeve from the upper portion this can

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.299 
sleeve from the upper portion this can
be<00:00:43.110> tricky<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.559> I'm<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> show<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.040> how

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
be tricky but I'm going to show you how

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.279 
be tricky but I'm going to show you how
you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.079> makes

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you can do that one thing that makes

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.700 
you can do that one thing that makes
this<00:00:46.559> alteration<00:00:47.039> possible<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.710> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
this alteration possible is that the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.220 
this alteration possible is that the
sleeve<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.489> same<00:00:50.789> width<00:00:51.149> pretty<00:00:52.020> much

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
sleeve is the same width pretty much

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.189 
sleeve is the same width pretty much
from<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.610> down<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
from here to here down so you have to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
from here to here down so you have to
make<00:00:55.379> sure<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:56.160> sleeve<00:00:56.399> doesn't<00:00:56.670> come

make sure that your sleeve doesn't come

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.819 
make sure that your sleeve doesn't come
down<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.360> an<00:00:57.449> angle<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> does<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
down in an angle because if it does you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.080 
down in an angle because if it does you
will<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.309> able<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.730> alteration

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
