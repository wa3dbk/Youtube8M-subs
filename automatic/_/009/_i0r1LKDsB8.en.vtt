00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.459
 because no he already is 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.350
 create a label 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.860
 all close the folder she is no longer us 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.080
 required all shut down now 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.430
 we will start it will be necessary to start game from 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.000
 you will have two labels for 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.910
 run like a standard here xvm-stat 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.980
 Now let's run to their flocks the 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:51.239
 there is now running such a window now 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:53.690
 we must wait she will now start the game all 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.070
 this game starts 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.610
 Now this whole thing will be downloaded from us 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.610
 have entered 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.330
 all entered the game here you can see 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.400
 even here it is here to achieve your 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.820
 achievements here you will already be seen 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.970
 there are all these things there are shorter there 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.190
 figure it out yourself what's there for somewhere 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.850
 In my efficiency, this percentage 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.280
 victories 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.030
 here, too, I will not remember exactly 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.950
 so do not give into the battle we go in we go into battle 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.140
 now just demonstrate how she is 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.910
 the whole thing looks in narva zile in many 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:44.440
 people there are a deer stand here you see how 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:47.950
 we have all shown here as Che fights 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.950
 I'll show you now 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.090
 that's all in general whether it is not measures 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.939
 installed here we have all shown 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.400
 red is a very bad player yellow 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.799
 this middle blue play is 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.850
 good player 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:21.259
 you can even see here statistics 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:27.410
 the percentage of victories that is like this 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:29.389
 Now Iâ€™m gone to close here so that you 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.889
 for example, and without a deer game run 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.560
 but we will also be installed there 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.550
 just go through an ordinary geologist 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.910
 through world of tanks 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.340
 that's all it all put huskies not 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.650
 forget how and leave comments 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.419

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.250
