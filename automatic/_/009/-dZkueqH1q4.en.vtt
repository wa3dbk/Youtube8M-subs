said they had decent pigmentation um

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.609 
said they had decent pigmentation um
they<00:01:54.329> definitely<00:01:54.570> were<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.439> build

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
they definitely were like you can build

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.350 
they definitely were like you can build
them<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:55.829> they<00:01:56.549> definitely<00:01:56.790> weren't<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.329> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
them up they definitely weren't like a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330
