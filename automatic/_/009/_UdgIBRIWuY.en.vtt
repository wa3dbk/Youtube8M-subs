00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.220
 i 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.680
 hello a couple of weeks ago I was in a 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.660
 blog trip in the jerte valley as 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.029
 you know well is well known for its 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.000
 cherries and especially by the pillories 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.640
 which are very peculiar cherries without 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.220
 tail with smoother meat and flavor 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.169
 very characteristic we saw how it collects in 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.180
 the cherries that as you have seen is a 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.820
 hand and then how they are packaged for their 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.100
 distribution 70% of the pillions are 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.110
 they are eaten by the English who are very fans 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.890
 the cherry pillory but here also 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.890
 can enjoy 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.560
 when we have seen this once we are going to 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.540
 make a recipe that I recommend you 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.220
 once at least try it because 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.620
 has a different touch to gazpacho 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.090
 Traditional approve worth it 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.550
 first thing we do is wash the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.240
 cherries and once clean we removed 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.240
 bone 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.570
 and we put them in the glass of the blender 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.440
 then we peel the tomatoes 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 and we add them 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.760
 we also put a small green pepper 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.940
 a tender onion also small and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.940
 this case we will not put neither cucumber nor 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.940
 we pepper 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.900
 a good spoonful of vinegar and the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.790
 extra virgin olive oil not 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.530
 this may be missing, you can beat it and go 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.830
 testing oil salt and go 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.830
 rectifying 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.390
 finally to discard all 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.370
 tomato and cherry skins that can 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.550
 it is better to pass it through a colander 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.550
 fine 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.500
 ah 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.630
 and this is already what you can decorate with a 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.070
 little bit of basil and this is easy and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.910
 very rich but that you have liked a 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.910
 hug until then
