00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
in my opinion I would prefer to go for

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
in my opinion I would prefer to go for
the<00:01:13.799> shiny<00:01:14.490> contracts<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.299> you'll<00:01:15.960> be

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the shiny contracts because you'll be

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.960 
the shiny contracts because you'll be
able<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.590> make<00:01:16.740> more<00:01:16.950> coins<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.580> them

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
able to make more coins out of them

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.969 
able to make more coins out of them
rather<00:01:18.240> than<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.720> normal<00:01:19.080> contracts<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
rather than the normal contracts I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.100 
rather than the normal contracts I
prefer<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> shiny<00:01:20.880> ones<00:01:21.180> because<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.900> can

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
prefer the shiny ones because you can

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.070 
prefer the shiny ones because you can
make<00:01:22.350> about<00:01:22.700> 150<00:01:23.700> coins<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.270> them<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
make about 150 coins on them and the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
make about 150 coins on them and the
normal<00:01:25.439> ones<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.920> only<00:01:26.100> make<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> maximum

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
normal ones you can only make a maximum

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.480 
normal ones you can only make a maximum
100<00:01:27.299> coins<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.049> them<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
100 coins on them I think this is one of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.609 
100 coins on them I think this is one of
the<00:01:29.640> best<00:01:29.850> ways<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.299> making<00:01:30.689> coins<00:01:30.930> because<00:01:31.409> if

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
