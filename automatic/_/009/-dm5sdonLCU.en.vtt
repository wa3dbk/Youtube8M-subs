00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
bigger so I wanted the axe to be not too

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.450 
bigger so I wanted the axe to be not too

big so I used that but I tried to make

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.789 
big so I used that but I tried to make
the<00:01:11.909> axe<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.390> blue<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:12.990> possible<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> make<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the axe as blue as possible to make it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.580

look<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.430> made<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> diamonds<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.590> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
