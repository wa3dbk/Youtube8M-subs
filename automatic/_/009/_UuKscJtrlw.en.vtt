00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
as well so let's just tap money home

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.890 
as well so let's just tap money home
button<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.110> then<00:02:30.110> go<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.530> duel<00:02:30.770> jump<00:02:31.900> and

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
button and then go and duel jump and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.680 
button and then go and duel jump and
then<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> resume<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.970> as<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.240> can<00:02:35.300> see<00:02:35.360> I

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
then have a resume and as you can see I

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.270 
then have a resume and as you can see I
have<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.230> many<00:02:36.320> rockets<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.460> it's<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:39.280> suga

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
have so many rockets so it's just suga

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.740 
have so many rockets so it's just suga

only rockets so oh my god there are so
many<00:02:48.380> rockets<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.790> just<00:02:50.270> endless<00:02:50.750> I

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
many rockets and this is just endless I

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.500 
many rockets and this is just endless I
mean<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.260> can<00:02:51.440> get<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.800> very<00:02:52.580> high<00:02:52.670> score<00:02:52.850> but<00:02:53.390> I

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
mean you can get a very high score but I

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.110 
mean you can get a very high score but I
don't<00:02:53.900> know<00:02:54.080> if<00:02:54.320> this<00:02:54.500> works<00:02:54.860> online<00:02:55.250> so<00:02:55.820> you'd

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
don't know if this works online so you'd

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.690 
don't know if this works online so you'd
have<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.510> try<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.750> out<00:02:56.870> yourself<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:57.680> it's<00:02:58.310> just

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
have to try it out yourself so it's just

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.810 
have to try it out yourself so it's just
half<00:02:59.140> some<00:03:00.140> other<00:03:00.350> settings<00:03:00.770> turn<00:03:01.010> on<00:03:01.250> let's

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
half some other settings turn on let's

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.340 
half some other settings turn on let's
let's<00:03:02.570> say<00:03:04.270> platforms<00:03:05.270> in<00:03:05.420> one<00:03:05.570> line<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.110> then

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
let's say platforms in one line and then

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.470 
let's say platforms in one line and then
have<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.680> want<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.010> turn<00:03:07.220> off<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.760> then<00:03:08.060> let's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
have to want to turn off and then let's

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.480 
have to want to turn off and then let's
just<00:03:08.780> show<00:03:08.990> you<00:03:10.870> pursue<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.200> then<00:03:13.100> as<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.400> can

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
just show you pursue and then as you can

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.320 
just show you pursue and then as you can
see<00:03:13.550> platforms<00:03:14.510> are<00:03:14.690> in<00:03:15.230> one<00:03:15.470> line<00:03:15.709> here<00:03:16.100> and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
see platforms are in one line here and

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.670 
see platforms are in one line here and
it<00:03:17.330> makes<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.690> very<00:03:17.900> easy<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.350> play

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
it makes it very easy to play

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.729 
it makes it very easy to play
so<00:03:19.250> ask<00:03:19.610> asius<00:03:20.090> hack<00:03:20.450> works<00:03:20.750> really<00:03:21.320> well<00:03:21.530> I

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739
