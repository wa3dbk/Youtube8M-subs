 Terrestrial digital tuner 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.590
 I would like to introduce briefly 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:21.260

 It will be a very useful tuner at times 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.419
 I think that quite often because people say I want to watch TV on a PC 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:37.340
 Once I was about leave it with that technique TV pet I wonder if you need this guitar one

 12 of xz 3 io data 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.020
 It's like an external terrestrial digital tuner, so you can step into your computer's own sound PC 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.530
 It is not a type 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.790
 Compact Hey light'm quite tiny 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.940
 This is a gps ca tuner in moth Ji but I know in 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:07.860
 The contents of the package are the main unit and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.690
 We are a cable computer family of usb but we often find it on a television or recorder 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.950
 The b-cas car Dotteyuu Contains more 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.250
 There are many cards for exclusive use of terrestrial digital, but case gps cs 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.960
 There is a b-cas card that can be viewed. The b-cas card is the same. 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.090
 It is the appearance here 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:28.159
 Now it's ok if you're next time it 's the only setting on the main unit After incorporating it 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.149
 The Oh this usb accessories 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:37.180
 It is here at the antenna line inserted in raised 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:43.330
 Just plug in the antenna and you're ready to go 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:46.060
 The in usb side is stuck to the antenna outlet here of the antenna line your room 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.690
 It will be over if it is connected to there 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:56.110
 Though it is characteristic of this product by connecting thing 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.200
 PC connect to first at Tteyuu TV can be seen also in the smartphone also on a PC 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.189
 Claim software 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.600
 Because it is only to say that I will try to put the software in this 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.920
 I have not done much 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:11.900
 Where Tteyuu seen has become a pretty place features in a convenient in Sumaho 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:17.150
 When you want to watch terrestrial digital broadcasting with iphone or brochure 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:21.620
 It will be a way to say that I try to shake the radio wave here via the router 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.390
 It is necessary to put software in. Name I am different In case of iphone 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.739
 Is a TV player app 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:32.959
 In the case of ipad, it is a television streamer, so it's hi-phone and ipad 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:35.209
 The name of the app is different for some reason Sometimes this is a little bit too ipad sometimes ipad 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.140
 I watch terrestrial digital broadcasting in 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.880
 Consultation with this sound product 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.880
 It is quite useful because you can see the image 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.540
 It's your toilet Toka Hey nail and people can be seen 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.380
 I just have to pay attention a little bit of terrestrial digital tuners and bs tuners 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.840
 etc 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:58.580
 Wow, it's only for singles, and when ipad claims it 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.319
 I can not afford to turn the channel here, so I turn on the sound power of the PC 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.250
 You can not see it without it 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.940
 Hey I kind of feel that there is a Tteyuu not seen and do not start the software 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.590
 I wonder if this is the best feature of this product 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.830
 There is a function that you can fully record at up to 15 times full HD 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.700
 Full high-definition hunting 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:22.710
 Loaded with long working hours up to 15 can be well as it is loaded 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:27.720
 We can record digital broadcast program easily while saving hard disk space 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:33.819
 I tried to be a princess of the image quality, but I guess I can not say that luck is also beautiful 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:38.680
 But I can see myself but I can record for a long time 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:42.280
 If you try to take in the usual 0 a image quality are but people I think have noticed it you are 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:48.250
 I can only take about 185 hours on a hard disk such as certification 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:51.940
 It can record a huge amount of time, such as 1,800 hours when it takes 15 times this 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.650
 You may not have to do this far, but only in Uz's standard mode 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.940
 If you are recording high-definition voice 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:02.300
 City Terano hard disk is piled up 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:06.260
 I said I to be kept in check have you I think I'm a little dangerous buried 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:10.910
 There are a lot of people who are not enough just with the recording function of the tuner 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.260
 Do not worry because there is a recorder that say record two programs simultaneously 3 program simultaneous recording 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:18.850
 This tuner Starred teeth can 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:23.050
 If you say that, please see here. Even if the programs you want to record overlap, up to 8 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:29.199
 I'd is written Itcho here illustrations and you can channel simultaneous recording requires middle a little 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:33.310
 You're little bitty also be under the ne gv mvp xz 3 is the maximum I'm a four 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.249
 It in only the Tteyuu channel simultaneous and Le is put at not connect 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.019
 Built-in 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.619
 It seems to be a way of saying that you can get up to 8 channels by setting the group again in 4 quarters 

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:44.809
 is 

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:47.209
 So this terrestrial digital tuner that Bussan is using 4 at the maximum because be linked up to four 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:52.939
 It is to say the channel simultaneous can be recorded 

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:54.240
 It 's enough if you have 4 channels back then, because you have to buy three Bhubanes in the first place 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.229
 It's a little becomes flights 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:03.660
 By the way, I'm a person of your price but the product here 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:08.520
 10,000 yen a little so now I 'll buy four chaotic second microphones 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:12.060
 Whether the video of the which was recorded, of course kneaded Well then another good recorder times Ya Blue disk 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.260
 It is also possible to copy it to dvd and take it out 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.680
 It's too bad to talk about a terrestrial digital tuner 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.470
 In a league match 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.010
 Hey good we are winning in 2-to-0 in here. 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:28.760
 There is a menu called magic menu and it is an application 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:33.950
 It is claimed that a program is here or program schedule recording 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:37.880
 These items in the form of reproduction dubbing set you have is displayed clearly 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:43.670
 So, let's play a poisoned program to fit here 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:48.689
 Me to recommend facilitate understanding of the function of saying Toka to display program Science of Well unplayed Masuda 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:53.189
 From the PC I think that it is easy to understand if you only look at people who are not good at it 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:58.379
 Software called Magic tb gt when software is started in this way 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:06:04.790
 It becomes a form called terrestrial digital broadcasting is broadcasting You're This is pulled through 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:08.840
 I 'm hiding the screen here on the setting screen for a moment, but I 'm going to show the TV screen in this way 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.070
 You can also see the part of the sound on the desktop c Of course you can see it in full size 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.670
 Because you can also 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.150
 It is also possible to watch TV in Uz's 23 inch monitor full size 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.680
 I will 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:24.240
 It is but I was not allowed to the middle in a very brief description of 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:28.620
 I was asked to give a brief explanation 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:32.759
 It is useful to have something in the example letters . 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.750
 It is seen as it is in this place not think Innovation Let's go to tinged look at TV all the way I once 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.789
 I will 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.670
 The program to be in my mind it is possible to be recorded because you can record book, however I 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:45.340
 And of course 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:50.050
 Because it is a simple connection of that laptop computer or usb, it can be connected 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:56.830
 There is basically no problem with any PC. Large Macs are not compatible. 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:59.009
 It is also a little older PC because not so strict cedar grilled conditions of Toka 8 cpu 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:03.689
 I think you will probably see 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:05.240
 Since it would have been sold in the health I still try to check Once some people to be worried about 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:09.169
 What do you think 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:12.560
 Today 's Mr. Hit from a little bit of terrestrial digital tuner iodata 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:17.840
 gv mvp a 9 z 3 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:23.960
 Is a child Amelie's called'm recommendation on which there is also a separate video 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:28.750
 Just because it's time for the lightning to come suddenly 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:31.660
 Even if you have made a recording reservation, the person who goes out of the outlet of the PC will be out 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:35.050
 There is not much pain with the contract 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.310
 I 've been missing youkai medals many times 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.310
 It's Sotchinda me one of the body
