it looks like it's health gray and the
back<00:00:50.580> is<00:00:50.850> actually<00:00:51.299> green<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.220> we've<00:00:53.220> seen<00:00:53.580> in

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
back is actually green and we've seen in

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.149 
back is actually green and we've seen in
the<00:00:54.150> trailers<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.110> his<00:00:55.409> glider<00:00:55.739> was

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
the trailers that his glider was

the trailers that his glider was
actually<00:00:56.729> a<00:00:56.760> completely<00:00:57.510> green<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.320> it's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
actually a completely green so it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.530 
actually a completely green so it's
really<00:00:58.710> interesting<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.790> not<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.210> sure

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
really interesting I'm not really sure

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.229 
really interesting I'm not really sure
if<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.080> the<00:01:01.260> real<00:01:01.769> prop<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.850> field

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
if this is the real prop for the field

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.729 
if this is the real prop for the field
maybe<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.690> unfinished<00:01:04.049> maybe<00:01:04.470> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
maybe it's unfinished maybe that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
maybe it's unfinished maybe that
something<00:01:05.190> else<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.880> glider<00:01:06.119> appears<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
something else but the glider appears to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.469 
something else but the glider appears to

be health green health grey and it looks

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.090 
be health green health grey and it looks
slightly<00:01:09.780> different<00:01:10.049> than<00:01:10.619> what<00:01:10.680> we've<00:01:11.070> seen

and<00:01:55.130> now<00:01:56.130> he<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.399> inside<00:01:56.819> so<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:58.049> looking

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
and now he is inside so really looking

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.809 
and now he is inside so really looking
forward<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:59.039> appears<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.549> some

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
forward to be there appears to be some

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.789 
forward to be there appears to be some
blood<00:02:00.060> stains<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.659> his<00:02:00.840> face<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.590> most

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
blood stains on his face but it's most

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.660 
blood stains on his face but it's most
likely<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.119> his<00:02:03.539> mutation<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.579> you<00:02:05.579> know

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
likely you know his mutation or you know
if<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:05.909> wouldn't<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.359> inside<00:02:06.810> Oscorp<00:02:07.289> I<00:02:07.530> would

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
if it wouldn't be inside Oscorp I would

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.350 
if it wouldn't be inside Oscorp I would
suggest<00:02:07.889> that<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.399> way<00:02:08.520> he<00:02:08.700> looks<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.119> beaten

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
suggest that the way he looks so beaten

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.360 
suggest that the way he looks so beaten
