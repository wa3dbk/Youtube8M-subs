recommend the iPhone 5c now for me on

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.200 
recommend the iPhone 5c now for me on
price<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.310> pick<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.580> up<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.849> lot<00:00:27.000> cheaper

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
price you can pick this up a lot cheaper

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.939 
price you can pick this up a lot cheaper
than<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> iPhone<00:00:27.960> 5s

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
than the iPhone 5s

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.919 
than the iPhone 5s
especially<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:29.939> contract<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.779> probably

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
especially on contract you can probably

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
especially on contract you can probably
bargain<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.500> better<00:00:31.679> deal<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.250> then<00:00:32.460> you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
bargain a better deal with this then you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
bargain a better deal with this then you
could<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> 5s<00:00:33.210> because<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.630> essentially

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
could the 5s because it's essentially

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.250 
could the 5s because it's essentially
not<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> flagship<00:00:34.920> model<00:00:35.630> but<00:00:36.630> generally<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
not the flagship model but generally the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.500 
not the flagship model but generally the
price<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> bit<00:00:37.920> cheaper<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:39.000> me<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.149> saved

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
price is a bit cheaper for me I saved

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.850 
price is a bit cheaper for me I saved
the<00:00:39.629> hell<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.930> lot<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.140> money<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.410> contract

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the hell of a lot of money on contract

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.209 
the hell of a lot of money on contract
going<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> 5c<00:00:41.910> then<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.239> did<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:43.050> 5s<00:00:44.010> so

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
going for the 5c then I did the 5s so

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.680

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the the pink color which is obviously

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.279 
the the pink color which is obviously
the<00:00:53.280> same<00:00:53.760> model<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.989> obviously<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the same model just obviously a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.470 
the same model just obviously a
different<00:00:55.590> color<00:00:55.770> okay<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.940> my<00:00:57.059> that's<00:00:57.360> my

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
different color okay so the my that's my

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
different color okay so the my that's my
top<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.199> reason<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> top<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
top one reason that's the top of the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
top one reason that's the top of the
list<00:00:59.670> really<00:00:59.910> its<00:01:00.120> price<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.500> look

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
list really its price but if we look

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.349 
list really its price but if we look
around<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.010> next<00:01:02.250> four<00:01:02.489> things<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.910> also<00:01:03.059> think

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
around the next four things I also think

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.939 
around the next four things I also think
they're<00:01:03.480> quite<00:01:03.750> important<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.439> think<00:01:04.619> there's

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
they're quite important I think there's

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.440 
they're quite important I think there's
something<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> need<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.820> basically

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
something you need all basically

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
something you need all basically
consider<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:07.320> choosing<00:01:07.350> between<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.189> 5c

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
consider when choosing between the 5c

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.450 
consider when choosing between the 5c
and<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.970> 5s<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:10.680> still<00:01:10.950> got<00:01:11.100> very<00:01:11.340> very

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and the 5s now it still got very very

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.859 
and the 5s now it still got very very
good<00:01:11.549> specs<00:01:12.000> obviously<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> hasn't<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
good specs obviously it hasn't got the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.469 
good specs obviously it hasn't got the
latest<00:01:13.229> processor<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> 5s<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
latest processor like the 5s but the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.570 
latest processor like the 5s but the
processor<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.170> fast<00:01:16.470> enough<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> run<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
processor is fast enough to run all the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.100 
processor is fast enough to run all the
new<00:01:17.700> applications<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.780> thing<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
new applications that's one thing that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.770 
new applications that's one thing that
really<00:01:19.259> did<00:01:19.530> annoy<00:01:19.740> me<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.280> 4s<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
really did annoy me about my 4s is that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020 
really did annoy me about my 4s is that
all<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> applications<00:01:22.590> always<00:01:22.860> using<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
all the applications always using on the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.450 
all the applications always using on the
iOS<00:01:24.150> 7<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> come<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.310> obviously

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
iOS 7 and when it come out and obviously

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.550 
iOS 7 and when it come out and obviously
the<00:01:26.790> previous<00:01:27.270> generation<00:01:27.780> iOS<00:01:28.200> were

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the previous generation iOS were

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
the previous generation iOS were
crashing<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> time<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> forest

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
crashing all the time because the forest

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.609 
crashing all the time because the forest
just<00:01:30.420> couldn't<00:01:30.840> handle<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.470> its

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
just couldn't handle it with its

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.859 
just couldn't handle it with its
outdated<00:01:32.009> chip<00:01:32.400> processor<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
outdated chip processor so with the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.499 
outdated chip processor so with the
iPhone<00:01:34.229> 5c<00:01:34.799> obviously<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> update<00:01:35.759> processor

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
iPhone 5c obviously the update processor

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.870 
iPhone 5c obviously the update processor
it's<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.259> down<00:01:37.530> from<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> 5s<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.700> still

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it's one down from the 5s but it's still

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.090

do not like about them is the build
quality<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.079> cheap<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.439> nasty

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
quality I think it's cheap and nasty

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.550 
quality I think it's cheap and nasty
mase<00:02:02.850> nice<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.299> look<00:02:03.420> at<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.110> think

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
mase nice to look at but I just think

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.319 
mase nice to look at but I just think
your<00:02:04.770> when<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.159> my<00:02:05.280> hand<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:06.270> doesn't

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
your when it's in my hand it doesn't

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.029 
your when it's in my hand it doesn't
appeal<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.049> me<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.229> all<00:02:07.350> especially<00:02:07.950> it

appeal to me at all especially it

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.169 
appeal to me at all especially it
doesn't<00:02:08.280> appeal<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.520> me<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.000> more

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
doesn't appeal to me when it's more

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.930 
doesn't appeal to me when it's more
expensive<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.920> job<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.280> do<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.550> get

what the iPhone 5c has potentially had
to<00:02:23.840> take<00:02:24.050> there's<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.920> few<00:02:25.130> scratches<00:02:25.430> on<00:02:25.730> this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
to take there's a few scratches on this

going to cover weight pal now wait I've
noticed<00:02:50.120> when<00:02:50.210> obviously<00:02:50.360> hold<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.990> 5s<00:02:51.470> is

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
noticed when obviously hold the 5s is

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.040 
noticed when obviously hold the 5s is
very<00:02:52.100> very<00:02:52.370> light<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.790> for<00:02:53.510> me<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.660> like<00:02:54.020> to

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
very very light and for me I like to

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.110 
very very light and for me I like to
have<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.560> holiday<00:02:55.250> own<00:02:55.460> in<00:02:55.640> my<00:02:55.700> pocket<00:02:55.970> that's

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.360 
have a holiday own in my pocket that's
why<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.330> like<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> 4s<00:02:57.080> design<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.620> generally<00:02:58.130> I

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
why I like the 4s design I generally I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.790 
why I like the 4s design I generally I
generally<00:02:58.850> really<00:02:59.030> like<00:02:59.210> the<00:02:59.330> design<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.870> like

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
generally really like the design I like

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.290 
generally really like the design I like
the<00:03:00.920> fact<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.250> was<00:03:01.340> glass<00:03:01.670> on<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.000> front<00:03:02.120> the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
the fact it was glass on the front the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.960 
the fact it was glass on the front the
back<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:03.200> felt<00:03:03.440> quite<00:03:03.560> heavy<00:03:03.970> just

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
back and it felt quite heavy just

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.420 
back and it felt quite heavy just
generally<00:03:05.390> felt<00:03:05.570> nice<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.780> hold<00:03:06.280> could<00:03:07.280> be<00:03:07.400> a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
generally felt nice to hold could be a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.670 
generally felt nice to hold could be a
weight<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.820> it<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> felt<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.690> if<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.350> fall

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
weight to it you felt that if you fall

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.900 
weight to it you felt that if you fall
those<00:03:09.830> in<00:03:10.010> your<00:03:10.130> pocket<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.490> probably<00:03:10.790> would
