00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
because rook g8 and then Queen g75 so if

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.730 
because rook g8 and then Queen g75 so if
we<00:07:18.800> go<00:07:18.950> back<00:07:19.630> so<00:07:20.630> what<00:07:21.050> I<00:07:21.080> thought<00:07:21.350> was<00:07:21.500> king

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:21.740 
we go back so what I thought was king

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.090 
we go back so what I thought was king
eight<00:07:21.890> shades<00:07:22.190> rook<00:07:23.090> f7<00:07:23.690> here<00:07:23.990> is<00:07:24.200> strongly

fretting Queen g7 they've rook GA I

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.430 
fretting Queen g7 they've rook GA I
thought<00:07:27.830> this<00:07:28.100> is<00:07:28.370> quite<00:07:29.330> good<00:07:29.540> now<00:07:29.930> for<00:07:30.140> here

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
thought this is quite good now for here

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.030 
thought this is quite good now for here
double<00:07:31.250> check<00:07:31.490> and<00:07:31.880> mate<00:07:32.350> so<00:07:33.350> that<00:07:33.740> was<00:07:33.890> not

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.040 
double check and mate so that was not

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.740 
double check and mate so that was not
bad<00:07:34.280> I<00:07:34.640> think<00:07:35.390> if<00:07:35.540> that<00:07:35.720> really<00:07:35.930> does<00:07:36.470> work<00:07:37.750> and

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
bad I think if that really does work and

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.659 
bad I think if that really does work and
so<00:07:38.960> in<00:07:39.110> the<00:07:39.200> game<00:07:39.410> continuation<00:07:40.220> he's<00:07:40.520> just

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:40.669 
so in the game continuation he's just

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.140 
so in the game continuation he's just
letting<00:07:40.910> me<00:07:41.060> sank<00:07:41.330> on<00:07:41.800> on<00:07:42.800> g6

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.150 
letting me sank on on g6

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.830 
letting me sank on on g6
it's<00:07:45.150> it's<00:07:45.510> fairly<00:07:45.750> straightforward<00:07:46.910> here<00:07:47.910> as

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 
it's it's fairly straightforward here as

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.290 
it's it's fairly straightforward here as
