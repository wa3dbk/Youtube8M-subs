this is from a 1922 Buick we're familiar
with<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.750> made<00:00:24.930> by<00:00:24.960> Stewart<00:00:25.500> all<00:00:26.039> of

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
with this this is made by Stewart all of

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.930 
with this this is made by Stewart all of
these<00:00:26.670> wheels<00:00:27.230> they're<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.380> swollen<00:00:28.940> because

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
these wheels they're all swollen because

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.820 
these wheels they're all swollen because
they're<00:00:30.330> made<00:00:30.690> out<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.960> pop<00:00:31.170> metal<00:00:31.439> because

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
they're made out of pop metal because

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.920 
they're made out of pop metal because
that<00:00:32.430> was<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.699> cheapest<00:00:33.090> things<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> Warner

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that was the cheapest things to a Warner

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.320 
that was the cheapest things to a Warner
Cable<00:00:35.300> have<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> done<00:00:36.600> by<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.129> 1922<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:39.120> what

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
Cable have it done by in 1922 but what

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.180 
Cable have it done by in 1922 but what
we'll<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.720> is<00:00:39.900> we'll<00:00:40.080> replace<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.559> this

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
we'll do is we'll replace it this

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.689 
we'll do is we'll replace it this
particular<00:00:42.000> piece<00:00:42.320> with<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:44.190> modern

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
particular piece with the more modern

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.869 
particular piece with the more modern
one<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.300> came<00:00:45.540> up<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.290> think<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.040> 24

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
one that they came up with I think in 24

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.360 
one that they came up with I think in 24
we'll<00:00:48.479> take<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.900> odometer<00:00:49.199> out<00:00:49.979> of<00:00:50.190> this

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
we'll take the odometer out of this

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.880 
we'll take the odometer out of this
piece<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.420> complete<00:00:51.780> odometer<00:00:52.260> mechanism

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
piece the complete odometer mechanism

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.030 
piece the complete odometer mechanism
because<00:00:53.339> this<00:00:53.729> is<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.909> celluloid<00:00:54.570> piece<00:00:55.010> we<00:00:56.010> use

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
because this is a celluloid piece we use

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.250 
because this is a celluloid piece we use
that<00:00:56.519> to<00:00:56.729> replace<00:00:57.290> bees<00:00:58.290> this<00:00:59.449> apart<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.080> that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that to replace bees this apart so that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.479 
that to replace bees this apart so that
I<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.850> confirm<00:01:02.850> everything<00:01:03.299> that's<00:01:04.489> wrong

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I can confirm everything that's wrong

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.730 
I can confirm everything that's wrong
with<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.840 

he<00:01:14.340> pretty<00:01:14.579> much<00:01:14.700> knows<00:01:16.310> what<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> problems

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
he pretty much knows what the problems

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:52.890 
he pretty much knows what the problems
are<00:01:18.000> anyway<00:01:19.369> he<00:01:20.369> should<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.729> able<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> see

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.940 

only<00:01:53.900> once<00:01:55.630> okay<00:01:56.630> now<00:01:57.110> this<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.620> mechanism

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
only once okay now this is the mechanism

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.630 
only once okay now this is the mechanism
that<00:01:58.370> that<00:01:58.970> seizes<00:01:59.480> up<00:02:00.940> they<00:02:01.940> just<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.720> know

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
that that seizes up they just you know

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.730 
that that seizes up they just you know
have<00:02:04.640> gone<00:02:04.850> completely<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.810> there<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.290> lot<00:02:06.680> of

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
have gone completely in there a lot of

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.170 
have gone completely in there a lot of
times<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.700> we<00:02:07.850> do<00:02:08.000> have<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.300> inspect<00:02:08.990> this

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
times and we do have to inspect this

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.720 
times and we do have to inspect this
this<00:02:11.180> piece<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.630> seized<00:02:11.990> up<00:02:12.230> all<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:15.670> want<00:02:16.670> to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
this piece of seized up all I want to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.710 
this piece of seized up all I want to
look<00:02:16.850> at<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.120> rest<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.720> gears<00:02:18.020> don't<00:02:18.770> you

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
look at the rest of the gears don't you

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.670 
look at the rest of the gears don't you
this<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.250> fiber<00:02:22.250> gear<00:02:22.640> here<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:24.440> gets

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
this is a fiber gear here and this gets

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.030 
this is a fiber gear here and this gets
run<00:02:25.610> over<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:27.110> gear<00:02:27.440> will<00:02:27.590> have<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.890> be

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
run over that gear will have to be

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.880 
run over that gear will have to be
replaced<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.680> I'm<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.459> looking<00:02:31.820> at<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
replaced and I'm just looking at the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.350 
replaced and I'm just looking at the
gear<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.190> magnet<00:02:34.640> housing<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:38.030> make<00:02:38.060> sure

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
gear on the magnet housing to make sure

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.170 
gear on the magnet housing to make sure
that<00:02:38.510> all<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.810> teeth<00:02:39.020> are<00:02:39.200> there<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:40.459> was

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
that all the teeth are there this was

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.920 
that all the teeth are there this was
made<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:42.100> better<00:02:43.100> grade<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.430> pop<00:02:43.760> metal<00:02:44.150> it

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
made of a better grade of pop metal it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.600 
made of a better grade of pop metal it
didn't<00:02:45.200> swell<00:02:45.470> quite<00:02:45.770> as<00:02:45.950> badly<00:02:46.160> as<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
didn't swell quite as badly as the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.590 
didn't swell quite as badly as the
odometer<00:02:48.310> will<00:02:49.310> call<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.700> customer<00:02:49.880> tell<00:02:50.480> him

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
odometer will call the customer tell him

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.900 
odometer will call the customer tell him
that<00:02:50.780> he<00:02:51.380> has<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.530> problem<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.220> magnet<00:02:52.670> and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
that he has a problem in the magnet and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.140 
that he has a problem in the magnet and
a<00:02:53.510> problem<00:02:53.990> then<00:02:54.170> basically<00:02:55.070> this<00:02:55.370> complete

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
the take the tech commoner out of the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.010 
the take the tech commoner out of the
cup<00:05:16.550> so<00:05:17.550> that<00:05:17.700> I<00:05:17.730> can<00:05:17.970> test<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.390> to<00:05:18.510> see<00:05:18.540> if<00:05:18.870> the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
cup so that I can test it to see if the

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.020 
cup so that I can test it to see if the
meter<00:05:19.200> movement<00:05:19.410> is<00:05:19.710> good<00:05:22.610> this<00:05:23.610> one<00:05:23.820> we<00:05:24.000> just

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
meter movement is good this one we just

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.220 
meter movement is good this one we just
test<00:05:24.480> with<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.890> with<00:05:25.890> an<00:05:26.010> ohm<00:05:26.190> meter<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:27.810> next

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
test with a with an ohm meter the next

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.070 
test with a with an ohm meter the next
step<00:05:28.470> is<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:31.940> take<00:05:32.940> this<00:05:33.120> apart<00:05:33.510> see<00:05:33.840> what<00:05:33.990> the

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
step is to take this apart see what the

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.340 
step is to take this apart see what the
inside<00:05:34.440> looks<00:05:34.470> like<00:05:35.660> this<00:05:36.660> is<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.020> sending

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
inside looks like this is the sending

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.220 
inside looks like this is the sending
unit<00:05:37.410> for<00:05:37.919> what<00:05:38.910> will<00:05:39.090> wind<00:05:39.330> up<00:05:39.450> by<00:05:39.600> doing<00:05:39.660> and

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
unit for what will wind up by doing and

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.170 
unit for what will wind up by doing and
this<00:05:40.320> is<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.650> type<00:05:40.860> that<00:05:40.890> took<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.400> mercury

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
this is the type that took the mercury

and from here other ways these are

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.490 
and from here other ways these are
calibrated<00:05:57.330> it's<00:05:58.140> these<00:05:58.950> have<00:05:59.190> just<00:05:59.430> a<00:05:59.580> small

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
calibrated it's these have just a small

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.560 
calibrated it's these have just a small
potentiometer<00:06:01.500> so<00:06:02.160> this<00:06:02.520> unit<00:06:02.730> is<00:06:03.060> going<00:06:03.390> to
