00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
it wasn't for me stopping them we would

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.710 
it wasn't for me stopping them we would
have<00:05:57.289> already<00:05:57.409> had<00:05:57.650> a<00:05:57.680> breeding<00:05:57.919> take<00:05:58.190> place

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
have already had a breeding take place

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.140

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
but since I am extra cautious this time

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.439 
but since I am extra cautious this time
since<00:06:02.419> it<00:06:02.599> is<00:06:02.720> her<00:06:02.870> first<00:06:03.020> heat<00:06:03.229> cycle<00:06:03.470> I'm

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
since it is her first heat cycle I'm

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.029 
since it is her first heat cycle I'm
definitely<00:06:05.449> keeping<00:06:05.599> them<00:06:05.960> separated<00:06:06.710> as

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039
