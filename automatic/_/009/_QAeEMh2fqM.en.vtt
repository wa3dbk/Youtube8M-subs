00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.260
 for being in the final and then we will see that they are not that in my understanding 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.669
 doctrinal 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.529
 It's a thousand and five 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.070
 it's a little more sim 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.529
 than another version that has already passed here by the infolab amelie 8h 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.259
 the ipc format follows the design insisted as if it were an achievement 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.409
 the top finish came with the shiny 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:32.570
 here on the bottom with lining and matte which give it a little more 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.850
 simplicity 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.310
 the keyboard is generous and occupies the entire bottom of the netbook 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 the space between the keys is good 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.740
 the version we tested here in infolab is not yet adapted to Portuguese 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.070
 the touchpad has a good area and does not stay in low relief instead of small 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.050
 marbles to mark it 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.210
 that the button is not the only one on the right as well as the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.450
 left accepting clicks from both sides 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.190
 the screen of 10 see an inch is good and is not too bright the resolution 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.190
 is 1024 by 600 pixels here at the top of the screen is a camera of a 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.570
 3 mega pixels and the integrated microphone 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.219
 inside the settings are well put to the netbook lines 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.630
 the atomic processor model 280 this made garrett garrett 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.060
 I basically of 666 mega refis 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.320
 the item then quotes divided 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.540
 and has 60 gb of hd 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.340
 the version we tested has a set of home applications especially 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.070
 for ipc 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.979
 try voice command to test some functions 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.240
 but it only works in English 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.759
 the battery gave a show and lasted 5 hours and 29 minutes is unreal for those who need 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.160
 mobility 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.140
 here in Brazil there will be different versions of bacteria depending on the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.050
 number of cells there is practical talent I even clap function added to the bar 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.890
 spaces 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.690
 to control the use of the battery 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.040
 in the connectivity question with 1005 garten came back I got myself but still 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.939
 The connection 3g 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:17.359
 Outside the netbook has the right side inputs the dishes with the NIH microphone 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.679
 two usb and network collection did indeed 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:25.169
 There is also an entry for the card you receive or the mmc 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:31.199
 on the left side is an output vga and another one or receiving this version is 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.659
 reasonably light 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.769
 of paula reports zonta pilot but did not always strike 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.989
 this pattern disagrees that in Brazil from September and black well 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.419
 slowly one thousand three hundred reais
