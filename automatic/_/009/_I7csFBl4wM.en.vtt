00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.400
 that they had pure life 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.400
 good for said 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.390
 friends create crisis we repudiate many 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.150
 things and we have every right to 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.390
 repudiate our country I am also very 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.160
 patriot I do not love my country I love my 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.640
 Flag to me I do not land my origins 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.979

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.000
 independence, I'm all super patriot 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.580

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.240
 Mexico 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.240

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.830
 where they reserve 300 meters north 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:29.000
 from the old paper mill I do that 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.310

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.950

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.270
 people who may speak ill of the country 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.700
 because then I would start to see the 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.490
 bad things but I'm soaked the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.890

 Well, my papers are there 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.540
 I hope there is no impediment 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.540
 at least I have a business here and I hope 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.709
 that there are more special cases of 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.069
 associate with people in other 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.830
 things so I would love to share 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.270
 my time in Mexico and here even if it's a 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.790
 little bit more mexico because my children 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.410
 they are there but I would like to try 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.270
 another lifestyle that was the style of 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.190
 life that I lived in Monterrey in 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.080
 that time where people were good 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.780
 most of the people were good 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.780
 now everyone is said nonsense by 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.790
 social networks 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.040
 some steps we are becoming 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.430
 crazy on this planet 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.829
 you want to be attacked, you say 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.239
 ranting is almost like a no and what 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.030
 loudest of all what you are 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.299
 putting that way you're that person who 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.909
 is complicit in everything if you are not the 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:07.120
 better mirror you want to see as if a 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.450
 person reads their social networks is that 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.450
 person
