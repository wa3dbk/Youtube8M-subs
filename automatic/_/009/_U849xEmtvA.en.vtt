00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that and uh yeah so another thing that i

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.819 
that and uh yeah so another thing that i
want<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> talk<00:02:03.240> about<00:02:03.270> was<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.409> hit<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
want to talk about was we have to hit a

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.590 
want to talk about was we have to hit a
certain<00:02:05.219> mark<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.820> two<00:02:06.030> thousand<00:02:06.450> subscribers

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
certain mark of two thousand subscribers

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.719 
certain mark of two thousand subscribers
and<00:02:07.200> i<00:02:07.350> think<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> best<00:02:07.920> way<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.369> is

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and i think the best way to do that is

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.980 
and i think the best way to do that is
not<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.899> spam<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.709> stuff<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.340> random

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
not to just spam out stuff on random

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.410 
not to just spam out stuff on random
websites<00:02:12.320> but<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.130> actually<00:02:13.580> go<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> people

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
websites but to actually go to people

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.600 
websites but to actually go to people
that<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.630> know<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.680> not<00:02:15.800> real<00:02:16.160> life<00:02:16.400> people
