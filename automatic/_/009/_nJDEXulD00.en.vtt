00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello april month of contrasts but 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.280
 while the weather is strange summer resident does not work 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.590
 hardworking leads so to speak 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
 internal work preparing Vasiuk 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.340
 the new season of the eyes is now busy 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.410
 problem book, we learn from Natalia Rogacheva 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.109
 hello so many lovers 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.029
 flowers that we constantly go to 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.330
 the market in the store is already doing spring 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.279
 purchasing your favorite plants and what about 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.180
 do them when we buy them in 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.399
 packet with bare roots as we see 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.620
 spring all does not begin and does not begin but 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.510
 for example, I put in the fridge in my 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 the fridge is almost full 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.280
 half yes and such a trouble for many 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 so today we will see how 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.489
 you can tidy up the roots and remove not 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.370
 refrigerator and for example 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.250
 tidy up and clean or in a caisson 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.739
 or some basement cool for 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.750
 this we need a box 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.520
 ordinary plastic because 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.350
 paper can river fathers fall apart 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.470
 when you get him closer 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.939
 by the right time plastic here i am 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.220
 put the carton on the bottom 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.130
 but since he has a lot of holes 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.290
 spread a newspaper as we have 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.320
 always a universal remedy which 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.509
 helps us in many ways here are ours with you 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.180
 Box is ready to what to do now with 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.509
 Here we take this package with plants. 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.030
 here we have hosts of the same grade and here 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.460
 here are the hosts of another sort to tidy up 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.610
 skill is more compact in one box but what about 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.110
 then do not confuse for this we are with you 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.689
 First we get one sort of host from the package. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.939
 where are several tail their few 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.490
 you never have to look at them. 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.880
 they are generally going on now he blames 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.680
 skating rink we got them all messed up and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 leaves and roots 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.250
 neatly so that they are not strong 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.130
 to injure and not to tear chlorine is not necessary 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.320
 disassemble we disassemble them natasha what 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.740
 they have already made new shoots 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.030
 scary will these flies sleep 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.910
 the fact is that in caisson we have with you 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.460
 or in the basement always chandelier about 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.979
 degrees is not 0 and not minus therefore 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.170
 nothing with these sprouts will be but if 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.320
 even some plant will not like it 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.930
 here is this part she will die but the kidneys 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.030
 renewals will go again here let's 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.470
 let's see the escape already curve to very 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.170
 it will be difficult to drink 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.390
 but no matter what happens to it 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.070
 the package is even worse as there are roots on top 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.280
 and the sprout in general from the bottom and starts 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.240
 twist the tight loop so now 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.450
 We will see 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.220
 sprout remains on top necklace hang down 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.800
 down they are very long for this 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.680
 plants that we need we take 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.710
 about 10-15 centimeters in my palm 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.930
 I clamp the roots and everything that I cut below 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.640
 no matter the fact that all the roots are 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.860
 now due to which plants will be 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.660
 they will receive food from sides 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.460
 small hairs grow to 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.980
 and that's it they will fly our 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.560
 plants for what are these roots 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.330
 long when the manufacturer leaves them 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.180
 because they contain stock 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.190
 nutrients that plants and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.959
 first buds here this escape began 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.840
 eat in order to shoot at 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.280
 floor at a positive temperature 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.910
 now we need this cut 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.390
 process 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.880
 we will need a room in which we 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.130
 dip the root cut is certainly not 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.440
 only means to prevent 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.320
 decay and postpone this escape to 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.470
 side are preparing the next light that how 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.030
 yes he is just beginning but the city 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.030
 you must do the same with him 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.200
 here is one sort of host we have with you 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.680
 what are we going to do next for us 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.659
 it is needed now peat which 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.430
 left over fed can use 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:04:00.200
 for this box we put closer 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.099
 let's take one side of the box 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.689
 cake right on the newspaper which yes yes yes 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.939
 namana this slide will be needed in order 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.639
 to lay young plants on them 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.790
 here is this land torso he's wet them 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:17.620
 preserved the roots of this land a little 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.620
 peat we will add more 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.470
 we will fill a hill more we will see you 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.690
 slide made on the one hand here 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.990
 newspaper can be slightly priporoshit 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.330
 that 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.710
 peat or soil but nevertheless 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.389
 here is a little here newspaper to us in this 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.949
 case will help that is we save 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.099
 amount of peat or soil 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.320
 and the roots being just on the newspaper they are not 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:45.169
 whether because the newspaper will be like 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.990
 magic wand is not conducive 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.479
 the development of rot will remove excess moisture I 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.990
 waiting here we are laying roots so 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.860
 to. . growth was up roots were 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.560
 inclined 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.570
 of course they are not in a purely vertical 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.330
 direction but still so it will be 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.099
 better than germinating in a bag 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.099
 and make unnecessary branches we stack them 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.750
 near after some distance here have 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.849
 you and me both times the port entered the 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.860
 one row to the land that we are with you 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.800
 showered there from the pack yes she already 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.229
 dried up and in order to have a little bit 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.970
 was wetter and the plant still 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.770
 felt healthier with us 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.610
 have special stimulants with you 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.169
 growth him on supporting plant 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.199
 so here we are with you somewhere 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.099
 he is a solution everybody uses his mind 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.099
 each his own 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.289
 Now we need you to sort 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.789
 forgot to sign that is 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.279
 back in the picture 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.069
 here we have it and we need a cake 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:49.479
 sign on sticks 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:52.009
 or someone to make special bookmarks 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.169
 Now look at this root layer. 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.870
 must also be covered to 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:00.259
 cook the next row so we have with 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.689
 these are the transitions from the roots to you 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.370
 points of growth was slightly 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.189
 sprinkled with much plant 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.699
 it is not necessary here now we can 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:15.099
 cook second grade tab well here we are with 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:17.719
 you cleaned up look two varieties of host 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:21.710
 the place is still much you can run 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:23.360
 shop is not necessary to buy now 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.339
 soup all the bushes to be here 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.830
 continue to need others to grow 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:30.669
 can other breeding up to get you here 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.319
 for example and arts 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.950
 I would put here for example the gift measure 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:39.760
 who is coming now too 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:43.420
 the roots can be cruelly chopped 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.050
 overhang ash and everything else 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.050
 lay down
