00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.960
 good today we are here from the com va 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:13.410
 we do a little code lesson of 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:18.000
 the road with gta 5 popular games 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.000
 for that you need a car 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:33.930
 triangle no wes bush but what so 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:56.070
 is that being here and then right 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:59.159
 relay to the first auto a mobile auto 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:06.619
 it is gone we attach to belt on 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:06.619
 start it's gone we'll handle it well 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.850
 acquired well 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.369
 this was the case 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.390
 he covers 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:17.450
 when we stop we stop at 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:22.160
 time is severe then we go 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.160
 first rule the direction of circulation 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:41.820
 good traditionally so we stay 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.350
 sidewalks it's really optional 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.900
 since now the pollution has been 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:53.180
 settled so that's really also for 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.180
 feignies proud to the pavement 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.489
 we will change cars have 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.330
 little dented habit because of the dog 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.580
 how I fight already announced but good 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:19.220
 all that you are proud of 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:24.830
 so that's why as angers 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.660
 thank you to my pass navigo 4 in 2 5 times the 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:42.290
 moon hop 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:46.100
 do not hesitate a little contact I do not 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:51.850
 do not know it can be part of 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:54.100
 code of the road will have a red light 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.290
 and green 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.180
 it's gone as you can 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.540
 see there is a truck on the way to 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.370
 right 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.050
 so we can take the opposite direction 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.110
 to avoid trucks in order to 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:12.970
 thin up traffic or 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:18.760
 not what are we going for them is not a 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:25.680
 little tacos truck I think we're going 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.680
 to actually keep you eating can do more 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.370
 see more 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.910
 mouses 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.500
 you need something funny it's Algerian 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.430
 you have nothing 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.490
 I tend but I wanted but tracks 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.849
 cyclists and people alive killed 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.849
 someone 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:18.720
 it would not hurt 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.720
 it's not very flattering, but 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.669
 what's the hangover we're gonna 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.990
 listen as she struggles and we go 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.910
 dreaming that way a little more 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.910
 traditional 3.18
