really big and all that but I think I'm

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
really big and all that but I think I'm
pretty<00:00:44.340> strong<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.480> against<00:00:45.719> I

I<00:01:03.870> sometimes<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.680> didn't<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> book<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I sometimes I didn't get the book is it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.100 
I sometimes I didn't get the book is it
the<00:01:05.880> teens<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.450> were<00:01:06.570> playing<00:01:06.810> again<00:01:07.020> we

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the teens that were playing again we

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.390 
the teens that were playing again we
just<00:01:07.260> try<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> take<00:01:07.619> me<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> game<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
just try to take me out of the game and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
just try to take me out of the game and
I'll<00:01:08.490> let<00:01:08.580> me<00:01:08.729> catch<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> ball<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.420> my<00:01:09.930> team<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
I'll let me catch the ball so my team is

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.600 
I'll let me catch the ball so my team is
really<00:01:10.320> looking<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> lot<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.430> plays

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
really looking for me a lot of plays

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.160 
really looking for me a lot of plays
remain<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.119> me<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.720> hard<00:01:12.750> sometimes

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
remain for me so it was hard sometimes

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.600 
remain for me so it was hard sometimes
because<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.710> would<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:13.890> double<00:01:14.340> team<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
because they would just double team a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.950 
because they would just double team a
triple<00:01:14.880> T<00:01:15.030> me<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.360> couldn't<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
triple T me so I couldn't really get the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
triple T me so I couldn't really get the
ball<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> lot<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.790> didn't<00:01:18.299> show

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
ball a lot but I think I didn't show
