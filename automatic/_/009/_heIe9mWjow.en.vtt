00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
there I used to put conditioner

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.050 
there I used to put conditioner
underneath<00:02:28.340> my<00:02:29.620> gel<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.890> both<00:02:31.579> of<00:02:31.760> them<00:02:31.879> just

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
used to flake off so this will

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.300 
used to flake off so this will
definitely<00:02:34.370> give<00:02:35.030> your<00:02:35.209> gel<00:02:35.389> staying<00:02:35.780> power

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450

outcome

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
outcome

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.890 
outcome
interesting<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.519> note<00:02:43.549> anywhere<00:02:44.269> that<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.569> have

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
interesting to note anywhere that I have

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.459 
interesting to note anywhere that I have
the<00:02:45.310> dark<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.519> lovely<00:02:47.109> lightening<00:02:48.109> color

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:48.469 
the dark and lovely lightening color

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.309 
the dark and lovely lightening color
it's<00:02:49.189> a<00:02:49.459> bit<00:02:49.639> ashy<00:02:49.879> so<00:02:50.450> consider<00:02:51.079> that<00:02:51.139> when

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
it's a bit ashy so consider that when

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.920 
it's a bit ashy so consider that when
you<00:02:51.620> consider<00:02:52.129> putting<00:02:52.760> any<00:02:52.939> color<00:02:53.450> on<00:02:53.720> your

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
you consider putting any color on your

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.349 
you consider putting any color on your
hair<00:02:54.040> it's<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.159> bit<00:02:55.340> more<00:02:55.549> difficult<00:02:55.609> to<00:02:56.180> keep

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
hair it's a bit more difficult to keep

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.470 
hair it's a bit more difficult to keep
moisturized<00:02:57.109> and<00:02:57.409> defined<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:58.159> last<00:02:59.150> but<00:02:59.359> not

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
moisturized and defined and last but not

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.360 
moisturized and defined and last but not
least<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.959> put<00:03:00.169> the<00:03:00.319> Shea<00:03:00.530> Moisture<00:03:00.560> Carling

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
least I put the Shea Moisture Carling

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.159 
least I put the Shea Moisture Carling
souffle<00:03:01.790> on<00:03:01.939> the<00:03:02.060> top<00:03:02.269> for<00:03:03.010> frizz<00:03:04.010> control<00:03:04.250> and

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
souffle on the top for frizz control and

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.569 
souffle on the top for frizz control and
because<00:03:06.169> it<00:03:06.319> wouldn't<00:03:06.590> be<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.709> true<00:03:07.040> experiment

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
because it wouldn't be a true experiment

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.170 
because it wouldn't be a true experiment
without<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.540> wild<00:03:09.109> child<00:03:09.469> dimples<00:03:10.250> we<00:03:11.000> took

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
without that wild child dimples we took

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.149 
without that wild child dimples we took
a<00:03:11.239> few<00:03:11.510> pictures<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:12.019> show<00:03:12.439> you<00:03:12.500> how<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:12.919> all

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
a few pictures to show you how this all

00:03:13.159 --> 00:04:44.510 
a few pictures to show you how this all
played<00:03:13.760> out
