look<00:00:04.440> at<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> play<00:00:04.920> here<00:00:05.160> at<00:00:05.310> speed<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.879> then<00:00:05.970> go

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
look at a play here at speed and then go

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.750 
look at a play here at speed and then go
back<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.750> break<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:07.049> down<00:00:07.200> pretty<00:00:07.649> good<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.730> me

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
back and break it down pretty good to me

back and break it down pretty good to me
this<00:00:09.480> should<00:00:09.960> be<00:00:09.990> pretty<00:00:10.590> hard<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.070> follow<00:00:11.370> in

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
this should be pretty hard to follow in

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.280 
this should be pretty hard to follow in

farther<00:00:17.039> than<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.250> went<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> long<00:00:17.670> time<00:00:17.730> just

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
farther than I went a long time just

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.150 
farther than I went a long time just
because<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.050> game<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.470> actually<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.070> know

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
because the game is actually you know

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.790 
because the game is actually you know
playable<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:21.090> year<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:22.619> when<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
playable this year and you know when the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.290 
playable this year and you know when the
game<00:00:22.949> wasn't<00:00:23.160> playable<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.730> impacted<00:00:24.150> all

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
game wasn't playable and impacted all

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.540 
game wasn't playable and impacted all
areas<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.140> franchise<00:00:25.710> minigames

areas you know franchise minigames

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.000 
areas you know franchise minigames
everything<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.320> this<00:00:28.320> has<00:00:28.500> actually<00:00:28.650> been<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
everything so this has actually been a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.740 
everything so this has actually been a
pretty<00:00:29.189> rewarding<00:00:29.369> scenario<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> only<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
pretty rewarding scenario the only the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.179 
pretty rewarding scenario the only the
only<00:00:30.929> problem<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.830> really

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
only problem I have with it is really

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.010 
only problem I have with it is really
the<00:00:32.309> trade<00:00:32.610> logic<00:00:33.149> seems<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.660> way<00:00:33.809> off

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the trade logic seems to be way off

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.420 
the trade logic seems to be way off
especially<00:00:34.320> when<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> look<00:00:34.920> at<00:00:35.010> real<00:00:35.250> NFL

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
especially when you look at real NFL

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.119 
especially when you look at real NFL
trades<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.630> know<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.930> game<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.710> seems<00:00:37.890> like

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
trades you know this game it seems like

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.250 
trades you know this game it seems like
your<00:00:38.280> players<00:00:38.520> are<00:00:38.700> really<00:00:38.820> undervalued

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
your players are really undervalued

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
your players are really undervalued
there's<00:00:40.260> also<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.530> disconnect<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> player

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
there's also a disconnect in the player

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.150 
there's also a disconnect in the player
progression<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.079> player<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:44.040> know

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
progression and player you know

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
progression and player you know
production<00:00:44.760> I've<00:00:45.210> had<00:00:45.390> players<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.020> I've

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
production I've had players that I've

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
production I've had players that I've
drafted<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.739> broke<00:00:47.010> NFL<00:00:47.399> records<00:00:47.820> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
drafted that a broke NFL records you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.360 
drafted that a broke NFL records you
know<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.390> shattered<00:00:49.320> team<00:00:49.620> records<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
know just shattered team records and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.060 
know just shattered team records and
they<00:00:50.610> never<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.120> them<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.559> ratings<00:00:52.559> wise<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
they never see them to ratings wise and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
they never see them to ratings wise and
prove<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.579> don't<00:00:54.149> care<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.350> player<00:00:55.559> is

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
prove I don't care because the player is

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.380 
prove I don't care because the player is
still<00:00:55.980> productive<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.210> there

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
still productive but you know there

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.639 
still productive but you know there
seems<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> disconnect<00:00:58.289> there<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
seems to be a disconnect there you

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.770 
seems to be a disconnect there you
should<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.980> able<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.190> draft<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.640> guy<00:00:59.670> work<00:01:00.570> him

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
should be able to draft a guy work him

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
should be able to draft a guy work him
out<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.859> him<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.190> an<00:01:02.280> elite<00:01:02.550> level<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
out and get him to an elite level and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.359 
out and get him to an elite level and
then<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.359> know<00:01:03.480> trade<00:01:03.870> them<00:01:03.989> away<00:01:04.229> for

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
then you know trade them away for

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.950 
then you know trade them away for
something<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.909> game<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.360> doesn't

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
something in this game it really doesn't

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
something in this game it really doesn't
seem<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> happen<00:01:07.380> taking<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.280> look<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> line

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
seem to happen taking a look at the line

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
seem to happen taking a look at the line
here<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.570> always<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:11.040> hard<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
here as always you know it's hard to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
here as always you know it's hard to
judge<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> preseason

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
judge this because this is a preseason

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.660 
judge this because this is a preseason
game<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:13.979> some<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> these<00:01:14.340> players

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
game so you know some of these players

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.999 
game so you know some of these players
really<00:01:15.210> aren't<00:01:15.450> aware<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.770> no

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
really aren't aware but you know no

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.880 
really aren't aware but you know no
pressure<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:18.090> generated<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.680> their

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
pressure is generated you can see their

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.249 
pressure is generated you can see their
general<00:01:20.430> use<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.850> Drake<00:01:21.060> never<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.750> pretty

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
general use and Drake never get pretty

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.320 
general use and Drake never get pretty
much<00:01:22.350> mitigated<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.100> that's<00:01:23.580> okay<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.240> know

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
much mitigated and that's okay you know

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.789 
much mitigated and that's okay you know
I'm<00:01:24.689> happy<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.500> least<00:01:25.619> the

I'm happy with this at least the
animations<00:01:26.310> are<00:01:26.430> separate<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.030> too

problems this game had was recognizing

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.730 
problems this game had was recognizing
inside<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.659> outside<00:01:45.750> defenders<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.500> this

inside and outside defenders in this

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
inside and outside defenders in this
situation<00:01:47.009> both<00:01:47.369> defenders<00:01:47.729> are<00:01:47.909> inside<00:01:48.329> but

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
situation both defenders are inside but

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
situation both defenders are inside but
what<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.439> would<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> past<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
what it would do in the past is have the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.359 
what it would do in the past is have the
wrong<00:01:51.450> player<00:01:51.840> go<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> ball<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.619> leave

wrong player go for the ball and leave

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.550 
wrong player go for the ball and leave
the<00:01:53.700> other<00:01:53.820> player<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.210> worse<00:01:54.930> position<00:01:55.530> than

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the other player in worse position than

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.260 
the other player in worse position than
you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.189> would<00:01:56.399> ever<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> be

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you know you would ever want them to be

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.600 
you know you would ever want them to be
the<00:01:57.960> game<00:01:58.170> seems<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.710> more<00:01:58.860> consistent<00:01:59.280> in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the game seems to be more consistent in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.639 
the game seems to be more consistent in
selecting<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> proper<00:02:00.270> defender<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.530> know

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
selecting the proper defender you know

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.069 
selecting the proper defender you know
the<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.100> furthest<00:02:02.670> from<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> ball<00:02:03.570> needs<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the the furthest from the ball needs to

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.660 
the the furthest from the ball needs to
be<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.649> trying<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.950> make<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> play<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
be going and trying to make the play and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
be going and trying to make the play and
leave<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> closest<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.170> ball<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.770> one

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
leave the closest to the ball the one

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.229 
leave the closest to the ball the one
that's<00:02:08.069> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.340> play<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.640> receiver<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
that's going to play the receiver and

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.969 
that's going to play the receiver and
that's<00:02:09.750> exactly<00:02:09.929> what<00:02:10.410> happens<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that's exactly what happens in the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.680 
that's exactly what happens in the
scenario<00:02:11.220> even<00:02:11.400> though<00:02:11.760> animation<00:02:12.390> Lee<00:02:12.540> they

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
scenario even though animation Lee they

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.640 
scenario even though animation Lee they
both<00:02:12.930> go<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.440> inner

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
both go for the inner

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.670 
both go for the inner
ception<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.760> inside<00:02:15.150> receiver<00:02:15.930> actually<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
ception the inside receiver actually the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.770 
ception the inside receiver actually the
inside<00:02:16.950> defender<00:02:17.370> gets<00:02:17.579> it<00:02:17.790> now<00:02:18.239> another

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
inside defender gets it now another

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.319 
inside defender gets it now another
thing<00:02:18.900> I'm<00:02:19.319> big<00:02:19.500> at<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.819> defense

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
thing I'm big at is you know the defense

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.119 
thing I'm big at is you know the defense
turning<00:02:21.750> into<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> offense<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.739> setting<00:02:23.040> up

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
turning into the offense and setting up

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.759 
turning into the offense and setting up
blocks<00:02:23.400> down<00:02:23.670> field<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.269> at<00:02:24.840> times<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.500> game

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
blocks down field and at times this game

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.490 
blocks down field and at times this game
was<00:02:26.099> flat-out<00:02:26.640> embarrassing<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.569> this<00:02:28.079> regard

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
was flat-out embarrassing in this regard

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.140 
was flat-out embarrassing in this regard
and<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:29.129> something<00:02:29.459> very<00:02:29.489> hard<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.000> do

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
and it's something very hard to do

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.059 
and it's something very hard to do
because<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.750> game<00:02:30.930> almost<00:02:31.140> has<00:02:31.409> to<00:02:31.439> react<00:02:31.859> to

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
because the game almost has to react to

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.660 
because the game almost has to react to
you<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.549> user<00:02:33.000> before<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:35.220> know<00:02:35.340> can

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
you as a user before it you know can

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.009 
you as a user before it you know can
because<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.090> know<00:02:36.329> you're<00:02:36.510> kind<00:02:36.659> of<00:02:36.810> try<00:02:36.959> to

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
because you know you're kind of try to

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.899 
because you know you're kind of try to
make<00:02:37.230> cuts<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> dime<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:37.920> said<00:02:38.310> locks<00:02:38.609> up

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
make cuts on a dime and said locks up

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.420 
make cuts on a dime and said locks up
and<00:02:39.060> steer<00:02:39.420> defenders<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:40.859> play<00:02:41.129> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
and steer defenders but in this play it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.880 
and steer defenders but in this play it
actually<00:02:41.819> works<00:02:42.000> out<00:02:42.120> extremely<00:02:42.540> well<00:02:42.689> so<00:02:43.409> you

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
actually works out extremely well so you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.319 
actually works out extremely well so you
know<00:02:43.980> basically<00:02:44.159> when<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.700> look<00:02:44.939> at<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> line

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
know basically when you look at the line

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.360 
know basically when you look at the line
that<00:02:45.510> I'm<00:02:45.629> trying<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.930> form<00:02:46.139> here<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.829> can<00:02:47.040> see

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
that I'm trying to form here you can see

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.229 
that I'm trying to form here you can see
most<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.510> offense<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.980> right<00:02:50.909> side

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
most of the offense is on the right side

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.110 
most of the offense is on the right side
so<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.170> trying<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.650> set<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.549> run<00:02:53.730> back<00:02:53.940> to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
pass was intended for and then we come

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.360 
pass was intended for and then we come
over<00:03:17.970> here<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.569> number<00:03:18.780> 31<00:03:19.260> picks<00:03:19.620> up<00:03:19.859> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
over here and number 31 picks up the

over here and number 31 picks up the
second<00:03:20.819> receiver<00:03:21.150> which<00:03:21.419> starts<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.019> set<00:03:22.260> up

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379

second receiver which starts to set up
the<00:03:22.590> lane<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.129> then<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.849> can<00:03:23.970> see<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.239> cut<00:03:24.780> over

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
the lane and then you can see I cut over

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.309 
the lane and then you can see I cut over
now<00:03:25.620> I'm<00:03:25.949> dependent<00:03:26.459> on<00:03:26.549> number<00:03:26.970> 25<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.810> 31

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
now I'm dependent on number 25 and 31

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.890 
now I'm dependent on number 25 and 31
picking<00:03:29.129> up<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.549> use<00:03:29.669> to<00:03:29.909> which<00:03:30.299> they<00:03:30.569> do

picking up the use to which they do
perfectly<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.739> then<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.220> cut<00:03:32.639> up<00:03:32.790> under<00:03:33.540> that

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
perfectly and then I cut up under that

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.740 
perfectly and then I cut up under that
seem<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.949> I<00:03:35.010> just<00:03:35.250> created<00:03:35.519> which<00:03:36.389> allows

seem that I just created which allows

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.409 
seem that I just created which allows
number<00:03:37.199> 59<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:38.310> go<00:03:38.430> pick<00:03:38.669> up<00:03:38.790> one<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.209> these

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
little bit of an edge but you know i'm

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.080

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
really gone or the multiple turns that

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.890 
really gone or the multiple turns that
this<00:04:14.519> game<00:04:14.760> used<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.180> take<00:04:15.389> when<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.629> take<00:04:15.870> a

look<00:04:15.959> at<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.260> defense<00:04:16.409> i<00:04:16.739> still<00:04:17.039> think<00:04:17.280> they

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
look at the defense i still think they

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.420 
look at the defense i still think they
overreact<00:04:18.630> as<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:18.959> whole<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:20.010> know<00:04:20.130> when<00:04:20.340> you

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
overreact as a whole you know when you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.850 
overreact as a whole you know when you
see<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.820> entire<00:04:21.299> actually<00:04:22.200> when<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.650> say

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
see the entire actually when I say

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.990 
see the entire actually when I say
defense<00:04:23.279> actually<00:04:23.669> mean<00:04:23.820> they're<00:04:23.969> all

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
defense actually mean they're all

offense<00:04:24.479> but<00:04:24.750> when<00:04:25.229> you<00:04:25.349> look<00:04:25.529> at<00:04:25.650> their

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
offense but when you look at their

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.660 
offense but when you look at their

react you know I have a hard time
understanding<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.800> we're<00:04:35.010> looking<00:04:35.280> at<00:04:35.370> this

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
understanding and we're looking at this

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.430 
understanding and we're looking at this
group<00:04:35.700> of<00:04:35.850> players<00:04:36.060> just<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.510> be<00:04:36.630> clear<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:37.080> have

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
group of players just to be clear I have

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.810 
group of players just to be clear I have
a<00:04:37.500> hard<00:04:37.680> time<00:04:37.830> understanding<00:04:37.980> that<00:04:38.400> all<00:04:38.580> these

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
a hard time understanding that all these

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.910 
a hard time understanding that all these
players<00:04:39.150> have<00:04:39.420> different<00:04:39.810> awareness<00:04:40.410> vision

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
players have different awareness vision

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.250 
players have different awareness vision
ratings<00:04:41.280> yet<00:04:41.820> they<00:04:42.000> all<00:04:42.210> make<00:04:42.480> this<00:04:42.660> turn<00:04:43.020> at

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
ratings yet they all make this turn at

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.680 
ratings yet they all make this turn at
the<00:04:43.590> same<00:04:43.830> time<00:04:44.160> so<00:04:44.850> that's<00:04:45.270> something<00:04:45.540> that

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
the same time so that's something that

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.270 
the same time so that's something that
needs<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:46.200> really<00:04:46.380> be<00:04:46.560> addressed<00:04:46.980> you<00:04:47.160> know

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
needs to really be addressed you know

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.340 
needs to really be addressed you know
there's<00:04:47.520> players<00:04:48.180> here<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.570> are<00:04:48.810> not<00:04:49.020> good

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
there's players here that are not good

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.500 
there's players here that are not good
in<00:04:49.500> pursuit<00:04:49.920> offensive<00:04:50.580> linemen<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.390> know

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
in pursuit offensive linemen you know

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.480 
in pursuit offensive linemen you know
are<00:04:51.690> really<00:04:52.020> not<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.440> greatest<00:04:52.710> in<00:04:53.040> pursuit

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
are really not the greatest in pursuit

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.310 
are really not the greatest in pursuit
so<00:04:54.210> they<00:04:54.420> shouldn't<00:04:54.690> be<00:04:54.810> making<00:04:55.080> these

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
so they shouldn't be making these

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.860 
so they shouldn't be making these
anticipatory<00:04:56.100> cuts<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:57.210> same<00:04:57.480> way<00:04:57.660> that<00:04:57.810> a

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
anticipatory cuts the same way that a

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.470 
anticipatory cuts the same way that a
receiver<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.950> going<00:04:59.220> to<00:04:59.310> be<00:04:59.400> making<00:04:59.610> but<00:05:00.360> you

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
receiver is going to be making but you

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.940 
receiver is going to be making but you
can<00:05:00.660> see<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.960> defense<00:05:01.320> pretty<00:05:01.620> much<00:05:01.740> Oh

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
can see the defense pretty much Oh

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.460 
can see the defense pretty much Oh
reacts<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.760> same<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.600> initial<00:05:03.990> time<00:05:04.200> and

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
reacts the same the initial time and

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.710 
reacts the same the initial time and
then<00:05:04.950> they<00:05:05.070> all<00:05:05.280> really<00:05:05.640> do<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.090> second<00:05:06.540> time

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
then they all really do the second time

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.870 
then they all really do the second time
as<00:05:06.900> well<00:05:07.110> it's<00:05:07.380> just<00:05:07.470> it<00:05:07.740> looks<00:05:08.040> like<00:05:08.280> because

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
as well it's just it looks like because

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.180 
as well it's just it looks like because
they're<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:09.450> close<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.350> receiver<00:05:10.770> the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
they're so close to the receiver the

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.370 
they're so close to the receiver the
ball<00:05:11.400> carrier<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:12.360> they<00:05:12.570> have<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.810> hard<00:05:13.110> time

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
ball carrier that they have a hard time

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.620 
ball carrier that they have a hard time
with<00:05:13.710> speeding<00:05:14.430> back<00:05:14.670> up<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:15.000> accelerating

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
with speeding back up and accelerating

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.660 
with speeding back up and accelerating
which<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.110> right<00:05:16.290> thing<00:05:16.320> but<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.580> know

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
which is the right thing but you know

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.770 
which is the right thing but you know
that's<00:05:17.880> something<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.300> I<00:05:18.420> would<00:05:18.600> like<00:05:18.750> to

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
that's something that I would like to

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.810 
that's something that I would like to
see<00:05:19.050> changed<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:19.830> then<00:05:20.220> as<00:05:20.340> you<00:05:20.370> can<00:05:20.550> see<00:05:20.670> now

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
see changed and then as you can see now

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.250 
see changed and then as you can see now
they<00:05:21.000> all<00:05:21.150> kind<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.450> pick<00:05:21.630> a<00:05:21.660> point<00:05:22.020> and

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
they all kind of pick a point and

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.780 
they all kind of pick a point and
because<00:05:22.770> I'm<00:05:22.890> running<00:05:23.250> straight<00:05:23.490> down<00:05:23.670> the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
because I'm running straight down the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.100 
because I'm running straight down the
field<00:05:24.000> they<00:05:24.120> obviously<00:05:24.270> just<00:05:24.690> follow<00:05:24.870> that

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
field they obviously just follow that

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.890 
field they obviously just follow that
point<00:05:25.470> but<00:05:25.980> just<00:05:26.430> an<00:05:26.580> example<00:05:26.730> here<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.300> really

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
point but just an example here a really

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.750 
point but just an example here a really
good<00:05:28.050> gameplay<00:05:28.590> things<00:05:28.980> that<00:05:29.250> need<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.610> be

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
good gameplay things that need to be

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.910 
good gameplay things that need to be
consistent<00:05:30.180> in<00:05:30.450> this<00:05:30.570> game<00:05:30.840> that<00:05:31.530> haven't

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
consistent in this game that haven't

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.160 
consistent in this game that haven't
been<00:05:31.950> in<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.220> past<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:33.120> obviously<00:05:33.570> uh<00:05:33.690> you

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
been in the past and obviously uh you

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.190 
been in the past and obviously uh you
know<00:05:34.260> a<00:05:34.290> good<00:05:34.620> example<00:05:35.310> of<00:05:35.460> a<00:05:36.210> user<00:05:36.570> being<00:05:36.990> able

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
know a good example of a user being able

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.280 
know a good example of a user being able
to<00:05:37.260> steer<00:05:37.650> blockers<00:05:38.460> into<00:05:39.330> you<00:05:40.140> know

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
to steer blockers into you know

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.280 
to steer blockers into you know
defensive<00:05:41.190> players<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:42.570> get<00:05:42.720> you<00:05:43.080> know<00:05:43.170> the

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
defensive players to get you know the

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.020 
defensive players to get you know the
result<00:05:43.620> of<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.800> touchdown<00:05:44.220> it<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:44.550> clearly

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
result of a touchdown it and clearly

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.670 
result of a touchdown it and clearly
this<00:05:45.300> is<00:05:45.480> something<00:05:45.780> that<00:05:45.870> goes<00:05:46.020> far<00:05:46.380> beyond

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
this is something that goes far beyond

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.470 
this is something that goes far beyond
interception<00:05:47.250> returns<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:47.880> fumble<00:05:48.180> returns

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
interception returns and fumble returns

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.570 
interception returns and fumble returns
but<00:05:48.720> you<00:05:49.140> know<00:05:49.260> that<00:05:49.410> that<00:05:49.680> player<00:05:50.070> steering

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
but you know that that player steering

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.600 
but you know that that player steering
is<00:05:50.970> huge<00:05:51.750> in<00:05:51.990> terms<00:05:52.020> of<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.470> return<00:05:52.800> game<00:05:52.830> so

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
is huge in terms of the return game so

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.340 
is huge in terms of the return game so
I'm<00:05:53.700> glad<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:54.030> see<00:05:54.180> it<00:05:54.270> executed<00:05:54.540> fairly<00:05:55.200> well

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
I'm glad to see it executed fairly well

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.010 
I'm glad to see it executed fairly well
in<00:05:55.380> this<00:05:55.590> example
