00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.160
 because the disease is actually triggered 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.160
 they have to do some more factors 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.860
 for the moment it is believed that the most important thing is the transmission 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.479
 hereditary 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:14.479
 the bosses 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.630
 the institute of human genetics of the university of bonn here affirms that 

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:23.599
 Schizophrenia is hereditary 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.230
 the genes are responsible for the disease 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.790
 the teacher tip is on the hunt for the gene for schizophrenia is convinced 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.720
 that somewhere in our DNA and these people are to be found 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.810
 the truth 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.950
 if you think that your dream has genetic components so the groups the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.670
 determinant in the structure and functioning of the brain with 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.020
 genetic methods we approach the cause that causes schizophrenia 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.280
 practically every day they do blood tests donated by the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.860
 sufferers of schizophrenia 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.000
 the tests are analyzed genetically and compared with the analytical one 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 healthy blood 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.420
 the suspicion that there must be a difference between them comes from a 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.840
 An old study carried out on relatives of patients has been 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.400
 demonstrated that the direct relatives of the patients is to say human or 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.640
 children have a near risk or 10% of developing schizophrenia 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.100
 in the course of his life 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.810
 the offer this percentage is more considerable than the rate of illness 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.390
 in terms of the average population density in which they are 1 per 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.490
 one hundred 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.950
 now here this statistical connection shows that with full security 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.470
 genetics has something to do and that hereditary transmission plays a role 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.560
 important 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.490
 there must be a gene that produces schizophrenia 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.159
 However, once these have been detected, it is possible to use 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.210
 successful medications the tip teacher is optimistic that in 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.600
 Little time will be discovered its exact location inside the plane cabin 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.409
 quito ecu the scientific community dislocated 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.780
 this chromosomal regions that predispose to schizophrenia from 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.619
 juveniles that the gene can be located most likely dies two 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.370
 there are also very specific hypotheses of these that will be verified or 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.270
 will validate at a certain moment, I am completely sure of 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.360
 that these connections will be checked in the course of the next three or 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.849
 four years at the latest its so it can be said that there is a gene that 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.340
 predisposes to something that there is a gene that predisposes for the identification of 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.270
 Penitent schizophrenia uncertain
