00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.750 
late so it's a really great kind of
secret<00:03:56.720> weapon<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:57.140> predators<00:03:57.680> will<00:03:57.890> use<00:03:58.250> by

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
secret weapon that predators will use by

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.759 
secret weapon that predators will use by
rolling<00:03:59.209> around<00:03:59.330> in<00:03:59.750> different<00:03:59.870> smells<00:04:00.380> in

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
rolling around in different smells in

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.009 
rolling around in different smells in
nature<00:04:01.640> it's<00:04:01.790> not<00:04:01.970> going<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.330> perfume<00:04:02.840> and

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
nature it's not going to be perfume and

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.830 
nature it's not going to be perfume and
be<00:04:03.170> more<00:04:03.350> likely<00:04:03.800> for<00:04:04.790> lions<00:04:05.209> for<00:04:05.420> examples

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
be more likely for lions for examples

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.319 
be more likely for lions for examples
often<00:04:06.050> elephant<00:04:06.709> dung<00:04:06.920> that's<00:04:07.850> what<00:04:08.000> they<00:04:08.090> use

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
often elephant dung that's what they use

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.449 
often elephant dung that's what they use
quite<00:04:08.570> frequently<00:04:08.890> I'm<00:04:09.890> not<00:04:10.100> sure<00:04:10.250> what<00:04:10.400> kind

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
quite frequently I'm not sure what kind

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.260 
quite frequently I'm not sure what kind
of<00:04:10.640> dung

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
of dung

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.180 
of dung
wolves<00:04:11.990> would<00:04:12.110> use<00:04:12.260> or<00:04:12.500> just<00:04:12.710> anything<00:04:12.920> else

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
wolves would use or just anything else

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.740 
wolves would use or just anything else
but<00:04:13.670> it's<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.790> really<00:04:13.910> interesting<00:04:14.210> way<00:04:14.570> that

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
but it's a really interesting way that

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.170 
but it's a really interesting way that
they<00:04:14.870> actually<00:04:15.350> put<00:04:15.470> like<00:04:15.620> camouflage<00:04:15.980> on<00:04:16.489> but

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
they actually put like camouflage on but

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.270 
they actually put like camouflage on but
uh<00:04:17.209> camouflage<00:04:18.140> for<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.410> noses<00:04:18.650> not<00:04:19.010> for<00:04:19.220> the

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
uh camouflage for the noses not for the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.020 
uh camouflage for the noses not for the
eyes<00:04:19.480> what<00:04:20.480> was<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:21.610> reason<00:04:22.610> for<00:04:22.790> both<00:04:22.880> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
eyes what was the reason for both the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.550 
eyes what was the reason for both the
gray<00:04:23.180> wolves<00:04:23.420> and<00:04:23.630> red<00:04:23.750> wolves<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.170> really<00:04:24.380> get

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
gray wolves and red wolves to really get

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.980 
gray wolves and red wolves to really get
to<00:04:24.680> population<00:04:25.250> is<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:25.550> low<00:04:25.730> to<00:04:26.630> really<00:04:26.810> rock

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
to population is that low to really rock

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.930 
to population is that low to really rock
wipe<00:04:27.230> out<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.470> populations<00:04:28.010> of<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.760> gray

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
wipe out the populations of the gray

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.060 
wipe out the populations of the gray
wolf<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.360> was<00:04:29.510> really<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.960> war<00:04:30.200> on<00:04:30.530> wolves

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
wolf it was really the war on wolves

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.790 
wolf it was really the war on wolves
that<00:04:31.250> we<00:04:31.520> did<00:04:31.670> here<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:33.080> know<00:04:33.200> people<00:04:33.230> we

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
that we did here you know people we

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.310 
that we did here you know people we
actually<00:04:34.310> put<00:04:34.430> bounties<00:04:34.880> out<00:04:35.090> on<00:04:35.330> wolves

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
actually put bounties out on wolves

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.410 
actually put bounties out on wolves
centuries<00:04:37.190> ago<00:04:37.430> so<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:37.760> was<00:04:37.880> actually<00:04:38.180> really

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
centuries ago so it was actually really

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.080 
centuries ago so it was actually really
good<00:04:38.660> living
