00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
stand out a little bit more because then

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.290

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
with mascara so that would definitely be

with mascara so that would definitely be
my<00:00:58.579> product<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.670> makes<00:00:59.790> me<00:01:00.000> feel<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.570> a

so I let my hair drive only eighty

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.490 
so I let my hair drive only eighty
percent<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.240> then<00:02:12.420> upload<00:02:12.750> your<00:02:12.960> my<00:02:13.080> bangs<00:02:13.290> if

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
I need to or if I can go the whole day

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.780 
I need to or if I can go the whole day
with<00:02:15.750> my<00:02:15.870> hair<00:02:16.050> wet<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.890> works<00:02:17.130> too<00:02:17.250> i<00:02:17.400> also

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
with my hair wet that works too i also

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.760 
with my hair wet that works too i also
think<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.450> gives<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.780> lot<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.020> volume<00:02:19.350> and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
think that it gives a lot of volume and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.650 
think that it gives a lot of volume and
it<00:02:19.890> gives<00:02:20.040> really<00:02:20.250> nice<00:02:20.430> texture<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.450> i<00:02:21.480> think

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
it gives really nice texture so i think

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.780 
it gives really nice texture so i think
all<00:02:21.990> those<00:02:22.170> things<00:02:22.470> combined<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.220> would<00:02:23.400> be

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
all those things combined that would be

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.760 
all those things combined that would be
a<00:02:24.030> good<00:02:24.210> hair<00:02:24.420> secret<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.900> mine<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.110> really

workout<00:03:37.320> tips<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.769> would<00:03:38.280> say<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.519> best<00:03:38.700> tip

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
workout tips I would say the best tip

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.850 
workout tips I would say the best tip
that<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.300> just<00:03:39.570> consistency<00:03:40.170> if<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.620> can

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
that I have just consistency if you can

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.100 
that I have just consistency if you can
get<00:03:41.100> into<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.310> schedule<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.940> working<00:03:42.390> out<00:03:42.540> that

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
get into a schedule of working out that

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.630 
get into a schedule of working out that
is<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.350> best<00:03:43.470> thing<00:03:43.620> because<00:03:44.070> if<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.459> have

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
is the best thing because if you have

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.460 
is the best thing because if you have
one<00:03:44.910> workout<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.720> know<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.989> lasts<00:03:46.200> for

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
one workout you know that lasts for

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.289 
one workout you know that lasts for
hours<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.100> only<00:03:47.190> do<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.700> once<00:03:47.820> because

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
hours but you only do it once because

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.970 
hours but you only do it once because
you<00:03:48.630> get<00:03:48.780> burnt<00:03:49.019> out<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.440> never<00:03:49.620> want<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.830> work

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
you get burnt out you never want to work

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.550 
you get burnt out you never want to work
on<00:03:50.070> again<00:03:50.310> it's<00:03:50.970> not<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.239> helpful<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:52.140> build

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
on again it's not that helpful to build

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.110 
on again it's not that helpful to build
muscle<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.160> burn<00:03:53.220> fat<00:03:53.580> it's<00:03:53.760> going<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:53.940> take<00:03:54.090> a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
muscle and burn fat it's going to take a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.060 
muscle and burn fat it's going to take a
few<00:03:54.360> workouts<00:03:54.690> for<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:55.709> any

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
few workouts for you to see any

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.990 
few workouts for you to see any
definition<00:03:56.549> in<00:03:56.790> your<00:03:56.910> body<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.299> muscles

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
definition in your body and muscles

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.580 
definition in your body and muscles
own<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.330> also<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:59.020> you<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.230> see<00:03:59.440> some

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
own and also for you to see some

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.920 
own and also for you to see some
differences<00:04:00.040> on<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.400> scale<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:00.940> differences

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
differences on the scale and differences

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.720 
differences on the scale and differences
that<00:04:02.170> actually<00:04:02.590> will<00:04:02.710> say<00:04:02.950> off<00:04:03.160> not<00:04:03.520> just

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
that actually will say off not just

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.280 
that actually will say off not just
water<00:04:03.910> weight<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:04.720> think<00:04:04.840> that<00:04:05.260> just

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
water weight so I think that just

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.530 
water weight so I think that just
consistency<00:04:06.100> with<00:04:06.370> working<00:04:06.700> out<00:04:06.820> is<00:04:07.030> probably

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
consistency with working out is probably

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.690 
consistency with working out is probably
the<00:04:07.660> best<00:04:07.810> tip<00:04:08.110> just<00:04:08.380> find<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.680> day<00:04:08.860> when<00:04:09.370> you

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
the best tip just find a day when you

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.490 
the best tip just find a day when you
know<00:04:10.030> you're<00:04:10.210> going<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.540> work<00:04:10.660> out<00:04:10.900> pump

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
know you're going to work out pump

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.320 
know you're going to work out pump
yourself<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:12.130> however<00:04:12.550> you<00:04:12.700> can<00:04:12.760> with<00:04:13.150> music

just get into some type of routine where

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.289 
just get into some type of routine where
you<00:04:18.010> know<00:04:18.190> on<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.609> day<00:04:18.820> you're<00:04:18.970> going<00:04:19.120> and

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:15.730 
like that might be kind of weird because

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.980 
like that might be kind of weird because
I<00:07:15.880> make<00:07:16.030> these<00:07:16.150> videos<00:07:16.240> so<00:07:16.660> you<00:07:16.750> would<00:07:16.870> think

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.230 
I make these videos so you would think
I'd<00:07:17.200> be<00:07:17.320> outgoing<00:07:17.680> and<00:07:18.010> open<00:07:18.370> and<00:07:18.610> whatever

and<00:07:36.040> all<00:07:36.190> this<00:07:36.310> stuff<00:07:36.510> so<00:07:37.510> i<00:07:37.540> guess<00:07:37.720> i'm

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
and all this stuff so i guess i'm

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.510 
and all this stuff so i guess i'm
probably<00:07:38.050> like<00:07:38.260> a<00:07:38.290> very<00:07:38.530> like<00:07:38.620> nervous<00:07:39.070> and

probably like a very like nervous and
shy<00:07:39.760> person<00:07:40.300> and<00:07:40.480> i<00:07:40.510> think<00:07:40.720> that's<00:07:40.900> probably

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110 
shy person and i think that's probably
