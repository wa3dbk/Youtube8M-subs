 take good pictures with your phone be 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.090
 Andre or any other operating system 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.090
 stay in this video 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 well let's start with the 5 tips 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.430
 so they can improve their quality 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 photography with your mobile device one 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.460
 know your phone 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.930
 first learn about the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.210
 options and configuration of your team 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.559
 to take pictures instantly use 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.660
 shortcuts so you can use the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.280
 camera as quickly as possible reviews 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.760
 also for example the speed of 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.519
 shutter of your device 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.390
 2 keep in mind light and movement 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.640
 make sure the object is well 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.409
 illuminated greater illumination more defined 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.080
 will be the image and also takes into account 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.240
 the movement of your object if you can 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.729
 use tripods or some application 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.259
 so that it does not move will be very much 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.090
 better your image 3 try to avoid it is a 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.770
 digital in most cases the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.000
 digital zoom is not of good quality 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.070
 I like six enlarge the image 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.110
 making it look pixelated is better 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.729
 approach the object that uses the zoom 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.300
 although not too much because it can 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.310
 extort the forms of the object 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.840
 If your device has optical sumo 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.700
 you can use it quietly 4 do not you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.050
 limits to a few hours botox if you have 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.580
 time takes several pictures of it 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.500
 so you can save yourself from the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.120
 images moved or blurred always 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.010
 uses the highest resolution and quality 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.200
 possible to reduce then there is time 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.330
 the mobile device that we are 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.480
 using can have memory for 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.600
 lots of pictures so use the 5 and 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.070
 finally keep the lens clean 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.780
 dust particles can apply the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.220
 quality of your photos try to keep your 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.020
 clean lens without scratches 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.510
 especially if by the type of phone 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.250
 remains permanently exposed avoids 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.020
 clean it with your finger you will only get 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.729
 bind it more the ideal is a chamois 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.560
 specialized for these types of 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.810
