00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:04.860 

so<00:03:58.629> can<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.900> 260<00:03:59.410> spend<00:03:59.680> these<00:03:59.830> tires<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:04.750> now

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
so can the 260 spend these tires so now

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.320 
so can the 260 spend these tires so now
the<00:04:04.930> 260<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.650> still<00:04:05.860> in<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.099> with<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.280> 342<00:04:06.879> posi

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
the 260 is still in it with the 342 posi

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.100 
the 260 is still in it with the 342 posi
so<00:04:07.510> we'll<00:04:07.660> see<00:04:07.840> what<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.080> can<00:04:08.170> do<00:04:09.900> rearend<00:04:10.900> is

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
so we'll see what it can do rearend is

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:19.500 
so we'll see what it can do rearend is
in

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.570
