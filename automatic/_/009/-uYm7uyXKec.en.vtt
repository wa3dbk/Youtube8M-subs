00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.610 

let's<00:00:17.150> go<00:00:17.240> Howser<00:00:17.510> coaches<00:00:17.660> vans<00:00:18.050> Brent<00:00:18.380> here

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.620 
let's go Howser coaches vans Brent here

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.920 
let's go Howser coaches vans Brent here
and<00:00:18.800> today<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:19.340> want<00:00:19.610> to<00:00:19.760> talk<00:00:19.940> about<00:00:20.150> the

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
and today I want to talk about the

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:29.230 
and today I want to talk about the
angled<00:00:21.410> takeoff<00:00:27.610> so<00:00:28.610> why<00:00:28.790> do<00:00:28.850> we<00:00:28.940> want<00:00:29.030> to

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
angled takeoff so why do we want to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.730 
angled takeoff so why do we want to
angle<00:00:29.480> our<00:00:29.600> takeoff<00:00:29.930> well<00:00:30.200> there's<00:00:30.350> a<00:00:30.440> couple

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
angle our takeoff well there's a couple

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.990 
angle our takeoff well there's a couple
of<00:00:30.830> main<00:00:30.950> reasons<00:00:31.130> they're<00:00:31.520> really<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:31.820> main

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
of main reasons they're really the main

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.700 
of main reasons they're really the main
reason<00:00:32.330> is<00:00:32.450> it<00:00:32.689> helps<00:00:32.930> us<00:00:33.020> get<00:00:33.230> down<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.560> line

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
reason is it helps us get down the line

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.100 
reason is it helps us get down the line
quicker<00:00:34.400> so<00:00:34.640> that<00:00:34.670> means<00:00:35.000> if<00:00:35.300> maybe<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.930> waves

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
quicker so that means if maybe the waves

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.480 
quicker so that means if maybe the waves
are<00:00:36.380> usually<00:00:36.650> we<00:00:36.890> do<00:00:36.980> this<00:00:37.070> when<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:37.370> waves

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
are usually we do this when the waves

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.760 
are usually we do this when the waves
are<00:00:37.580> smaller<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.900> we<00:00:39.050> want<00:00:39.230> to<00:00:39.290> get<00:00:39.410> moving

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
are smaller and we want to get moving

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.890 
are smaller and we want to get moving
left<00:00:40.100> or<00:00:40.370> right<00:00:40.700> down<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.060> wave<00:00:41.240> as<00:00:41.510> quick<00:00:41.750> as

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
left or right down the wave as quick as

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.510 
left or right down the wave as quick as
possible<00:00:41.960> so<00:00:42.470> that<00:00:42.680> we<00:00:42.740> don't<00:00:42.829> miss<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.040> section

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
possible so that we don't miss a section

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.250 
possible so that we don't miss a section
it<00:00:43.880> also<00:00:44.060> helps<00:00:44.420> it<00:00:44.480> if<00:00:44.570> you're<00:00:44.690> paddling<00:00:44.900> for

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
it also helps it if you're paddling for

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.840 
it also helps it if you're paddling for
a<00:00:45.320> wave<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:45.829> maybe<00:00:46.310> you're<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.489> little<00:00:46.610> bit

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
a wave and maybe you're a little bit

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.450 
a wave and maybe you're a little bit
behind<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.360> peak<00:00:47.630> and<00:00:47.900> you<00:00:48.350> want<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.340> get

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
behind the peak and you want to get

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.130 
behind the peak and you want to get
going<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.940> get<00:00:50.060> around<00:00:50.360> that<00:00:50.540> section<00:00:50.989> it

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
going and get around that section it

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.870 
going and get around that section it
helps<00:00:51.380> you<00:00:51.470> to<00:00:51.620> get<00:00:51.800> up<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.370> your<00:00:52.489> feet<00:00:52.700> and

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
helps you to get up to your feet and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.479 
helps you to get up to your feet and
moving<00:00:53.690> in<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.470> direction<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:55.190> want<00:00:55.220> to

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
moving in the direction that you want to

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.630 
moving in the direction that you want to
go<00:00:55.579> very<00:00:55.760> quickly<00:00:56.470> it<00:00:57.470> also<00:00:57.770> can<00:00:57.920> make<00:00:58.100> steep

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
go very quickly it also can make steep

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.030 
go very quickly it also can make steep
drops<00:00:59.450> easier<00:00:59.989> in<00:01:00.110> some<00:01:00.350> cases<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:00.890> for

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
drops easier in some cases so for

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.340 
drops easier in some cases so for
example<00:01:01.370> when<00:01:01.460> I<00:01:01.489> surf<00:01:01.820> on<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.329> longboard<00:01:03.110> and

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
example when I surf on a longboard and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.379 
example when I surf on a longboard and
the<00:01:03.470> waves<00:01:03.649> are<00:01:03.829> steeper<00:01:04.399> it<00:01:04.879> kind<00:01:05.119> of<00:01:05.210> helps

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:05.389 
the waves are steeper it kind of helps

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:07.149 
the waves are steeper it kind of helps
me<00:01:05.449> to<00:01:05.630> get<00:01:05.749> into<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:05.960> wave<00:01:06.139> without<00:01:06.469> purling

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
me to get into the wave without purling

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.760 
me to get into the wave without purling
or<00:01:07.310> nose-diving<00:01:07.780> by<00:01:08.780> angling<00:01:09.229> my<00:01:09.319> take<00:01:09.590> off

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
or nose-diving by angling my take off

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.580 
or nose-diving by angling my take off
left<00:01:10.189> or<00:01:10.310> right<00:01:10.549> as<00:01:10.789> I'm<00:01:11.359> paddling<00:01:11.840> into<00:01:12.350> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
left or right as I'm paddling into the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.800 
left or right as I'm paddling into the
wave<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.729> how<00:01:13.880> do<00:01:13.939> we<00:01:14.030> angle<00:01:14.329> our<00:01:14.389> take<00:01:14.630> off

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
wave so how do we angle our take off

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.440 
wave so how do we angle our take off
well<00:01:15.079> it's<00:01:15.469> really<00:01:16.069> pretty<00:01:16.520> easy<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.179> with<00:01:17.420> a

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
well it's really pretty easy and with a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.699 
well it's really pretty easy and with a
little<00:01:17.569> bit<00:01:17.659> of<00:01:17.780> practice<00:01:17.929> it's<00:01:18.350> easy<00:01:18.560> to

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
little bit of practice it's easy to

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.529 
little bit of practice it's easy to
master<00:01:18.920> with<00:01:19.249> a<00:01:19.280> couple<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.729> main<00:01:19.999> techniques

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
master with a couple of main techniques

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.300 
master with a couple of main techniques
so<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.319> first<00:01:21.530> thing<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:21.859> we<00:01:21.950> want<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.130> make

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
so the first thing is we want to make

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.399 
so the first thing is we want to make
sure<00:01:22.549> that<00:01:22.789> as<00:01:22.969> we're<00:01:23.179> piling<00:01:23.539> in<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.229> if<00:01:24.350> I

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
sure that as we're piling in so if I

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.239 
sure that as we're piling in so if I
want<00:01:24.619> to<00:01:24.679> go<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:24.889> right<00:01:25.009> hand<00:01:25.219> direction

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
want to go in the right hand direction

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:26.770 
want to go in the right hand direction
I'm<00:01:25.639> looking<00:01:25.969> down<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.149> line<00:01:26.270> where<00:01:26.569> I<00:01:26.600> want

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
I'm looking down the line where I want

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.870 
I'm looking down the line where I want
to<00:01:26.840> go<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.259> as<00:01:27.679> I'm<00:01:27.889> paddling<00:01:28.219> in<00:01:28.429> I'm<00:01:28.670> gonna

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
to go and as I'm paddling in I'm gonna

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.239 
to go and as I'm paddling in I'm gonna
start<00:01:29.149> leaning<00:01:29.659> in<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.899> direction<00:01:30.799> I<00:01:30.979> want<00:01:31.189> to

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
start leaning in the direction I want to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:32.859 
start leaning in the direction I want to
go<00:01:31.399> and<00:01:31.670> as<00:01:32.060> I'm<00:01:32.270> leaning<00:01:32.569> and<00:01:32.630> actually

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
go and as I'm leaning and actually

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.809 
go and as I'm leaning and actually
enables<00:01:33.170> me<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.350> see<00:01:33.740> because<00:01:34.279> I'm<00:01:34.549> paddling

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
enables me to see because I'm paddling

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.370 
enables me to see because I'm paddling
at<00:01:34.969> an<00:01:35.029> angle<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.299> Able's<00:01:35.689> me<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.899> see<00:01:36.139> down

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
at an angle and Able's me to see down

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.230 
at an angle and Able's me to see down
the<00:01:36.529> wave<00:01:36.709> in<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.579> direction<00:01:37.819> I<00:01:37.969> want<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.179> go

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
the wave in the direction I want to go

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.539 
the wave in the direction I want to go
before<00:01:38.539> I<00:01:38.719> actually<00:01:38.899> get<00:01:39.139> to<00:01:39.170> my<00:01:39.319> feet<00:01:39.549> now

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
before I actually get to my feet now

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.370 
before I actually get to my feet now
this<00:01:40.729> next<00:01:40.909> part<00:01:41.119> is<00:01:41.299> really<00:01:41.600> really<00:01:41.929> key<00:01:42.170> is

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
this next part is really really key is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.300 
this next part is really really key is
we<00:01:42.499> want<00:01:42.679> to<00:01:42.709> make<00:01:42.829> sure<00:01:42.889> that<00:01:43.069> we<00:01:43.130> keep

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
we want to make sure that we keep

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.370 
we want to make sure that we keep
pressure<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.060> inside<00:01:44.450> rail<00:01:44.689> while

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
pressure on the inside rail while

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.919 
pressure on the inside rail while
paddling<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.130> while<00:01:46.369> popping<00:01:46.880> up<00:01:47.029> what<00:01:47.779> that

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
paddling and while popping up what that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.319 
paddling and while popping up what that
means<00:01:48.170> as<00:01:48.469> the<00:01:49.159> inside<00:01:49.579> rail<00:01:49.789> is<00:01:49.999> going<00:01:50.179> to<00:01:50.240> be

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
means as the inside rail is going to be

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.910 
means as the inside rail is going to be
the<00:01:50.450> rail<00:01:50.659> that's<00:01:50.929> closest<00:01:51.469> to<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.740> wave

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
the rail that's closest to the wave

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.919 
the rail that's closest to the wave
because<00:01:52.609> what<00:01:52.789> happens<00:01:53.179> if<00:01:53.329> I<00:01:53.420> have<00:01:53.450> my<00:01:53.719> board

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
because what happens if I have my board

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:54.969 
because what happens if I have my board
angle<00:01:54.319> that<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:54.499> want<00:01:54.679> to<00:01:54.740> go<00:01:54.799> in<00:01:54.889> this

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
angle that I want to go in this

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.289 
angle that I want to go in this
direction<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.490> way<00:01:55.579> it's<00:01:55.700> coming<00:01:55.849> behind<00:01:56.060> me

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
direction the way it's coming behind me

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.399 
direction the way it's coming behind me
it's<00:01:56.479> going<00:01:56.599> to<00:01:56.659> want<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.899> flip<00:01:57.139> the<00:01:57.259> board

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
it's going to want to flip the board

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.889 
it's going to want to flip the board
over<00:01:57.649> towards<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.279> beach<00:01:58.459> so<00:01:59.029> as<00:01:59.209> I'm<00:01:59.479> piling

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
over towards the beach so as I'm piling

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.569 
over towards the beach so as I'm piling
I<00:01:59.990> want<00:02:00.139> to<00:02:00.200> be<00:02:00.259> leaning<00:02:00.529> ever<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.279> slightly

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
I want to be leaning ever so slightly

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.730 
I want to be leaning ever so slightly
towards<00:02:02.029> the<00:02:02.090> rail<00:02:02.359> well<00:02:03.200> I'm<00:02:03.319> keeping<00:02:03.499> my

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
towards the rail well I'm keeping my

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.129 
towards the rail well I'm keeping my
eyes<00:02:03.889> down<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.310> line<00:02:04.459> and<00:02:04.789> as<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:05.090> pop<00:02:05.359> up<00:02:05.389> I'm

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:06.139 
eyes down the line and as I pop up I'm

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:07.629 
eyes down the line and as I pop up I'm
gonna<00:02:06.289> keep<00:02:06.499> pressure<00:02:06.799> on<00:02:06.889> that<00:02:07.009> inside<00:02:07.369> rail

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:07.639 
gonna keep pressure on that inside rail

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:09.789 
gonna keep pressure on that inside rail
and<00:02:07.939> then<00:02:08.299> once<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.599> get<00:02:08.659> to<00:02:08.840> my<00:02:08.959> feet<00:02:09.200> the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
and then once I get to my feet the

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.380 
and then once I get to my feet the
pressure<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.159> gonna<00:02:10.340> go<00:02:10.519> from<00:02:10.729> my<00:02:10.939> body<00:02:11.180> weight

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
pressure is gonna go from my body weight

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.930 
pressure is gonna go from my body weight
leaning<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:12.470> my<00:02:12.769> feet<00:02:13.010> actually<00:02:13.430> keeping

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
leaning to my feet actually keeping

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.940 
leaning to my feet actually keeping
pressure<00:02:14.120> on<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.570> same<00:02:14.990> rail<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:15.890> I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
pressure on that same rail so that I

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.920 
pressure on that same rail so that I
never<00:02:16.010> get<00:02:16.310> flipped<00:02:16.580> over<00:02:16.880> towards<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.690> beach

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
never get flipped over towards the beach

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.110 
never get flipped over towards the beach
now<00:02:18.800> some<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.100> most<00:02:19.250> common<00:02:19.640> errors<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:19.940> see

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
now some of the most common errors I see

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.520 
now some of the most common errors I see
when<00:02:20.300> people<00:02:20.570> are<00:02:20.660> practicing<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:21.290> and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
when people are practicing this and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.140 
when people are practicing this and
after<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.740> teach<00:02:21.980> them<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.670> first<00:02:22.910> is

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
after I teach them this is the first is

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.390 
after I teach them this is the first is
they<00:02:23.480> angle<00:02:23.900> too<00:02:24.050> much<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.590> what<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.190> means

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
they angle too much and what that means

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.700 
they angle too much and what that means
is<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.940> we<00:02:26.300> never<00:02:26.510> want<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.750> angle<00:02:27.050> probably

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
is that we never want to angle probably

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.020 
is that we never want to angle probably
more<00:02:27.860> than<00:02:28.010> forty-five<00:02:28.430> degrees<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:28.910> most

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
more than forty-five degrees in most

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.820 
more than forty-five degrees in most
cases<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.600> if<00:02:29.720> you're<00:02:29.870> angled<00:02:30.320> like<00:02:30.440> straight

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
cases so if you're angled like straight

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.950 
cases so if you're angled like straight
sideways<00:02:31.100> down<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.550> wave<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:32.330> really<00:02:32.720> hard

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
sideways down the wave it's really hard

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.230 
sideways down the wave it's really hard
to<00:02:33.080> keep<00:02:33.230> enough<00:02:33.470> pressure<00:02:33.740> on<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.940> inside

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
to keep enough pressure on that inside

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.340 
to keep enough pressure on that inside
rail<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.690> keep<00:02:35.840> yourself<00:02:36.140> from<00:02:36.230> getting

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
rail to keep yourself from getting

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.290 
rail to keep yourself from getting
flipped<00:02:36.680> over<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.220> pits<00:02:37.580> out<00:02:37.820> towards<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
flipped over and pits out towards the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.120 
flipped over and pits out towards the
beach<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:38.930> also<00:02:39.080> kind<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.470> harder<00:02:39.710> for<00:02:39.950> you

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
beach it's also kind of harder for you

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.070 
beach it's also kind of harder for you
to<00:02:40.160> get<00:02:40.760> your<00:02:40.910> fins<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.390> set<00:02:41.660> in<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.960> way

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
to get your fins to set in the way

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.780 
to get your fins to set in the way
because<00:02:42.380> your<00:02:42.500> board<00:02:42.710> is<00:02:42.830> sideways<00:02:42.980> and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
because your board is sideways and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.860 
because your board is sideways and
you're<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.060> going<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.240> get<00:02:44.360> rolled<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:44.780> we

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
you're just going to get rolled so we

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.660 
you're just going to get rolled so we
don't<00:02:45.020> want<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.170> angle<00:02:45.500> too<00:02:45.710> much<00:02:45.890> usually

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
don't want to angle too much usually

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.060 
don't want to angle too much usually
just<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.970> slight<00:02:47.210> angle<00:02:47.540> maybe<00:02:47.780> like<00:02:48.050> 20<00:02:48.710> 25

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
just a slight angle maybe like 20 25

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.250 
just a slight angle maybe like 20 25
degrees<00:02:49.520> is<00:02:49.820> sufficient<00:02:50.330> enough<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.720> get<00:02:51.140> us

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
degrees is sufficient enough to get us

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.330 
degrees is sufficient enough to get us
moving<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.710> direction<00:02:51.770> we<00:02:52.040> want<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.280> go

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
moving in the direction we want to go

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.210 
moving in the direction we want to go
without<00:02:53.060> getting<00:02:53.510> pitched<00:02:54.020> over<00:02:54.230> or<00:02:54.590> digging

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
without getting pitched over or digging

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.340 
without getting pitched over or digging
a<00:02:55.400> rail<00:02:55.580> on<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.910> takeoff<00:02:56.300> another<00:02:56.930> big<00:02:57.140> error

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
a rail on the takeoff another big error

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.110 
a rail on the takeoff another big error
is<00:02:57.590> not<00:02:57.920> keeping<00:02:58.340> pressure<00:02:58.610> on<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.000> inside

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
is not keeping pressure on the inside

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.570 
is not keeping pressure on the inside
rail<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.690> is<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:00.320> important<00:03:00.800> again<00:03:01.250> like

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
rail this is so so important again like

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.910 
rail this is so so important again like
I<00:03:01.700> said<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:02.840> gonna<00:03:03.080> pitch<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.440> off<00:03:03.770> to

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
I said it's it's gonna pitch you off to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.680 
I said it's it's gonna pitch you off to
the<00:03:04.010> side<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.460> if<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.640> let<00:03:05.030> up<00:03:05.210> even<00:03:05.510> for<00:03:05.600> a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
the side so if you let up even for a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.870 
the side so if you let up even for a
second<00:03:06.020> as<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.230> pop<00:03:06.470> up<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.310> get<00:03:07.460> to<00:03:07.550> my<00:03:07.670> feet

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
second as I pop up and I get to my feet

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.000 
second as I pop up and I get to my feet
if<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.090> let<00:03:08.330> off<00:03:08.450> even<00:03:08.780> for<00:03:08.990> just<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.440> second<00:03:09.860> on

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
if I let off even for just a second on

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.270 
if I let off even for just a second on
that<00:03:10.610> pressure<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:12.470> gonna<00:03:12.680> make<00:03:12.950> me<00:03:13.070> catch

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
that pressure it's gonna make me catch

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.890 
that pressure it's gonna make me catch
my<00:03:13.460> rail<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.000> causes<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.480> pretty<00:03:14.720> bad

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
my rail and it causes a pretty bad

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.270 
my rail and it causes a pretty bad
wipeout<00:03:15.110> if<00:03:15.410> you've<00:03:15.560> ever<00:03:15.680> caught<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.250> a

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
wipeout if you've ever caught like a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.680 
wipeout if you've ever caught like a
rail<00:03:16.580> with<00:03:16.760> your<00:03:16.910> board<00:03:17.060> sideways<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.570> get

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
rail with your board sideways you get

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.830 
rail with your board sideways you get
pitched<00:03:17.989> over<00:03:18.290> either<00:03:18.800> face-first<00:03:19.540> or<00:03:20.540> back

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
pitched over either face-first or back

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.510 
pitched over either face-first or back
first<00:03:21.140> which<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.560> really<00:03:21.800> bad<00:03:21.980> wipeout<00:03:22.370> so

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
first which is a really bad wipeout so

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.190 
first which is a really bad wipeout so
we<00:03:22.640> want<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.910> keep<00:03:23.030> pressure<00:03:23.330> from<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.989> time

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
we want to keep pressure from the time

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.750 
we want to keep pressure from the time
that<00:03:24.410> on<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:25.010> inside<00:03:25.250> rail<00:03:25.430> from<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.640> time

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
that on that inside rail from the time

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.550 
that on that inside rail from the time
that<00:03:25.910> we're<00:03:26.030> paddling<00:03:26.209> in<00:03:26.600> through<00:03:27.440> the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
that we're paddling in through the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.650 
that we're paddling in through the
pop-up<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.220> transfer<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.910> into<00:03:29.180> our<00:03:29.300> stance

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
pop-up and transfer that into our stance

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.690 
pop-up and transfer that into our stance
as<00:03:29.870> we<00:03:30.050> get<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.290> our<00:03:30.380> feet<00:03:30.650> another<00:03:31.280> big<00:03:31.520> error

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
as we get to our feet another big error

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.910 
as we get to our feet another big error
is<00:03:32.000> popping<00:03:32.510> up<00:03:32.660> off<00:03:32.840> center<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.620> know<00:03:33.739> we're

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
is popping up off center you know we're

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.110 
is popping up off center you know we're
paddling<00:03:34.100> in<00:03:34.489> we're<00:03:34.700> going<00:03:34.910> at<00:03:35.000> an<00:03:35.060> angle

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
paddling in we're going at an angle

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.400 
paddling in we're going at an angle
we're<00:03:35.390> ready<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.690> get<00:03:35.810> moving<00:03:36.050> down<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.260> line

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
we're ready to get moving down the line

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.380 
we're ready to get moving down the line
but<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.250> have<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.550> allow<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.760> board<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.120> move

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
but you have to allow the board to move

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.630 
but you have to allow the board to move
with<00:03:38.600> you<00:03:38.750> if<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.020> pop<00:03:39.290> up<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:40.190> lean<00:03:40.430> off

the board or your get out in front of
your<00:03:42.620> surfboard<00:03:43.100> you're<00:03:43.190> gonna<00:03:43.310> be

your surfboard you're gonna be

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.740 
your surfboard you're gonna be
off-balance<00:03:44.090> we<00:03:44.209> always<00:03:44.390> want<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.600> stay

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
off-balance we always want to stay

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.020 
off-balance we always want to stay
centered<00:03:45.050> over<00:03:45.110> our<00:03:45.320> surfboard<00:03:45.769> so<00:03:46.250> if<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.459> lean

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
centered over our surfboard so if I lean

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.509 
centered over our surfboard so if I lean
up<00:03:47.209> or<00:03:47.420> if<00:03:47.540> I'm<00:03:47.660> leaning<00:03:47.959> off<00:03:48.050> the<00:03:48.200> board<00:03:48.519> more

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
up or if I'm leaning off the board more

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.280 
up or if I'm leaning off the board more
than<00:03:49.820> my<00:03:50.000> board<00:03:50.239> is<00:03:50.330> angling<00:03:50.720> what's<00:03:51.170> gonna

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
than my board is angling what's gonna

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.720 
than my board is angling what's gonna
happen<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.620> I'm<00:03:51.650> gonna<00:03:51.769> pop<00:03:52.040> up<00:03:52.070> my<00:03:52.430> body's

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
happen is I'm gonna pop up my body's

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.040 
happen is I'm gonna pop up my body's
gonna<00:03:52.880> be<00:03:53.000> off<00:03:53.090> balance<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.570> I'm<00:03:53.630> gonna<00:03:53.720> fall

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
gonna be off balance and I'm gonna fall

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.780 
gonna be off balance and I'm gonna fall
and<00:03:54.320> whatever<00:03:54.890> direction<00:03:55.100> that<00:03:55.489> I'm<00:03:55.580> leaning

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
and whatever direction that I'm leaning

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.610 
and whatever direction that I'm leaning
and<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.239> causes<00:03:56.600> me<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.750> completely<00:03:57.290> blow<00:03:57.440> the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
and it causes me to completely blow the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.290 
and it causes me to completely blow the
wave<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.400> last<00:03:58.610> air<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:58.820> see<00:03:59.090> all<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.269> time

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
wave and the last air I see all the time

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.449 
wave and the last air I see all the time
is<00:03:59.750> just<00:03:59.780> missing<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.620> wave<00:04:00.769> in<00:04:00.920> general<00:04:01.250> so

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
is just missing the wave in general so

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.610 
is just missing the wave in general so
if<00:04:01.610> we<00:04:01.760> have<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:01.940> peak<00:04:02.720> coming<00:04:02.989> in<00:04:03.200> here<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.560> I'm

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
if we have a peak coming in here and I'm

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.380 
if we have a peak coming in here and I'm
angling<00:04:03.950> my<00:04:04.130> take<00:04:04.400> off<00:04:04.580> if<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.850> ain't<00:04:05.030> lit<00:04:05.239> too

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
angling my take off if I ain't lit too

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.080 
angling my take off if I ain't lit too
much<00:04:05.600> or<00:04:05.900> paddle<00:04:06.320> too<00:04:06.560> far<00:04:06.860> or<00:04:07.100> too<00:04:07.130> soon<00:04:07.550> it's

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
much or paddle too far or too soon it's

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.490 
much or paddle too far or too soon it's
gonna<00:04:08.180> happen<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.570> I'm<00:04:08.660> gonna<00:04:08.750> paddle<00:04:09.050> myself

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
gonna happen is I'm gonna paddle myself

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.830 
gonna happen is I'm gonna paddle myself
so<00:04:09.769> far<00:04:10.040> away<00:04:10.160> from<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.519> peak<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:11.030> I'm<00:04:11.690> not

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
so far away from the peak that I'm not

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.240 
so far away from the peak that I'm not
actually<00:04:12.110> gonna<00:04:12.200> be<00:04:12.380> able<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.680> catch<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.130> wave

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
actually gonna be able to catch the wave

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.890 
actually gonna be able to catch the wave
I'm<00:04:13.550> gonna<00:04:13.700> paddle<00:04:13.910> myself<00:04:14.330> over<00:04:14.600> towards<00:04:14.840> the

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
I'm gonna paddle myself over towards the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.349 
I'm gonna paddle myself over towards the
shoulder<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.489> in<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.640> area<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.970> waiver<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
shoulder and in the area the waiver the

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.420 
shoulder and in the area the waiver the
where<00:04:17.630> it's<00:04:17.750> not<00:04:17.900> breaking<00:04:18.380> at<00:04:18.470> all<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:18.890> it'll

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
where it's not breaking at all and it'll

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.340 
where it's not breaking at all and it'll
cause<00:04:19.640> me<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.910> completely<00:04:20.269> miss<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.959> wave<00:04:21.140> so

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
cause me to completely miss the wave so

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.600 
cause me to completely miss the wave so
we<00:04:21.380> want<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.709> just<00:04:21.769> make<00:04:21.919> sure<00:04:22.039> that<00:04:22.190> we<00:04:22.340> time

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
we want to just make sure that we time

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.310 
we want to just make sure that we time
it<00:04:22.640> correctly<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:23.390> we're<00:04:23.870> not<00:04:23.990> paddling

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
it correctly and we're not paddling

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.860 
it correctly and we're not paddling
ourselves<00:04:24.830> away<00:04:25.280> from<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.490> peak<00:04:25.789> so<00:04:26.539> guys<00:04:26.690> now

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870

quick demonstration of what it looks
like<00:04:29.389> as<00:04:29.540> I'm<00:04:29.690> piling<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.139> see<00:04:30.410> this<00:04:30.560> shows<00:04:30.830> my

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
like as I'm piling you see this shows my

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.460 
like as I'm piling you see this shows my
balance<00:04:31.639> from<00:04:31.730> left<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.180> right<00:04:32.389> as<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.720> go<00:04:33.139> side

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
balance from left to right as I go side

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.379 
balance from left to right as I go side
to<00:04:33.590> side<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.400> if<00:04:34.490> I<00:04:34.580> want<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:34.850> angle<00:04:35.090> my<00:04:35.150> take

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
to side so if I want to angle my take

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.120 
to side so if I want to angle my take
off<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.660> my<00:04:35.780> right<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.260> started<00:04:36.710> on<00:04:36.770> paddling

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
off to my right I started on paddling

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.470 
off to my right I started on paddling
and<00:04:37.280> I'm<00:04:37.400> looking<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:37.760> my<00:04:37.880> right<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:38.300> want

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
and I'm looking to my right and I want

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.850 
and I'm looking to my right and I want
to<00:04:38.540> be<00:04:38.600> leaning<00:04:38.840> in<00:04:39.169> that<00:04:39.230> direction<00:04:39.320> because

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
to be leaning in that direction because

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.200 
to be leaning in that direction because
that<00:04:39.950> was<00:04:40.100> gonna<00:04:40.310> do<00:04:40.430> some<00:04:40.610> maybe<00:04:40.730> paddler<00:04:41.180> and

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
that was gonna do some maybe paddler and

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.760 
that was gonna do some maybe paddler and
angle<00:04:41.570> so<00:04:41.990> I'm<00:04:42.080> leaning<00:04:42.290> towards<00:04:42.680> my

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
angle so I'm leaning towards my

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.950 
angle so I'm leaning towards my
right-hand<00:04:43.010> side<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.700> then<00:04:44.090> as<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.360> pop<00:04:44.600> up<00:04:44.810> I'm

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
right-hand side and then as I pop up I'm

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.510 
right-hand side and then as I pop up I'm
gonna<00:04:45.139> keep<00:04:45.290> pressure<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.950> little<00:04:46.280> bit<00:04:46.370> more

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
gonna keep pressure a little bit more

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.920 
gonna keep pressure a little bit more
pressure<00:04:46.760> on<00:04:46.880> my<00:04:47.060> right<00:04:47.240> hand<00:04:47.450> side<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:47.810> can

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
pressure on my right hand side so I can

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.750 
pressure on my right hand side so I can
keep<00:04:48.020> pressure<00:04:48.260> on<00:04:48.350> this<00:04:48.500> inside<00:04:48.800> rail<00:04:49.040> as<00:04:49.580> I

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
keep pressure on this inside rail as I

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.930 
keep pressure on this inside rail as I
pop<00:04:50.000> up<00:04:50.030> my<00:04:50.900> pressure<00:04:51.139> stays<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.950> transfer<00:04:52.790> from

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
pop up my pressure stays I transfer from

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.030 
pop up my pressure stays I transfer from
my<00:04:53.120> hand<00:04:53.389> to<00:04:53.570> my<00:04:53.690> toes<00:04:53.960> so<00:04:54.260> that<00:04:54.620> my<00:04:54.800> board

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
my hand to my toes so that my board

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.350 
my hand to my toes so that my board
stays<00:04:55.280> on<00:04:55.460> rail<00:04:55.639> in<00:04:55.760> the<00:04:55.820> direction<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.150> want<00:04:56.330> to

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
stays on rail in the direction I want to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.360 
stays on rail in the direction I want to
go<00:04:56.419> and<00:04:56.810> boom<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.590> can<00:04:57.770> move<00:04:57.889> off<00:04:58.130> in<00:04:58.310> the

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
go and boom I can move off in the

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.760 
go and boom I can move off in the
direction<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:59.630> I'm<00:04:59.780> angled<00:05:00.200> same<00:05:00.620> with

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770
