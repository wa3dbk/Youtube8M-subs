00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 as well explained in the note they tend 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.629
 to let's say all the waste as 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.910
 texts noble materials for 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.800
 body therefore all wood and the other 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.389
 you have to see is never to put it in the light 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.920
 is very strong for it they are almost like 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.440
 vampires and then dark and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.789
 original room temperature not 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.010
 I want to tell my experience that is 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.470
 traumatic they gave me with the week 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.529
 last I took it covered with a jar 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.480
 well because the truth because I thought that if 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.779
 I was turning in the car and already the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.579
 house did not uncover them and they died and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.200
 they died when they distracted me 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.790
 delicate however everything you can 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.140
 make interior of your body's environment 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.090
 it's remarkable that's why you have to take care of it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.559
 we have always shown you remember with 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.289
 a little house to cover it so you can 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.570
 breathe a towel that serves and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.210
 change the water is the idea 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.699
 Ideally every day but day 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 domestic environment and the minimum where one 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.050
 has to do the water transfer 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.050
 boiling and also hopefully filtered 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.159
 exactly in fact if you look at it here 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.590
 please 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.240
 the fungus as well as it is preserved are almost 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.020
 like pop with like goat of those who 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.640
 we consume 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.799
 obviously when they watch a movie it comes out 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.840
 to mozzarella cheese exactly as 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.240
 balls without eyes and that someone for 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.189
 example found very as if it has been 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.959
 the fermentation since they only 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.819
 they feed on milk with that 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.950
 keep 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.929
 it is recommended to add if someone 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.939
 a little surprise the taste or a 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:35.590
 teaspoon of honey or sugar also 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:37.240
 I wish sugar blond expression me by 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.060
 look a little bit more it has been maybe 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.219
 but with a neutral like the ricotta 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.679
 example a problem but as we said 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.939
 other properties are all bongos 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.020
 they do more or less the same 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.450
 the chlorine particles and there what 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.879
 said some says I'm going to throw what 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.030
 I understand as the most beneficial sugar 

00:01:54.879 --> 00:02:00.129
 well, life 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.099
 natural sugar chancaca obviously for 

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:05.170
 the fungi here and here but and this 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.060
 context in which we already speak also what 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.679
 bring for diabetics 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.460
 approximately 25 percent of what 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.050
 normal that you put on 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.540
 excellent clear because you have to understand 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.720
 which is the food with which we 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.600
 we will naturally grow to believe 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.210
 that they reproduce quickly without 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.980
 However, keep in mind the differences to the concept 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.110
 what you want from each of this 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.150
 Congo has to do with the time of 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.400
 mushrooms are different 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.500
 let's say if delicate are the most 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.270
 fast are the most agile the in the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.070
 construction to use wins polo but in 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.200
 the case of the east fungus of milk 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.360
 we have then where we start from 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.160
 where we get the object I think there's 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.680
 do with water with sugar as the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.380
 process milk goal with milk with milk 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.480
 with Chinese milk forgiveness and obviously what 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.250
 that we said these things are not sold they 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.370
 give away there are people who 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.860
 sell as we said if you are in 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.720
 an extreme urgency of wanting to get the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.400
 results I can do it but 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.620
 always when there is price and currencies 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.590
 by means they may not be 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.450
 really what one is buying the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.830
 Bongos who say they are better 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.330
 try to get just stay where 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.320
 we know that there is a goodwill what 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.970
 who of the people that with 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.420
 gratefulness wants to share that with 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.370
 others 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.689
 from here we start 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.189
 well we start here in the sector 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.379
 because it 's what happens to you in the 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.409
 gift that you start with the 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.120
 water withdrawals everything we do not have 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.650
 here a sherd of the team but we can 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.930
 understand that the result is that this 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.569
 vial that is empty and that we fill it 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.420
 of milk they put the mushrooms 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:43.970
 in there then suppose that here 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.370
 There would only be milk to milk as they are 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.739
 those that we did not get that gave us 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.590
 already then in a pot of milk that 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.269
 It has to be whole and with lactose I 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.950
 sleep because if healthy and green dishes 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.049
 they feed those who have what they 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.639
 of the body ni and obviously it's the liquid 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.530
 that the one who is going to serve you does not have 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.720
 exact interior when you go lactose 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.639
 of the most important the most important 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.090
 then in the milk gesture you are 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.519
 add then 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.890
 already done if this is has not returned 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.690
 you part with that your gift up 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.790
 the new scope and then with a pot of 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.620
 milk is warned and they remain as is 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.329
 here he prepares eye 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.160
 you can fill milk high but 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.290
 always important that being that they are 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.970
 living creatures that need also 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.220
 of air not in excess because the air 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.350
 we try what evolutionary training is a 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.729
 very powerful poison that is enough to cut 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.010
 an apple waits in less than a minute 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.810
 and they already put you to your beloved that's 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.699
 oxidize our body oxidizes the 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.960
 breathing presents life to us but at 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.610
 same time we also wear out not 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.250
 age that you can talk about 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.720
 antioxidants that ruined a bit of 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.720
 very important air 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.030
 Usually when one pours messes 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.669
 sugar is not thrown so that the mushrooms 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.500
 are fed only it is added in cases 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.229
 so that hairs so that someone 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.330
 It does not look like much to the taste when I 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.250
 stone in the malba june a neutron 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.910
 yogurt in the filter exactly because 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:15.419
 the sugar does not prolong for you 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:20.430
 honey that act milk with fungi 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.500
 one or two days serves as like this 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.270
 because you that this one returned my breakfast 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.599
 which is like a yogurt as it is 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.599
 well, exactly 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:37.740
 after turn to the steps that the 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.020
 drums is not what one eats what 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.630
 one eats in the case of milk water 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.550
 or the tea that we are going to go to that is the 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.200
 decanting of the action that 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.479
 positioned on the liquid where he lives 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.520
 one then one does not eat I do not 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.010
 chew it out there they pass some 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.320
 cells and everything well in strict rigor the 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.180
 bongos are returned to follow their 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.830
 growth process of feeding 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.539
 the colonies and keep growing 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.870
 I can eat this with cereals 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.430
 example with the chopped fruit not because in 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.919
 the sector and with those going to lose those going to 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.139
 kill and already the benefit are not the 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.539
 bongos same but that is in what you 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.520
 they made the milk in which it is 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.529
 little egg and could take with 1 tbsp 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.889
 sugar 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:21.709
 it's something cereal I eat it and then 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:25.519
 immediately I put the milk what 

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:28.209
 came down in fact more milk is removed but 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:28.209
 then it returns
