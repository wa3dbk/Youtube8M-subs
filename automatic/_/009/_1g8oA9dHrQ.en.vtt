natural instrument to play the one thing
we<00:01:03.969> want<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.210> think<00:01:04.360> about<00:01:04.510> is<00:01:04.930> having<00:01:05.290> curved

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
we want to think about is having curved

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.749 
we want to think about is having curved
fingers<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:07.630> you<00:01:07.659> play<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:08.799> to<00:01:09.310> start<00:01:09.579> off

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
fingers when you play you to start off

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.080 
fingers when you play you to start off
pretend<00:01:10.450> you're<00:01:11.140> holding<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.740> ball<00:01:12.130> or<00:01:12.400> a<00:01:12.460> piece

the sake of this video lesson I'm going

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.810 
the sake of this video lesson I'm going
to<00:01:20.020> turn<00:01:20.170> my<00:01:20.350> hand<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.799> side<00:01:21.009> and<00:01:21.280> you'll

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
to turn my hand to the side and you'll

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.179 
to turn my hand to the side and you'll
see<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.210> there<00:01:22.420> is<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.570> curvature<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:24.009> the

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
see that there is a curvature to the

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.130 
see that there is a curvature to the
fingers<00:01:24.610> we<00:01:25.420> want<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.720> maintain<00:01:25.869> that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
fingers we want to maintain that

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.780 
fingers we want to maintain that
curvature<00:01:26.619> even<00:01:27.159> if<00:01:27.250> your<00:01:27.399> fingers<00:01:27.670> are

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
curvature even if your fingers are

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.060 
curvature even if your fingers are
nearly<00:01:28.180> flat<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:29.259> want<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.470> keep<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.799> slight

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
nearly flat you want to keep a slight

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.219 
nearly flat you want to keep a slight
curvature<00:01:30.750> depending<00:01:31.750> on<00:01:31.840> how<00:01:32.020> you're

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
curvature depending on how you're

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.740 
curvature depending on how you're
playing<00:01:32.469> in<00:01:32.799> a<00:01:32.950> piece<00:01:33.189> or<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.520> song<00:01:33.880> what<00:01:34.630> you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
playing in a piece or a song what you

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.350 
playing in a piece or a song what you
want<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.049> avoid<00:01:35.380> is<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:36.189> knuckle<00:01:36.490> any<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.240> the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
want to avoid is the knuckle any of the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.660 
want to avoid is the knuckle any of the
knuckles<00:01:37.719> bending<00:01:38.259> back<00:01:38.770> against<00:01:39.340> itself

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
knuckles bending back against itself

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.240 
knuckles bending back against itself
that's<00:01:40.000> unnatural<00:01:40.600> anyway<00:01:41.290> it's<00:01:41.890> not<00:01:42.040> going

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
that's unnatural anyway it's not going

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.249 
that's unnatural anyway it's not going
to<00:01:42.340> feel<00:01:42.579> very<00:01:42.880> good<00:01:43.119> it's<00:01:43.540> also<00:01:43.750> going<00:01:44.110> to

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
to feel very good it's also going to

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.840 
to feel very good it's also going to
increase<00:01:44.530> your<00:01:44.560> chances<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:45.250> slipping<00:01:45.670> off<00:01:45.820> a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
increase your chances of slipping off a

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.810 
increase your chances of slipping off a
note<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:46.390> making<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.259> bad<00:01:47.439> tone<00:01:47.860> or<00:01:48.219> bad<00:01:48.430> sound

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
note and making a bad tone or bad sound

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.990 
note and making a bad tone or bad sound
on<00:01:49.149> piano<00:01:50.039> it's<00:01:51.039> the<00:01:51.250> same<00:01:51.430> as<00:01:51.579> true<00:01:51.759> for<00:01:51.939> the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
on piano it's the same as true for the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.910 
on piano it's the same as true for the
left<00:01:52.210> hand<00:01:52.299> if<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.259> pretend<00:01:53.619> you're<00:01:53.770> holding

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
left hand if you pretend you're holding

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.310 
left hand if you pretend you're holding
a<00:01:54.189> piece<00:01:54.219> of<00:01:54.460> fruit<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.090> then<00:01:55.630> turn<00:01:55.899> your<00:01:55.930> hand

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
a piece of fruit and then turn your hand

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.789 
a piece of fruit and then turn your hand
over

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
over

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.100 
over
you'll<00:01:56.979> see<00:01:57.250> there's<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:58.000> curvature<00:01:58.600> here<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
you'll see there's a curvature here and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.319 
you'll see there's a curvature here and
you<00:01:59.530> want<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.770> maintain<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:01.090> same

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
you want to maintain that so the same

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.709 
you want to maintain that so the same
technique<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:02.140> true<00:02:02.829> for<00:02:03.219> both<00:02:03.340> hands<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
technique is true for both hands the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.859 
technique is true for both hands the
next<00:02:05.020> thing<00:02:05.140> I'd<00:02:05.259> like<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.590> talk<00:02:05.799> about<00:02:06.009> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
next thing I'd like to talk about is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.050 
next thing I'd like to talk about is
releasing<00:02:07.869> keys<00:02:08.590> when<00:02:09.160> people<00:02:09.460> start<00:02:09.759> playing

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
releasing keys when people start playing

into<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.350> lower<00:04:53.530> notes<00:04:57.300> let's<00:04:58.300> look<00:04:58.690> now<00:04:58.960> at

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
into the lower notes let's look now at

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.290 
into the lower notes let's look now at
the<00:04:59.890> notes<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.460> keyboard<00:05:00.940> we've<00:05:01.120> already

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
the notes of the keyboard we've already

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.830 
the notes of the keyboard we've already
found<00:05:01.870> middle<00:05:02.350> C<00:05:02.590> right<00:05:03.190> here<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.700> then<00:05:04.480> as<00:05:04.690> we

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
found middle C right here and then as we

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.990 
found middle C right here and then as we
mentioned<00:05:05.020> in<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.410> book<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:06.160> piano<00:05:06.490> is<00:05:06.730> very

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
mentioned in the book the piano is very

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.810 
mentioned in the book the piano is very
easy<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.890> understand<00:05:08.890> in<00:05:09.130> terms<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.610> notes

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
easy to understand in terms of the notes

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.960 
easy to understand in terms of the notes
because<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.810> follows<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.350> alphabet<00:05:12.070> so<00:05:12.430> we're

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
because it follows the alphabet so we're

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.300 
because it follows the alphabet so we're
started<00:05:13.390> at<00:05:13.540> our<00:05:13.630> alphabet<00:05:13.990> goes<00:05:14.229> from<00:05:14.560> A<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:15.130> G

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
started at our alphabet goes from A to G

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.940 
started at our alphabet goes from A to G
in<00:05:15.850> music<00:05:16.540> it<00:05:16.690> doesn't<00:05:16.960> go<00:05:17.200> beyond<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.740> letter

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
in music it doesn't go beyond the letter

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.420 
in music it doesn't go beyond the letter
G<00:05:18.280> so<00:05:19.000> if<00:05:19.240> we<00:05:19.390> find<00:05:19.630> middle<00:05:19.960> C<00:05:20.080> we<00:05:20.740> find<00:05:21.040> our<00:05:21.160> two

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
G so if we find middle C we find our two

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.150 
G so if we find middle C we find our two
Black<00:05:21.910> Keys<00:05:21.940> in<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:23.080> middle<00:05:23.350> of<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.979> keyboard

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
Black Keys in the middle of the keyboard

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.560 
Black Keys in the middle of the keyboard
then<00:05:24.700> C<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.330> then<00:05:26.080> we<00:05:26.200> walk<00:05:26.410> two<00:05:26.710> notes<00:05:26.919> down

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
then C and then we walk two notes down

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.620 
then C and then we walk two notes down
one<00:05:28.570> two<00:05:29.140> that's<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:30.130> note<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.490> so<00:05:31.360> with<00:05:31.479> your

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
one two that's the note a so with your

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.060 
one two that's the note a so with your
index<00:05:31.990> finger<00:05:32.169> I'd<00:05:32.650> like<00:05:32.979> you<00:05:33.160> to<00:05:33.460> find<00:05:33.640> a<00:05:33.970> C

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
index finger I'd like you to find a C

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.060 
index finger I'd like you to find a C
and<00:05:36.070> two<00:05:36.400> keys<00:05:36.610> down<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:37.750> then<00:05:38.620> we're<00:05:38.919> going

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
and two keys down and then we're going

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.510 
and two keys down and then we're going
to<00:05:39.280> climb<00:05:39.580> up<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:40.419> piano<00:05:40.660> keyboard<00:05:41.520> saying

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
to climb up the piano keyboard saying

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:54.000 
to climb up the piano keyboard saying
the<00:05:43.419> letters<00:05:43.750> so<00:05:48.660> a-b-c-d-e-f-g<00:05:52.800> and<00:05:53.800> that's

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
the letters so a-b-c-d-e-f-g and that's

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.820 
the letters so a-b-c-d-e-f-g and that's
the<00:05:54.160> end<00:05:54.340> of<00:05:54.669> piano<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.600> music<00:05:56.020> alphabet<00:05:56.620> so

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
the end of piano and music alphabet so

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.420 
the end of piano and music alphabet so
it<00:05:57.010> will<00:05:57.130> just<00:05:57.310> repeat<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:59.250> b<00:06:00.250> c<00:06:00.840> d

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
it will just repeat a b c d

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.070 
it will just repeat a b c d
e<00:06:04.169> f<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:05.560> so<00:06:06.550> on<00:06:06.729> you<00:06:07.180> can<00:06:07.360> get<00:06:07.600> the<00:06:07.720> idea<00:06:07.750> that

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
e f and so on you can get the idea that

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.620 
e f and so on you can get the idea that
it<00:06:08.320> continues<00:06:08.770> up<00:06:08.979> the<00:06:09.580> lowest<00:06:10.060> note<00:06:10.240> on<00:06:10.509> the
