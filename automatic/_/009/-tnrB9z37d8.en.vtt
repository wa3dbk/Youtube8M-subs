00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.570
 hello that such good morning nothing else 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.910
 I want to say that he commanded a little bit 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.730
 influenza and it is because today there are not many 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.770
 I want to cook but I'm hungry 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.840
 busy fasting something like that is that I do not 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.290
 I got up to make myself a milestone sandwich if 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.480
 ok little egg with cheese 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.580
 Yellow and said well then let's 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.200
 record it to share it so they can see 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.809
 that although one is sick as well as 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.960
 want they have to cook the disadvantage 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.360
 with this alone but then in hands to the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.940
 work because you know I always take them 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.940
 I recommend grape seed oil 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.320
 but when entering 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.920
 i 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.940
 grabbed the pains 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.940
 we remove it 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.570
 and nothing more 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.450
 you see that you enter by not putting the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.180
 ham sausage although this vegetable 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.180
 little onions and ready something 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.770
 today as simple as possible 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.670
 since although I have the stomach 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.670
 Enough 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.610
 I was lying down and just going around and 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.610
 round and round 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.650
 and I'm not waiting for someone 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.540
 more to come and tell you here is your 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.730
 breakfast in the bed but then 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.000
 hence the disadvantage of when an airplane 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.090
 'solar sme can live alone I love 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 live alone but on these occasions as 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.340
 that there are things 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.500
 It will be like what you want to be with 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.630
 someone and let's not say a relationship 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.950
 loving family friend who was 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.959
 Well, it was ready in the morning 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.959
 to put it in the field 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.320
 Well, out which this is it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.330
 All it does is put mayonnaise is 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.550
 can put butter but I put it 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.740
 Mayonnaise 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.740
 a considerable amount 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.030
 I know what you gave us when he gives us diet 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.749
 Well, I'm not going to limit myself to putting you 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.749
 enough quantity 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.580
 unfortunately, the majority are 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.580
 richer knows 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.130
 Y 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.890
 now let's put the little egg 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.720
 in either of the two loaves 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.490
 the one that stays outside when I eat it 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.490
 with a fork not and to limit 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.390
 the doctor appears 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.790
 they are two little eggs and I will put nothing 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.040
 more a yellow cheese than above for 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.819
 that the warm of the egg starts it 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.819
 melt 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.290
 and how do I tell you what was worth about 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.290
 Towards the rods nothing more 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.730
 and then I will accompany it with a little dot 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.730
 I'm going back to sewing 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.990
 Well, my mother always told me the same 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.960
 my grandmother that the best medicines for 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.480
 construction permit is the food the no 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.120
 stop eating is the best kind if 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.520
 effectively here is a little bit 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.240
 although they allow allow but hunger 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.770
 do not get rid of me 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.400
 and even if it's little egg do not fall but 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.400
 you have to eat something 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.209
 This time I did not put anything spicy look 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.900
 I love spicy but not everything 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.900
 time can be 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.630
 the miracle that I did not give him the love of 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.410
 fools of always dances 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:39.520
 it shows that being a bit sickly 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.520
 the fourth part of a single 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.510
 and also simple is very rich 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.820
 and 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.820
 s 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.330
 a limit cited to decongest and I 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.330
 I go to the bed again 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.770
 see you
