retaliating towards this you realize you

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.930 
retaliating towards this you realize you
can<00:02:39.420> reverse<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.870> again<00:02:40.459> what<00:02:41.459> he<00:02:41.550> does<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.910> he

can reverse it again what he does is he

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.660 
can reverse it again what he does is he
uses<00:02:42.360> his<00:02:42.540> burner<00:02:42.810> I'm<00:02:43.590> sorry<00:02:43.830> burning<00:02:44.370> inner

strength<00:02:45.060> which<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.050> basically<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.709> power<00:02:47.130> that

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
strength which is basically a power that

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.130 
strength which is basically a power that
allows<00:02:47.430> him<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.850> defeat<00:02:48.150> anybody<00:02:48.630> because

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
allows him to defeat anybody because

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.340 
allows him to defeat anybody because
he's<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> manga<00:02:50.100> hero<00:02:50.420> shounen<00:02:51.420> gotta<00:02:51.900> love<00:02:52.200> it

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
he's a manga hero shounen gotta love it

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.850 
he's a manga hero shounen gotta love it
anyway<00:02:53.040> he<00:02:53.880> reverses<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.510> spins<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.530> hits

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
anyway he reverses it spins up and hits

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.280 
anyway he reverses it spins up and hits
him<00:02:56.040> on<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.280> ceiling<00:02:57.120> with<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.510> canoe<00:02:57.780> buster

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
him on the ceiling with the canoe buster

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.949 
him on the ceiling with the canoe buster
I<00:02:58.700> think<00:02:59.700> that's<00:02:59.850> how<00:03:00.000> he<00:03:00.030> defeats<00:03:00.480> no<00:03:00.780> he

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
I think that's how he defeats no he

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.840 
I think that's how he defeats no he
doesn't<00:03:01.290> defeat<00:03:01.500> him<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.459> might<00:03:02.670> I

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
doesn't defeat him like that you might I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.310 
doesn't defeat him like that you might I
don't<00:03:03.209> remember<00:03:03.300> it's<00:03:03.720> been<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.900> while<00:03:04.110> since

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
don't remember it's been a while since

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.760 
don't remember it's been a while since
I've<00:03:04.500> read<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:05.390> that's<00:03:06.390> truly<00:03:06.930> devastating

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
I've read it that's truly devastating

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.000 
I've read it that's truly devastating
technique<00:03:08.190> um<00:03:08.459> it's<00:03:08.910> also<00:03:09.090> used<00:03:09.709> I'll<00:03:10.709> see

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
technique um it's also used I'll see

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.820 
technique um it's also used I'll see
it's<00:03:11.610> used<00:03:11.730> by<00:03:11.880> stochastic<00:03:12.480> King<00:03:12.800> because<00:03:13.800> he

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
it's used by stochastic King because he

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.880 
it's used by stochastic King because he
has<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.760> tapes<00:03:15.360> but<00:03:16.110> we'll<00:03:16.380> get<00:03:16.500> into<00:03:16.650> him

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
can you come on tarro you might know him

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.440 
can you come on tarro you might know him
from<00:03:22.320> ultimate<00:03:23.010> muscle<00:03:23.220> we<00:03:23.820> won't<00:03:24.030> talk<00:03:24.239> about

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
from ultimate muscle we won't talk about

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.340 
from ultimate muscle we won't talk about
that<00:03:24.600> because<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.200> was<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> horrible<00:03:25.830> dub<00:03:27.350> also

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
that because it was a horrible dub also
