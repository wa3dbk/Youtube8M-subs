00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.339
 Welcome to this new world video 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.140
 leg that serves and good today I will teach 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.660
 the enchantment of fortune that sure 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 many will already know it because good 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.380
 is one of the most used enchantments 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.240
 especially at the time of mining and then 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.050
 well here we have the different 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.869
 levels are only three good each 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.760
 this obviously gives you a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.490
 greater probability to get 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.320
 materials especially at the time of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.990
 look but we'll see also 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.620
 it serves for some other things this I'm going 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.420
 to use this the peak of fortune 3 and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 because fortune 3 but the rest 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.950
 because it really is a little more 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.680
 difficult to show everyone so I'm going to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.140
 teach what he really does and good 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.600
 here we have diamond him what he usually 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.629
 give us the diamond with a normal peak is 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.989
 only one diamond then with 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.149
 fortune level 1 you could get two 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.039
 lucky diamonds at level 2 could you 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.530
 get three diamonds and with this one 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.909
 fortune 3 you could get up to four 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.950
 10 diamonds 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.049
 something pretty 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.430
 convenience with convenient but 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.159
 then game 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.979
 let's try this and then here we go to 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.210
 apply it came out in a diamond and it came out 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.210
 another one and there comes out one ok if nothing does not 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.200
 I was fixing here how much they came out here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 they came out three and well yes it's enough 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.340
 quite effective especially at the time 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.340
 to look at diamond because then 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.800
 It is usually very difficult to find 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.650
 demand with which other materials serves 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.260
 this also works with coal or with 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.920
 the quartz with the emeralds with the 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:58.760
 Redstone with lapis lazuli with 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:01.520
 luminous stone with with watermelons and 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.320
 well here we see that it is really 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.240
 that you get many more minerals and 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.850
 Well, you do not see me, I like it 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.330
 very much this enchantment because then 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.250
 gives you then to get more materials 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.470
 and faster 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.360
 well here we have gravel because we have 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.540
 gravel good it turns out that with this 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.260
 enchantment to level 3 by destroying the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.840
 gravel gives us flint in all the serious 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.050
 that we destroy so we have left very 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.350
 ok when you're going to make arrows or some 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.620
 item like a cigarette lighter but only 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.780
 you need one that other things work 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.450
 they also work with some crops 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.430
 It should be noted that for wheat only 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.410
 It affects the seeds that give you this way 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.510
 that they do not expect much with the 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.180
 wheat but if it's served with carrots 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.860
 potatoes even with the wart of the ned and 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.100
 Well, let's see what the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.490
 Warts are only three but we see how much 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.960
 gives us here gave us three 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:08.050
 ok there he gave us 6 if they fixed ok 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.080
 we have 9 and there he gave us 3 of no but 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.390
 well really if it affects more or less 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.620
 the probability and then here with the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.610
 carrots what does not usually give 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.370
 normally it's from two to four more or 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.550
 less then when destroying it with one of 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.300
 these peaks I get 6 for example here 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.420
 they came out 5 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.580
 There's only two of them coming out but well this 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.250
 it can vary a lot then here as 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.650
 I told them he is always going to give us 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.290
 one of wheat but they will give us more 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.110
 seeds if they fix us gives us a lot to 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.530
 of seeds I got six and then no 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.930
 they know eating a lot if you want 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.910
 reproduce more your farm or something and 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.280
 also with crops you 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.880
 It agrees a lot to because then 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.430
 plants - and cultivate more I do not know is something 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.260
 what pleases me and so good with what other 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.080
 system would serve also serves a little 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.120
 with what would be the giant pinks 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.120
 the mushrooms these coming out 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:18.970
 the giant red mushrooms good and then 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.620
 with I think it only affects that 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.680
 I do not know if I mentioned that with quartz 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.300
 it also served but then the quartz to me 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.490
 I really like to use it with this 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.340
 because even though there's a lot in 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.410
 Hell, simply because 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.650
 constructions require a lot 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.810
 quartz to do something pretty and 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.040
 I personally like it very much 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.570
 good effort if you liked the video 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.210
 leave your like comment that the 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.430
 disappeared that they believe that I have been lacking 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:54.750
 is nothing and so keep on facebook and in 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.750
 twitter and until next time and chau
