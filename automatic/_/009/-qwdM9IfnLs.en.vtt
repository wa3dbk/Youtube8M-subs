 in primordially if with servers and 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.630
 after stealing the trunk is how they see 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.850
 the description of the video 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.770

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.250
 has protected the tsc is below 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.140
 there's no way they can steal it 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.870
 because they will not be able to break 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.280
 down the block what we need but 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.220
 there are people who usually leave both 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.850
 blocks out there blocks the chés by 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.670

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.340
 that we are going to be able to steal those that still 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.650

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.840
