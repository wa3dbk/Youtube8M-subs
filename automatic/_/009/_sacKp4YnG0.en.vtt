00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.910
 Welcome to the review of 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:07.230
 spicy tank the 400 just under 130 euros 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.510
 Amazon is available 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.370
 on the front side is the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.290
 camera with a quarter vga photos 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.330
 and can record videos and that 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.339
 Infrared lamp for night mode 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.750
 not to forget the microphone and 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.240
 the built-in speaker for the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.099
 Speech communication right on the device 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.749
 is the dismantled antenna 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.640
 for the smooth voters 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:30.060
 communication between smartphone or 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.289
 tablet and the setting acts behind 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.660
 on the device we see two lambs 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.070
 which indicate the condition of the device whether 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.520
 he is looking for wlan or just 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.480
 just connected to iss you know 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.670
 the back side remains relative 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.590
 unspectacular what you are there no 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.510
 This is just for decoration 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.760
 now for a practical test 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.550
 since it is she thinks this one is a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.510
 app open connected via wlan with 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.170
 they think I can free here 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.900
 spicy and such a figure 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.880
 No idea and combination of letters 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:08.520
 we open spacey and see what is 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.960
 actually we should have it like that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.320
 at all for setting options 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.990
 Here we have the opportunity 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.729
 actually and down the camera too 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 move 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.969
 you see it now where that goes up to 45 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.159
 Degree 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:32.539
 the whole thing is really cool like that and how 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.920
 strongly recommend the video now you see 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.689
 you see it a bit jerky you 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.189
 Of course, it can not be done right now 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.189
 expect perfect hd quality 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.899
 wonderful now I come my hobby 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.460
 oh we can ever if leisurely 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.960
 activate and actually 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.960
 infrared camera and not only 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.030
 I hope you have the review for 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.739
 setting if that is the case then 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.810
 Gives a thumbs up if I have one 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.370
 thumbs down 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.959
