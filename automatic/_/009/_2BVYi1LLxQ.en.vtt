00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.560
 What is there aquarium people? Fishtanktv.com Dustin 's Fish Tanks brings you on one 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.269
 Sunday absolutely beautiful beautiful day outside. I am getting here this morning before 9:00 am 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.779
 water changes on 3 tanks. Excited to show Species Sunday on some 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.560
 fish the rainbow, check it out. A lot of people are asking me about Rainbow 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.430
 fish. My fish look good. The tank actually got about 80% water change 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.979
 . I still have to get in and if I really have the time with a slow siphon and dig out 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:36.130
 all dirty parts, it's really gross. I got out as balls and balls and 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.350
 dollop of baby Tears from this tank and plant constants. Yes, it's dirty, yes 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.190
 it is a mess. It still looks pretty hot considering the lack of attention 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.240
 I give it. I have to do a really polished video of this tank. Anyways, this 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.880
 is after an 80% water change, two screaming children does not easily get there 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.340
 to get all the stuff out, but let's talk about some 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.170
 Rainbows people. Let me tell you this, Rainbows good from Australia / New Guinea 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.100
 region, freshwater lakes, habitats that kind of thing. I actually checked out one 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.819
 Catch YouTube video of a guy she lives in Australia, had a nice fall, very cool. I 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:14.600
 am a big fan of Rainbows for a very long time as you all know, so I want to 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.799
 they visible here. Rainbow fishing, most fish like refreshing large water 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.030
 . These guys are just a huge water change, they love it. Their colors come out 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.030
 as KAPOW, the colors in your face. To the right there is a Parke Soni. It could be 

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:36.539
 that there is a different kind with them I do not know. I believe it is a Parke Soni. How 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.030
 also any gurus out there correct me. These are all Melatonai I believe is how you 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.399
 it says is Fredrickii. I can't pronounce anything. There is the only native in the wild caught 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.209
 man I still have, the rest all jumped. Fortunately I had a lot of women and babies 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:56.759
 in there. They haven't grown much because I don't have many water changes on it 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.759
 done, and they are in a kind of small tank for the amount of fish that load 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.279
 in. Now that this is a right here, I am curious about your opinions. I actually bought 

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:13.279
 it's because it looks hot. I don't know exactly what it is, it might be a species 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.600
 of hybrid. I'm not sure, it kind of looks like a cross between Bosmani 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 because it's that real bright tail, but then it has lines here, so I'm curious 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.690
 to hear what you all think it is. I one that was labeled as 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 saw a Prachoct, I don't think this is a Prachoct though. I love your opinion about it 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.630
 and that happens a lot by the way with the fish of the rainbow, you see, like 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 cross breed and are like oh her a new species. No, it's just a cross. And 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.270
 that's too bad actually you want to get pure species and keep the genes like that. Rainbow 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.820
 fish high vegetarian diets, do not like big changes water, not, not 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.060
 in my humble opinion, Rainbow puts fish in less than a 55 liter tank, the average. 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.310
 They are great swimmers, they want the current, they want a lot of space to swim. This one 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.000
 tank is a bit too busy there. Little pearling action going on there. Pearling is when CO2 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.970
 is released ... I'm sorry Oxygen is released from the plants so that these guys grow 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.930
 , loving it. Yes, tell me what you know about Rainbows, tell me what you want to know about 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.230
 Rainbows. I am flying here because my daughter is about to go to sleep. Play 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.860
 in the sprinkler today people, had a lot of fun with it. Madagascar Kant, many people 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.790
 have asked me about Aquatic Jungles to get more Madagascar Lace. Let me be you 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.960
 tell people, when i get in more Kant, i will let you know. So we have 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.370
 a good time at that. Major water changes on this tank. What else was I planning 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.500
 to tell you about this tank? I don't know, Rainbows let me know what you want 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.390
 know, put it in the comments i will yell at you. After a lot of fun loving 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.090
 how these fish look. This mud crawler, by the way, larger than the 220, because 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.480
 he dominates, dominates, dominates the snails in here. I wanted to shout 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.480
 to a number of people who corrected me on a video. Don't forget the video in the 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.910
 greenhouse with the 40 looking at the baby's Tears who corrected me for being a female 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.410
 shrimp, good for you thank you high. I don't know everything. I added some ugly ones 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.100
 men out there. I always thought men were the nicer shrimp but I miss it 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.990
 have got . I have not looked and checked, but whatever. Do you have some more shrimp 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.030
 out there, hoping to get some babies out there. Oh by the way I have some 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.540
 Red Tiger Lotus in, you know how long this last one. I'm totally getting away from it 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.040
 the Lotus in. People have asked me about the Peru fish too, Ill tell you really fast 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.389
 about them . Here are some of the remaining Peru fish. I have the checkerboard cichlids here 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.440
 , one of the severums, and the angels in the back. The 125 I have not talked about, I have 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.270
 sort of been in mourning 2 months back the angelfish I had died for 7 or 8 years 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.900
 . So now out of respect for that fish I might bring these fish up in the 125. I 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.350
 wasn't going to put any moonfish in that tank while he was alive. He 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.590
 is no longer with us so that means that your life is about better big man 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.460
 to get. What's up with the Peruvian Angel, how do you live? So the Lotus love the 50% water 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.960
 refresh too, you can see it here, new leaves just ejecting. One thing about it 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.820
 adjust leave also see any leaves ragged you are going to want them to jerk off 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.410
 . That I would pick. That I would pick. Ragged to get rid of that. Get rid of that 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.940
 . That Severum just yawned to watch. I wish his friends didn't die, they were 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.820
 in the green house. Crinum also returned Calimastratum tons of them and Crinum Betans here 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.460
 , many of them. These are plants that if I don't sell I don't care because 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.610
