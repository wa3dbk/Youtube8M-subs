change in your life the way I like to
explain<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.030> structure<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.870> change<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:59.129> by

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
explain the structure for change is by

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.630 
explain the structure for change is by
means<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.879> an<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.120> energy<00:01:00.540> and<00:01:01.250> this<00:01:02.250> analogy

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
means of an and energy and this analogy

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.590 
means of an and energy and this analogy
is<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.390> map<00:01:03.949> now<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.010> first<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:06.360> need<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
is a map now the first thing we need to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.220 
is a map now the first thing we need to
do<00:01:06.930> before<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:08.280> make<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.730> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.000> myth<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
do before we make use of the myth is to

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.550 
do before we make use of the myth is to
draw<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.500> map<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.230> to<00:01:13.380> do

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
draw the map and this we will have to do

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.149 
draw the map and this we will have to do
through<00:01:14.070> exploration<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:15.590> excavation<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
through exploration or excavation if you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.930 
through exploration or excavation if you
will<00:01:17.370> and<00:01:17.690> this<00:01:18.690> is<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.409> journey<00:01:19.800> or<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> process

will and this is a journey or a process

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.190 
will and this is a journey or a process
of<00:01:21.150> understanding<00:01:21.870> yourself<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:23.630> lot<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.870> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
of understanding yourself a lot of the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.360 
of understanding yourself a lot of the
time<00:01:25.440> we<00:01:26.010> need<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> make<00:01:26.610> use<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> tools<00:01:27.420> for

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
time we need to make use of tools for

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.810 
time we need to make use of tools for
self-discovery<00:01:29.810> understanding<00:01:30.810> values

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
self-discovery understanding values

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.430 
self-discovery understanding values
understanding<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:33.450> our<00:01:33.480> position<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:34.200> life

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
understanding what our position of life

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.340 
understanding what our position of life
balance<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.310> or<00:01:35.670> even<00:01:36.140> understanding<00:01:37.140> what

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
balance is or even understanding what

balance is or even understanding what
bad<00:01:37.620> habits<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.670> change<00:01:39.230> but

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
bad habits we would like to change but

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.160 
bad habits we would like to change but
it's<00:01:40.680> important<00:01:41.370> ultimately<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.570> draw<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> map

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it's important ultimately to draw a map

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.660 
it's important ultimately to draw a map
of<00:01:43.410> who<00:01:43.800> we<00:01:44.160> are<00:01:44.370> as<00:01:44.490> people<00:01:46.010> what<00:01:47.010> things<00:01:47.430> we

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
of who we are as people what things we

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.390 
of who we are as people what things we
love<00:01:47.940> what<00:01:48.720> things<00:01:49.050> we<00:01:49.500> don't<00:01:49.650> love<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.220> much

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
love what things we don't love so much

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.840 
love what things we don't love so much
where<00:01:51.270> our<00:01:51.480> potentials<00:01:52.200> lie<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.860> where<00:01:53.580> our

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
where our potentials lie and where our

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.720 
where our potentials lie and where our
gifts<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.740> once<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.280> map<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
gifts like once we have this map of

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.370 
gifts like once we have this map of
ourselves<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.540> place<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:58.800> can<00:01:58.830> use<00:01:59.220> it<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
ourselves in place we can use it the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.090 
ourselves in place we can use it the
next<00:02:01.740> step<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.400> implementing<00:02:03.240> change<00:02:03.750> is

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
next step in implementing change is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.809 
next step in implementing change is
deciding<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.730> change<00:02:06.470> now<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.800> lot<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
deciding on the change now a lot of the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.330 
deciding on the change now a lot of the
time<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.479> would<00:02:09.509> need<00:02:09.780> tools<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.530> help<00:02:11.069> us

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
time we would need tools to help us

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
time we would need tools to help us
decide<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:13.319> change<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.700> help<00:02:14.879> focus

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
decide on the change and to help focus

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.460 
decide on the change and to help focus
our<00:02:15.569> attention<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.970> correct<00:02:18.360> manner<00:02:18.480> we

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
our attention in the correct manner we

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.710 
our attention in the correct manner we
need<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.800> make<00:02:20.040> change<00:02:20.489> in<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.180> right<00:02:21.330> place

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
need to make change in the right place

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.580 
need to make change in the right place
at<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
at the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.000 
at the
time<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.970> need<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.209> set<00:02:24.599> goals<00:02:24.930> at<00:02:25.349> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
time and we need to set goals at the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.910 
time and we need to set goals at the
right<00:02:26.190> time<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.849> in<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.209> right<00:02:27.480> way<00:02:27.920> goal

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
right time and in the right way goal

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.250 
right time and in the right way goal
setting<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.550> just<00:02:30.269> like<00:02:30.540> deciding<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
setting is just like deciding on a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.150 
setting is just like deciding on a
holiday<00:02:31.560> destination<00:02:33.470> once<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.709> know<00:02:34.890> where

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
holiday destination once we know where

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.630 
holiday destination once we know where
we're<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:36.239> next<00:02:36.569> step<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.980> plan

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
we're going the next step is to plan

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.240 
we're going the next step is to plan
your<00:02:38.849> route<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.920> we<00:02:41.280> call<00:02:41.870> strategizing<00:02:43.250> now

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
your route this we call strategizing now

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.259 
your route this we call strategizing now
strategies<00:02:45.090> are<00:02:45.360> loose<00:02:46.349> broad<00:02:47.069> groups<00:02:47.879> of

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
strategies are loose broad groups of

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.280 
strategies are loose broad groups of
actions<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:50.430> like<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> route<00:02:51.000> map<00:02:51.290> would

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
actions and just like a route map would

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.569 
actions and just like a route map would
allow<00:02:53.129> us<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:54.239> plot<00:02:54.599> our<00:02:54.900> journey<00:02:55.579> one

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
allow us to plot our journey one

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.930 
allow us to plot our journey one
destination<00:02:57.569> or<00:02:58.019> sub<00:02:58.590> destination<00:02:59.370> at<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.579> time

destination or sub destination at a time

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.740 
destination or sub destination at a time
pretty<00:03:00.870> much<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.349> series<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.160> steps<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:03.420> would

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
pretty much a series of steps that would

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.800 
pretty much a series of steps that would
allow<00:03:04.170> us<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.890> bridge<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.459> gap<00:03:05.489> or<00:03:06.180> travel<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
allow us to bridge the gap or travel the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.289 
allow us to bridge the gap or travel the
road<00:03:07.019> between<00:03:07.470> where<00:03:07.769> we<00:03:07.799> are<00:03:08.040> now<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.549> where
