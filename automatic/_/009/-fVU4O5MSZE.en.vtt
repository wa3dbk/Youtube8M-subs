with the Phantom data from that we can

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.280 
with the Phantom data from that we can

sir it's professor clays fault
he<00:05:53.110> and<00:05:53.290> his<00:05:53.410> mechanical<00:05:54.040> Bakugan<00:05:54.670> are<00:05:54.880> the

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
he and his mechanical Bakugan are the

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.880 
he and his mechanical Bakugan are the
useless<00:05:55.480> ones<00:05:55.780> hey<00:05:58.290> someone<00:05:59.290> bring<00:05:59.530> em<00:05:59.710> to<00:05:59.860> me

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890
