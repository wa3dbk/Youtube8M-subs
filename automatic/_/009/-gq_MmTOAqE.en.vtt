for<00:02:00.929> the<00:02:00.990> trailer<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.890> switched<00:02:02.249> over<00:02:02.429> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
for the trailer they switched over to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.779 
for the trailer they switched over to
the<00:02:02.700> car<00:02:02.969> type<00:02:03.179> because<00:02:03.509> basically<00:02:03.749> a

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
the car type because basically a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.770 
the car type because basically a
styrofoam<00:02:05.789> is<00:02:06.179> not<00:02:06.390> good<00:02:06.539> for<00:02:06.569> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
styrofoam is not good for the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.389 
styrofoam is not good for the
environment<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.499> Japan<00:02:07.679> switched<00:02:08.099> over<00:02:08.280> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
environment so Japan switched over to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.150 
environment so Japan switched over to
these<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.629> car<00:02:09.989> which<00:02:10.470> i<00:02:10.590> think<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.009> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
these and car which i think is really a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.039 
these and car which i think is really a
good<00:02:11.310> alternative<00:02:11.519> you<00:02:12.060> compared<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.810> what<00:02:12.930> we

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
good alternative you compared to what we

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.630 
good alternative you compared to what we
do<00:02:13.200> now<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:13.410> we<00:02:13.709> use<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.129> cheap<00:02:14.400> plastic

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
do now is we use this cheap plastic

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.150 
do now is we use this cheap plastic
where<00:02:15.060> everything<00:02:15.110> gets<00:02:16.110> flattened<00:02:16.830> really

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
where everything gets flattened really

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.039 
where everything gets flattened really
quickly<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:17.910> not<00:02:18.090> really<00:02:18.299> durable<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
quickly and it's not really durable and

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.990 
quickly and it's not really durable and
it<00:02:19.140> bends<00:02:19.349> easily<00:02:19.590> well<00:02:20.099> egg<00:02:20.280> carton<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.730> good

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it bends easily well egg carton is good

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
use egg cartons as well so they could

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.130
