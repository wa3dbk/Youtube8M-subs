00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.159
 i 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.159
 ah 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.490
 this recipe we are going to use one leg 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.220
 small and good I use this one because 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.080
 we are few depending on your home that 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.260
 so many people are going to do is the 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.470
 size of the leg is from pork we go to 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.210
 use a ham package and what is 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.210
 a pack of bacon 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.570
 about two almond envelopes about 2 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.790
 garlic cloves and a whole onion 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.300
 let's also use prunes 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.700
 to honor chicken broth 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.530
 in a pot with water we are going to put 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.070
 boil the almonds this is so that it 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.710
 soften the shell let's start 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.460
 cut what is the bacon and that what 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.260
 we are going to cut well in small squares and 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.830
 Well, look for a knife 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.810
 sharp because this knife was not there 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.700
 cutting very well but well well let's 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.380
 do what is the whole package of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 bacon in squares 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.770
 after that also what we're going to 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.140
 do is the same with the ham we 're going 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.430
 to cut into what are small pictures 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.430
 the whole package 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.360
 once cut everything we will occupy what 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.600
 which is a refractory and we are going to put the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.600
 ham the bacon the prune 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.660
 already once we see that the almonds and 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.080
 yesterday they saw then let's rinse 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.330
 with cold water and what we are going to do is 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.479
 start peeling them to take away what is 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.900
 to cascarita and thus boiled is very much 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.270
 easier to take them off and we're going to 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.860
 wash very well later after 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.750
 we're going to add that to those who 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.940
 we already have in the refractory and what 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.420
 let's do is stir all this 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.190
 mix being ready for what it is 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.190
 add sela to the leg 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.670
 meanwhile we already wash the leg 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.739
 we remove that leather that it brings because 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.080
 mine brought as the little body that of the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.940
 leg then I take it off and what 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.489
 let's do is start opening holes 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.890
 with the knife and let's start 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.709
 fill it inside this mixture that 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.890
 we have alternating what is the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.840
 bacon ham the almonds and the plum 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.120
 go very carefully 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.459
 of not cutting us 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.920
 and well this is what we are going to do with 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.250
 all this side of the leg after 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.530
 finish filling this part the same 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.870
 let's do the let's turn around sorry 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.840
 and the same thing we're going to do on the other side 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.090
 let's try to highlight the very well 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.329
 of everything that we bite there in 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.849
 our other refractory and this takes a 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.650
 time so much patience and if the 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.890
 they want from one day to the next remember 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.769
 do it a day early and if you have spare what 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.890
 that is a little bit of the mixture of 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.959
 stuffing what you can do is put it on 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.120
 on or on the sides of the refractory 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.060
 where you're going to bake it, you're not going to 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.810
 put any type of oil of anything but 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.810
 Well, it's going to get 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.170
 perform the leg in the blender 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.770
 to put the garlic the onion two tablespoons 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.860
 of nor switzerland and we're going to put what is 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.530
 the equivalent of one liter of juice 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.530
 orange and what we are going to do 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.530
 liquefy it 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.270
 later we are going to add it to 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.970
 what is the leg rectify the very 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.250
 well the salt please the salt be the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.290
 they can put when they are liquefying or 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.410
 time to wash the leg can 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.410
 once again salt this mixture 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.870
 take what is a cup of sugar to 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.940
 that is a bit sweet but I do not know 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.790
 I wanted to put it, I assure you that with 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.590
 sugar gives a very delicious touch and 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.380
 well once ready what we are going to do 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.239
 is to put it in the fridge if they are going to leave it 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.700
 for the other day remember that 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.290
 they have to let it rest and if they are going to 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.270
 use that same day then remember 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.820
 do it early to absorb that 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.000
 orange juice on the leg 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.960
 we are going to cover it with aluminum foil and the 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.030
 let's put the oven at 380 degrees 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.510
 about an hour and a half once 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.340
 that we spend that hour and a half 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.350
 we prepare the aluminum foil and we are going to 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.290
 to turn what leg 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.960
 remember after this they have to 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.240
 be constantly bathing the leg 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.610
 with its own juice so it does not dry 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.100
 and the only thing we're going to expect is that 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.770
 brown another little bit more another hour and 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.330
 mean then in total they were 3 hours 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:07.480
 that my leg was and here it is ready 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.940
 I remember, it depends on the 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.250
 leg size is the knowledge to 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.200
 Sometimes it is worn if it is a large leg 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.960
 it takes up to 5 now the only thing that 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.050
 let's do now is to do them in 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.240
 slide and you can accompany her 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.270
 what you like is ideal for what 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.220
 which is our dinner on the 24th or 31st of 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.860
 December 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.860
 and I hope you liked my recipe 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.180
 once they cut it like this in slice what 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.120
 what they do is boil it on the plate 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.970
 they can put the juice on top of it 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.030
 juice of the orange that already has 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.710
 the leg forgiveness and can accompany it 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.950

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.020
