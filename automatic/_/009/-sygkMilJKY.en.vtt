00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.000 

the<00:00:06.689> first<00:00:06.930> step<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.439> converting<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.979> decimal

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
the first step in converting a decimal

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.110 
the first step in converting a decimal
to<00:00:08.639> an<00:00:08.760> improper

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.539 

mixed<00:00:11.360> number<00:00:11.750> so<00:00:12.590> we'll<00:00:12.710> convert<00:00:13.040> to<00:00:13.250> mixed

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
mixed number so we'll convert to mixed

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.990 
mixed number so we'll convert to mixed
number

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
number

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.080 
number
first<00:00:14.410> in<00:00:15.410> this<00:00:16.369> first<00:00:16.670> example<00:00:16.850> we<00:00:17.570> have<00:00:17.800> 7.6

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
first in this first example we have 7.6

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.340 
first in this first example we have 7.6
to<00:00:20.090> convert<00:00:20.390> this<00:00:20.510> to<00:00:20.570> a<00:00:20.750> mixed<00:00:20.930> number

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
to convert this to a mixed number

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.560 
to convert this to a mixed number
we'll<00:00:21.920> take<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.340> whole<00:00:22.520> part<00:00:22.820> or<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.240> part<00:00:23.270> to

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
we'll take the whole part or the part to

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.589 
we'll take the whole part or the part to
the<00:00:23.660> left<00:00:23.810> of<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.110> decimal<00:00:25.000> which<00:00:26.000> is<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:26.180> seven

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
the left of the decimal which is a seven

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.690 
the left of the decimal which is a seven
and<00:00:26.750> then<00:00:27.320> we'll<00:00:27.470> take<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.860> part<00:00:28.130> to<00:00:28.580> the

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
and then we'll take the part to the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.480 
and then we'll take the part to the
right<00:00:28.790> of<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.000> decimal<00:00:29.170> which<00:00:30.170> is<00:00:30.289> a<00:00:30.320> six<00:00:30.650> now

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
right of the decimal which is a six now

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.020 
right of the decimal which is a six now
we<00:00:32.330> can<00:00:32.480> put<00:00:32.629> the<00:00:32.750> six<00:00:33.050> over<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:34.250> power<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.760> 10

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
we can put the six over a power of 10

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.350 
we can put the six over a power of 10
and<00:00:36.220> there's<00:00:37.220> only<00:00:37.370> one<00:00:37.760> digit<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.269> right

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
and there's only one digit to the right

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.660 
and there's only one digit to the right
of<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.629> decimal<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.710> there's<00:00:39.949> only<00:00:40.070> one<00:00:40.190> zero

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
of the decimal so there's only one zero

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.590 
of the decimal so there's only one zero
so<00:00:41.480> we<00:00:41.600> have<00:00:41.629> seven<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:42.260> six<00:00:42.949> over<00:00:43.250> ten<00:00:43.540> now<00:00:44.540> we

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
so we have seven and six over ten now we

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.540 
so we have seven and six over ten now we
can<00:00:44.809> reduce<00:00:45.080> this<00:00:45.290> fraction<00:00:45.350> by<00:00:45.949> dividing<00:00:45.980> top

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
can reduce this fraction by dividing top

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.420 
can reduce this fraction by dividing top
and<00:00:46.610> bottom<00:00:46.969> by<00:00:47.090> two<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:48.260> we<00:00:48.440> have<00:00:48.469> three<00:00:49.219> on

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
and bottom by two so we have three on

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.630 
and bottom by two so we have three on
top<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.809> five<00:00:51.050> on<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.320> bottom<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.250> this<00:00:52.430> is

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
top and a five on the bottom so this is

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.220 
top and a five on the bottom so this is
equivalent<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.149> seven<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.219> three-fifths<00:00:56.230> now

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
equivalent to seven and three-fifths now

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.440 
equivalent to seven and three-fifths now
to<00:00:57.320> convert<00:00:57.590> this<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.860> an<00:00:57.980> improper<00:00:58.040> fraction

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
to convert this to an improper fraction

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.970 
to convert this to an improper fraction
we'll<00:00:59.450> multiply<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.050> denominator<00:01:00.710> by<00:01:00.800> the

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
we'll multiply the denominator by the

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.920 
we'll multiply the denominator by the
whole<00:01:01.250> number<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:01.789> then<00:01:02.270> add<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.570> numerator

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
whole number and then add the numerator

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.440 
whole number and then add the numerator
5<00:01:03.739> times<00:01:04.039> 7<00:01:04.399> is<00:01:04.489> 35<00:01:04.630> Plus<00:01:05.630> 3<00:01:05.930> is<00:01:06.170> 38<00:01:07.149> so<00:01:08.149> we<00:01:08.270> have

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
5 times 7 is 35 Plus 3 is 38 so we have

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.109 
5 times 7 is 35 Plus 3 is 38 so we have
38<00:01:09.100> over<00:01:10.100> 5<00:01:10.509> in<00:01:11.509> this<00:01:12.410> next<00:01:12.619> example<00:01:13.119> we're

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
38 over 5 in this next example we're

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.340 
38 over 5 in this next example we're
going<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.360> once<00:01:14.539> again<00:01:14.630> take<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.200> whole

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
going to once again take the whole

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.670 
going to once again take the whole
number<00:01:15.649> part<00:01:15.890> just<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.430> 5<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.030> then<00:01:17.470> we<00:01:18.470> will

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
number part just a 5 and then we will

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.880 
number part just a 5 and then we will
put<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.340> part<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.850> right<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.180> decimal

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
put the part to the right of the decimal

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.920 
put the part to the right of the decimal
over<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.920> power<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.430> 10<00:01:22.670> two<00:01:23.390> places<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:23.900> the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
over a power of 10 two places to the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.580 
over a power of 10 two places to the
right<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.290> decimal<00:01:24.400> so<00:01:25.400> 2<00:01:25.820> zeroes<00:01:26.290> 35<00:01:27.290> over

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
right of the decimal so 2 zeroes 35 over

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.640 
right of the decimal so 2 zeroes 35 over
100<00:01:28.090> we<00:01:29.090> can<00:01:29.240> reduce<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:29.780> by<00:01:30.020> dividing<00:01:30.290> top

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
100 we can reduce this by dividing top

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.289 
100 we can reduce this by dividing top
and<00:01:30.710> bottom<00:01:31.100> by<00:01:31.250> 5<00:01:31.900> 35<00:01:32.900> over<00:01:33.200> 5<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:33.710> 7<00:01:34.100> 100<00:01:35.090> over

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
and bottom by 5 35 over 5 is 7 100 over

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.510 
and bottom by 5 35 over 5 is 7 100 over
5<00:01:35.540> is<00:01:36.140> 20<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.430> this<00:01:37.610> is<00:01:37.790> equivalent<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.299> 5<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:40.100> 7

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
5 is 20 so this is equivalent to 5 and 7

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.289 
5 is 20 so this is equivalent to 5 and 7
over<00:01:40.640> 20<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:43.009> convert<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.670> an<00:01:43.880> improper

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
over 20 to convert to an improper

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.469 
over 20 to convert to an improper
fraction<00:01:44.329> now<00:01:44.960> we'll<00:01:45.860> multiply<00:01:46.009> 20<00:01:46.850> times<00:01:47.119> 5

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
fraction now we'll multiply 20 times 5

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.940 
fraction now we'll multiply 20 times 5
which<00:01:48.110> is<00:01:48.140> 100<00:01:48.680> plus<00:01:49.280> 7<00:01:49.790> which<00:01:50.150> is<00:01:50.210> 107<00:01:51.079> so<00:01:51.829> we

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
which is 100 plus 7 which is 107 so we

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.380 
which is 100 plus 7 which is 107 so we
have<00:01:52.070> 107<00:01:52.880> over<00:01:53.689> 20<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.579> final<00:01:55.909> example

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
have 107 over 20 in the final example

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.330 
have 107 over 20 in the final example
well<00:01:56.930> once<00:01:57.140> again<00:01:57.320> take<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.860> whole<00:01:58.040> number

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
well once again take the whole number

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.840 
well once again take the whole number
part<00:01:58.579> 3<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.920> then<00:02:00.920> take<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.490> part<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.820> the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
part 3 and then take the part to the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.840 
part 3 and then take the part to the
right<00:02:02.030> of<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.240> decimal<00:02:04.240> 375<00:02:05.320> over<00:02:06.430> 3<00:02:07.430> decimal

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
right of the decimal 375 over 3 decimal

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.400 
right of the decimal 375 over 3 decimal
places<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.570> 3<00:02:09.530> zeroes<00:02:10.930> 375<00:02:11.930> over<00:02:12.320> 1000<00:02:13.630> now<00:02:14.630> we

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
places so 3 zeroes 375 over 1000 now we

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.780 
places so 3 zeroes 375 over 1000 now we
can<00:02:15.620> divide<00:02:15.739> top<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.310> bottom<00:02:16.760> here<00:02:17.000> by<00:02:17.530> 125

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
can divide top and bottom here by 125

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.280 
can divide top and bottom here by 125
which<00:02:19.790> leaves<00:02:20.090> us<00:02:20.239> with<00:02:20.410> 3<00:02:21.879> over<00:02:22.879> 8<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.390> this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
which leaves us with 3 over 8 so this

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.830 
which leaves us with 3 over 8 so this
number<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.680> equivalent<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.370> 3<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.030> 3/8

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
number is equivalent to 3 and 3/8

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.880 
number is equivalent to 3 and 3/8
now<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.900> convert<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.440> an<00:02:29.500> improper<00:02:29.800> fraction

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
now to convert to an improper fraction

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.300 
now to convert to an improper fraction
well<00:02:30.520> once<00:02:30.700> again<00:02:30.850> multiply<00:02:31.540> 8<00:02:32.230> times<00:02:32.290> 3<00:02:33.070> which

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
well once again multiply 8 times 3 which

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.420 
well once again multiply 8 times 3 which
is<00:02:33.400> 24<00:02:33.940> plus<00:02:34.720> 3<00:02:35.170> which<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:35.950> 27<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.480> we<00:02:37.630> have<00:02:37.750> 27

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
is 24 plus 3 which is 27 so we have 27

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:48.680 
is 24 plus 3 which is 27 so we have 27
over<00:02:39.430> 8

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.750
