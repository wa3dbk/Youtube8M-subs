 make the notebook on the agenda even more beautiful 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.320
 but also really make a lot possible 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.470

 and quoting the ban 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.970
 I'm going to get started right away from there I have the very nice to if you 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.150
 to counteract all sorts of creative sector pastels 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.600
 do not comment further on 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.940

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.840
 that alonso and how it really helps 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.790
 start next week 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.610
 we take the tape from a tablet 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.900
 first we had an extra adult 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.340
 very tough in the north 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.770
 you know it 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.750
 and then start with the dogs 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.750
 if we are aiming for a certain moment or if being 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.050
 the palestines are grown crops 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.400
 shoulder 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.730
 the debt would be reduced from the honor 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.990
 really where they are going to work to help find a job 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.020
 and I think this is sensible today and also of that 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.490
 it is both parties 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.980
 further 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.100
 fully placed 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.810
 and hard has expanded today I am going for the star just like and also 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.520
 and I have internet on TV and live says Boonen 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.710
 received the first card 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.900
 in addition, the church is needed and that is also the hearing the scissors 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.900
 we are still busy 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.380
 such 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.850
 i'm busy i'm going to use put on the map 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.809
 so in the rainy days it is the biggest booth ever i would recommend eating 

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:09.369
 the inside 9 you can get that is also tricky so start there I have it 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.369
 is sticking the ep on the tail 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.299
 the swedish peak 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.269
 Moerdijk the WWF and that with great energy now stuck on the snow 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.149
 falls for the latter it is not easy to leave on all fronts 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.099
 but there are also easy 8 points 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.049
 what a bunch of whole patients 4 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.689
 of the single top 100 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.359
 here you will find them non-smokers 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.039
 k 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.909
 dr 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.009
 real soon is going fast why is that you are strong drivers 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:52.159
 it is 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.939
 but despite their sticking 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:54.859
 somewhere 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.859
 it is no longer there 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.979
 so 3 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.409
 has nothing to do with him 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.889
 I have had the past 12 March before putting it aside 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.289
 this market 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.659
 and then the minister goes 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.959
 7 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.969
 graphics a clear this should be able to indicate responsible 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:19.769
 beautiful 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.590
 and then it goes wrong I do not understand that they will allow more 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.330
 city ​​that could cool it down a bit 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.849
 the right front number remains 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.249
 several reporters 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:33.819
 the fighters do something with much love anp 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.709
