00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.860 
far as as far as if you if you are put
together<00:07:33.889> multiple<00:07:34.580> clips<00:07:34.880> there's<00:07:35.810> a

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870 
together multiple clips there's a

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.089 
together multiple clips there's a
there's<00:07:36.800> a<00:07:36.860> lag<00:07:37.270> well<00:07:38.270> after<00:07:38.419> it<00:07:38.690> compiles<00:07:39.289> it

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:40.099 
there's a lag well after it compiles it

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:42.100 
there's a lag well after it compiles it
there's<00:07:40.430> a<00:07:40.490> there's<00:07:40.789> a<00:07:40.880> there's<00:07:41.120> a<00:07:41.389> there's<00:07:41.780> a

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 
there's a there's a there's a there's a

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.330 
there's a there's a there's a there's a
lag<00:07:42.349> between<00:07:42.620> the<00:07:42.919> sound<00:07:43.159> in<00:07:43.340> the<00:07:43.460> video<00:07:43.789> and

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.340 
lag between the sound in the video and

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.340 
lag between the sound in the video and
and<00:07:45.820> I<00:07:45.940> think<00:07:46.150> once<00:07:46.360> you<00:07:46.570> upload<00:07:46.900> it<00:07:47.020> to

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.350 
and I think once you upload it to

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.150 
and I think once you upload it to
youtube<00:07:47.980> it<00:07:48.360> compiles<00:07:49.360> to<00:07:49.480> flash<00:07:49.780> and<00:07:50.230> then<00:07:50.919> it

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:51.160 
youtube it compiles to flash and then it

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.050 
youtube it compiles to flash and then it
really<00:07:51.400> becomes<00:07:51.610> a<00:07:52.000> lag<00:07:53.669> so<00:07:54.669> maybe<00:07:54.880> I<00:07:54.970> should

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.060 
really becomes a lag so maybe I should

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.760 
really becomes a lag so maybe I should
compile<00:07:55.570> it<00:07:55.750> to<00:07:55.870> flash<00:07:56.110> video<00:07:56.560> and<00:07:56.710> then

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:56.770 
compile it to flash video and then

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.360 
compile it to flash video and then
upload<00:07:57.190> it<00:07:57.220> to<00:07:57.490> YouTube<00:07:58.210> I<00:07:58.500> don't<00:07:59.500> know<00:07:59.590> we'll

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.370 
upload it to YouTube I don't know we'll

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.640 
upload it to YouTube I don't know we'll
see

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:04.650 

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.710
