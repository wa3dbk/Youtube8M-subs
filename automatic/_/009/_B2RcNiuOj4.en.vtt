00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.510
 independent states whose centers were 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.969
 only corinto esparta every city ​​had

 the commander of the west ipi forces 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.820
 informed that the ideal place for the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.329
 will have the vast beach of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.329
 marathon 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.450
 while gates landed his men 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.140
 the Greek army will meet in 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.329
 Marathon mountains near the beach 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.450
 the Athenian army was composed of 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.000
 several local tribes were one thousand men of 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.610
 11 different tribes each with their own 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 themselves, all of them commanded by a 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.500
 general and the teams 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.470
 the Greek army used men of 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.380
 infantry the so-called 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.900
 cause of its shell called the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.660
 athletes were fighting information from speakers 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.460
 an almost impregnable wall of men 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:57.040
 and shields and advancing continuously in 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.590
 mountains in the distance marathon and I 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.690
 had said and his ten generals had a 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.950
 clear vision of the organization of the army 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.860
 Persian 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.479
 was an army twice as large as the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:14.290
 Greek with archers from Ethiopia 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.480
 indian knights swords 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.910
 steppes of Asia although they are all 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.730
 subjects of the Darius king of Persia 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.680
 they had nothing in common 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.680
 not even a language 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.210
 on the other hand the Greeks were neighbors and 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.280
 would fight shoulder to shoulder to save their 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.280
 independence and their lifestyle 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.840
 tates not attacked because they expected the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.060
 Athenians still faithful to epix if 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.330
 get up and take control of 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.400
 only on the Greek side and the day says no 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.890
 attacked because he hoped to receive 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.390
 of the promised contingent of Sparta 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.390
 neither side moved 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.060
 while the only army was 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.790
 marathon run along the coast 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:20.090
 land his troops and attack the 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:22.459
 unprotected only his faithful general 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:31.160
 atta fairness would stay in marathon with 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:35.090
 a force of 12,000 miltiadis men 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.220
 realized that he should act quickly 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.890
 tates would take more than three hours to 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.830
 save for Athens and so many hours 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.080
 to land his miltiadis army 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.209
 had to win fast in marathon 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.850
 and run for just to face 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:57.290
 touches miltiadis prepared his 11 thousand 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.450
 applied for the fight would be formed a 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.090
 phalanx but was worried 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.700
 for the fulfillment of the enemy line 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.850
 the Persians could move along the sides and 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.480
 surrounding the Greeks we know of these details 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.810
 by two Greek historians, Herodotus and 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.570
 wrote while the Greek army 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.239
 that the day dispensed in the next 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:25.810
 problem the massive ranks of Achilles 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.810
 Deadly Persians up to almost 300 meters 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.280
 the Greeks should run this distance 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.280
 final or would be a sacred 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.830
 reached this distance began to 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.620
 hail of wounds when the troops 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.470
 miltiadis the Persians set out to run 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:52.440
 were astonished whatever nature one 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:54.450
 phalanx slowly advanced the objects 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.250
 They trained hard for this. 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.320
 there was even an event in the games 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.780
 Olympic and consisted of a race 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.030
 400 meters with the uniform pitta 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.280
 Complete the Persians were perplexed and 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.710
 positions could see the center of the 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.020
 Greek line running over them 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.590
 I just hoped they'd get breathless. 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.590
 for the fight 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.090
 the Persians was not a heavy infantry 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.760
 with light weapons short spears and 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.840
 scimitar he lined up to repeat 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.840
 the spears of the Greeks 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.850
 the two armies meet the verses 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.490
 saw that their weapons were inferior to 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.710
 but fought bravely and as 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.530
 were more numerous began to make the 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.680
 Greeks withdrew the practice of a thousand days 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:49.600
 seemed to have failed and meanwhile kate 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.880
 was approaching athens when seeing the center 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.160
 of the Greek line retreat the commander thinks 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.160
 his leg and felt the victory 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.900
 the sides of the Greek phalanx began to 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.890
 push the sides of the line 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.290
 the center 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.150
 each tip was moving at the same time 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.570
 by turning to the left or to the 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.940
 right cycling 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.050
 the end of the tactics that gave Miuccia 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.780
 result 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.840
 center of the line has dropped and it comes to the 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.030
 was surrounded by the enemy. 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.040
 was a carnage because the efficient 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.110
 Greek armaments struck over the 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.870
 enemy 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.169
 the Persians continued to throw themselves on 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.889
 the enemy speaker 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:38.569
 desperately looking for broken 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.059
 Meanwhile the various willow 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:43.939
 rained thousands of flashes over 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:46.400
 the Greeks now so close together of the Persians and 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:49.059
 friends were at risk of killing their 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.059
 own soldiers 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:07:02.009
 the Greeks realized this and fought as 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:07:04.800
 the Persians who were 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:07.499
 They had never been beaten Losers 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.830
 the Greeks but now thousands of their 

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:12.830
 soldiers were dead or dying 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:18.869
 Suddenly the Persians dispersed and 

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:21.199
 rushed to their ships to escape 

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:21.199
 of death 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:31.270
 the Greeks tried to prevent their escape and the 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:33.880
 They chased art but there was no time 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.620
 to rest while the battle 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.020
 happened in marathon 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:42.160
 tates and their troops who were close to 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:44.620
 athens miltiadis ordered his troops 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.680
 march for only one march 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.910
 35 kilometers forced in uniform 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.040
 complete 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.590
 it took him three hours to defeat the 

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.470
 Persian in marathon but that left 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:08:00.240
 dates three hours closer to athens 

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.240
 it was a race against time 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.430
 he did not think these 

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.010
 troops had been defeated in 

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:12.660
 marathon but they were here to 

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.660
 fight again in time
