the<00:00:58.320> airport<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> biggest<00:01:00.420> benefits

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the airport one of the biggest benefits

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.959 
the airport one of the biggest benefits
that<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.379> found<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.280> helps<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that we found is that it helps in the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.850 
that we found is that it helps in the
prevention<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.539> runway<00:01:03.840> incursion<00:01:04.350> because

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
prevention of runway incursion because

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.670 
prevention of runway incursion because
we<00:01:05.010> no<00:01:05.159> longer<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> call<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.960> entry

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
we no longer have to call up for entry

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.770 
we no longer have to call up for entry
to<00:01:07.860> alive<00:01:08.130> runway<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.450> know

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
to alive runway to you know

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719 
to alive runway to you know
dispersed<00:01:10.350> birds<00:01:10.590> because<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.520> actually

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
dispersed birds because we can actually

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
dispersed birds because we can actually
do<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.750> side<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.560> runway<00:01:15.470> we

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
do it on the side of the runway we

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
do it on the side of the runway we
originally<00:01:16.890> had<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.490> laser<00:01:17.759> which<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.119> bought

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
originally had a laser which we bought

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.670 
originally had a laser which we bought
about<00:01:18.390> two<00:01:18.600> years<00:01:18.810> ago<00:01:18.990> which<00:01:19.229> was<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
about two years ago which was at the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.810 
about two years ago which was at the
time<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.250> know<00:01:20.340> sort<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> newest

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
time you know sort of the newest

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.149 
time you know sort of the newest
technology<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.540> good<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.799> took

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
technology really good we then took

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.100 
technology really good we then took
delivery<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> aero<00:01:23.909> laser<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:24.780> has<00:01:24.960> got

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
delivery of the aero laser which has got

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.960 
delivery of the aero laser which has got
not<00:01:25.380> some<00:01:25.710> added<00:01:25.950> safety<00:01:26.340> features<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
not some added safety features into it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.219 
not some added safety features into it
which<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.180> proven<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:28.110> really

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
which have proven to be really really

bit inclement and it's sort of low
visibility<00:01:51.290> that<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.530> great<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.250> with

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
visibility that was great but now with

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.190 
visibility that was great but now with
this<00:01:53.549> new<00:01:53.610> equipment<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.240> new<00:01:54.450> era<00:01:54.780> laser<00:01:55.049> we

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
this new equipment this new era laser we

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
this new equipment this new era laser we
can<00:01:55.320> actually<00:01:55.439> use<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.890> during<00:01:56.070> quite<00:01:56.460> bright

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
can actually use it during quite bright

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.280 
can actually use it during quite bright
days<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.180> well<00:01:57.299> which<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.540> an<00:01:57.750> excellent

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
days as well which is an excellent

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
days as well which is an excellent
safety<00:01:58.560> benefit<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.159> us<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.909> manage<00:02:00.390> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
safety benefit for us if we manage to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.240 
safety benefit for us if we manage to
get<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.930> under<00:02:01.170> two<00:02:01.290> kilometers<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.159> the

get just under two kilometers out of the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.760 
get just under two kilometers out of the
laser<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.969> terms<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.329> range<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.530> us<00:02:04.619> at

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
laser in terms of range so for us at

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.109 
laser in terms of range so for us at
this<00:02:04.890> airfield<00:02:05.219> we've<00:02:05.520> got<00:02:05.670> about<00:02:05.909> two

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
this airfield we've got about two

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.580 
this airfield we've got about two
kilometres<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:06.930> us<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> perfect

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
kilometres so for us it's a perfect

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.720 
kilometres so for us it's a perfect
piece<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> equipment

the scope on the device we use to to
good<00:02:14.069> effect<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:15.180> pretty<00:02:15.540> much<00:02:15.689> like<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
good effect it's pretty much like a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.270 
good effect it's pretty much like a
normal<00:02:15.989> scope<00:02:16.560> where<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.769> have<00:02:16.859> a<00:02:16.890> red<00:02:17.069> dot

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280

actually<00:02:21.390> activate<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:22.019> again<00:02:22.590> an<00:02:22.950> excellent

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
actually activate it again an excellent

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.920 
actually activate it again an excellent
safety<00:02:23.549> feature<00:02:23.849> because<00:02:24.180> previously<00:02:24.689> what

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
safety feature because previously what

bird but actually with the with a scope

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.610 
bird but actually with the with a scope
you<00:02:29.579> can<00:02:29.609> very<00:02:30.120> clearly<00:02:30.450> predict<00:02:31.319> where<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
you can very clearly predict where that

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.839 
you can very clearly predict where that
lasers<00:02:31.859> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.069> shine<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.430> avoid<00:02:32.609> any

lasers going to shine and avoid any
unwanted<00:02:33.799> laser<00:02:34.819> being<00:02:35.819> shown<00:02:36.030> anywhere<00:02:36.329> you

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
unwanted laser being shown anywhere you

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.879 
unwanted laser being shown anywhere you
can<00:02:36.480> want<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:39.420> horizon<00:02:39.540> safety<00:02:40.530> system

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
can want it to the horizon safety system

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.399 
can want it to the horizon safety system
is<00:02:41.040> now<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> very<00:02:41.730> good<00:02:42.000> feature<00:02:42.269> because<00:02:42.450> if<00:02:43.260> I

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
is now a very good feature because if I

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.069 
is now a very good feature because if I
was<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.590> stumble<00:02:44.069> or<00:02:44.189> fall<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:45.209> would<00:02:45.359> actually

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
was to stumble or fall it would actually

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.080 
was to stumble or fall it would actually
prevent<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.650> laser<00:02:46.889> from<00:02:47.159> being<00:02:47.400> shone<00:02:47.669> into

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
prevent the laser from being shone into

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.929 
prevent the laser from being shone into
an<00:02:48.180> aircraft<00:02:48.569> or<00:02:48.720> into<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.079> building<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.760> one<00:02:50.909> of

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
an aircraft or into a building so one of

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.580 
an aircraft or into a building so one of
the<00:02:51.060> features<00:02:51.359> I<00:02:51.480> really<00:02:51.900> really<00:02:52.200> like<00:02:52.349> for

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the features I really really like for

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.020 
the features I really really like for
this<00:02:52.739> product<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.310> horizon<00:02:53.519> safety

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
this product is the horizon safety

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.089 
this product is the horizon safety
system<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:55.169> what<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.409> does<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.799> actually

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
system and what it does is it actually

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.339 
system and what it does is it actually
prevents<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.730> laser<00:02:57.090> being<00:02:57.389> shown<00:02:57.659> a<00:02:57.930> certain

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
prevents the laser being shown a certain

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.869 
prevents the laser being shown a certain
degree<00:02:58.590> angle<00:02:59.099> so<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.459> set<00:02:59.669> the<00:02:59.849> the

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
degree angle so you can set the the

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.819 
degree angle so you can set the the
angle<00:03:00.359> of<00:03:00.419> which<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.689> want<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.959> laser<00:03:01.620> to

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
angle of which you want the laser to

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.740 
angle of which you want the laser to
automatically<00:03:02.370> switch<00:03:02.579> off<00:03:02.879> for<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.540> team

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
automatically switch off for the team

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.960 
automatically switch off for the team
out<00:03:04.049> performing<00:03:04.739> birth<00:03:04.859> control<00:03:05.220> it's<00:03:05.430> really

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
out performing birth control it's really

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.729 
out performing birth control it's really
really<00:03:06.180> good<00:03:06.299> safety<00:03:06.569> feature<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:07.200> means<00:03:07.470> that

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
really good safety feature it means that

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.890 
really good safety feature it means that
you<00:03:08.010> can<00:03:08.159> avoid<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.790> laser<00:03:09.120> being<00:03:09.599> shauna

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
you can avoid the laser being shauna

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.349 
you can avoid the laser being shauna
aircraft<00:03:10.409> and<00:03:10.650> also<00:03:11.459> building<00:03:11.909> such<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
aircraft and also building such the

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.509 
aircraft and also building such the
terminal<00:03:12.840> or<00:03:12.959> more<00:03:13.650> importantly<00:03:14.069> for<00:03:14.220> us<00:03:14.310> that

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
terminal or more importantly for us that

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.939 
terminal or more importantly for us that
the<00:03:14.780> control<00:03:15.780> tower<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.229> a<00:03:16.530> safety<00:03:16.829> feature

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
the control tower and a safety feature

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.710 
the control tower and a safety feature
completely<00:03:17.579> takes<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.389> possibility

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
completely takes that that possibility

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.809 
completely takes that that possibility
away<00:03:19.109> so<00:03:19.169> it's<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> great<00:03:19.739> benefit<00:03:20.129> we<00:03:20.669> have<00:03:20.790> a

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
away so it's a great benefit we have a

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.339 
away so it's a great benefit we have a
few<00:03:21.030> costs<00:03:21.389> that<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.690> bird<00:03:21.840> control<00:03:22.079> unit

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
few costs that the bird control unit

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.979 
few costs that the bird control unit
have<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.709> sustain<00:03:23.370> things<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:24.150> flares<00:03:24.629> so

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
have to sustain things like flares so

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.479 
have to sustain things like flares so
when<00:03:25.139> we<00:03:25.199> use<00:03:25.229> our<00:03:25.530> very<00:03:25.769> pistols<00:03:26.159> to<00:03:26.310> shoot

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
when we use our very pistols to shoot

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.949 
when we use our very pistols to shoot
flares<00:03:26.699> into<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:27.030> sky<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.780> see<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
flares into the sky and see the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.899 
flares into the sky and see the
cartridges<00:03:28.409> cost<00:03:28.650> money<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.639> one<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.849> the

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
cartridges cost money and one of the

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.819 
cartridges cost money and one of the
benefits<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.389> using<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.750> laser<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
benefits of using a laser is that

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.289 
benefits of using a laser is that
actually<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.280> can<00:03:32.430> reduce<00:03:32.729> the<00:03:32.940> amount<00:03:33.180> of

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
actually you can reduce the amount of

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.969 
actually you can reduce the amount of
money<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.139> need<00:03:34.169> to<00:03:34.349> spend<00:03:34.500> on<00:03:34.650> flares

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
money that you need to spend on flares

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.250 
money that you need to spend on flares
because<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.699> laser<00:03:35.849> acts<00:03:36.389> as<00:03:36.659> a<00:03:36.989> great

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
because the laser acts as a great

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.009 
because the laser acts as a great
substitute<00:03:37.919> for<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.639> for<00:03:39.269> those<00:03:39.359> flares<00:03:39.690> if

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
substitute for the for those flares if

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.500 
substitute for the for those flares if
I'm<00:03:40.739> honest<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.639> error<00:03:41.909> laser<00:03:42.120> handheld

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
I'm honest the the error laser handheld

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.479 
I'm honest the the error laser handheld
that<00:03:42.599> we<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.870> today<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.470> pretty<00:03:44.220> much

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
that we have today is pretty much

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.180 
that we have today is pretty much
spot-on<00:03:45.299> what<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.599> need<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.739> effect<00:03:47.010> birth

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
spot-on what I need so effect birth
