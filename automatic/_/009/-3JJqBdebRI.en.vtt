one<00:02:36.790> because<00:02:36.970> that's<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.240> won't<00:02:37.510> work<00:02:37.630> it's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
one because that's just won't work it's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.840 
one because that's just won't work it's
impossible<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.770> if<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.370> possible<00:02:39.520> then<00:02:39.790> I

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
impossible and if it is possible then I

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.310 
impossible and if it is possible then I
haven't<00:02:40.060> done<00:02:40.120> I've<00:02:40.270> seen<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.630> haven't<00:02:41.140> seen

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
haven't done I've seen I haven't seen

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.840 
haven't done I've seen I haven't seen
anyone<00:02:41.590> do<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:41.770> either<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.430> my<00:02:42.640> god<00:02:42.790> I'm

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
anyone do it either so my god I'm

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.670 
anyone do it either so my god I'm
guessing<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.270> impossible<00:02:43.930> but<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:44.620> you

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
guessing it's impossible but if you

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.380 
guessing it's impossible but if you
can't<00:02:44.860> do<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.100> then<00:02:45.250> make<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> video<00:02:46.210> about<00:02:46.270> it

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
can't do it then make a video about it

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.760 
can't do it then make a video about it
and<00:02:46.630> show<00:02:46.750> me<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.020> then<00:02:47.110> I'll<00:02:47.200> tell<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.560> out
