00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.020
 with me right titan who just 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.030
 played 1 match to your group say at all 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.719
 How many days have you come? 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.109
 was prepared and then came the match 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.199
 where for how many days in Kiev hello 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:22.050
 where came here coming back came 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.320
 got used to the local conditions completely 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.310
 used to being well prepared for the complex 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.109
 do after losing the game about the game 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.300
 let's take a little more detail when you're long 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.790
 before I started to play with him you were 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.110
 I am sure that you will win as you 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 In general , I have the most cruel group 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.190
 sort of like well i just don't think in 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.800
 confidence but just sure about your game 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.170
 if everything did okay how would i 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.239
 I think I will pass 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.550
 Now come on every game that won 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.640
 Here you have played 3 games straight since 1 2 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.010
 3 first game he went to the gift of jersey loved 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.660
 stratum seems to me but it's easy for me 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.879
 counter it turned out i went blink 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.340
 bus server then there 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.629
 he retreated I put the base he did 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.700
 let feet iPhones 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.140
 but she oils a bunch of stalkers chich 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.330
 idiots and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:18.270
 and somehow the second game was easily beat off 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:19.920
 shaku time i went 12 gate well wanted with 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.330
 the first three stalkers under the harasit 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.670
 his principle got killed him 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.880
 robotics but in return lost its nukers 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.040
 exchanging for a stalker robe and a couple of workers 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.369
 this is what the workers did not mine by dunked 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.530
 base I went blink observer and so I started 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.360
 tumble over his base for ducked 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.829
 kill worker retreat set himself 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 the base 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.030
 well, everything goes well, that's all 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.280
 well going but somehow I started on 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.439
 climb to burst merge eventually merged 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.720
 how how like a bum ivy 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.420
 he was punished for it and why are you 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.020
 tryaseshsya now you're something you're sick does not 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.700
 so thought better so in general 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.700
 last game I'll tell lies 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.250
 by the way here the news heard the shooter 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.680
 the shooter won at him and collected at him 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.180
 backpack said he was offended could him 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.490
 can not play the arrow and was going to 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.920
 gone yet it is unknown whether he 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.170
 continue to participate in all because 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.970
 because but still a high tournament 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.820
 level, perhaps he organizer there 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.770
 most importantly they say that there buddy need 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.480
 play it out otherwise we won't be with you 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.790
 invite you to such tournaments do not know you 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.240
 by we don't even patreon january he got 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.510
 did not pass the selection as far as I know here 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.310
 but if he does not return his result with 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.270
 shooter to 0 from respectively in the group 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.240
 will you stay 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.790
 roi shooter and for what you get out 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.740
 in an amicable way you need to kill the arrow and on 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.290
 already there it will be possible either replay 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.640
 if you kill it trick 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.860
 No, on the contrary, if the shooter kills white 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.140
 ruin and so forth first let's 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.450
 the third game to you 3 and then 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.090
 further about the events in the group in the third 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.090
 I play three whales taldarims 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:09.080
 and I usually tale always touched 4dita 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:11.330
 does decided to deceive and there in I went out 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.880
 see how are you 8 my base is two 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.950
 stalker got in a panic ran home and 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.100
 In general, the whole game went awry field 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.959
 crookedly threw and as a result 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.959
 well deserved + 1 played well 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.860
 clear further game to the arrow ready 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.000
 everyone knows that the shooter is 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.960
 an adversary who might not be very good 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.180
 reacts to some spontaneous 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.590
 actions well that is and thats what 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.750
 come up on the go but he's very good 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.970
 it is preparing for the opponent you with him 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.340
 was on bootcamp you started with him like this 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.020
 that he could prepare well that is 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.670
 just under you find some holes in 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.040
 your game and so forth you are what you 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.110
 you think I think absolutely right he 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.350
 very well prepared and can be 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.390
 cleaning because invented and therefore necessary as 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.340
 would not for a second relax from 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.910
 possible actions and to everything to be 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.490
 ready and quick to respond okay 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.659
 then we probably wish good luck 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.659
 [applause] 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.990
 no places if a graduate student asks if 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.680
 type you three stay and will 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.770
 replay 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.170
 isn't he afraid if they will try 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.410
 don't let go of the russian and go out there together 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.180
 well I think how would they just 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.820
 lose some of them i 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.370
 we have a strong guy to okay wish 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:38.110
 those probably luck hand to be seen in 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.110
 cams disss friend let's get stuck
