00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and then intet on the other side and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.149 
and then intet on the other side and
then<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.740> decklist<00:01:39.590> alright<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.890> let's<00:01:41.040> go

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
then the decklist alright so let's go

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.749 
then the decklist alright so let's go
and<00:01:41.310> open<00:01:41.369> up<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> actual<00:01:41.970> deck<00:01:42.509> itself<00:01:42.840> now

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.880 

so<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.930> main<00:01:49.140> general<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> think<00:01:49.560> he's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
so we have the main general I think he's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.370 
so we have the main general I think he's
the<00:01:50.130> main<00:01:50.280> general<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> deck<00:01:51.290> recruit<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the main general of the deck recruit the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.399 
the main general of the deck recruit the
two<00:01:52.530> reflections<00:01:53.750> he's<00:01:54.750> definitely<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.259> good

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
two reflections he's definitely be good

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410 
two reflections he's definitely be good
if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.920> multiple<00:01:56.610> blue<00:01:56.850> sources<00:01:57.270> out

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
if you can get multiple blue sources out

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.679 
if you can get multiple blue sources out
I<00:01:57.750> also<00:01:58.530> would<00:01:59.009> maybe<00:01:59.189> think<00:01:59.310> about<00:01:59.729> running<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
I also would maybe think about running a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.380 
I also would maybe think about running a
double<00:02:01.560> mana<00:02:01.939> source<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.920> cage<00:02:04.920> son<00:02:05.219> or<00:02:06.060> mana

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
double mana source like cage son or mana

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.609 
double mana source like cage son or mana
reflection<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.350> get<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
reflection just so you can get the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.499 
reflection just so you can get the
double<00:02:07.829> blue<00:02:07.979> because<00:02:08.280> he's<00:02:08.940> definitely<00:02:09.360> be

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
double blue because he's definitely be

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.030 
double blue because he's definitely be
heavy<00:02:09.720> blue<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.039> copy<00:02:11.610> effect<00:02:12.060> so

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
heavy blue with the copy effect so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.520 
heavy blue with the copy effect so
