here<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> new<00:00:16.650> loop<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.119> fusion

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
here is the new loop it's fusion

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.700 
here is the new loop it's fusion
torpedoes<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:18.990> we're<00:00:19.170> gonna<00:00:19.260> put<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.560> for

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
torpedoes here we're gonna put it for

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.800 
torpedoes here we're gonna put it for
the<00:00:19.770> Li<00:00:19.920> Niang<00:00:20.330> into<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> game<00:00:21.630> okay<00:00:23.720> that<00:00:24.720> was

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the Li Niang into the game okay that was

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.479 
the Li Niang into the game okay that was
up<00:00:26.630> logo<00:00:28.429> so<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.699> they<00:00:29.789> look<00:00:29.939> like

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
up logo so this is what they look like

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.709 
up logo so this is what they look like
filling<00:00:32.489> they're<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> lot<00:00:32.969> thinner<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.390> right

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
filling they're a lot thinner out right

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.139 
filling they're a lot thinner out right
here<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.140> little<00:00:34.440> middle<00:00:35.219> insert<00:00:35.730> part

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
here on this little middle insert part

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.420 
here on this little middle insert part
they're<00:00:36.840> wider<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.800> gaps<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
they're wider because the gaps on the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.369 
they're wider because the gaps on the
edge<00:00:39.090> pieces<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> lot<00:00:39.870> bigger<00:00:39.989> size<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
edge pieces are a lot bigger size to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.410 
edge pieces are a lot bigger size to
fill<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.649> whole<00:00:40.800> thing<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:42.000> support<00:00:42.329> I'm

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
fill that whole thing for support I'm

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.790 
fill that whole thing for support I'm
assuming<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:42.989> yeah<00:00:43.110> they're<00:00:43.290> very<00:00:43.500> high

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
assuming but yeah they're very high

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.040 
assuming but yeah they're very high
quality<00:00:43.940> like<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.420> try<00:00:45.809> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
quality like if you go to try and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.119 
quality like if you go to try and
squeeze<00:00:46.260> them<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.710> don't<00:00:46.890> even<00:00:47.219> budge<00:00:47.960> so

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
squeeze them they don't even budge so

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.709 
squeeze them they don't even budge so
yeah<00:00:50.129> squeezes<00:00:50.489> pretty<00:00:50.640> hard<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:50.879> anyway

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
yeah squeezes pretty hard there anyway

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
yeah squeezes pretty hard there anyway
so<00:00:52.230> same<00:00:52.590> basic<00:00:52.949> thing<00:00:53.100> let's<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.550> our<00:00:53.699> keep

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
so same basic thing let's get our keep

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.639 
so same basic thing let's get our keep
apart<00:00:56.000> put<00:00:57.000> me<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> corners<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.440> we're<00:00:58.559> gonna

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
apart put me the corners so we're gonna

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.910 
apart put me the corners so we're gonna
move<00:00:58.859> those<00:00:59.039> out<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> way<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.770> need

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
move those out of the way you just need

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:13.190 
move those out of the way you just need
the<00:01:01.949> edges<00:01:08.119> get<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> can

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the edges get that going so I can

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.630 
the edges get that going so I can
already<00:01:13.320> tell<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.770> has<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> leaks

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
already tell this has a lot of leaks

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.100 
already tell this has a lot of leaks
loop<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.540> won't<00:01:15.600> need<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.869> relive

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
loop on it so I won't need to relive

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
loop on it so I won't need to relive
this<00:01:16.229> afterwards<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.100> recommend<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
this afterwards but I recommend that you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.030 
this afterwards but I recommend that you
do<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.570> basically<00:01:18.840> you're<00:01:19.049> gonna<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.380> is

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
do so basically you're gonna do is

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.719 
do so basically you're gonna do is
you're<00:01:20.189> gonna<00:01:20.250> split<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.180> apart<00:01:22.490> I'm<00:01:23.490> going

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you're gonna split this apart I'm going

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
you're gonna split this apart I'm going
to<00:01:23.850> pair<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.390> these<00:01:24.479> torpedoes<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:25.500> fit

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to pair one of these torpedoes just fit

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.580 
to pair one of these torpedoes just fit
it<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:27.020> you'll<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.380> uh

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it right in there you'll see this uh

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
it right in there you'll see this uh
the<00:01:28.979> black<00:01:29.670> edge<00:01:29.850> will<00:01:30.060> fit<00:01:30.210> right<00:01:30.240> under<00:01:30.659> that

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the black edge will fit right under that

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.929 
the black edge will fit right under that
torpedo<00:01:31.020> thing<00:01:32.570> for<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> low<00:01:33.869> point<00:01:34.939> I'm

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
torpedo thing for the low point I'm

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.530 
torpedo thing for the low point I'm
worried<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.360> put<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> other<00:01:37.049> side<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:38.540> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
worried just put the other side on and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.010 
worried just put the other side on and
then<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.960> click<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> together<00:01:41.780> sure<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.840> push

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
then you click it together sure you push

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.120 
then you click it together sure you push
together<00:01:43.170> really<00:01:43.439> nicely<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:43.979> look

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
together really nicely and then look

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.440 
together really nicely and then look
good<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.430> why<00:01:44.610> they<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:44.970> those<00:01:45.149> little

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
good that's why they have those little

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.480 
good that's why they have those little
flares<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.740> fill<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.189> gap

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
flares because they fill that little gap

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.990 
flares because they fill that little gap
there<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.200> then<00:01:49.640> there<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:50.790> there's<00:01:50.970> your

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
there and then there you go there's your

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.940 
there and then there you go there's your
torpedo<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.600> hopefully<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.590> will<00:01:52.740> come<00:01:52.920> out

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
torpedo so hopefully this will come out

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.440 
torpedo so hopefully this will come out
really<00:01:53.610> awesome<00:01:53.820> when<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.450> break

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
really awesome when we do this so break

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.010 
really awesome when we do this so break
apart<00:01:58.340> insert<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.520> thing<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.960> she

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
apart insert that thing in there so she

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.780 
apart insert that thing in there so she
said<00:02:01.579> when<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.700> close<00:02:02.909> it

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
said when you close it

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.230 
said when you close it

older one and these edges have kind of

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.170 
older one and these edges have kind of

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
gap is kind of slightly closed you might

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.200 
gap is kind of slightly closed you might
need<00:02:18.860> something<00:02:19.280> that's<00:02:19.550> gonna<00:02:19.640> open<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:20.090> up

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
but most likely you won't need to don't

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.540 
but most likely you won't need to don't
worry<00:02:23.180> about<00:02:23.390> how<00:02:23.770> how<00:02:24.770> hard<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.280> going<00:02:25.460> to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
worry about how how hard it is going to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.730 
worry about how how hard it is going to
be<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.730> install<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.330> just<00:02:28.150> opened<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.270> and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
be to install this I just opened it and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.620 
be to install this I just opened it and
basically<00:02:30.740> just<00:02:31.610> started<00:02:32.000> doing<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.480> so

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
basically just started doing this so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.240 
basically just started doing this so
it's<00:02:32.750> not<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.930> very<00:02:32.990> long<00:02:33.290> process<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.830> feeling

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
it's not a very long process a feeling

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.530 
it's not a very long process a feeling
it's<00:02:34.370> gonna<00:02:34.460> take<00:02:34.670> like<00:02:34.760> maybe<00:02:34.820> five<00:02:35.180> minutes

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
it's gonna take like maybe five minutes

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.890 
it's gonna take like maybe five minutes
or<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:37.000> we'll<00:02:38.000> see<00:02:38.240> how<00:02:38.830> this<00:02:39.830> works<00:02:40.130> out

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
or so so we'll see how this works out

00:02:40.900 --> 00:03:03.310 
or so so we'll see how this works out
just<00:02:41.900> super<00:02:42.500> easy<00:02:42.530> and<00:03:01.540> you're<00:03:02.540> done<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.140> let's

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
put together our cube here this one's

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.560 
put together our cube here this one's
gonna<00:03:34.040> definitely<00:03:34.459> not<00:03:34.610> pop<00:03:37.330> get<00:03:38.330> in<00:03:38.420> there
