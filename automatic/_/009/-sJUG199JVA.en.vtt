to fit in there and I'll get him glued
in<00:00:40.640> there<00:00:40.850> one<00:00:41.030> of<00:00:41.059> these<00:00:41.269> days<00:00:42.760> Gary<00:00:43.760> made

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
in there one of these days Gary made

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.279 
in there one of these days Gary made
these<00:00:44.359> by<00:00:45.010> cutting<00:00:46.010> up<00:00:46.159> and<00:00:46.370> combining<00:00:47.289> two

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
these by cutting up and combining two

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:58.150 
these by cutting up and combining two
marks<00:00:49.010> three<00:00:49.370> three<00:00:49.640> threes

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.240 

this<00:00:58.820> forward<00:00:59.210> motor<00:00:59.630> is<00:00:59.840> powered<00:01:02.980> this<00:01:03.980> one

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
this forward motor is powered this one

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.500 
this forward motor is powered this one
here<00:01:04.519> just<00:01:04.550> has<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.269> guts<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:07.010> the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
here just has the guts and this is the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.050 
here just has the guts and this is the
what<00:01:08.510> allows<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.200> thing<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.820> navigate<00:01:10.820> a

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
what allows this thing to navigate a

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.560 
what allows this thing to navigate a
reasonably<00:01:14.060> tight<00:01:14.360> turn<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:16.300> look<00:01:17.300> at<00:01:17.450> the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
reasonably tight turn is look at the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:26.020 
reasonably tight turn is look at the
swing<00:01:17.900> line<00:01:21.700> works<00:01:22.700> pretty<00:01:23.000> good<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.640> so

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
swing line works pretty good and so

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.200 
swing line works pretty good and so
we're<00:01:26.210> going<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.390> take<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.750> for<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:26.990> run<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.729> for

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
we're going to take it for a run and for

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.170 
we're going to take it for a run and for
the<00:01:29.300> purposes<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.990> this<00:01:30.170> because<00:01:31.180> Southern

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
the purposes of this because Southern

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.730 
the purposes of this because Southern
Pacific<00:01:32.300> is<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.780> ones<00:01:33.050> that<00:01:33.110> ran<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.530> cab

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
Pacific is the ones that ran the cab

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.639 
Pacific is the ones that ran the cab
forwards<00:01:34.280> will<00:01:35.149> use<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.360> marker<00:01:36.259> Southern

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
forwards will use a marker Southern

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.010 
forwards will use a marker Southern
Pacific<00:01:36.770> tender<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:38.300> only<00:01:38.509> problem<00:01:38.930> with

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
Pacific tender the only problem with

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.020 
Pacific tender the only problem with
this<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.530> actually<00:01:40.039> a<00:01:40.369> coal<00:01:40.670> tender<00:01:41.410> and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
this this is actually a coal tender and

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.029 
this this is actually a coal tender and
cab<00:01:44.030> forward<00:01:44.360> would<00:01:44.720> not<00:01:44.960> have<00:01:45.140> run<00:01:45.350> run<00:01:45.890> on

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
cab forward would not have run run on

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.749 
cab forward would not have run run on
coal<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.580> would<00:01:46.700> have<00:01:46.789> run<00:01:46.940> on<00:01:47.149> oil<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:49.369> here

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
coal it would have run on oil and here

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.499 
coal it would have run on oil and here
in<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.940> background<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:51.259> can<00:01:51.289> see<00:01:51.710> my<00:01:52.509> future

in the background you can see my future

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.990 
in the background you can see my future
tender<00:01:54.229> it's<00:01:54.680> got<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.920> ways<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.190> go<00:01:55.399> it's<00:01:55.789> held

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
tender it's got a ways to go it's held

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.320 
tender it's got a ways to go it's held
together<00:01:56.240> with<00:01:56.539> tape<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.100> on<00:01:58.340> but

you'll notice here that I've cut the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.589 
you'll notice here that I've cut the
coal<00:02:02.060> load<00:02:02.810> out<00:02:03.160> of<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.310> tender<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.000> replaced

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
coal load out of the tender and replaced

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.419 
coal load out of the tender and replaced
it<00:02:05.810> with<00:02:05.840> hatches<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:06.560> doors<00:02:06.590> where<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.310> would

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
it with hatches and doors where it would

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.510 
it with hatches and doors where it would
be<00:02:07.550> filled<00:02:08.149> with<00:02:08.360> oil<00:02:08.800> it's<00:02:09.800> not<00:02:10.009> poor<00:02:10.399> to

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
be filled with oil it's not poor to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.390 
be filled with oil it's not poor to
typical<00:02:11.030> but<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.770> wanted<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.920> made<00:02:13.130> for

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
typical but it I wanted it made for

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.610 
typical but it I wanted it made for
Mark's<00:02:13.700> parts<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.420> that's<00:02:14.930> kind<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.290> what<00:02:15.470> it's

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.550 
Mark's parts so that's kind of what it's
going<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.800> look<00:02:15.860> like<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:17.120> then<00:02:17.810> behind<00:02:18.050> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
going to look like and then behind it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.860 
going to look like and then behind it
we're<00:02:18.800> gonna<00:02:18.920> pull<00:02:19.310> also<00:02:20.209> tonight<00:02:20.510> as<00:02:20.840> a
