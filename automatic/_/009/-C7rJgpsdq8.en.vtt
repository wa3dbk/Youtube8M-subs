steps<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.280> use<00:01:32.490> gum<00:01:33.150> paste<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.720> can

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
steps so you can use gum paste you can

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.730 
steps so you can use gum paste you can
use<00:01:34.110> phone<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.520> use<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.619> think<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
use phone then you can use I think it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.649 
use phone then you can use I think it
hardest<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.400> work<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> fountain<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
hardest to work it fountain because you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.330 
hardest to work it fountain because you
need<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> mix<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> powder<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.890> don't<00:01:41.220> mix

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
