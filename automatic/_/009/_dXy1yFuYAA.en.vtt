00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.809
 jo haye and welcome here too 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.789
 a new fashion idea i know 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.330
 not if the presenter is still 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.980
 Nevermind 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.730
 a new fashion idea at least 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.430
 here on dw-tv so we have again 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.500
 a mod and this time a lot 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.689
 extraordinary motto of how to do it 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.630
 To be realistic, but I think quite 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.960
 cool if you save a little time 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.250
 want 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.219
 So let's go to the dealer 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.879
 over to the forest devices and see here 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.030
 the brux and i dont know if this is it 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.879
 But part of it is okay 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.210
 Entertainment costs 195 euros per person 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:58.760
 day and the purchase price or 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:04.280
 purchase price is 50,000 450 euro yes that 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:08.120
 it was actually already say of this 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.010
 I first shredder yes for wood 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.180
 Wood chipper can actually say that 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.829
 still once in the garage and 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.850
 see the selling price is 25,000 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:24.259
 225 yes super look us the device once 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.409
 anja washed textures in itself now 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.640
 nothing special needed a bit 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.079
 out yes here in front of the money like ok zapfl 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.789
 it's already a bit dirty 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:40.479
 Let's get in and see 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.609
 ever the function we can with 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.369
 extend the tube 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:48.320
 we can use x4 all the money 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.299
 Open up there is support feet everywhere 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.250
 fold in and unfold 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.850
 but there are actually no support 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.649
 Feet here I would say yes 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.149
 turn on weight 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.469
 they see that he is a bit like 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.539
 We can do that here, too 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.650
 turn on and of course completely 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.930
 lower as normal 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.120
 every front attachment here i have 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:16.150
 ever liked a small tree 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.670
 we'll try that out now 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.360
 We do not know if that works 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.760
 look now found here now and 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.940
 He is completely gone and we are already 100 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.410
 percent or small hanger 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.030
 So you can wonderful the whole 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.620
 trees or maybe it's small 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.150
 that we also have what you do not have to be like that 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.450
 I think that's a bit different 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.880
 if you change them quickly but for 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.850
 small branches remove themselves with the 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.470
 with the tree freese bad remove 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.170
 let's be a good one in any case 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.820
 thing here and you can stop the wood 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.240
 still use here you can especially 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.820
 bring it to the power plant here at the back 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.410
 and that's how it all comes down to 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.880
 Of course, a very cool watch is one 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.010
 little unrealistic 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.820
 Again, we see it working together 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.840
 a plate and no real pipe is 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.550
 a bit too bad 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.890
 Well then 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.860
 so what I have that's it 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.570
 Some of this motto days should still be 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.160
 a map that was coming more often 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.160
 desired and that will of course still 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.170
 a little longer ideas 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.240
 I guess so 20 minutes we are 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.070
 normal web presentations there are times 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.720
 relatively short but we do that 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.630
 very detailed or I will do that 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.830
 Do not know if jonathan does that 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.970
 I would say I make this map 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.920
 imagine that we have there ever 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.570
 clarified that will come then the days 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.480
 I hope I hope that everything I have 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.910
 currently a lot too much 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.860
 as you have seen we did 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.690
 a new intro or i have a new one 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.400
 intro i do not stop that 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.960
 Also, the white uses at the time 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.900
 where i do not even snow this video 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.780
 that we have that writes mine 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.950
 comments if I like that and then 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.440
 I would say what about this 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.560
 small but kohlenpott conception of 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.510
 the hacker here we see two parts 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.040
 or excel are here on it is also quite 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.040
 we are made fun again 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:15.200
 or should it be more for 80 degrees say 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.200
 You can not read the rest so well 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:23.580
 mobile chips okay they will 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.340
 know what they are doing 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.080
 ok then thank you for your audience 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.530
 and I say now under the hotline 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.530
 job 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.930
 that again 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.729
 you go
