seriously<00:03:06.630> some<00:03:07.500> very<00:03:07.680> bold<00:03:07.890> words<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.459> terms

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
seriously some very bold words in terms

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.520 
seriously some very bold words in terms
of<00:03:08.880> his<00:03:09.180> technique<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.020> said<00:03:10.170> he's<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> very

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
of his technique you said he's a very

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.290 
of his technique you said he's a very
well<00:03:10.680> rounded<00:03:10.830> puncher<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.580> think<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.060> not<00:03:12.270> a

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
well rounded puncher I think it's not a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.270 
well rounded puncher I think it's not a
well-rounded<00:03:13.020> boxer<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.709> think<00:03:14.040> it's<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.190> good

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
well-rounded boxer I think it's a good

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.970 
well-rounded boxer I think it's a good
fighter<00:03:14.550> -<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.790> think<00:03:15.180> he<00:03:15.270> posed<00:03:15.480> some

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
fighter - I think he posed some

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.050 
fighter - I think he posed some
difficulties<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.160> stuff<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.580> think<00:03:17.670> that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
difficulties but stuff that I think that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.640 
difficulties but stuff that I think that
you<00:03:18.840> have<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.019> little<00:03:19.170> bit<00:03:19.320> more<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.560> an

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
you have a little bit more of an

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.070 
you have a little bit more of an
advantage<00:03:19.920> on<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:20.430> what<00:03:21.269> do<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.390> find<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.930> his

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
advantage on but what do you find of his

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.890
