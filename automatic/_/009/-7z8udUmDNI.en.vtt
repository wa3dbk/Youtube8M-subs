00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
the bottom and just connect it and don't

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.140 
the bottom and just connect it and don't
think<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:19.570> weak<00:03:19.870> it's<00:03:20.200> not<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:20.620> weak

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
think this is so weak it's not that weak

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.210 
think this is so weak it's not that weak
and<00:03:22.150> get<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:22.660> how<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:22.900> want<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:24.040> make<00:03:24.190> it

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
and get like how you want it to make it

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.020 
and get like how you want it to make it
straight<00:03:24.700> like<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:26.440> like<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.190> then

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
straight like it's like that and then

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.000 
straight like it's like that and then
it's<00:03:28.150> perfectly<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:32.260> cage<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.590> really

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
it's perfectly on this cage is really

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.120 
it's perfectly on this cage is really
good<00:03:33.160> cage<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:35.230> I'm<00:03:35.290> think<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.650> bad<00:03:35.860> cave

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
good cage so I'm think it's a bad cave

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.590 
good cage so I'm think it's a bad cave
your<00:03:36.400> hands<00:03:36.670> cannot<00:03:36.940> chew<00:03:37.239> through<00:03:37.540> it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
your hands cannot chew through it

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.900 
your hands cannot chew through it
because<00:03:37.690> it's<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.050> metal<00:03:38.350> but<00:03:38.800> it's<00:03:39.070> pretty

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
because it's a metal but it's pretty

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.820 
because it's a metal but it's pretty
easy<00:03:40.090> for<00:03:40.390> Dolph<00:03:40.720> Hampshire<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.410> go<00:03:41.530> through

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
easy for Dolph Hampshire to go through

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.310 
easy for Dolph Hampshire to go through
it<00:03:42.010> because<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.670> has<00:03:42.790> gaps<00:03:43.120> but<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:43.930> think<00:03:44.260> you

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
it because it has gaps but I think you

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.000 
it because it has gaps but I think you
can<00:03:44.500> fix<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.920> gaps<00:03:45.420> but<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.140> best<00:03:47.620> for<00:03:47.980> a

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
can fix the gaps but this is best for a

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.370 
can fix the gaps but this is best for a
teddy<00:03:48.670> bear<00:03:48.730> hamster<00:03:49.360> now<00:03:50.050> for<00:03:50.260> the
