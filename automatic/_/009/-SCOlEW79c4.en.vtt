00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.320
 21 June 2014 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.910
 dad francesco launches an attack without 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.910
 precedents against the mafia 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.730
 they are not in communion with god they are 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 excommunicated 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.720
 the excommunication of the mafia with the world of 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.820
 surprise 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.090
 the last time a pope attacked 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.660
 the mafia bombs exploded in front of the 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.269
 the mobsters asked me deeply 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.790
 devotees but they are also profoundly 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.920
 cynics in the way they use the 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.879
 religion to justify theirs 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.540
 power and succeed because for decades 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.339
 priests and godparents have had interests in 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.339
 common of the same enemy 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.600
 an alliance that is anything but holy to her 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.840
 infiltrated mafia effects 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.730
 in the organization of religious holidays 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.610
 men of faith colluded with men 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.980
 of honor the Vatican bank recycled i 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.040
 money of ours while priests 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.220
 brave have been killed for having 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.340
 dared to ask the bosses 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.500
 my name is jaunty that for over 15 years 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.060
 study criminal organizations 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.550
 Italian 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.340
 this is my survey of relationships 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.950
 between mafia and church to understand what 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.510
 it will happen now that the pope has decided 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.510
 to break them 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.300
 my journey begins in southern Italy 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.350
 the trench of the fight against the mafias of 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.930
 Pope francesco 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.920
 here organized crime is 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.530
 an infinite emergency I am in Calabria 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.200
 in the poorest region of italy but 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:19.850
 also the home of the richest and mafia 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:23.060
 dangerous the ndrangheta in the 90s 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.310
 the Ndrangheta ousted 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.210
 becoming the largest importer of 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.210
 cocaine in Italy 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.470
 violence is the basis of all 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.360
 criminal activities of the Ndrangheta 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.530
 a violence that has not spared 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.390
 not even women and children and is here in 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.200
 calabria and that papa francesco has 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.880
 launched its challenge to the mafia la 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.950
 ndrangheta and this worship of evil 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:04.510
 and contempt for the common good 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.510
 this evil must be combated must be removed
