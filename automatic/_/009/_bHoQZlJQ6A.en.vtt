00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.990
 Yup 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.129
 outside of lawn 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.360
 watch out for the video you are about to 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.610
 display was made in 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.650
 then those who do not appreciate will come out 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.260
 certain types of videos are asked to 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.970
 close the video are now breaking 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.920
 comments thanks write if not now there 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.390
 I'm in this new video I'm here today 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.640
 with the fifth episode of a week 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.950
 the doubles it is today brings you a double 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.880
 cam strike taken suffering this too 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.560
 quite fast and fine I say it now 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.989
 who doesn't want to see another video on 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.539
 this is for video favorites today 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.789
 we're going to deal with a topic 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.890
 similar to this to solve precisely 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.010
 these problems because many people 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.219
 unfortunately they don't understand that youtube doesn't 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.530
 television is indeed even the 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.630
 television one can change channel but 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.840
 anyway youtube even more if one 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.550
 wants to see a video on what in the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.980
 his tremor writes on youtube.com tremor 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.830
 and he finds billions so I don't 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.290
 I understand why people continue to 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.070
 write under this video just 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.900
 map but not in the sense of writing 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.970
 as a criticism the latter then there yes 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.530
 but to write it continually offending and 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.560
 repeatedly says born the video does 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.049
 sucks and things 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.630
 in short, now also this comment by 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.810
 what I heard about it will suck 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.240
 that beats jokes anyway 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.880
 topic already covered many times if yes 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.460
 can call topic here anyway i 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.030
 habitat and certain comments of the kind 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.390
 just don't do this water anymore 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.799
 sucks because because as you see in 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.220
 this last period I am taking many 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.140
 light 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.720
 in these last videos, precisely because 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.090
 because maybe a person doesn't like me 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.310
 made others like you more suffering 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.600
 strikes representative perceived streisand 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.010
 that I'm suffering 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.410
 in short, I can't see myself at 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.840
 upload 18 videos a day for 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.630
 please 18 people then in the end 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.160
 because there will always be someone who is not 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.730
 happy with the video I upload 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.830
 however if one if one does not like the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.410
 video however role to give the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.330
 cover he drinks now that I don't have 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.880
 still put the covers or again 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.500
 loaded with curtains sees it from the image 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.870
 which puts them youtube of the year one 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.520
 range person so if one does not want 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.430
 see a video range and don't know 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.440
 not even that opens well than on super 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.270
 range and closes it a foreigner looks 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.240
 but shut up 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.390
 in the sense I understand that there is freedom 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.870
 In short, I will do what I write 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.810
 want 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.310
 everyone can write what he wants is 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.260
 in any case, quite rightly so 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.870
 avoid such stupid comments 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.640
 because the seas I write so much 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.270
 I try to change a patch ercoli pd 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.620
 be satisfied, however, maybe 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.480
 write it saying you feel me this lai 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.930
 he repeated so much other me 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.240
 would like you to upload a video on 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.770
 another map I don't stop doing these 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.130
 cock video loads another map 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.580
 order imperative point no no good 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.030
 like some people who write me step by step 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.140
 my channel exclamation point on the cock 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.900

 I do it with pleasure giorgia city 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.950
 a few 15 myths of nothing to satisfy you 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.410
 whoever passed me to the church 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.110
 now violent billions demand for 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.690
 pass on to their dogs anyway if I do 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.600
 ask with kindness and I seek with 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.450
 I'm glad you can even switch to yours 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.730
 channel or in this case change 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.250
 map here but if you order me 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.380
 using imperatives using points 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.400
 exclamation marks also offending me 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.840
 many times 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.269
 1 offending the gaulle person and there it is 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.370
 very happy to fulfill your wish 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.910
 no who has never told his own 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.549
 parents 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.890
 feel fucked buying this and you 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.080
 will be bought true yes immediately always if 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.310
 forever happened so anyway a 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.290
 part of this off topic avoid comments 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.689
 gender because they are of no use 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.389
 rather 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.949
 does not consider them just as soon as I see 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.689
 that there is an offense in the comment by google 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.089
 I'm not in mind here maybe 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.969
 have had a little too much today we listen to 

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:43.269
 let's see the next comment it makes if it is 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:46.569
 Good I read it here Seriously 

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:48.159
 anyway if you see that he doesn't answer you 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.379
 to the comments because unfortunately it is always the 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.629
 usually problem I have to write all the 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:55.059
 your name literally and with wall more 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.009
 then there are billions from the list but field 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.539
 I can find yours and then 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.300
 maybe I avoid answering mine 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.679
 comments of the kind great big lori that 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.019
 I'm glad he continued to 

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:06.789
 write but still I don't go to 

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:09.189
 answer everyone because I can't 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.169
 I answer to the maximum as that is a little more 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:13.629
 articulated that they necessarily have 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.249
 want an answer or maybe in 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.929
 this comment for example answer a 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.599
 a comment made me one ie 

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:21.489
 who told me he sees me a little more 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.969
 sad in the videos if I understand correctly 

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:24.219
 in conclusion 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:26.589
 in the last video you can very well a 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:30.129
 read a comment like that and i 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:32.199
 they respond by saying that yes I don't 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.509
 like most common that once upon a time there was 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.429
 play the legitimate for the simple 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.800
 fact that the boss sucks because 

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:39.849
 in fact in these three the last three 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.349
 days the trouble 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.029
 I only played black ops tour 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.099
 on the league because I really enjoy it 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.439
 liked the two my friends amuses me and 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.449
 also a bit competitive with mode 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:52.539
 so it keeps me attacked by its own 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.879
 so and while ghost I do 12 games 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.409
 or I don't play but anyway 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:58.749
 I enjoy it but not like the past 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.429
 capital will now see the next 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:02.559
 and this is the poured answer of maybe 

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:04.179
 also for this reason that he does not see me this way 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:06.099
 as happy as once that anyway 

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:07.929
 guys over here at the video is over and there 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.720
 let the blast hope the video is 

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:10.880
 the comment 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.740
 He liked sako invites you to leave 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.170
 I like a nice commented avoid 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.920
 stupid body boy comments is over 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.920
 Hi everyone
