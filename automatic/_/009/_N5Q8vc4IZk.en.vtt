00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
we did the pupae water castle and what

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.260 
we did the pupae water castle and what
you<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.369> our<00:01:47.820> initial<00:01:48.390> idea<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
you see is our initial idea for it and

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
yeah we thought that's probably not

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.230 
yeah we thought that's probably not
enough<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.479> such<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> long<00:01:55.790> time<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
enough for for such a long time the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.560 
enough for for such a long time the
players<00:01:57.780> playing<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.619> PvP<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.369> we<00:02:00.329> wanted

players playing on on PvP so we wanted
to<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.750> something<00:02:01.020> bigger<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.860> play

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040
