00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.780 
screamers so there's got there's a few
sources<00:01:56.670> we're<00:01:57.060> good<00:01:57.990> um<00:01:58.490> officially<00:01:59.490> named

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
sources we're good um officially named

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.969 
sources we're good um officially named
that<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.450> him<00:02:00.540> well<00:02:01.140> okay<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.530> these<00:02:01.799> are

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that and see him well okay so these are

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.399 
that and see him well okay so these are
screamers<00:02:02.549> they're<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:02.969> ghosts<00:02:03.329> green<00:02:04.020> blob

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
screamers they're like ghosts green blob

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
screamers they're like ghosts green blob
looking<00:02:04.770> things<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.610> they<00:02:06.030> look<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.509> they

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
looking things and they look like they

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.820 
looking things and they look like they
got<00:02:06.899> hands<00:02:07.380> sort<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> mini<00:02:08.009> figure<00:02:08.340> but

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
got hands sort of like a mini figure but

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.520 
got hands sort of like a mini figure but
they<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.129> kind<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.370> look<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.840> green<00:02:12.840> blob

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
they just kind of look like a green blob

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.240 
they just kind of look like a green blob
of

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.720 
of
and<00:02:14.970> they<00:02:15.270> got<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> face<00:02:16.190> not<00:02:17.190> much<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.610> him

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and they got a face not much to him

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.490 
and they got a face not much to him
honestly<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.450> their<00:02:18.810> trend<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.440> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
honestly but their trend it's a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.210 
honestly but their trend it's a
transparent<00:02:19.890> um<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:21.920> figure<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.950> don't

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
transparent um little figure I don't

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.290 
transparent um little figure I don't
know<00:02:23.310> if<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.580> figure<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.910> don't<00:02:24.120> know<00:02:24.180> if

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
know if it's a figure I don't know if

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.120 
know if it's a figure I don't know if
you<00:02:24.390> could<00:02:24.510> consider<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.110> figure<00:02:25.380> it's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
you could consider that a figure it's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.030 
you could consider that a figure it's
got<00:02:26.280> its<00:02:26.460> face<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.150> got<00:02:27.330> arms<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.680> I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
got its face and it's got arms but I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.620 
got its face and it's got arms but I
don't<00:02:29.280> know<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.790> would<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:30.030> considered<00:02:30.510> a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
don't know if it would be considered a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.580 
don't know if it would be considered a
figure<00:02:30.990> um<00:02:31.370> i<00:02:32.990> don't<00:02:33.990> i<00:02:34.140> would<00:02:34.290> say<00:02:34.560> probably

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
figure um i don't i would say probably

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.340 
figure um i don't i would say probably
not<00:02:35.209> but<00:02:36.209> i<00:02:36.480> think<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:36.959> i<00:02:36.990> might<00:02:37.170> be

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
not but i think like i might be

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.310 
not but i think like i might be
considering<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.010> figure<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> don't<00:02:38.520> know

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
considering it a figure I don't know

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.810 
considering it a figure I don't know
there's<00:02:40.320> obviously<00:02:40.770> different<00:02:41.130> faces<00:02:41.610> for

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
there's obviously different faces for

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.670 
there's obviously different faces for
some<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.150> them<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.780> some<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.500> could

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
some of them so it's like some you could

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.170 
some of them so it's like some you could
like<00:02:43.830> sort<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.160> collect<00:02:44.520> these<00:02:44.670> guys<00:02:44.970> I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
like sort of collect these guys I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.020 
like sort of collect these guys I
suppose<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.400> very<00:02:47.610> cool<00:02:47.850> looking

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
suppose but it's a very cool looking

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.229 
suppose but it's a very cool looking
mold<00:02:48.690> on<00:02:49.020> these<00:02:49.440> guys<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.400> know<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:51.180> looks

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
mold on these guys so you know it looks

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.240 
mold on these guys so you know it looks
like<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.810> same<00:02:52.080> mold<00:02:52.350> for<00:02:52.530> each<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:52.920> but

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
like this the same mold for each one but

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.930 
like this the same mold for each one but
different<00:02:53.400> face<00:02:53.730> printings<00:02:54.300> on<00:02:54.480> them<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
different face printings on them and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.540 
different face printings on them and
yeah<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.510> they're<00:02:58.320> just<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.590> transparent<00:02:59.280> green

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
yeah so they're just a transparent green

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.920 
yeah so they're just a transparent green
you<00:02:59.790> know<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.480> could<00:03:00.600> put<00:03:00.810> whatever

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
you know and then you could put whatever

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.270 
you know and then you could put whatever
you<00:03:01.140> want<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.410> their<00:03:01.560> hands<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.950> probably

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
you want in their hands you probably

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.240 
you want in their hands you probably
hold<00:03:02.520> them<00:03:02.700> from<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.940> back<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.480> um<00:03:04.350> fly<00:03:05.100> them

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
hold them from the back and um fly them

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.320 
hold them from the back and um fly them
around<00:03:05.459> because<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.820> looks<00:03:06.030> like<00:03:06.180> they're

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
around because it looks like they're

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.680 
around because it looks like they're
they<00:03:06.570> fly<00:03:06.870> around<00:03:07.020> like<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.410> ghost<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.730> those

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
they fly around like a ghost so those

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.420 
they fly around like a ghost so those
look<00:03:09.900> pretty<00:03:10.050> cool<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.680> two<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.190> one's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
look pretty cool the two that one's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.860 
look pretty cool the two that one's
holding<00:03:11.610> like<00:03:11.790> an<00:03:11.940> axe<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.270> think<00:03:12.510> they're<00:03:12.690> and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
holding like an axe I think they're and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.430 
holding like an axe I think they're and
one's<00:03:13.050> holding<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.590> TNT<00:03:14.400> or<00:03:14.630> dynamite<00:03:15.630> and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
one's holding on TNT or dynamite and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.660 
one's holding on TNT or dynamite and
yeah<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.730> mean<00:03:17.850> that's<00:03:18.120> um<00:03:19.670> pretty

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
yeah so I mean that's um pretty

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.190 
yeah so I mean that's um pretty
interesting<00:03:21.120> too<00:03:21.299> so<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.690> could<00:03:21.900> just<00:03:21.959> put

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
interesting too so you could just put

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.810 
interesting too so you could just put
anything<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.530> your<00:03:22.560> hands<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.640> their

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
anything in your hands the in their

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.880 
anything in your hands the in their
hands<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:25.160> they<00:03:26.390> can<00:03:27.390> attack<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.350> ninja<00:03:28.680> or

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
hands and they can attack the ninja or

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.030 
hands and they can attack the ninja or
attack<00:03:29.730> wherever<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.209> want<00:03:30.420> them<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.630> attack

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
attack wherever you want them to attack

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.530 
attack wherever you want them to attack
so<00:03:32.630> again<00:03:33.630> different<00:03:33.930> face<00:03:34.140> printings<00:03:34.620> and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
so again different face printings and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.880 
so again different face printings and
yeah<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.810> they're<00:03:36.959> just<00:03:37.080> like<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.230> transparent

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
yeah so they're just like a transparent

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.830 
yeah so they're just like a transparent
green<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:39.060> looks<00:03:39.209> really<00:03:39.269> cool<00:03:39.570> they<00:03:39.720> got

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
green and it looks really cool they got

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.320 
green and it looks really cool they got
like<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> lot<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.380> green<00:03:40.739> they<00:03:41.670> got<00:03:41.820> light<00:03:42.030> green

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
like a lot of green they got light green

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.380 
like a lot of green they got light green
for<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.780> glow<00:03:43.769> in<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:43.950> dark<00:03:44.280> on<00:03:44.459> pieces<00:03:45.180> and

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
for the glow in the dark on pieces and

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.630 
for the glow in the dark on pieces and
stuff<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:45.870> some<00:03:46.079> sets<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.010> summer<00:03:47.280> wave

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
stuff for some sets in the summer wave

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.330 
stuff for some sets in the summer wave
