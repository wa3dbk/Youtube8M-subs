reason you you might be thinking hey why
do<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.680> need<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.859> build<00:00:23.160> blue<00:00:23.310> buff<00:00:23.490> why<00:00:23.699> would<00:00:23.880> I

need to bring my solo lanes to come help
me<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> reason<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.789> number<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
me but the reason is that number one it

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.169 
me but the reason is that number one it
makes<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.380> take<00:00:28.500> less<00:00:28.710> damage<00:00:28.939> number<00:00:29.939> two

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
makes you take less damage number two

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.269 
makes you take less damage number two
the<00:00:30.480> SolarWinds<00:00:30.929> don't<00:00:31.439> lose<00:00:31.619> anything<00:00:31.920> for

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the SolarWinds don't lose anything for

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.400 
the SolarWinds don't lose anything for
that<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.669> number<00:00:33.390> three<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.020> much<00:00:34.230> more

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
that and number three is just much more

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.190 
that and number three is just much more
efficient<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.160> way<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.780> wonderful

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
efficient to do this way so my wonderful

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.530 
efficient to do this way so my wonderful
assistant<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.180> blue<00:00:39.390> buff

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
assistant here and when the blue buff

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720 
assistant here and when the blue buff
spawns<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.200> pull<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.489> one

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
spawns is going to pull it and this one

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.690 
spawns is going to pull it and this one
less<00:00:42.570> pill<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:43.100> really<00:00:44.100> really<00:00:44.340> helps<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
less pill as really really helps the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.279 
less pill as really really helps the
jungle<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.660> don't<00:00:45.750> normally<00:00:46.020> see

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
jungle this one you don't normally see

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.090 
jungle this one you don't normally see
in<00:00:46.530> normal<00:00:47.039> games<00:00:47.250> or<00:00:47.520> solo<00:00:48.270> queue<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.200> make

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
in normal games or solo queue and make

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
in normal games or solo queue and make
the<00:00:50.460> Medellin<00:00:51.000> does<00:00:51.539> lose<00:00:51.899> out<00:00:52.079> maybe<00:00:52.320> one

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the Medellin does lose out maybe one

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.920 
the Medellin does lose out maybe one
maybe<00:00:53.010> two<00:00:53.129> CS<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.940> pill<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.329> blow<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> way

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
maybe two CS on pill and blow this way

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.590 
maybe two CS on pill and blow this way
but<00:00:55.289> basically<00:00:55.860> ensures<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:57.239> jungler

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
but basically ensures that your jungler

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
but basically ensures that your jungler
takes<00:00:57.989> zero<00:00:58.649> damage<00:00:59.039> from<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> blue<00:00:59.850> buff

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
takes zero damage from the blue buff

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
takes zero damage from the blue buff
which<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.660> cool<00:01:00.930> especially<00:01:01.920> for

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
which is really cool especially for

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.560 
which is really cool especially for
money<00:01:02.219> won't<00:01:02.399> cure<00:01:02.550> no<00:01:02.730> jungle<00:01:02.940> afterwards<00:01:03.480> or

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
money won't cure no jungle afterwards or

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.299 
money won't cure no jungle afterwards or
something<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.110> they're<00:01:05.040> scared

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
something like that and they're scared

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
something like that and they're scared
of<00:01:05.369> me<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> enemy<00:01:05.909> jungler<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.720> your

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
of me in the enemy jungler so your

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.929 
of me in the enemy jungler so your
jungler<00:01:07.770> tough<00:01:08.070> foe<00:01:08.250> health<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> energy

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
jungler tough foe health and the energy

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.109 
jungler tough foe health and the energy
angle<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.330> would<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.540> low<00:01:09.720> from<00:01:09.930> their<00:01:10.110> camps

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
angle that would be low from their camps

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
angle that would be low from their camps
so<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> reason<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.479> trick<00:01:13.170> works<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.680> that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
so the reason that trick works is that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.490 
so the reason that trick works is that
the<00:01:14.570> person<00:01:15.570> who<00:01:15.659> pulls<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> blue<00:01:16.140> buff<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the person who pulls the blue buff the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.170 
the person who pulls the blue buff the
blue<00:01:16.650> buff<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.009> grilled<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.369> them<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
blue buff is a grilled on them so the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
blue buff is a grilled on them so the
blue<00:01:18.360> buff<00:01:18.509> once<00:01:18.689> they<00:01:18.869> go<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.320> person

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
blue buff once they go to that person

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.330 
blue buff once they go to that person
and<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.450> take<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> shortest<00:01:22.380> route<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.920> go

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and it was take the shortest route to go

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.670 
and it was take the shortest route to go
to<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.610> person<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.320> will<00:01:25.439> make<00:01:25.530> more

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to that person so this will make more

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.200 
to that person so this will make more
sense<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.130> blue<00:01:26.430> outsource<00:01:26.790> bonds<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.090> we

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
sense when blue outsource bonds that we

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.090 
sense when blue outsource bonds that we
do<00:01:27.330> pull<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.500> wants<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
do pull it so it wants to go to the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.480 
do pull it so it wants to go to the
shortest<00:01:29.460> route<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.380> if<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.770> person<00:01:32.400> who

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
shortest route and if the person who

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789 
shortest route and if the person who
pills<00:01:32.759> blue<00:01:33.259> changes<00:01:34.259> where<00:01:34.409> they're<00:01:34.530> going

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
pills blue changes where they're going

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
pills blue changes where they're going
the<00:01:35.220> shortest<00:01:35.579> route<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:36.299> change<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the shortest route will change so if you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.630 
the shortest route will change so if you
look<00:01:37.079> here<00:01:37.229> blows<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:38.100> towards

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
look here blows going down towards
