00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.239
 with his key sun 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.560
 a sunat 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.580
 we go 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.070
 and within this we have 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.070
 yes 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.150
 books and electronic records are not 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.510
 there is the possibility of doing so 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.430
 through clues or that would imply that 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.620
 you 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 buy the rents or if you do not upload in a 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.850
 massive file with the structure 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.989
 that last year it was called sl and now 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.120
 do not confuse us 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.159
 words fast on the internet that can be 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.440
 do in that let's see what are the 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.140
 characteristics there is another one that is more 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.100
 popular probably you have 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 seen that there are 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.640
 P.S 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:13.110
 what happened last year to some 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.110
 random contributors 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.580
 Until now 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.390
 that has been college 20 is to say the year 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.400
 happened he did with this because I 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.140
 I wonder he applied something he did not do with this 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.610
 nothing of all did vÃ©lez this was a 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.619
 project but from this year onwards 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.409
 can carry through those is 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.450
 optional between the two times when but 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.450
 from experience you yourselves will say 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.650
 it's over the internet if it falls 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.880
 exact then I try your translation of 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.890
 according to the norm and what you 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.330
 you are seeing there in this part that 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.590
 we are reviewing the issue of what 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:07.480
 normative dos de meira over there that's why 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.340
 So when you say here that 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.460
 we saw a moment ago says it can be 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.840
 by sml or the porting 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.850
 both are book systems 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.190
 electronic only that the system 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.750
 electronic book pl is with the soho an 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.380
 portal electronic book system 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.380
 as well
