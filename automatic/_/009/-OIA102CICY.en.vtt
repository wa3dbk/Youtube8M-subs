00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 first at the baltic sea in rostock hansa 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.629
 against the first fc kaiserslautern and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.389
 quite interesting the two coaches 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.570
 wolfgang wolf and franco foda have two 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.969
 Spielzeiten 1 am Betzenberg as actors 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.090
 spent together we see here 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.949
 old team photo wolfgang wolf in 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.650
 the last series and franco foda the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.580
 later on the dfb-cup with louder than 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.460
 player won 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.529
 there in the middle hansa rostock 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.510
 you want to go back up to the top 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.830
 So profi area in league two has become 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.290
 not quite found 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.460
 but at home markus gaupp is one 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.460
 so far unbeaten 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.470
 hansa rostock at home in this 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.900
 third league season still undefeated 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.120
 The mood in the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.770
 dkb-arena at the dfb cup game against 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 Kaiserslautern however the guests 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.830
 it was clear in the first half 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.650
 the tone 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.750
 purely in the part it bunjaku and in 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.590
 in the middle it is like that and after ten 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.540
 have to stand 0 to 1 minutes 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.450
 classes interplay between the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.360
 acute crisis the top storm of the second 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.770
 current league and continue to read in the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.869
 advance with the next one 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.420
 possibility like this one must 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.580
 failed on kevin müller the keeper 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.750
 it rusts 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.490
 Of course, the homeowners had the same way 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.270
 Your options from one 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.390
 single action city out the boss tobias 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.650
 Sippel to check 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.840
 advantages in the first half quite clear 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.610
 in favor of kaiserslautern and zur 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.880
 second half of the condensed 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.640
 heaven over rostock further than that 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.340
 louder they came to their first 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.100
 hit well played out over the left 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.720
 then bunjaku ice cold into the short corner 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.030
 the 1 0-lead in the 49 minute game 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.920
 There were two questions on this hit 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.600
 on the one hand or not the answer 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.979
 Of course it was not stephan gusche 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.320
 is that too late and then the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.630
 second of course why kevin müller here 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.229
 the short corner is free he expects 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 the pass in the middle of the driessen 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.159
 Kaiserslautern was on the top and rostock 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.299
 sheen to be in a state of shock 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.690
 seven minutes later 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.239
 This pass on train and train against markus 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.150
 and then to get kevin müller and 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.010
 then it's 2 to rostocker until 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.070
 there with good order in the defensive 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.260
 but here they were just too open us 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.840
 see in the virtual setting it 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.269
 It was also time off but that is 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.130
 nothing to accuse the assistant 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.670
 could the rest of class made by 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.560
 hendrik train 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.140
 the louder they had the lot in the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.180
 but it seemed the rostocker 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.270
 they were still alive 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.250
 substitute Johannes Platz 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.110
 on half left the ball gets him be 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.650
 Defenders can be the goalkeeper through the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.810
 legs 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.980
 and suddenly it was 2 2 1 is again 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.370
 loud in the stadium 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.440
 and you could see there was something else 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.819
 in it 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.010
 this is the one of johann plate 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.140
 Dutch from ts da this summer 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.720
 had come in for smetana 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.870
 and here with his best scene 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.850
 and rostock pushed on and had the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.430
 next opportunity with michael flowers 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.360
 but the class only has the post 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.160
 just missed and how it is when 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.870
 we press a team and drinks 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.459
 and everything admits to the compensation 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.440
 then the other one is easy to achieve 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.569
 There was a lot of space in Kaiserslautern 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.959
 fall and the place in you use at the end 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.920
 93 minutes the valley to 1 the end 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.319
 and konstantinos fortounis 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.880
 kaiserslautern gloomy with further and 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.739
 Rostock they had fought 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.690
 they had given much but the big one 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.850
 catching up she just came too late for 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.380
 For the fourth time in a row, Rostock is out in 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.049
 the first round and I can here in 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.880
 reproach us for being after 1 0 the 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.350
 2 0 have gotten earlier that's it 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.630
 only thing I can do 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.720
 otherwise she has here and courage 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.310
 Cup performance delivered and yes the big one 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.350
 and all I am satisfied but under 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.310
 the result and the dash disappointing 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.079
 the result was 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.609
 maybe we had more in it today 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.769
 We want to win every game 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.549
 not only championship cup already that 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.200
 already depends on the friendly games 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.480
 You have to have such a mentality 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.070
 develop and the cup is always important 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.090
 there is continued self-confidence 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.060
 and you can see there are already some 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.560
 Bundesliga eliminated and Kappel 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.140
 is still financially for the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.430
 Very good and therefore it was enormous 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.799
 important for us today that we have one 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.720
 round have come on 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.400
 thorsten customer had the votes 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.199
 Game Kaiserslautern is a round one 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.340
 continue the last three years in a row 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.659
 they were at least once in the round of last 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.129
 Tickets continue with the game against 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.129
 ingolstadt with toni tomic
