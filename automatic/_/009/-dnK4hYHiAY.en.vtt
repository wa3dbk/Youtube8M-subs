given<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.250> fact<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.340> you're

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
given all that the fact that you're

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.280 
given all that the fact that you're
constantly<00:00:35.880> kind<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> connected<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
constantly kind of connected to the to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.670 
constantly kind of connected to the to
the<00:00:37.380> cloud<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.989> horsepower<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.469> box

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the cloud the horsepower of the box

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.869 
the cloud the horsepower of the box
itself<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.520> substantially<00:00:42.390> larger<00:00:42.600> bigger

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
itself is substantially larger bigger

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.270 
itself is substantially larger bigger
and<00:00:44.879> between<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.500> sort<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.219> know

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
and between that and sort of you know

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.760 
and between that and sort of you know
you're<00:00:47.640> not<00:00:47.760> only<00:00:48.000> sort<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.300> defined<00:00:49.260> by<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you're not only sort of defined by the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.729 
you're not only sort of defined by the
horsepower<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.760> box<00:00:50.940> itself<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.539> also

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
horsepower of the box itself but also

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.660 
horsepower of the box itself but also
the<00:00:52.739> horsepower<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.520> actually

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the horsepower that you can actually

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.689 
the horsepower that you can actually
sort<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.059> harness<00:00:54.270> from<00:00:54.539> from<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> cloud<00:00:55.949> if

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
sort of harness from from the cloud if

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.310 
sort of harness from from the cloud if
you<00:00:56.820> talk<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> horsepower<00:00:57.629> compared<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you talk with the horsepower compared to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.740 
you talk with the horsepower compared to
the<00:00:58.440> xbox<00:00:58.949> 360<00:00:59.690> um<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> compared<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> xbox

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the xbox 360 um so compared to the xbox

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.950 
the xbox 360 um so compared to the xbox
360<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.799> think<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.189> had<00:01:05.689> when<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:06.930> about

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
360 I think we had when you think about

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.240 
360 I think we had when you think about
things<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.439> ram<00:01:07.820> 512<00:01:08.820> megs<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> ram<00:01:09.770> 8<00:01:10.770> gigs

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
things like ram 512 megs of ram 8 gigs

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.850 
things like ram 512 megs of ram 8 gigs
on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.150> xbox<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:14.060> we<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.570> have

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
on the xbox one we are going to have

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.490 
on the xbox one we are going to have
basically<00:01:16.860> half<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.460> terabyte<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.909> space<00:01:18.500> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
basically half a terabyte of space and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.230 
basically half a terabyte of space and
on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> actual<00:01:20.159> hard<00:01:20.430> drive<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.759> comes<00:01:20.970> with

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
on the actual hard drive that comes with

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.390 
on the actual hard drive that comes with
the<00:01:21.509> with<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> xbox<00:01:22.619> one<00:01:23.960> believe<00:01:24.960> xbox<00:01:25.860> three

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the with the xbox one believe xbox three

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.179 
the with the xbox one believe xbox three
sixty<00:01:26.689> five<00:01:27.689> million<00:01:28.049> transistors<00:01:28.680> five

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
sixty five million transistors five

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.510 
sixty five million transistors five
billion<00:01:29.810> on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> Xbox<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.950> probably<00:01:32.369> some

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
billion on the Xbox one is probably some

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.240 
billion on the Xbox one is probably some
of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> stats<00:01:32.909> you've<00:01:33.119> heard<00:01:33.270> earlier<00:01:33.630> today

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
of the stats you've heard earlier today

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
of the stats you've heard earlier today
so<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.640> mean<00:01:35.909> multiple<00:01:36.479> multiple<00:01:36.689> folds<00:01:37.259> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
so I mean multiple multiple folds and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.810 
so I mean multiple multiple folds and
obviously<00:01:37.650> again<00:01:37.829> sort<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.159> wanna<00:01:38.340> keep

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
obviously again sort of wanna keep

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789 
obviously again sort of wanna keep
harping<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.810> cloud<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.530> sort<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
harping on the on the cloud but sort of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.740 
harping on the on the cloud but sort of
really<00:01:41.009> kind<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.280> harnessing<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> power<00:01:42.600> of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
really kind of harnessing the power of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.120 
really kind of harnessing the power of
the<00:01:42.869> cloud<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> might<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.799> heard<00:01:43.890> mark

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the cloud that you might have heard mark

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.280 
the cloud that you might have heard mark
went<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.399> talked<00:01:44.549> about<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.329> 300,000

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
went and talked about you know 300,000

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
went and talked about you know 300,000
servers<00:01:46.680> basically<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.430> terms<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.479> know

xbox one have well when it comes to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
xbox one have well when it comes to
games<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.530> actually<00:02:01.860> even<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.219> entertainment

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
games and actually even to entertainment

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.950 
games and actually even to entertainment
apps<00:02:02.939> there<00:02:03.270> won't<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.570> backwards

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
apps there won't be backwards

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
apps there won't be backwards
compatibility<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> know<00:02:04.950> basically<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.610> is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
compatibility you know basically this is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.210 
compatibility you know basically this is
a<00:02:05.820> new<00:02:06.450> modern<00:02:06.780> architecture<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
a new modern architecture so you have to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.470 
a new modern architecture so you have to
sort<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.520> built<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.660> new<00:02:09.959> platform

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
sort of built for this new platform

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.920 
sort of built for this new platform
so<00:02:11.659> but<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.290> said<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:12.800> know<00:02:12.830> hopefully<00:02:13.159> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
so but that said you know hopefully the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.300 
so but that said you know hopefully the
experiences<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.349> will<00:02:15.680> be<00:02:15.799> able<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.159> bring

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
experiences that will be able to bring

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.470 
experiences that will be able to bring
to<00:02:16.370> bear<00:02:16.610> both<00:02:16.819> with<00:02:17.030> games<00:02:17.269> and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
to bear both with games and

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.440 
to bear both with games and
entertainment<00:02:18.099> will<00:02:19.099> basically<00:02:19.730> sort<00:02:20.330> of

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
entertainment will basically sort of

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.119 
entertainment will basically sort of
make<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.019> worthwhile<00:02:21.349> investment<00:02:21.709> both

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
make that a worthwhile investment both

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.070 
make that a worthwhile investment both

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
xbox one will have more information

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.140 
xbox one will have more information
later<00:02:29.840> on<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.310> how<00:02:31.310> will<00:02:31.489> they<00:02:31.610> connect<00:02:31.910> push

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
later on that how will they connect push

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.199 
later on that how will they connect push
things<00:02:32.390> beyond<00:02:32.720> what<00:02:32.900> current<00:02:33.349> games<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.799> do

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
things beyond what current games can do

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.780 
things beyond what current games can do
um<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:36.049> think<00:02:36.379> a<00:02:36.470> lot<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.340> remains<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
um I think a lot of that it remains to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.250 
um I think a lot of that it remains to
be<00:02:37.819> seen<00:02:38.060> I'm<00:02:38.209> sorry<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.540> kind<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.750> keep<00:02:38.900> sort

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
be seen I'm sorry to kind of keep sort

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.170 
be seen I'm sorry to kind of keep sort
of<00:02:39.349> bringing<00:02:40.099> entertainment<00:02:40.700> into<00:02:40.879> this<00:02:41.000> as

of bringing entertainment into this as

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.250

well<00:02:41.209> because<00:02:41.480> that's<00:02:41.659> sort<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.959> lenses

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
well because that's sort of the lenses

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.110 
well because that's sort of the lenses
that<00:02:42.379> I<00:02:42.440> look<00:02:42.739> at<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.950> look<00:02:43.640> at<00:02:43.730> things<00:02:43.910> but

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
that I look at a look at things but

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.009

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
you know we've never had before so it'll

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.690 
you know we've never had before so it'll
take<00:03:24.290> sort<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.950> accessibility<00:03:25.669> I

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
take sort of this the accessibility I

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.460 
take sort of this the accessibility I

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
think of games and entertainment as it

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.170 
think of games and entertainment as it
relates<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.829> natural<00:03:28.190> user<00:03:28.370> interface<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.970> a

connect<00:03:31.519> you<00:03:31.579> needed<00:03:31.819> a<00:03:31.880> lot<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.120> room<00:03:32.359> for<00:03:32.389> it

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
connect you needed a lot of room for it

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.940

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
as it again sort of broader depth you

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.670 
as it again sort of broader depth you
know<00:03:43.790> we've<00:03:43.970> sort<00:03:44.269> of<00:03:44.299> designed<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.590> know

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
know we've sort of designed it you know

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.110 
know we've sort of designed it you know
some<00:03:45.829> of<00:03:45.859> the<00:03:45.980> feedback<00:03:46.160> that<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.700> had<00:03:46.940> gotten

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
some of the feedback that we had gotten

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.629 
some of the feedback that we had gotten
it<00:03:47.450> was<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:48.019> know<00:03:48.139> hard<00:03:48.410> for<00:03:48.889> you<00:03:49.310> know<00:03:49.430> sort

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
it was you know hard for you know sort

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.240 
it was you know hard for you know sort
of<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:50.060> terms<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.359> to<00:03:50.569> see<00:03:50.720> children<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:52.069> so

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
of in terms of to see children and so

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.309 
of in terms of to see children and so
now<00:03:52.459> sort<00:03:52.849> of<00:03:52.910> in<00:03:53.090> terms<00:03:53.209> of<00:03:53.419> the<00:03:53.599> depth

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
now sort of in terms of the depth

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.199 
now sort of in terms of the depth
perception<00:03:54.919> that<00:03:55.069> it<00:03:55.280> has<00:03:55.489> as<00:03:55.790> well<00:03:55.970> as<00:03:56.090> the

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
field that you can actually see it makes

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.159 
field that you can actually see it makes
that<00:04:00.169> a<00:04:00.349> lot<00:04:00.739> easier<00:04:00.919> for<00:04:01.359> to<00:04:02.359> see<00:04:02.690> kids<00:04:02.959> as

the<00:05:17.199> in<00:05:17.409> the<00:05:17.500> world<00:05:17.710> obviously<00:05:18.639> it'll<00:05:18.789> work

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
the in the world obviously it'll work

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.490 
the in the world obviously it'll work
with<00:05:19.150> windows<00:05:19.479> 8<00:05:19.599> tablets<00:05:19.960> would<00:05:20.080> also<00:05:20.229> be

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
with windows 8 tablets would also be

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.379 
with windows 8 tablets would also be
compatible<00:05:20.979> with<00:05:21.009> iOS<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:21.789> Android<00:05:21.849> tablets

compatible with iOS and Android tablets

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.600 
compatible with iOS and Android tablets
certainly<00:05:23.289> today<00:05:23.530> we<00:05:23.740> have<00:05:23.949> smart<00:05:24.430> glass

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
available on iOS and Android so I think

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.279 
available on iOS and Android so I think
