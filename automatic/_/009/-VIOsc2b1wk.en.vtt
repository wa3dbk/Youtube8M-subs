00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
ahead and start off by folding it across

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.980 
ahead and start off by folding it across
diagonally<00:00:22.730> this<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:24.090> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.840> give

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
diagonally this is just going to give

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.109 
diagonally this is just going to give
you<00:00:25.050> sort<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.470> reference<00:00:25.980> line<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.699> your

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you sort of a reference line in your

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.870 
you sort of a reference line in your
crease<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.890> you're<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.400> open<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
crease and you're going to open that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.179 
crease and you're going to open that
back<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.320> you're<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.560> take<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:31.830> top

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
back up you're going to take your top

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.760 
back up you're going to take your top
edge<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.899> you're<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> fold<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.620> down

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
edge and you're going to fold it down

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.180 
edge and you're going to fold it down
until<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.880> side<00:00:36.680> meets<00:00:37.680> your<00:00:37.860> crease<00:00:40.190> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
until this side meets your crease and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.510 
until this side meets your crease and
you<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.180> crease<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.309> you're<00:00:44.309> going

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you want to crease that and you're going

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.300 
you want to crease that and you're going
to<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> same<00:00:45.050> with<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.350> bottom

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.010 

now<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.150> have<00:00:54.210> those<00:00:54.390> two<00:00:54.600> reference

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
now that you have those two reference

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
now that you have those two reference
Greece's<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.590> ahead<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.920> open<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.370> up

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
Greece's go ahead and open it back up

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.300 
Greece's go ahead and open it back up
and<00:00:57.200> turn<00:00:58.200> it<00:00:58.320> around<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.830> that<00:00:58.860> you've<00:00:59.070> got

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
and turn it around so that you've got

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.240 
and turn it around so that you've got
the<00:00:59.460> edges<00:00:59.940> facing<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.540> and<00:01:00.980> you're<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.160> to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the edges facing you and you're going to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.370 
the edges facing you and you're going to
bring<00:01:02.610> this<00:01:02.880> point<00:01:03.240> up<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:04.050> where<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.199> meets

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
bring this point up to where it meets

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.900 
bring this point up to where it meets
this<00:01:04.830> point<00:01:05.870> so<00:01:06.870> that<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.430> basically<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
this point so that you have basically a

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.000 
this point so that you have basically a
little<00:01:09.150> white<00:01:09.360> showing<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.050> both<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
little white showing on both of the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.670 
little white showing on both of the
edges<00:01:12.140> go<00:01:13.140> ahead<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.470> crease<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:13.980> and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
edges go ahead and crease that and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
edges go ahead and crease that and
you're<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.010> fold<00:01:17.160> until<00:01:17.730> these<00:01:18.060> two

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you're going to fold until these two

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.870 
you're going to fold until these two
white<00:01:18.930> edges<00:01:19.430> meet<00:01:20.430> each<00:01:20.610> other<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:22.880> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
white edges meet each other and that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.150 
white edges meet each other and that
makes<00:01:24.120> a<00:01:25.220> symmetrical<00:01:26.220> pattern<00:01:27.800> now<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.860> want

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
makes a symmetrical pattern now you want

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.410 
makes a symmetrical pattern now you want
to<00:01:29.369> flip<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.060> whole<00:01:30.240> thing<00:01:30.479> upside<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
to flip the whole thing upside down and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.890 
to flip the whole thing upside down and
open<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:34.260> your<00:01:34.440> bottom<00:01:35.690> petals<00:01:36.690> right

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
open up just your bottom petals right

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.859 
open up just your bottom petals right
there<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.400> bring<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.550> up<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:39.030> top<00:01:39.210> so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
there and bring them up to the top so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.650 
there and bring them up to the top so
that<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.560> intersection<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> these<00:01:41.490> two<00:01:41.660> comes

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
that the intersection of these two comes

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.650 
that the intersection of these two comes
just<00:01:43.290> right<00:01:43.710> underneath<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.330> point<00:01:46.550> and

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
just right underneath that point and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.050 
just right underneath that point and
you're<00:01:48.660> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.170> flip<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> over<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:52.759> just<00:01:53.759> do

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you're going to flip it over and just do

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.200 
you're going to flip it over and just do
the<00:01:54.240> same<00:01:54.890> with<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:56.490> bring<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> little

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the same with that and bring it a little

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.520 
the same with that and bring it a little
lower<00:01:59.600> so<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.320> you've<00:02:01.500> got

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
lower so you can see there you've got

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.380 
lower so you can see there you've got
five<00:02:01.950> points<00:02:02.720> now<00:02:03.720> flip<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:04.590> over<00:02:04.710> again<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
five points now flip it over again and

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.050 
five points now flip it over again and
take<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:06.570> edges<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.729> bring<00:02:08.729> them<00:02:08.910> up

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
take your edges here and bring them up

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.420 
take your edges here and bring them up
until<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.930> point<00:02:13.190> down<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.400> the
