was almost going to get them in white as
well<00:03:23.200> but<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.410> thought<00:03:23.560> that's<00:03:23.829> a<00:03:23.950> little<00:03:24.100> bit

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
well but I thought that's a little bit

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.759 
well but I thought that's a little bit
overboard<00:03:24.609> but<00:03:25.299> I<00:03:25.540> like<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.260> way<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.590> they

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
overboard but I like the way that they

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.770 
overboard but I like the way that they
fit<00:03:27.130> they<00:03:27.579> feel<00:03:27.850> really<00:03:28.209> nice<00:03:28.540> and

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
fit they feel really nice and

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.970 
fit they feel really nice and
comfortable<00:03:29.139> of<00:03:29.260> course<00:03:29.319> it's<00:03:29.650> always<00:03:29.859> the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
comfortable of course it's always the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.949 
comfortable of course it's always the
task<00:03:30.190> getting<00:03:30.519> into<00:03:30.850> them<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:31.600> that's

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
task getting into them but that's

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.629 
task getting into them but that's
alright<00:03:32.290> we<00:03:32.530> can<00:03:32.680> move<00:03:32.829> past<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.430> think

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
alright we can move past that I think

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.180 
alright we can move past that I think

they do have it as stretch in them so

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.180 
they do have it as stretch in them so
they'll<00:03:37.900> be<00:03:38.109> more<00:03:38.319> comfortable<00:03:38.680> over<00:03:38.920> time

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
top which isn't usually something that I

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.430 
top which isn't usually something that I
would<00:06:06.940> get<00:06:07.120> but<00:06:07.240> I<00:06:07.300> really<00:06:07.660> really<00:06:07.900> liked<00:06:08.139> it

it<00:06:08.590> is<00:06:09.039> this<00:06:09.280> white<00:06:09.580> top<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.630> just<00:06:10.660> goes

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
it is this white top it just goes

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.930 
it is this white top it just goes
straight<00:06:11.229> down<00:06:11.440> like<00:06:11.800> that<00:06:12.039> but<00:06:12.490> it<00:06:12.610> has<00:06:12.789> this

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
straight down like that but it has this

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.390 
straight down like that but it has this
caging<00:06:13.539> effect<00:06:13.870> around<00:06:14.169> the<00:06:14.260> neckline<00:06:14.500> so

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
caging effect around the neckline so

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.350 
caging effect around the neckline so
it's

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
it's

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.270 
it's
something<00:06:16.659> really<00:06:16.960> different<00:06:17.319> and<00:06:17.710> I<00:06:18.069> think

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
something really different and I think

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.070 
something really different and I think
it<00:06:18.340> all<00:06:18.400> looks<00:06:18.580> like<00:06:19.000> really<00:06:19.449> good<00:06:19.719> just<00:06:19.960> like

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
it all looks like really good just like

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.580 
it all looks like really good just like
