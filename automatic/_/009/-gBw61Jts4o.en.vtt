00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.970
 and then people bragging about it to stay calm of the gold 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.030
 green 11 I'm here with you though 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.089
 games to show very good ideas that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.480
 you can use your videos and also 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.460
 is an explanation of how you can 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.020
 appear here on the channel because I do not 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.390
 I made this very clear 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.580
 only it's a community channel I want 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.730
 also that you appear here, right? 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.640
 so let's start with the ideas then 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.059
 and 10 video clips you can do are 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.390
 cultures of dribbling or how it is 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.980
 to win on the last team I've ever 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.239
 I made some but I know that you have 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.600
 also very good methods or 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.420
 make cultural celebrations and I just 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.329
 I was thinking about the truth you 're thinking. 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.890
 nothing is just that there are many others everything 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.120
 This is what you can do. 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 then what you can do to 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.180
 comparison of players or even a 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.580
 analysis of a specific player is the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.670
 People, I really like to see 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.119
 goal compilations with manners editions 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.020
 or other types of edits with a 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.619
 Good sun , these things are or you can too. 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.619
 to make videos of is time assembly knows 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.450
 it's an analysis of the team you show the team 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.659
 injured players gets a little bit 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.450
 each and then machÃ© goals you 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.299
 got to do with this team 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.329
 but I also thinking about making a top 5 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.150
 of goals or editions or clips 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.939
 and can follow every week 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.460
 people do a different theme and lastly 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.310
 an idea that everyone does more 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.940
 which is very good is is a series know that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.030
 You start from scratch with the middle team. 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.830
 in the last team after each game and goes 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.790
 buying a player will command a 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.490
 cool team at the end and you can do 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.200
 different variations then for or instead 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.080
 to make each game if the new 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.990
 player you have to get three goals 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.390
 with a certain player you can 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.760
 buy a better version of it or even 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.430
 buy a better player than you are 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.620
 position and then to appear in the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.540
 channel is just to use our intuition that 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.390
 you can download using the link in the description 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.790
 below the video and of course you 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.490
 use an idea that I said in the beginning 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.010
 of the video would be very good if you used 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.260
 our intuition and that sends the result 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.020
 final for people but stay connected 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.670
 we have someone doing a new introduction 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.480
 So, we'll see you in a few weeks. 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.430
 come back here to download this new version 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.770
 but that's just it folks do not get the bunches of 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.020
 let a gem share with the 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.180
 friends who helps a lot in the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.180
 channel and thanks people until the next
