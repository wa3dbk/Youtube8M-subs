but<00:00:26.570> anyhow<00:00:27.730> there's<00:00:28.730> no<00:00:28.880> gasket<00:00:29.919> so<00:00:30.919> I'm<00:00:31.460> gues

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
but anyhow there's no gasket so I'm gues

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.650 
using this this stuff here it's always
worked<00:00:35.180> for<00:00:35.360> me<00:00:35.510> good<00:00:35.690> in<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.870> past<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:37.660> you

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
just want a thin thin film all the way

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.319 
just want a thin thin film all the way
around<00:00:44.680> you<00:00:45.680> don't<00:00:45.860> want<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.159> go<00:00:47.030> out<00:00:47.150> the

crankcase block up your oil sump and

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.209 
crankcase block up your oil sump and
you'll<00:00:55.160> be<00:00:55.280> done<00:00:55.460> for<00:00:55.489> then<00:00:55.940> you'll<00:00:56.840> be<00:00:56.960> sad<00:01:00.219> no

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
guarantees on this engine that uh

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.400 
guarantees on this engine that uh
something<00:01:04.339> didn't<00:01:04.729> get<00:01:04.940> damaged<00:01:05.899> when<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:06.289> was

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
something didn't get damaged when it was

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.219 
something didn't get damaged when it was
racing<00:01:07.220> like<00:01:07.399> hell<00:01:07.610> before<00:01:07.810> when<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.899> guy<00:01:09.020> was

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
racing like hell before when the guy was

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.150 
racing like hell before when the guy was
running<00:01:09.410> it<00:01:09.679> but<00:01:10.280> uh<00:01:10.310> I<00:01:11.470> still<00:01:12.470> think<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:12.920> think

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
running it but uh I still think I think

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.010 
running it but uh I still think I think
it'll<00:01:13.369> be<00:01:13.490> all<00:01:13.640> right<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.119> isn't<00:01:14.300> knocking<00:01:14.690> or

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
it'll be all right it isn't knocking or

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.740 
it'll be all right it isn't knocking or
anything<00:01:15.259> like<00:01:15.649> that<00:01:15.679> so<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:16.539> believe<00:01:17.539> she'll

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
anything like that so I believe she'll

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.139 
anything like that so I believe she'll
be<00:01:17.899> okay<00:01:18.259> once<00:01:18.470> we<00:01:18.649> get<00:01:18.800> her<00:01:18.920> together<00:01:19.100> what<00:01:19.940> up

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
be okay once we get her together what up

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.960 
be okay once we get her together what up
yeah<00:01:20.630> let's<00:01:20.979> let's<00:01:21.979> do<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:22.399> might<00:01:22.700> be<00:01:22.850> able

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
yeah let's let's do that I might be able

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.960 
yeah let's let's do that I might be able
to<00:01:23.179> get<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:24.070> back<00:01:25.070> on<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> tractor<00:01:25.670> and

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
to get this back on a tractor and

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.370 
to get this back on a tractor and
running<00:01:26.210> yet<00:01:26.360> even<00:01:26.689> it<00:01:26.780> doesn't<00:01:26.960> even<00:01:27.110> take

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
running yet even it doesn't even take

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.350 
running yet even it doesn't even take
that<00:01:27.409> long<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:28.009> do<00:01:28.159> that<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:28.729> we'll<00:01:29.000> see<00:01:29.210> what

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
that long to do that so we'll see what

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.469 
that long to do that so we'll see what
happens<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.920> there's<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.790> oil<00:01:32.150> pan<00:01:32.840> back<00:01:33.200> on<00:01:33.500> I

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
happens so there's the oil pan back on I

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.600 
happens so there's the oil pan back on I
did<00:01:35.479> eventually<00:01:35.990> have<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.200> take<00:01:36.950> off<00:01:37.159> this<00:01:37.340> oil

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
did eventually have to take off this oil

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.499 
did eventually have to take off this oil
pump<00:01:37.909> cover<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:40.369> get<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:40.670> gear<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:40.970> line<00:01:41.299> up

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
pump cover to get this gear to line up

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.840 
pump cover to get this gear to line up
on<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.810> shaft<00:01:42.079> that's<00:01:42.380> that's<00:01:42.829> still<00:01:43.579> up<00:01:43.729> in

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
on the shaft that's that's still up in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.639 
on the shaft that's that's still up in
the<00:01:43.909> engine<00:01:46.689> how<00:01:47.689> to<00:01:47.750> persuade<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.470> little

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
the engine how to persuade it a little

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.730 
the engine how to persuade it a little
bit<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.220> give<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.060> some<00:01:50.210> taps<00:01:50.479> but<00:01:50.869> for<00:01:51.680> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
bit and give it some taps but for the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.819 
bit and give it some taps but for the
most<00:01:51.860> part<00:01:51.979> it<00:01:52.250> went<00:01:52.399> on<00:01:52.549> okay<00:01:52.729> getting<00:01:53.240> this

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
most part it went on okay getting this

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.490 
most part it went on okay getting this
seal<00:01:54.829> to<00:01:55.270> go<00:01:56.270> back<00:01:56.479> around<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.930> crankshaft

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
seal to go back around the crankshaft

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.030 
seal to go back around the crankshaft
that<00:01:57.619> was<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:57.890> bit<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.430> task<00:01:59.240> but<00:01:59.630> in<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.890> end

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
that was a bit of a task but in the end

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.700 
that was a bit of a task but in the end
I<00:02:01.159> got<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.520> didn't<00:02:01.850> take<00:02:02.000> too<00:02:02.149> damn<00:02:02.390> long<00:02:03.729> so<00:02:05.710> so

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
I got it didn't take too damn long so so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.910 
I got it didn't take too damn long so so
far<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.039> guess<00:02:07.399> it's<00:02:07.610> all<00:02:07.759> good

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.700 

let<00:02:11.920> me<00:02:12.010> see<00:02:12.250> yeah<00:02:13.120> I've<00:02:13.270> had<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:14.020> use<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
let me see yeah I've had to use the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.100 
let me see yeah I've had to use the
silicone<00:02:15.490> setting<00:02:16.000> up<00:02:16.090> for<00:02:16.270> about<00:02:16.420> 15<00:02:16.870> minutes

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
silicone setting up for about 15 minutes

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.260 
silicone setting up for about 15 minutes
so<00:02:17.500> we'll<00:02:18.570> both<00:02:19.570> torque<00:02:19.900> them<00:02:20.020> down<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:21.270> don't

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
so we'll both torque them down I don't

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.470 
so we'll both torque them down I don't
have<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.450> torque<00:02:22.750> wrench<00:02:22.990> but<00:02:23.980> uh<00:02:24.480> Jeff

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
have a torque wrench but uh Jeff

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.800 
have a torque wrench but uh Jeff
Bradshaw<00:02:26.050> elderly<00:02:26.890> hiring<00:02:27.280> guy<00:02:27.600> he<00:02:28.600> got<00:02:28.780> a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
Bradshaw elderly hiring guy he got a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.300 
Bradshaw elderly hiring guy he got a
nice<00:02:29.080> torque<00:02:29.410> wrench<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:29.830> I'm<00:02:29.950> sure<00:02:30.100> he<00:02:30.190> won't

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
nice torque wrench so I'm sure he won't

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.670 
nice torque wrench so I'm sure he won't
mind<00:02:30.580> if<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.820> borrow<00:02:30.850> his<00:02:31.390> old<00:02:32.050> one<00:02:33.780> quick
