00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.690
 good folks the procedure now 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:10.530
 answering the serve in the hand is 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.150
 800 BC is the subject is everything 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.059
 the other has to be thick 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.029
 not far from the people of the fiber 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.760
 so and how it made a hole a bit 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.039
 longer but there doing we 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.830
 work with adhesive tape 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.170
 I can pass the fifth victim along with the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.330
 daughter and then we'll fit the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.239
 ronaldinho to make a petition to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:40.700
 measured and 23 centimeters thick 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.700
 just like that 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:55.100
 basically a stabilizer footprint 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:59.000
 another important thing with certain adhesive 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:05.070
 3 any better brand better 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.890
 that other alternatives there that we 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.920
 we can 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.510
 I'm new kind of expensive nonsense 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.760
 thinks about himself but will not spend a roll 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.500
 tape to close a wagon full of 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.670
 fifa examples 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.710
 put the flags is important 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:31.170
 although the staff did not forget that we 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.170
 we have a right nei financial side 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.300
 I would say we are a business 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.430
 take is the contribution 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.920
 this is the part of the dragon that really 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.780
 difficult I'll prepare my love if 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.780
 round windows in the next relation 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.940
 selected the flag the side that goes 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.700
 Being glued gets the subject on the day 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.180
 of those the little bit offset 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.350
 father father of ours when talking to people 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.650
 Let's put it, let's paste this 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.450
 right flag here 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.100
 The interesting thing is that she has to stay 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.750
 10 subject to the name is that this is the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.870
 flag but afraid she has to speak 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.840
 for more even put gnarled have with 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.540
 goals, nor is it here his moment that 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.000
 really have to have a lot of patience 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.000
 this here is more than 10 more already had 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.900
 What to do, I confess. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.900
 so we'll fix what we can 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.170
 and that we are leaving more or less a few 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.090
 people that we 'll already be holding 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.870
 here in the day and now that has a detail 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.650
 as the stock stock 6 twisted 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.000
 we're going around and stay speechless and 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.040
 come on holding it's to have the lime part 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.310
 I particularly the first flag 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.460
 we already put the first flag already 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.460
 we are passing the next flag there 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:26.660
 you will adapt the value to you 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:26.660
 take out with second tape
