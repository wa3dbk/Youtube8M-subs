 creating interesting tourist 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.130
 routes in the republic 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.350
 fishing development opportunities in the register 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.950

 well-known magazine reader 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.149
 go fishing with us 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.460
 their predatory fish here at games they before 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.100
 you can count on catching pike 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.450
 and perch 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.250
 fishing conditions allows you to use 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.310
 the most different lures and accessories 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.380
 for example about minogue holes oscillating 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.890
 spinners and even despite the calendar 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.310
 winter 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.660
 superficial bait but according to 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.000
 Konstantin Kuzmina 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.550
 the most interesting thing is to catch them 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.670
 edible tires equipped on the basis of 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.530
 century this type of tooling is new for 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.509
 most of our fishermen but 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.640
 having tried it once and having achieved 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.830
 result skills can be thoroughly 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.800
 clean here for a completely different feeling 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.709
 rather than catching the same rubber but more 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.229
 usual ways we century predator 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.619
 chews don't let go that's where we catch 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.810
 natural bait know used 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.250
 underlined light class so as in 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.250
 bait there is no additional burden 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.800
 and just throw it just actually 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.510
 long casts are not very necessary 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.239
 put a plastic worm to under 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.800
 reed wall or closer to one of 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.739
 very characteristic for a g'raha on 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.629
 floating islands 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.239
 after that we start very slow 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.820
 wiring with slight twitching and 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.250
 periodic pauses and very 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.280
 carefully monitor their feelings 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.290
 how tactile so visual 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.590
 try not to lose sight of the outgoing 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.600
 water cord bite is usually very gentle 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.240
 this or light touch 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.090
 transferred to the rod or just 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.330
 slip the cord a little to the side very 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.670
 it is important not to cross immediately do a pause 2 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.880
 4 seconds during this time predator 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.390
 shifts the worm more comfortably and only 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.130
 after that it snaps short 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.310
 Special shaped hook usually securely 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.080
 catches the fish at the edge of the jaw by the way if 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.970
