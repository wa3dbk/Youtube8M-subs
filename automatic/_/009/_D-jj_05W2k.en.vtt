00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.039
 I said people on the channel a little above all 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.240
 In this video all three talk about 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.630
 couple your loudspeaker with your mode 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.840
 would be using as an example this 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:32.689
 handsome 700 watt rms subwoofer 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.689
 combines double and four hours 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.100
 you can see that adult coil is 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.030
 we will be doing a drawing and not 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.449
 computer 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.660
 for you to understand better now 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:53.769
 I'll have an example here on the computer 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:56.949
 This is our module here. I bought it. 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.530
 that the symbols to mark which positive 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.839
 negative but here I just as an example I 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.519
 I did not even look at which one has negative because I 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.560
 I'm just going to explain even you're going to look at that 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.590
 will be very marked there in your height 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.720
 positive negative speaker 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.460
 Let's make the first type of connection. 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.490
 first button that specifies the 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:22.229
 speaker that he is a loudspeaker 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:26.759
 of 700 watts rms and four plus four 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:31.810
 what does this mean 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:39.759
 it means that he is an author of 700 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:42.670
 watts rms dual adult coil each 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:48.820
 this coil has 350 watts ie that 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 It's 350 watts at 4 o'clock and it 's 4 o'clock I'm 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:57.640
 and leaves me with two options or he 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.450
 parallel leaving a result here 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.840
 in 2h series eye apps resulted in 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.840
 eight 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:14.100
 in the case here in parallel would be the 700 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.790
 watts rms at 2h 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:25.940
 and if it were to the contrary it would be if it were 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:31.080
 in the case in series would be 350 oab / ms in 8 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.840
 now it's time we'll call 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.670
 here for example stay here in case 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.830
 get a line and I'll do the negative 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:49.470
 in the case of parallel connection 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:53.190
 You'll call straight from the outside to understand. 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:03:02.220
 better, what are you going to do here? 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:08.900
 straight into the other negative and positive pole 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:14.970
 the same thing will get here will call 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:17.060
 Straight on the positive here turned red but 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.060
 is 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.620
 There you go and call a positive 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.330
 any change or up here or here 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.660
 just connect the positive and negative 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.490
 sd module that the connection scheme is in 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:40.750
 which will result in 700 watts 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.750
 rms to two men 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.250
 in the case of serial connection 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:55.340
 good the serial claim is is one is so 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.710
 advanced so if you get here 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.900
 was to try to understand better 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.720
 So you're going to pick up one side and call 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.730
 so the positive on one side of the coil in the 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.520
 the other and will use the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.740
 and negative of negative module 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.980
 here is what is left here and the positive 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.410
 module here this link is going to give 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:24.910
 eight men 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:27.590
 in the case of 350 watts rms to eight men 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.230
 you want more information 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.100
 click on the registration link that is 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:37.960
 our blog is a little about everything there 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:41.840
 have a tutorial also stock photos and images 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.710
 talk about this serial link and 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.480
 parallel integration of the loudspeaker 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.890
 which is very useful for you to marry your 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.400
 module with its loudspeaker and up to 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.400
 next video lesson
