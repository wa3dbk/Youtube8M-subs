struggling<00:03:47.040> with<00:03:47.340> what<00:03:47.730> everybody<00:03:48.269> struggles

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
struggling with what everybody struggles

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.770 
struggling with what everybody struggles
with<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.400> they<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:51.269> they're<00:03:51.390> kind<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
with so they but they're kind of the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.720 
with so they but they're kind of the
grease<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.170> guess<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.130> speak<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.519> they

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
grease I guess so to speak that they

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.830 
grease I guess so to speak that they
keep<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.060> thing

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
keep the thing

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.780 
keep the thing
and<00:03:55.019> then<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.860> seemed<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.190> me<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.640> was

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
and then it seemed to me that it was

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.410 
and then it seemed to me that it was
built<00:03:57.360> on<00:03:57.629> or<00:03:58.140> it's<00:03:58.610> how<00:03:59.610> should<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.849> say<00:04:00.090> that

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
built on or it's how should I say that

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.350 
built on or it's how should I say that
fabric<00:04:01.379> on<00:04:01.530> which<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.950> goes<00:04:02.129> are<00:04:02.459> these<00:04:02.610> SRS

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
fabric on which it goes are these SRS

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.229 
fabric on which it goes are these SRS
tell<00:04:04.140> us<00:04:04.290> about<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.650> SR<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.099> seems<00:04:05.400> like<00:04:05.610> the

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
tell us about the SR it seems like the

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.690 
tell us about the SR it seems like the
an<00:04:06.390> SR<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.260> an<00:04:07.440> issue<00:04:07.620> that<00:04:08.099> they<00:04:08.310> have<00:04:08.549> to

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
an SR is an issue that they have to

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.610 
an SR is an issue that they have to
address<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.450> work<00:04:09.750> through<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.379> leads

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
address and work through and that leads

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.500 
address and work through and that leads
them<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.069> next<00:04:11.220> SR<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:11.970> tell<00:04:12.150> us<00:04:12.180> about<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
them to the next SR so tell us about the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.410 
them to the next SR so tell us about the
other<00:04:12.599> right<00:04:13.170> well<00:04:13.410> yes<00:04:14.069> SR<00:04:14.849> was<00:04:15.030> just<00:04:15.269> a

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
other right well yes SR was just a

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.449 
other right well yes SR was just a
something<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.139> coined<00:04:16.440> from<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.979> twist<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.370> the

survival reactions or a ttle reaction
what's<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:53.310> like<00:04:53.460> beer<00:04:54.289> so<00:04:55.520> what<00:04:56.520> we

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
what's that it's like beer so what we

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.400 
what's that it's like beer so what we
know<00:04:56.850> is<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.750> order<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:58.050> get<00:04:58.260> the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
know is that in order to get the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.339 
know is that in order to get the
technical<00:04:58.770> skill<00:04:59.250> skills<00:05:00.150> together<00:05:00.720> for<00:05:01.320> a

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
technical skill skills together for a

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.710 
technical skill skills together for a
writer<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.700> big<00:05:02.880> battle<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.419> just

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
writer that the the big battle is just

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.390 
writer that the the big battle is just
battling<00:05:04.440> those<00:05:04.620> survival<00:05:05.010> reactions

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
battling those survival reactions

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.390 
battling those survival reactions
they're<00:05:05.610> srs<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:07.740> these<00:05:07.889> guys<00:05:08.099> yes

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
they're srs and that so these guys yes

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.980 
they're srs and that so these guys yes
that's<00:05:08.669> exactly<00:05:09.150> what<00:05:09.300> they<00:05:09.450> do<00:05:09.510> you<00:05:09.870> know

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
that's exactly what they do you know

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.960 
that's exactly what they do you know
they<00:05:10.169> they<00:05:10.620> recognize<00:05:11.160> those<00:05:11.430> things<00:05:11.760> and

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
they they recognize those things and

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.180 
they they recognize those things and
then<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.840> film<00:05:13.050> goes<00:05:13.169> along<00:05:13.530> as<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.979> book

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
then the film goes along as the book

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.120 
then the film goes along as the book
does<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:15.000> put<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.780> technical<00:05:16.289> point<00:05:16.440> in<00:05:16.710> that

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
does to put the technical point in that

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.490 
does to put the technical point in that
will<00:05:17.310> resolve<00:05:17.580> that<00:05:17.820> situation<00:05:17.880> and<00:05:18.690> most

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
will resolve that situation and most

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.080 
will resolve that situation and most
often<00:05:19.710> we<00:05:19.950> show<00:05:20.160> what<00:05:20.520> happens<00:05:20.820> when<00:05:20.880> it's

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
often we show what happens when it's

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.640 
often we show what happens when it's
done<00:05:21.270> right<00:05:21.330> what<00:05:21.870> happens<00:05:22.200> when<00:05:22.349> it's<00:05:22.470> done

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
done right what happens when it's done

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.610 
done right what happens when it's done
wrong<00:05:22.950> and<00:05:23.160> so<00:05:24.090> we've<00:05:24.240> got<00:05:24.570> a<00:05:24.599> nice<00:05:24.810> balance<00:05:25.470> in

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
wrong and so we've got a nice balance in

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.170 
wrong and so we've got a nice balance in
there<00:05:25.740> I<00:05:25.770> think<00:05:25.860> on<00:05:26.220> on<00:05:26.789> each<00:05:26.970> of<00:05:27.090> the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
there I think on on each of the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.480 
there I think on on each of the
technical<00:05:27.599> skills<00:05:27.870> that<00:05:28.080> we<00:05:28.590> used<00:05:29.099> for<00:05:29.370> the

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
technical skills that we used for the

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.529 
technical skills that we used for the
for<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.210> DVD

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
for the DVD

world I don't know but we know that what
we've<00:05:59.940> taught<00:06:00.210> has<00:06:00.599> made<00:06:01.320> a<00:06:01.349> massive

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
we've taught has made a massive

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.620 
we've taught has made a massive
difference<00:06:01.979> with<00:06:02.490> every<00:06:02.849> single<00:06:03.000> skill<00:06:03.330> level

writer that exists

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.060 
writer that exists
and<00:06:05.440> it's<00:06:05.920> to<00:06:06.910> not<00:06:07.210> put<00:06:07.660> these<00:06:07.870> these<00:06:08.320> these

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
and it's to not put these these these

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.490 
and it's to not put these these these
concepts<00:06:09.610> into<00:06:10.090> images<00:06:10.690> that<00:06:11.320> illustrate

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
concepts into images that illustrate

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.280 
concepts into images that illustrate
those<00:06:12.220> points<00:06:12.730> yeah<00:06:13.240> well<00:06:13.480> the<00:06:13.630> other<00:06:13.660> concept

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
those points yeah well the other concept

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.110 
those points yeah well the other concept
the<00:06:14.380> idea<00:06:14.740> was<00:06:15.040> to<00:06:15.070> take<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.610> words<00:06:15.790> off<00:06:15.970> the

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
the idea was to take the words off the

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.740 
the idea was to take the words off the
page<00:06:16.360> and<00:06:16.630> and<00:06:17.500> create<00:06:18.430> that<00:06:18.550> bridge<00:06:18.910> over<00:06:19.450> to

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
page and and create that bridge over to

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.210 
page and and create that bridge over to
something<00:06:20.200> you<00:06:20.410> could<00:06:20.590> see<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.070> that's

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
something you could see and that's

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.690 
something you could see and that's
exactly<00:06:21.550> why<00:06:21.970> why<00:06:22.570> the<00:06:22.630> video<00:06:23.170> is<00:06:23.710> that<00:06:24.100> we<00:06:24.280> can

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
exactly why why the video is that we can

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.460 
exactly why why the video is that we can
see<00:06:24.970> these<00:06:25.150> things<00:06:25.390> because<00:06:25.780> not<00:06:25.990> everybody

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
see these things because not everybody

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.470 
see these things because not everybody
gets<00:06:26.680> it<00:06:26.830> off<00:06:26.980> the<00:06:27.130> words<00:06:27.340> and<00:06:27.700> that's<00:06:28.270> what

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
gets it off the words and that's what

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.930 
gets it off the words and that's what
Matt<00:06:28.660> was<00:06:28.690> talking<00:06:28.900> about<00:06:29.200> earlier<00:06:29.560> you<00:06:29.620> know

getting the images and the you know the

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.140 
getting the images and the you know the
concepts<00:06:36.220> out<00:06:36.310> of<00:06:36.430> your<00:06:36.520> mind<00:06:36.730> and<00:06:36.940> putting

concepts out of your mind and putting
them<00:06:37.240> on<00:06:37.360> film<00:06:37.570> is<00:06:37.810> a<00:06:37.920> it's<00:06:38.920> a<00:06:39.040> massive
