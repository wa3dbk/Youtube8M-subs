and we drove away like he never came
back<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.530> we<00:02:26.530> probably<00:02:26.980> went<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.519> three<00:02:28.090> more

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
back on we probably went to three more

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.030 
back on we probably went to three more
places<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.019> car<00:02:29.230> were<00:02:29.380> started<00:02:29.890> and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
places so the car were started and

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.390 
places so the car were started and
stopped<00:02:30.600> three<00:02:31.600> more<00:02:31.840> times<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.650> never<00:02:33.100> any

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
stopped three more times and never any

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.300 
stopped three more times and never any
lights<00:02:33.640> came<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.410> never<00:02:35.410> hesitated<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.040> start

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
lights came on never hesitated to start

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.850 
lights came on never hesitated to start
again<00:02:36.489> or<00:02:36.640> anything<00:02:36.820> so<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.060> just<00:02:37.390> think<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:38.530> was

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860
