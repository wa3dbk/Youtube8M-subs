I<00:00:00.650> think<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.740> worst<00:00:01.949> thing<00:00:02.040> in<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.310> world<00:00:02.340> is

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
I think the worst thing in the world is

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.369 
I think the worst thing in the world is
when<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.600> record<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:05.270> opening<00:00:06.270> video<00:00:06.540> where

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
when you record a opening video where

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.020

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
you open like a pack of cards and your

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.520 
you open like a pack of cards and your
microphone<00:00:12.540> does<00:00:12.719> not<00:00:12.840> work<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.170> first<00:00:13.380> time

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and you have to do the entire video

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.450 
and you have to do the entire video
again<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:16.049> that's<00:00:16.230> what<00:00:16.470> happened<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.130> I'm

deep even though I really like it but
it's<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.759> s<00:01:50.939> perp<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.750> put

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
them back packs you can see the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.020 
them back packs you can see the
reflection<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.899> things<00:01:55.259> inside<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.490> and

hey<00:02:03.710> in<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> reflection<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.899> sure<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.200> like

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
hey in the reflection so sure I like

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.800 
hey in the reflection so sure I like
that<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> lot<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.610> Esper's<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.479> super

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
that a lot I think Esper's like super
