different<00:01:09.940> aspects<00:01:10.390> of<00:01:10.570> what<00:01:10.780> goes<00:01:10.960> on<00:01:11.170> here

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
different aspects of what goes on here

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.260 
different aspects of what goes on here
right<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:11.979> that<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.220> retail<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:12.940> that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
right is that the retail is that

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.940 
right is that the retail is that
consumer<00:01:13.630> interaction<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.710> u.s.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
consumer interaction this is the u.s.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.700 
consumer interaction this is the u.s.
basically<00:01:15.670> I'm<00:01:16.450> thinking<00:01:16.869> three<00:01:17.080> weeks<00:01:17.290> right

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
basically I'm thinking three weeks right

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.490 
basically I'm thinking three weeks right
one<00:01:18.220> week<00:01:18.430> maybe<00:01:18.640> three<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.119> four<00:01:19.330> days<00:01:19.510> would

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
one week maybe three to four days would

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.400 
one week maybe three to four days would
be<00:01:20.710> each<00:01:21.750> person<00:01:22.750> would<00:01:22.900> be<00:01:23.020> in<00:01:23.050> a<00:01:23.170> different

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
be each person would be in a different

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.380 
be each person would be in a different
area<00:01:23.800> so<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.550> know<00:01:24.820> somebody<00:01:25.119> will<00:01:25.300> be
