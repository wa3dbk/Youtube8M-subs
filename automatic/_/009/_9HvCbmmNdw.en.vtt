space<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.119> piece<00:01:56.389> of<00:01:56.569> shit<00:01:56.889> so<00:01:57.889> I<00:01:58.279> think<00:01:58.459> I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
space is a piece of shit so I think I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.279 
space is a piece of shit so I think I
would<00:01:58.759> be<00:01:58.969> good<00:01:59.149> with<00:01:59.329> just<00:01:59.569> my<00:01:59.779> barbarians

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
would be good with just my barbarians

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.690 
would be good with just my barbarians
and<00:02:00.409> archers<00:02:00.499> honestly<00:02:01.039> I<00:02:01.099> get<00:02:01.219> three-star

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
and archers honestly I get three-star

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.659 
and archers honestly I get three-star
this<00:02:01.819> base<00:02:01.999> I'm<00:02:02.990> just<00:02:03.259> kidding<00:02:03.499> and<00:02:04.310> let's<00:02:04.520> go

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:04.669 
this base I'm just kidding and let's go

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:07.059 
this base I'm just kidding and let's go
check<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.090> other<00:02:05.119> guy<00:02:05.389> out<00:02:05.649> so<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:06.919> guy

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
check the other guy out so this guy

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.469 
check the other guy out so this guy
actually<00:02:07.310> stole<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.729> bunch<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.030> my<00:02:08.149> resources

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
actually stole a bunch of my resources

actually stole a bunch of my resources
oh<00:02:08.929> yeah<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:09.709> one's<00:02:09.890> definitely<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.310> bit

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
oh yeah this one's definitely a bit

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.339 
oh yeah this one's definitely a bit
tougher<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.939> think<00:02:11.659> we'll<00:02:11.810> be<00:02:11.930> able<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.110> get<00:02:12.200> to

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
tougher I think we'll be able to get to

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.720 
tougher I think we'll be able to get to
those<00:02:12.470> two<00:02:12.680> gold<00:02:12.920> storages<00:02:13.340> pretty<00:02:13.549> easily

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
those two gold storages pretty easily

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.730 
those two gold storages pretty easily
and<00:02:14.090> also<00:02:14.329> the<00:02:14.450> dark<00:02:14.629> elixir<00:02:14.840> storage

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
and also the dark elixir storage

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.900 
and also the dark elixir storage
so<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:15.980> one<00:02:16.130> will<00:02:16.190> be<00:02:16.250> pretty<00:02:16.490> easy<00:02:16.580> to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
so this one will be pretty easy to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.050 
so this one will be pretty easy to
revenge<00:02:18.190> all<00:02:19.190> right<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.460> let's<00:02:19.610> watch<00:02:19.760> these

thousand gold 245,000 elixir so the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.640 
thousand gold 245,000 elixir so the
problem<00:03:45.650> was<00:03:45.830> that<00:03:46.450> not<00:03:47.450> only<00:03:47.690> was<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.260> not<00:03:48.410> able

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
problem was that not only was I not able

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.200 
problem was that not only was I not able
to<00:03:48.890> collect<00:03:49.190> my<00:03:49.340> resources<00:03:49.940> from<00:03:50.090> my

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
to collect my resources from my

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.110 
to collect my resources from my
collectors<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.960> had<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.620> ton<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:51.950> gold<00:03:52.700> in<00:03:52.970> my

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
collectors I had a ton of gold in my

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.300 
collectors I had a ton of gold in my
gold<00:03:53.360> storages<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.990> think<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.260> had<00:03:54.410> like<00:03:54.740> four

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
gold storages I think I had like four

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.570 
gold storages I think I had like four
or<00:03:55.849> something<00:03:56.209> so<00:03:57.080> they<00:03:57.260> could<00:03:57.410> steal<00:03:57.590> 400,000

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
or something so they could steal 400,000

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.059 
or something so they could steal 400,000
gold<00:03:58.760> for<00:03:59.000> me<00:03:59.120> just<00:03:59.480> for<00:03:59.599> my<00:03:59.720> sword<00:04:00.020> is<00:04:00.230> low<00:04:00.500> so

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
gold for me just for my sword is low so

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.610 
gold for me just for my sword is low so
my<00:04:01.250> base<00:04:01.459> was<00:04:01.670> definitely<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.239> target<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:03.290> he's

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
my base was definitely a target and he's

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.860 
my base was definitely a target and he's
going<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.800> take<00:04:04.010> out<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.400> Town<00:04:04.670> Hall<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.270> then

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
going to take out the Town Hall and then

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.180 
going to take out the Town Hall and then
I<00:04:05.900> think<00:04:06.140> he's<00:04:06.290> going<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.530> start<00:04:06.770> his<00:04:06.860> attack

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
I think he's going to start his attack

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.580 
I think he's going to start his attack
on<00:04:07.459> my<00:04:07.700> collectors<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.810> he<00:04:09.140> was<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.380> first

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
on my collectors and he was the first

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.040 
on my collectors and he was the first
one<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:09.950> hit<00:04:10.040> my<00:04:10.190> collectors<00:04:10.670> so<00:04:11.510> he's<00:04:11.840> going

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
one to hit my collectors so he's going

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.660 
one to hit my collectors so he's going
to<00:04:12.110> be<00:04:12.230> using<00:04:12.349> two<00:04:12.769> fingers<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.340> looks<00:04:13.519> like

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
to be using two fingers it looks like

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.710 
to be using two fingers it looks like
he's<00:04:13.880> going<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.060> take<00:04:14.239> them<00:04:14.420> out<00:04:14.510> really

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
he's going to take them out really

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.409 
he's going to take them out really
quickly<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.400> top<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:16.760> off<00:04:16.820> he<00:04:17.030> sends<00:04:17.329> his

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
quickly and to top that off he sends his

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.909 
quickly and to top that off he sends his
heroes<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.989> get<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.260> this<00:04:18.380> other<00:04:18.590> gold

one<00:04:55.610> nope<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:57.430> damn<00:04:58.430> it<00:04:58.460> they<00:04:58.700> both<00:04:58.850> have

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
one nope and damn it they both have

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.029 
one nope and damn it they both have
shields<00:04:59.450> so<00:04:59.660> that's<00:05:00.380> what<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.560> was<00:05:00.740> afraid<00:05:00.830> of

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
shields so that's what I was afraid of

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.550 
shields so that's what I was afraid of
but<00:05:02.000> we<00:05:02.630> might<00:05:02.810> as<00:05:02.930> well<00:05:02.960> just<00:05:03.200> go<00:05:03.350> ahead<00:05:03.410> and

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
but we might as well just go ahead and

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.920 
but we might as well just go ahead and
try<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.800> revenge<00:05:03.979> somebody<00:05:04.280> else<00:05:04.930> two

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
try and revenge somebody else two

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.750

hundred<00:05:06.200> forty<00:05:06.350> thousand<00:05:06.890> that's<00:05:07.160> not<00:05:07.610> worth

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
hundred forty thousand that's not worth

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.540 
hundred forty thousand that's not worth
it<00:05:08.140> so<00:05:09.140> that's<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.650> sucks<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:10.160> really<00:05:10.370> wanted

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550

it so that's that sucks I really wanted
to<00:05:10.640> revenge<00:05:10.850> then<00:05:11.150> maybe<00:05:11.330> we<00:05:11.450> can<00:05:11.600> in<00:05:11.780> another

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
to revenge then maybe we can in another

to revenge then maybe we can in another
video<00:05:12.350> but<00:05:13.300> definitely<00:05:14.300> not<00:05:14.419> going<00:05:14.539> to<00:05:14.600> be

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
video but definitely not going to be

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.270 
video but definitely not going to be
able<00:05:14.750> to<00:05:14.900> today<00:05:15.260> cuz<00:05:15.530> I'm<00:05:15.740> definitely<00:05:16.190> not

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
able to today cuz I'm definitely not

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.219 
able to today cuz I'm definitely not
gonna<00:05:16.430> wait<00:05:16.640> for<00:05:17.210> them<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.600> break<00:05:18.020> their

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
gonna wait for them to break their

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.900 
gonna wait for them to break their
shield<00:05:18.440> cuz<00:05:18.680> I<00:05:18.740> have<00:05:18.860> no<00:05:19.100> idea<00:05:19.430> when<00:05:19.610> they<00:05:19.700> will

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
shield cuz I have no idea when they will

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.790 
shield cuz I have no idea when they will
if<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:20.960> said<00:05:21.110> that<00:05:21.229> they<00:05:21.320> were<00:05:21.380> all<00:05:21.560> in<00:05:21.590> line

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
if it said that they were all in line

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.980 
if it said that they were all in line
then<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.370> might<00:05:22.970> possibly<00:05:23.240> wait<00:05:23.720> for<00:05:23.870> them<00:05:23.960> to

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
then I might possibly wait for them to

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.840 
then I might possibly wait for them to
get<00:05:24.200> off<00:05:24.320> but<00:05:24.620> if<00:05:25.160> they<00:05:25.310> have<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.460> shield<00:05:25.760> you

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
get off but if they have a shield you

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.500 
get off but if they have a shield you
have<00:05:25.970> no<00:05:26.090> idea

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
have no idea

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.440 
have no idea

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
a bunch of trophies and it looks like

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.190 
a bunch of trophies and it looks like
the<00:06:43.180> pack<00:06:43.360> and<00:06:43.540> the<00:06:43.600> Queen<00:06:43.780> are<00:06:43.900> going<00:06:44.020> to<00:06:44.080> make

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
it to the dark elixir storage and maybe

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.150 
it to the dark elixir storage and maybe
even<00:06:46.660> to<00:06:46.870> that<00:06:47.080> with<00:06:47.290> that<00:06:47.530> third<00:06:47.860> gold

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.410 
even to that with that third gold
storage<00:06:48.460> that'd<00:06:48.700> be<00:06:48.820> awesome

storage that'd be awesome

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.000 
storage that'd be awesome

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
but it looks like our troops are

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.730 
but it looks like our troops are
starting<00:06:51.370> to<00:06:51.490> die<00:06:51.640> out<00:06:51.850> so<00:06:52.410> come<00:06:53.410> on<00:06:53.500> Queen

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
take out the archer tower here we go I

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.280 
take out the archer tower here we go I
like<00:06:56.350> cannon<00:06:57.480> all<00:06:58.480> right<00:06:58.690> so<00:06:58.870> that's<00:06:58.990> good

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
like cannon all right so that's good

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.690 
like cannon all right so that's good
okay<00:06:59.860> get<00:07:00.130> the<00:07:00.220> gold<00:07:00.400> storage<00:07:01.590> yes<00:07:02.590> she<00:07:03.490> picked

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
okay get the gold storage yes she picked

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.920 
okay get the gold storage yes she picked
the<00:07:03.820> right<00:07:03.850> one<00:07:04.090> because<00:07:04.420> the<00:07:04.570> elixir<00:07:04.750> storage

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
the right one because the elixir storage

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.500 
the right one because the elixir storage
is<00:07:05.290> empty<00:07:05.590> so<00:07:05.860> I'd<00:07:06.190> be<00:07:06.700> mad<00:07:06.850> if<00:07:07.000> she<00:07:07.120> targeted

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
is empty so I'd be mad if she targeted

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.320 
is empty so I'd be mad if she targeted
that<00:07:07.600> one<00:07:07.780> first<00:07:07.960> so<00:07:08.860> we're<00:07:09.100> at<00:07:09.190> 72%<00:07:09.820> let's
