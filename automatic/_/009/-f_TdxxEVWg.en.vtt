00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
green there I kept the original color

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.790 
green there I kept the original color
there<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> actual<00:00:44.790> picture<00:00:45.800> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
there because in the actual picture it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.960 
there because in the actual picture it
looks<00:00:47.190> kind<00:00:48.060> of<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.690> color<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.970> there

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
looks kind of to be that color so there

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.880 
looks kind of to be that color so there
were<00:00:51.060> parts<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.020> never<00:00:52.200> really<00:00:52.530> see

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
were parts that you never really see

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
were parts that you never really see
pictures<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.880> don't<00:00:54.060> know<00:00:54.210> exactly

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
pictures of so you don't know exactly

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
pictures of so you don't know exactly
what<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.590> colorings<00:00:56.070> supposed<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> look<00:00:56.670> like

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
what the colorings supposed to look like

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.900 
what the colorings supposed to look like
like<00:00:57.090> down<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.330> I<00:00:57.900> just<00:00:58.560> kind<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> improvised

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
like down here I just kind of improvised

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.140 
like down here I just kind of improvised
and<00:01:00.620> made<00:01:01.620> there's<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.070> little<00:01:02.280> dig<00:01:02.580> divots

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
and made there's like little dig divots

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.560 
and made there's like little dig divots
and<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.720> colored<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.470> black<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:06.030> said<00:01:06.270> it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and I colored them black so as I said it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
and I colored them black so as I said it
does<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:07.050> kind<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.410> bit<00:01:07.590> better<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.950> person

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
does look kind of a bit better in person

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.270 
does look kind of a bit better in person
but<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.550> doesn't<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:08.940> matter<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:10.280> that's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
but that doesn't really matter so that's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.620 
but that doesn't really matter so that's
kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.880> looks<00:01:11.910> like<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> pop

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
kind of what it looks like when you pop

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.720 
kind of what it looks like when you pop
them<00:01:12.780> open<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.380> bend<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:14.040> green<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.490> there

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
darker green which I just used a I just

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.700 
darker green which I just used a I just
used<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> share<00:01:39.390> before<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.380> kind<00:01:40.650> of

sharpie<00:01:41.100> um<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:44.159> call<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:44.970> all<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.150> part

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
sharpie um so I call it all this part

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.690 
sharpie um so I call it all this part
black<00:01:45.600> some<00:01:46.080> green<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.440> there<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
black some green in there I think it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.940 
black some green in there I think it
looks<00:01:47.820> pretty<00:01:47.940> cool<00:01:48.120> I<00:01:48.630> call<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.440> much<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.830> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
looks pretty cool I call it as much as I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.789 
looks pretty cool I call it as much as I
could<00:01:50.010> possibly<00:01:50.130> get<00:01:50.900> as<00:01:51.900> you<00:01:52.080> see<00:01:52.320> there's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
could possibly get as you see there's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.770 
could possibly get as you see there's
some<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.070> lighter<00:01:53.370> lighter<00:01:54.360> green<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
some like lighter lighter green and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.020 
some like lighter lighter green and
stuff<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.320> there<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.710> can't<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
stuff in there I can't get it with the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.630 
stuff in there I can't get it with the
markers<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.900> this<00:01:58.710> was<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.010> best<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.310> could<00:01:59.369> do

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
markers so this was the best I could do

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.330 
markers so this was the best I could do
and<00:01:59.850> here's<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> purple<00:02:00.869> eyes<00:02:01.170> there<00:02:01.590> with

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and here's the purple eyes there with

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.609 
and here's the purple eyes there with
all<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> green<00:02:02.880> diamond<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.140> his<00:02:04.290> head<00:02:04.470> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
all the green diamond on his head and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.859 
all the green diamond on his head and
stuff<00:02:04.830> so<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.430> he's<00:02:05.640> pretty<00:02:05.850> cool<00:02:06.240> that

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
stuff so I think he's pretty cool that

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.209 
stuff so I think he's pretty cool that
he's<00:02:07.170> not<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.599> greatest<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.499> it

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:11.219 
he's not the like the greatest and it

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.070 
he's not the like the greatest and it
looks<00:02:11.760> worse<00:02:12.689> on<00:02:13.019> camera<00:02:13.590> but

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
looks worse on camera but

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.740 
looks worse on camera but
