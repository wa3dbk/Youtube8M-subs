00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
but they scored so we end up stuff in

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.539 
but they scored so we end up stuff in
the<00:01:03.180> run<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.750> 31<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.769> them<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> fourth<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the run on 31 got them to fourth and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.399 
the run on 31 got them to fourth and
inches<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.450> they<00:01:06.540> end<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.840> putting<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> ball

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
inches so they end up putting the ball

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.820 
inches so they end up putting the ball
away<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> offense<00:01:08.369> scored<00:01:08.820> again<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.539 
first quarter I haven't seen that in the
wild<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.229> shoving<00:01:13.710> think<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
wild but shoving think that was a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.030 
wild but shoving think that was a
tight<00:01:14.760> end<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.509> little<00:01:15.840> phone<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.740> we

tight end back to little phone and we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.130 
tight end back to little phone and we
get<00:01:17.220> another<00:01:17.640> sack<00:01:18.060> gets<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> funnel<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
get another sack gets the funnel but the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.859 
get another sack gets the funnel but the
offensive<00:01:19.530> Guam<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:19.890> picks<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:21.030> was

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890
