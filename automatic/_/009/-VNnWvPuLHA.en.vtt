randomized<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.460> bit<00:01:50.579> more<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.119> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
randomized it a little bit more and if I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940 
randomized it a little bit more and if I
had<00:01:51.329> more<00:01:51.450> time<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.140> feel<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> sort<00:01:52.920> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
had more time but I feel this is sort of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.830 
had more time but I feel this is sort of
a<00:01:53.070> nice<00:01:53.340> little<00:01:53.490> thing<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> keep<00:01:54.540> up<00:01:54.720> with

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
a nice little thing just to keep up with

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.149 
a nice little thing just to keep up with
your<00:01:54.960> bracket<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.799> try<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.009> out

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
your bracket if you want to try it out

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.399 
your bracket if you want to try it out
in<00:01:56.189> Minecraft<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.390> basically<00:01:58.110> how<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.350> works

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
in Minecraft so basically how this works

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.289 
in Minecraft so basically how this works
is<00:01:59.840> say<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.860> say<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.880> was<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> game

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
is say this was say this was the game

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.700 
is say this was say this was the game
that<00:02:03.570> you're<00:02:03.810> following<00:02:04.049> your<00:02:04.290> March<00:02:04.469> Madness

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that you're following your March Madness

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.490 
that you're following your March Madness
and<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.610> team<00:02:05.880> won<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> would<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.290> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
and this team won what you would do is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.010 
and this team won what you would do is
you'd<00:02:07.649> step<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.099> pressure<00:02:08.310> plate<00:02:08.840> as<00:02:09.840> you

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
you'd step on this pressure plate as you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.720 
you'd step on this pressure plate as you
can<00:02:10.140> see<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.830> pig<00:02:11.009> will<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.310> slide<00:02:11.520> up<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
can see the pig will just slide up to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.820 
can see the pig will just slide up to
the<00:02:11.819> next<00:02:12.030> spot<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.900> then<00:02:13.560> say

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the next spot and then say

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.250 
the next spot and then say
this<00:02:14.070> team<00:02:14.280> won<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.790> next<00:02:14.970> game<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.990> guy

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
this team won for the next game this guy

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.170 
this team won for the next game this guy
would<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:16.830> slide<00:02:16.980> up<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
would just slide up to there and you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
would just slide up to there and you
just<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.660> each<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.050> different

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
just do that for each of the different

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.530 
just do that for each of the different
things<00:02:19.380> depending<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.460> how<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.730> actual<00:02:21.210> March

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
things depending on how the actual March

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.650 
things depending on how the actual March
Madness<00:02:21.750> thing<00:02:22.050> went<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:23.210> then<00:02:24.210> moving<00:02:24.540> on

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
Madness thing went but then moving on

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.540 
Madness thing went but then moving on
here<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.530> pig<00:02:25.680> would<00:02:25.800> move<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.100> here

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
here you see the pig would move on here

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.490 
here you see the pig would move on here
and<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:27.270> will<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.600> keep<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.900> going<00:02:28.290> until

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
and this will just keep on going until

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.150 
and this will just keep on going until
you<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.490> winner<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.060> actually<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
you have a winner I actually have a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.350 
you have a winner I actually have a
actually<00:02:32.160> use<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.490> bracket<00:02:32.820> I'm<00:02:32.910> currently

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
actually use the bracket I'm currently

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.420 
actually use the bracket I'm currently
playing<00:02:33.720> I've<00:02:34.350> remade<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.040> bracket<00:02:35.340> I'm

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
playing I've remade the bracket I'm

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.540 
playing I've remade the bracket I'm
currently<00:02:36.030> playing<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.770> I'll<00:02:38.130> cut<00:02:38.430> to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
currently playing in this so I'll cut to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.490 
currently playing in this so I'll cut to
that<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.880> little<00:02:39.000> bit<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.810> show<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.050> an

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that in a little bit just to show you an

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.190 
that in a little bit just to show you an
example<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.920> what<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.100> looks<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.580> full

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
example of what this looks like in full

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.020 
example of what this looks like in full
right<00:02:43.200> now<00:02:43.320> there<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.620> no<00:02:43.770> real<00:02:44.130> reset<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:44.940> if

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
right now there is no real reset so if

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.520 
right now there is no real reset so if
you<00:02:45.120> do<00:02:45.270> edit<00:02:45.540> stuff<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.870> will<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.260> reset

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
you do edit stuff you will have to reset

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.220 
you do edit stuff you will have to reset
the<00:02:46.620> map<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:47.040> didn't<00:02:47.730> feel<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.420> it

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
the map I didn't feel it was like it

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.870 
the map I didn't feel it was like it
wasn't<00:02:49.470> gonna<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.650> for<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.280> big<00:02:50.460> of<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.640> thing

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
wasn't gonna be for that big of a thing

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.550 
wasn't gonna be for that big of a thing
I<00:02:51.150> don't<00:02:52.020> if<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.170> sure<00:02:52.290> how<00:02:52.380> many<00:02:52.470> people

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
I don't if you sure how many people

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.800 
I don't if you sure how many people
we've<00:02:52.800> or<00:02:53.010> even<00:02:53.280> used<00:02:53.520> this<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.970> yeah<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.600> didn't

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
we've or even used this so yeah I didn't

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.940 
we've or even used this so yeah I didn't
feel<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.990> it's<00:02:55.110> too<00:02:55.260> necessary<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.830> do<00:02:55.920> that

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
feel it it's too necessary to do that

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.830 
feel it it's too necessary to do that
all<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.370> stuff<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.180> right<00:02:57.360> down<00:02:57.510> here<00:02:57.720> is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
all that stuff but right down here is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.290 
all that stuff but right down here is
how<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.170> works<00:02:58.440> uh<00:02:58.740> those<00:02:59.490> guys<00:02:59.760> up<00:03:00.090> there

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
how it all works uh those guys up there

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.660 
how it all works uh those guys up there
are<00:03:00.540> all<00:03:01.080> actually<00:03:01.560> stacked<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.190> top<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.400> mine

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
are all actually stacked on top of mine

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.640 
are all actually stacked on top of mine
carts<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.240> in<00:03:03.810> between<00:03:04.170> them<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
carts and in between them in the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.650 
carts and in between them in the
minecart<00:03:05.040> are<00:03:05.400> tons<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.790> invisible<00:03:06.240> villagers

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
minecart are tons of invisible villagers

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.290 
minecart are tons of invisible villagers
let<00:03:07.470> me<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.680> say<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.520> took<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.820> long<00:03:09.030> time<00:03:09.060> to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
let me just say this took a long time to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.110 
let me just say this took a long time to
do<00:03:09.770> I<00:03:10.770> don't<00:03:11.100> even<00:03:11.250> want<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.640> mention<00:03:11.970> how<00:03:12.060> long

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
do I don't even want to mention how long

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.850 
do I don't even want to mention how long
it<00:03:12.270> took<00:03:12.420> me<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.870> get<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.230> slides<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.800> stuff

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
it took me to get the slides and stuff

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.890 
it took me to get the slides and stuff
cuz<00:03:14.550> actually<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.970> manually<00:03:15.360> placed<00:03:15.630> them

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
cuz actually the manually placed them

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.660 
cuz actually the manually placed them
and<00:03:16.380> then<00:03:16.500> they<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.830> had<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.040> kill<00:03:17.280> them<00:03:17.459> if<00:03:17.580> they

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
and then they I had to kill them if they

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.710 
and then they I had to kill them if they
weren't<00:03:17.850> right<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.330> I'm<00:03:18.390> gonna<00:03:18.480> toggle

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
weren't right and I'm gonna toggle
