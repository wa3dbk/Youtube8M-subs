00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
think that's a smart move I mean it was

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.599 
think that's a smart move I mean it was
a<00:02:39.819> long<00:02:40.060> time<00:02:40.239> ago<00:02:40.419> but<00:02:40.720> like<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:42.069> kind<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:42.519> like

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
a long time ago but like I kind of like

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.009 
a long time ago but like I kind of like
the<00:02:42.760> competition<00:02:43.359> that<00:02:43.480> they<00:02:43.599> were<00:02:43.660> having

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
the competition that they were having

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.440 
the competition that they were having
you<00:02:44.200> know<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.380> make<00:02:44.680> bread<00:02:44.859> er<00:02:44.889> films<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.489> just

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
you know to make bread er films I just

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.360 
you know to make bread er films I just
think<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.810> Pixar<00:02:47.410> was<00:02:47.620> maybe<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.190> little

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
think that Pixar was maybe a little

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.830 
think that Pixar was maybe a little
better<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:48.819> then<00:02:48.880> they<00:02:49.180> kind<00:02:49.359> of<00:02:49.450> got<00:02:49.569> jealous

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
better and then they kind of got jealous

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.949 
better and then they kind of got jealous
so<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:51.430> yeah<00:02:51.609> finding<00:02:52.389> gyro<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.660> one<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.900> the

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
so but yeah finding gyro is one of the
