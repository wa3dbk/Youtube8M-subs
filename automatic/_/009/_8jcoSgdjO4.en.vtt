00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
it to stick the ceiling but when you do

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.429 
it to stick the ceiling but when you do
that<00:00:28.369> one<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.359> velcro<00:00:29.689> doesn't<00:00:30.140> stick<00:00:30.289> very

that one the velcro doesn't stick very
well<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:30.829> fabric<00:00:31.159> at<00:00:31.279> all<00:00:31.400> and<00:00:31.699> I<00:00:31.880> don't

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
well to the fabric at all and I don't

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.549 
well to the fabric at all and I don't
want<00:00:32.270> to<00:00:32.329> use<00:00:32.449> any<00:00:32.629> kind<00:00:32.809> of<00:00:32.989> extra<00:00:33.260> glue<00:00:33.410> or

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
want to use any kind of extra glue or

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.740 
want to use any kind of extra glue or
adhesive<00:00:33.620> because<00:00:34.160> I<00:00:34.579> was<00:00:35.210> thinking<00:00:35.329> one<00:00:35.629> day

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
adhesive because I was thinking one day

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.990 
adhesive because I was thinking one day
I<00:00:35.780> was<00:00:35.930> going<00:00:36.020> to<00:00:36.110> fix<00:00:36.320> it<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:36.620> -<00:00:37.340> when<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:37.850> do

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
I was going to fix it and - when you do

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.090 
I was going to fix it and - when you do
that<00:00:38.180> all<00:00:38.750> it<00:00:38.960> does<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.320> whole<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.620> visor<00:00:39.800> up

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
that all it does the whole the visor up

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.560 
that all it does the whole the visor up
you<00:00:40.219> can't<00:00:40.430> really<00:00:40.520> actually<00:00:41.149> use<00:00:41.329> it<00:00:41.449> when

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
you can't really actually use it when

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.970 
you can't really actually use it when
you're<00:00:41.690> driving<00:00:41.809> because<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.440> won't<00:00:42.590> hold<00:00:42.739> its

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
you're driving because it won't hold its

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.119 
you're driving because it won't hold its
place<00:00:43.760> or<00:00:44.000> position<00:00:44.320> now<00:00:45.320> my<00:00:45.500> passenger<00:00:45.920> side

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
place or position now my passenger side

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.069 
place or position now my passenger side
works<00:00:46.370> right<00:00:46.640> I<00:00:46.850> mean<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:47.300> is<00:00:47.449> exactly<00:00:47.930> how

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
works right I mean this is exactly how

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.930 
works right I mean this is exactly how
it<00:00:48.230> should<00:00:48.379> work

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.549 

perfect<00:00:52.940> I<00:00:53.059> mean<00:00:53.269> it<00:00:53.420> stays<00:00:53.660> in<00:00:53.809> shape<00:00:53.840> it's

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
perfect I mean it stays in shape it's

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.560 
perfect I mean it stays in shape it's
got<00:00:54.710> friction<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:55.309> holds<00:00:55.609> space<00:00:56.359> and

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
got friction it holds space and

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.099 
got friction it holds space and
everything<00:00:56.929> but<00:00:57.170> uh<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:59.329> just<00:00:59.480> put<00:00:59.780> it<00:00:59.870> up<00:00:59.989> and

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
everything but uh you just put it up and

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.689 
everything but uh you just put it up and
it<00:01:00.170> falls<00:01:00.410> right<00:01:00.500> down<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.160> had<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:01.460> happen

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
anywhere farther in but right where this

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.270 
anywhere farther in but right where this
much<00:01:22.910> thicker<00:01:23.270> part<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.140> visor<00:01:24.560> arm<00:01:25.010> is

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
much thicker part of the visor arm is

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.570 
much thicker part of the visor arm is
you<00:01:26.120> got<00:01:26.300> to<00:01:26.450> stick<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:26.870> just<00:01:27.320> where<00:01:27.710> right

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
you got to stick it just where right

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.300 
you got to stick it just where right
where<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:29.090> starts<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.840> thin<00:01:30.380> out<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.770> go<00:01:31.100> into

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
where it starts to thin out and go into

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.600 
where it starts to thin out and go into
the<00:01:31.820> thinner<00:01:32.720> part<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.470> arm<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.460> got

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
the thinner part of the arm and you got

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.760 
the thinner part of the arm and you got
to<00:01:34.730> stick<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.150> right<00:01:35.330> on<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.200> end<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.500> so

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
to stick it right on the end of that so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.640 
to stick it right on the end of that so
it's<00:01:36.920> just<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.220> little<00:01:37.460> bit<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.790> velcro<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.650> on

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
it's just a little bit of velcro is on

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.460 
it's just a little bit of velcro is on
that<00:01:40.040> transition<00:01:40.580> point<00:01:40.970> on<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.360> visor<00:01:41.540> and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
that transition point on the visor and

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.560 
that transition point on the visor and
then<00:01:42.800> because<00:01:43.400> if<00:01:43.580> you<00:01:43.670> stick<00:01:43.910> it<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:44.120> too<00:01:44.300> far

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
then because if you stick it in too far

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.900 
then because if you stick it in too far
it'll<00:01:45.290> screw<00:01:45.740> up<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:45.950> velcro<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.580> you<00:01:46.670> won't

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
it'll screw up the velcro and you won't

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.430 
it'll screw up the velcro and you won't
be<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.150> push<00:01:47.330> your<00:01:47.480> visor<00:01:47.660> and<00:01:47.840> back<00:01:48.140> all<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
be to push your visor and back all the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.160 
be to push your visor and back all the
way<00:01:48.560> into<00:01:48.710> place<00:01:49.330> so<00:01:50.330> just<00:01:50.660> pull<00:01:50.840> your<00:01:50.990> visor

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170
