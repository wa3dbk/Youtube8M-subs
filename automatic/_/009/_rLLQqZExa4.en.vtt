we pay better in the third set and if we
could<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.770> thought<00:00:44.210> like<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.359> play<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.809> in

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
could have thought like we play that in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.689 
could have thought like we play that in
the<00:00:46.500> certainty<00:00:46.920> could<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.250> been<00:00:47.399> different

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
the certainty could have been different

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.610 
the certainty could have been different
but<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> case<00:00:49.109> today

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
but it was not the case today

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.049 
but it was not the case today
they<00:00:49.980> were<00:00:50.100> better<00:00:50.280> than<00:00:50.519> us<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
they were better than us so it's a I

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.080 
they were better than us so it's a I
could<00:00:54.989> say<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.730> disappointed<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:56.879> we

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
could say the disappointed because we

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.319 
could say the disappointed because we
really<00:00:57.989> wanted<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.859> win<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.100> match<00:00:59.340> but

really wanted to do win this match but

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.569 
really wanted to do win this match but
now<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.679> stay<00:01:01.829> focused<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.399> two

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
now we have to stay focused for the two

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.850 
now we have to stay focused for the two
singles<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.149> sure<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.320> mentioned<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
singles well sure and you mentioned the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.760 
singles well sure and you mentioned the
third<00:01:05.339> set<00:01:05.640> tiebreak<00:01:06.020> if<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.230> had<00:01:07.320> gone<00:01:07.500> your

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
third set tiebreak if it had gone your

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.850 
third set tiebreak if it had gone your
way<00:01:07.800> it<00:01:08.460> got<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.060> close<00:01:09.300> you<00:01:10.020> think<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.500> match

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
way it got so close you think that match

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.130 
way it got so close you think that match
could<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.220> turned<00:01:11.370> around<00:01:11.610> completely<00:01:12.140> yes

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
could have turned around completely yes

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.340 
could have turned around completely yes
this<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:13.980> we<00:01:14.510> we<00:01:15.510> keep<00:01:15.690> in<00:01:15.870> our<00:01:15.990> mind

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this is what we we keep in our mind

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.430 
this is what we we keep in our mind
during<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.770> match<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.760> one<00:01:18.000> break<00:01:18.300> just<00:01:18.660> and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
during the match just one break just and

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.320 
during the match just one break just and
maybe<00:01:20.010> it's<00:01:20.190> one<00:01:20.400> set<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.790> us<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
maybe it's one set for us and then the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.230 
maybe it's one set for us and then the
different<00:01:21.690> match<00:01:22.160> in<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.340> sense<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.880> we

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
