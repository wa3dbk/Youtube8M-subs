to<00:00:23.850> reproduce<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.660> sound<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:26.130> actually

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
to reproduce a sound so it actually

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.160 
to reproduce a sound so it actually
feels<00:00:27.029> like<00:00:27.180> there's<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> sound<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.140> the

the room with the we feel sensitive
system<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:33.899> create<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.890> sound

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
system you can actually create a sound

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.819 
system you can actually create a sound
source<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.000> coming<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.620> front<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> the

Diego<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.750> recording<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.199> did<00:01:04.410> there<00:01:04.650> was

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
Diego the recording I did there was

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.340 
Diego the recording I did there was
twelve<00:01:05.810> microphones<00:01:06.810> with<00:01:07.110> six<00:01:09.140> musicians<00:01:10.140> in

twelve microphones with six musicians in
a<00:01:10.440> single<00:01:10.770> space<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:12.030> project<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.720> meant<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
a single space this project is meant to

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.670 
a single space this project is meant to
reproduce<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.970> virtual<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.510> space<00:01:15.960> virtually

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
reproduce that virtual a space virtually

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.660 
reproduce that virtual a space virtually
and<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:18.560> see<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> room<00:01:19.950> through<00:01:20.370> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and you can see see the room through a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.820 
and you can see see the room through a
window<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> speakers<00:01:22.050> so<00:01:22.800> if<00:01:23.010> you<00:01:23.130> move<00:01:23.370> along

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
window of speakers so if you move along

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.469 
window of speakers so if you move along
in<00:01:25.830> front<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> speakers<00:01:26.580> you'll<00:01:27.180> start

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
in front of speakers you'll start

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
in front of speakers you'll start
hearing<00:01:27.780> different<00:01:28.560> sounds<00:01:28.890> coming<00:01:29.130> in

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
hearing different sounds coming in

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
hearing different sounds coming in
because<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.420> basically<00:01:31.320> change<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> angle

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
because you basically change the angle

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.070 
because you basically change the angle
of<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.220> window<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.390> start<00:01:33.780> seeing

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
of the window and you start seeing

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.240 
of the window and you start seeing
different<00:01:34.410> musicians<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:37.050> is<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> simple

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
different musicians and this is a simple

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
different musicians and this is a simple
application<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.240> field<00:01:39.479> synthesis<00:01:39.930> there's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
application of a field synthesis there's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.810 
application of a field synthesis there's
16<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.580> horizontally<00:01:42.360> arrayed<00:01:43.820> and

has to be individually driven that means

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
has to be individually driven that means

software<00:02:23.400> environment<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:23.970> wrote<00:02:24.209> an<00:02:24.500> external

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
software environment I wrote an external

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.670 
software environment I wrote an external
object<00:02:25.680> called<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.989> does<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.349> way<00:02:28.470> feel

since<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.450> operation<00:02:31.519> this<00:02:32.519> project<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.209> now

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
since this operation this project is now

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.620 
since this operation this project is now
trying<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.800> get<00:02:34.920> ported<00:02:35.280> into<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.970> ecology<00:02:36.599> to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
trying to get ported into the ecology to

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.920 
trying to get ported into the ecology to
starcade<00:02:37.319> virtual<00:02:37.800> reality<00:02:38.220> system<00:02:38.700> and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
starcade virtual reality system and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.960 
starcade virtual reality system and
right<00:02:39.930> now<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.830> summer<00:02:41.040> research<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.760> was

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
right now this the summer research I was

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.500 
right now this the summer research I was
involved<00:02:42.239> was<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:43.340> see<00:02:44.340> how<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.670> wave<00:02:45.300> field

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
involved was to see how the wave field

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.449 
involved was to see how the wave field
synthesis<00:02:45.900> could<00:02:46.170> be<00:02:46.410> imported<00:02:46.890> into<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
synthesis could be imported into the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.460 
synthesis could be imported into the
cave<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.450> one<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.750> problem<00:02:49.049> we<00:02:49.170> have<00:02:49.319> in

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
cave the one of the problem we have in

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.979 
cave the one of the problem we have in
the<00:02:49.560> caves<00:02:49.799> found<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:51.450> room<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.780> very

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
the caves found is the room is very

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.850 
the caves found is the room is very
reflective<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:53.060> reverberant<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:55.170> typical

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
reflective and reverberant so a typical

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.699 
reflective and reverberant so a typical
surround<00:02:56.430> sound<00:02:56.730> system<00:02:57.330> would<00:02:58.140> not<00:02:58.290> work<00:02:58.530> as

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
surround sound system would not work as

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.530 
surround sound system would not work as
well<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.640> reflection<00:02:59.819> Meyer

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
well because of that reflection Meyer

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.199 
well because of that reflection Meyer
Sound<00:03:01.280> showed<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> little<00:03:02.549> interest<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:03.060> this

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
Sound showed a little interest in this

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.150 
Sound showed a little interest in this
project<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:04.230> were<00:03:04.290> working<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.769> getting<00:03:05.010> a

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
project and we were working on getting a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160 
project and we were working on getting a
co-sponsoring<00:03:05.819> ship<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.569> further<00:03:06.810> develop

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
co-sponsoring ship to further develop

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.170 
co-sponsoring ship to further develop
the<00:03:07.319> system<00:03:07.739> with<00:03:07.920> better<00:03:08.340> speakers<00:03:08.970> and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the system with better speakers and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.930 
the system with better speakers and
