time
perhaps<00:03:13.000> halfway<00:03:13.600> up<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:15.430> receptacle<00:03:17.010> then

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
perhaps halfway up the receptacle then

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.890 
perhaps halfway up the receptacle then
we're<00:03:18.130> going<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.310> place<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:19.150> cover<00:03:19.390> on<00:03:19.600> top

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
we're going to place the cover on top

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.960 
we're going to place the cover on top
what<00:03:20.740> we're<00:03:20.830> going<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.010> actually<00:03:21.160> do<00:03:21.580> is<00:03:21.610> to

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
what we're going to actually do is to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.510 
what we're going to actually do is to
turn<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:22.390> upside<00:03:23.230> down<00:03:23.470> before<00:03:23.770> we<00:03:24.010> started

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
turn this upside down before we started

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.810 
turn this upside down before we started
the<00:03:25.420> reason<00:03:25.810> for<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.050> being<00:03:26.350> sometimes<00:03:26.820> the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
the reason for that being sometimes the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.060 
the reason for that being sometimes the
largest<00:03:28.300> seeds<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.230> tendency<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.950> get

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
largest seeds have a tendency to get

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.699 
largest seeds have a tendency to get
trapped<00:03:30.370> between<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.790> blade<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:32.290> bottom

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
trapped between the blade and the bottom

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.820 
trapped between the blade and the bottom
of<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.400> spice<00:03:33.880> grinder<00:03:34.090> receptacle<00:03:35.019> this

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
of the spice grinder receptacle this

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.430 
of the spice grinder receptacle this
prevents<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.820> from<00:03:36.880> happening<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.870> jamming

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
prevents that from happening and jamming

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.620 
prevents that from happening and jamming
the<00:03:38.530> blade<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:39.640> we<00:03:39.790> start<00:03:40.090> off<00:03:40.239> from<00:03:40.450> this

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
the blade so we start off from this

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.630 
the blade so we start off from this
position<00:03:41.040> depress<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.220> button

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
position depress the button

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.780 
position depress the button
and<00:03:42.940> slowly<00:03:46.830> turn<00:03:47.830> it<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.040> right<00:03:48.220> way<00:03:48.400> up<00:03:48.430> and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
and slowly turn it the right way up and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.810 
and slowly turn it the right way up and
as<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.209> can<00:03:49.330> see<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.950> whole<00:03:51.130> spices<00:03:51.489> are

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
as you can see the whole spices are

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.940 
as you can see the whole spices are
grinding<00:03:52.420> your<00:03:53.410> powder

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950

cocktail shake here which helps the
grind

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.100 

now<00:04:06.550> you<00:04:06.610> can<00:04:06.880> check<00:04:07.090> for<00:04:07.300> find<00:04:07.600> this<00:04:07.840> by
