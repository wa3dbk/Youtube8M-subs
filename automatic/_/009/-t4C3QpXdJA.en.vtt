00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
no more you know we don't to see anymore
we<00:01:37.619> tired<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.100> put<00:01:38.340> some<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.610> Castle<00:01:38.970> put

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
we tired of this put some in Castle put

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.490 
we tired of this put some in Castle put
some<00:01:39.210> multiple<00:01:39.540> fed<00:01:39.720> three<00:01:39.900> black<00:01:40.140> ops<00:01:40.320> one

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
some multiple fed three black ops one

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
some multiple fed three black ops one
black<00:01:40.680> ops<00:01:40.890> did<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> more<00:01:41.340> fit<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.549> anything

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
black ops did not a more fit to anything

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.130 
black ops did not a more fit to anything
but<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.850> it's<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.600> gameplay<00:01:46.110> i

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
but this and it's like the gameplay i

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.660 
but this and it's like the gameplay i
uploaded<00:01:46.860> i<00:01:47.040> think<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.430> something<00:01:47.579> like

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
uploaded i think it was something like

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.749 
uploaded i think it was something like
20<00:01:48.060> 643<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.560> retrospect<00:01:49.920> that's<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.520> just

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
20 643 so in retrospect that's what just

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.760 
20 643 so in retrospect that's what just
over<00:01:51.060> an<00:01:51.149> 8<00:01:51.390> KD<00:01:51.720> or<00:01:51.990> something<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.470> so

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
over an 8 KD or something like that so

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.929 
over an 8 KD or something like that so
in<00:01:52.890> team<00:01:53.040> deathmatch<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
in team deathmatch you would think that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.700 
in team deathmatch you would think that
would<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> fast-paced<00:01:54.810> non-stop<00:01:55.290> action

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
would be a fast-paced non-stop action

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.560 
would be a fast-paced non-stop action
call<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.070> duty<00:01:56.340> ghosts<00:01:56.579> gameplay<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.240> it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
call of duty ghosts gameplay but it

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.870 
call of duty ghosts gameplay but it

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
upload because in my mind I thought that

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.710

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.900 
that maybe that's what people wanted to
see<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.560> it<00:04:39.710> turns<00:04:39.949> out<00:04:40.100> that<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.370> isn't<00:04:40.669> so

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
see and it turns out that it isn't so

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.790
