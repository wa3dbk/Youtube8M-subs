didn't really even think much about it
until<00:03:08.340> like<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:08.820> week<00:03:09.060> when<00:03:09.300> someone's<00:03:09.660> like

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
until like this week when someone's like

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.100 
until like this week when someone's like
you<00:03:10.650> do<00:03:10.860> realize<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.850> you're<00:03:12.390> pulling<00:03:12.930> your

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
hair out and that should hurt right

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.240 
hair out and that should hurt right
because<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.990> wasn't<00:03:16.230> making<00:03:16.710> me<00:03:16.830> any<00:03:16.860> faces

don't know if it's the OCD thing or if

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.980 
don't know if it's the OCD thing or if
it's<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:27.380> thing<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.710> don't<00:03:28.890> know<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.840> it's

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
it's just a thing I don't know but it's

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.650 
it's just a thing I don't know but it's
something<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.710> and<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.970> took<00:03:33.150> me<00:03:33.360> four

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
something that I do and it took me four

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.360 
something that I do and it took me four
minutes<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.230> say<00:03:34.410> nothing<00:03:34.830> this<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.070> why<00:03:35.340> I

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
minutes to say nothing this is why I

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.820 
minutes to say nothing this is why I
don't<00:03:35.670> talk<00:03:35.910> about<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:38.330> know<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.780> lot<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.620> you

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
don't talk about and I know a lot of you

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.710 
don't talk about and I know a lot of you
have<00:03:41.070> questions<00:03:41.640> about<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.090> dissociation

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
have questions about the dissociation

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.580 
have questions about the dissociation
and<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:45.540> reason<00:03:45.870> why<00:03:45.990> I<00:03:46.020> don't<00:03:46.080> make<00:03:46.350> videos

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
and the reason why I don't make videos

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.800 
and the reason why I don't make videos
is<00:03:46.980> just<00:03:47.010> just<00:03:47.550> because<00:03:47.910> they<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.180> don't<00:03:48.420> really

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
is just just because they I don't really

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.750 
is just just because they I don't really
know<00:03:48.990> what<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.230> say<00:03:49.590> about<00:03:50.040> it

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.480 
but when I are talking about you know
red<00:05:13.139> ticks<00:05:13.379> or<00:05:13.590> whatever<00:05:13.830> then<00:05:14.099> they<00:05:14.189> start

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
red ticks or whatever then they start

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.070 
red ticks or whatever then they start
doing<00:05:14.759> it<00:05:14.909> and<00:05:15.090> there's<00:05:15.509> the<00:05:15.569> same<00:05:15.779> thing<00:05:15.990> with

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
doing it and there's the same thing with

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.559 
doing it and there's the same thing with
my<00:05:16.199> old<00:05:16.409> CD<00:05:16.800> for<00:05:17.129> some<00:05:17.310> odd<00:05:17.490> reason<00:05:17.520> if<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:18.389> have

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
my old CD for some odd reason if I have

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.649 
my old CD for some odd reason if I have
to<00:05:18.750> tell<00:05:18.990> someone<00:05:19.500> what<00:05:20.250> my<00:05:20.879> compulsion<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:21.629> I

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
to tell someone what my compulsion is I

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.649 
to tell someone what my compulsion is I
start<00:05:22.259> doing<00:05:22.409> it<00:05:22.740> randomly<00:05:23.389> sometimes<00:05:24.389> I<00:05:24.479> just

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
start doing it randomly sometimes I just

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.379 
start doing it randomly sometimes I just
say<00:05:24.839> that<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.259> just<00:05:25.589> noticed<00:05:26.099> like<00:05:26.550> as<00:05:26.879> I<00:05:27.150> was

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
say that I just noticed like as I was

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.649 
say that I just noticed like as I was
you<00:05:27.810> know<00:05:27.839> thinking<00:05:28.740> even<00:05:29.430> like<00:05:29.580> when<00:05:29.939> I<00:05:29.969> was

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
you know thinking even like when I was

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:33.290 
you know thinking even like when I was
thinking<00:05:30.930> about<00:05:31.289> what<00:05:31.830> I<00:05:31.860> do<00:05:32.039> it<00:05:32.729> just<00:05:32.909> made<00:05:33.150> me

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
thinking about what I do it just made me

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.240 
thinking about what I do it just made me
more<00:05:33.509> pool<00:05:33.839> and<00:05:36.469> that's<00:05:37.469> an<00:05:38.129> interesting

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
more pool and that's an interesting

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.699 
more pool and that's an interesting
thing
