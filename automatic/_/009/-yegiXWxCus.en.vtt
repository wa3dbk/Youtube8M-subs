 under the sea level on the rock 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 Manhattan is the safest place 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.280
 the worlds safekeep the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.079
 Americans in the past 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.329
 years were voices in Germany 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.770
 according to di demanded that the German gold 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.960
 again brought back to German soil 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.489
 should be like the French in the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.310
 70s with their own 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.480
 gold stocks had been made france 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.010

 pick up warships in new york 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.100
 to let 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.290
 The great German gold treasure has one 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.750
 approximate value of 70 billion 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.030
 us dollar and would be in the case of a euro 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.260
 collapses a secure foundation around one 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.260
 to cover new currency 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.740
 The 1500 tons of gold are a product 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.020
 German work and German meat 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.310
 They date back to the postwar period as 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.009
 Germany in the course of the so-called 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.579
 big business miracle 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.579
 generated foreign trade surpluses 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.320
 But now the fed German refuses 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.690
 return property after 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.420
 years of tug of war approved it in 2012 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.729
 a minimum of 300 tons by the year 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.330
 Hand over again in 2020 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.330
 For the year 2013 was planned 50 tons 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.100
 to bring gold back to germany 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.009
 in fact, then only 37 tons arrived 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.440
 32 tons came from paris and 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.440
 Only 5 tons really came from the fed 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.390
 These five tons were 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.650
 On top of that, it was not about goods from Germany 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.800
 original stocks 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.750
 Those were newly cast goods with 2013 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.340
 German politicians denounce the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.380
 control German gold stocks 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.330
 should returned empty-handed from things 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.520
 new york back the fed refuses 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.600
 moreover, until today even a barren 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.610
 list to disclose 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.560
 leading economic experts in the world 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.860
 are united the German gold is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.390
 path 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.370
 Germany will never be gold again 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.530
 see were the ex goldman sachs manager 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.480
 william k and this although the fed is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.710
 never should have touched it 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.780
 was her only for safekeeping 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.250
 entrusted this is a 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.680
 incomparable act of oppression 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.780
 and the provocation and he will of 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.490
 German politicians actively covered 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.860
 a few weeks ago was announced 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.570
 that even the repatriation of the 300th 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.130
 tons of gold by the year 2020 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.830
 should be canceled 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.630
 the pressure from the usa became too big like that 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.550
 that German politics collapsed 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.989
 the cdu politician norbert barthle 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.209
 claimed in front of the media 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.030
 the americans are a good fit for our gold 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.070
 On when does Germany have to be in each 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.750
 affair blind left in front of the usa 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.910
 troop wall are standing 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.350

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.540
 women and men in germany 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.130

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.650
 income from hard work of a whole 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.720

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.160
 even us politicians like that 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.720
 Congressman Ron Paul 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.790
 fundamentally doubt whether in the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.200
 usa stored gold stocks 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.090
 different countries still physical 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.790
 Germany has every one 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.090
 right at least a check 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.100
 to claim your own reserves 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.660
 a sovereign state must be allowed to do that 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.660
 otherwise he is not sovereign 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.930
