00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.770
 very good two kids that just like 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.120
 you are welcome again to the channel and 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.220
 I was back with another gameplay of 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.230
 call of duty cost and is that in the video 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.060
 Yesterday I was really surprised 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.160
 very much the amount of comments that 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.809
 had saying grows explains the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.820
 prestige grew I want to know the 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.339
 prestiges explains as during the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.140
 video I said the prestige icon jumped 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.449
 10 the modern warfare 2 that many people 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.499
 of course you 're curious about it and said 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.569
 good if you want me to explain this 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.699
 tell me in the comments god 80% 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.649
 of the comments and there were quite a few 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.329
 comments were prestigious prestige 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.430
 yes the truth that surprised me quite 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.620
 We will discuss that because I've been 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.989
 reporting a lot amount seen 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.070
 of videos, number of web pages and 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.960
 final well I have reached the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.940
 own conclusion apart from that in my 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.469
 conclusion there is quite certain that already 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.539
 is confirmed but well let's 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.600
 explain it because it 's quite complex 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.999
 mÃ³n kids to explain the system of 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.160
 prestige of acquaintances we have to 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.289
 from a certain point if you have not yet 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.870
 you know in with the only ones we are going to have 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.789
 what is called the squat because it is called 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.190
 our patrol in all with the 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.740
 previous days we had 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.110
 20 100 classes even in whites 2 that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.300
 add a million kinds good 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.070
 we had a class in which 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.020
 we put our gun our 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.370
 primary school in model a 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.040
 we could get on the streaks 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.800
 inside we could accessories the 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.960
 advantages all the same of a whole 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.270
 within the same economic class 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.180
 this is going to change instead of having classes 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.090
 let's have a squat and inside the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.040
 squat we are going to have ten soldiers to 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.620
 that you understand a soldier is like a 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.920
 class but wider 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.720
 in a soldier we are going to put 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.360
 characterize the gender the hair in the 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.770
 I head the ass I know I do not care 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.450
 we will be able to customize all 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.930
 we will be able to customize the advantages 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.720
 the gusts the weapons all within a 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.440
 soldier and remember that we are going to have 10 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.210
 that is to say the 10 soldiers go together they go 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.940
 to be like our squad like 10 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.010
 classes not then good it turns out that 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.690
 according to here says rubin sea as you see 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.380
 we have 10 soldiers what I have 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.900
 explained and puts 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.480
 one level of prestige per soldier what 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.090
 which means that with each soldier we go 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.070
 to be able to make prestige 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.040
 then in total if we make prestige 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.170
 with the 10 soldiers we will have 10 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.490
 prestige levels what do you mean 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.900
 this we are going to see we have 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.970
 our soldiers as you see here every 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.610
 soldier with his business card with his 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.740
 emblem and there you are seeing its level that 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.810
 in the presentation of the multiplayer in 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.550
 the angels were all at a knot level 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.440
 then we are going to be able to take a 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.910
 specific soldier and let's start 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.730
 level up to a certain level 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.530
 until we can pass prestige with 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.360
 a soldier we're only going to be able to go from 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.700
 prestige once until you get to the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.130
 maximum level of that prestige the curious thing 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.170
 is that of course this is quite clear 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.120
 we do not have we can prestige once 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.430
 with each soldier what would be in total 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.290
 10 prestige but of course because when 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.920
 they were playing these people many times 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.380
 appeared the emblem of prestige number 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.790
 10 of modern warfare 2 it turns out that it has 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.640
 I've been reporting about people who went there 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.770
 to the angels and there they said that they 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.080
 when they played 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.190
 on many occasions he jumped like 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.410
 that went up in level 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.900
 level up and continue to assault the 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.000
 Emblem this prestigious number 10 of 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.800
 modern warfare 2 and jumping over and over 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.710
 once they like that in angels the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.480
 game was not 100% finished and each 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.480
 once they finished a game they 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.070
 reset all all the progress 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.840
 they had done and returned in 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.280
 same weapons the lesser advantages than 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.680
 same time I remembered that there everything 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.020
 I was like limited then let's say 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.250
 that in this that leaves the emblem of 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.930
 prestige 10 of modern warfare 2 does not 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.850
 we can do too much because the 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.490
 game is not finished and who knows 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.370
 it could be when leveling up I know that 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.530
 that they are giving you for example if we arrive 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.450
 to emos prestigious all soldiers 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.550
 we have prestigious new soldiers and we 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.920
 the last soldier remains for prestige 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.170
 the number 10 is therefore worth the best in that 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.760
 soldier the prestige is going to be the one of 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.110
 modern warfare 2 the iconic because what 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.090
 What I have not told you is the following 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.160
 it turns out that we with a soldier 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.040
 we will be able to go up in prestige 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.870
 but of course imagine that we all climbed 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.030
 the prestigious soldiers and in all 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.130
 prestige of the ten soldiers appears 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.120
 the same emblem would not be a little 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.130
 monotonous 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.169
 and so that it had gone up in prestige if 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.330
 I will always have the same emblem 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.550
 then to push us to do the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.350
 prestigo with the 10 soldiers have done 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.990
 next we take the first 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.940
 soldier we upload it to the imaginative prestige 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.070
 that give us a certain emblem of 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.479
 prestige then when we go up when 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.370
 let's start to rise in prestige to 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.040
 second soldier let's have another 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.900
 completely different emblem 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.639
 this is the grace with every soldier that 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.919
 let's go up in level let's have 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.449
 prestige but a different eye to 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.250
 give us a different emblem of 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.560
 prestige we have to have prestige 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.120
 already with a soldier before because if it is not 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.770
 like the game does not detect that you 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.100
 have to give another emblem then 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.419
 Of course, this emblem may be that 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.550
 prestige all the soldiers except one 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.380
 we went to prestige the 10 and no longer 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.270
 there is this emblem of prestige 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.490
 different the demon lower 2 the 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.199
 discredit 10 I suppose that in the 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.330
 gamescom have said that it will give a lot 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.789
 more information on this in remembrance 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.830
 that there's going to be another conference there and 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.690
 then we band will give us more 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.970
 information about this but this is the 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.710
 basic idea is worth and is soldiers a level 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.630
 of prestige each ten vestiges in 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.280
 total each time you give prestige one can 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.050
 with another and they are giving us an emblem 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.180
 different thing has lengthened me a lot in 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.400
 this explanation but I think I've 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.930
 vocalized pretty well I've given 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.790
 understand has explained me quite well 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.230
 Ok, it's good, I thank you 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.580
 heard of this explanation because the 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.140
 it has really lengthened me a lot but 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.760
 I suppose you understood 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.440
 perfectly and it's something that a lot 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.730
 people interested him because there he appears 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.410
 the emblem of modern prestige 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.510
 warfare 2 well that's just 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.790
 the explanation so good after 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.590
 I hope this has been enough for you 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.840
 clear the prestige system of core 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.670
 civic insurance that brings out more things 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.990
 the game is not yet let's say 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.610
 finished good to the best yes it is 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.080
 finished but they have not shown it to 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.760
 one hundred percent what is the prestige and 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.200
 all that, as I speak to you, I hope that 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.760
 I it is pretty clear the 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.310
 prestige system as I tell you already 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.350
 which is something that a lot of people had a 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.610
 lot of doubts regarding this so 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.160
 we start as witnesses I hope that you 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.780
 have liked to support the video if so and 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.620
 nothing else see you in the next video 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.620
 goodbye People
