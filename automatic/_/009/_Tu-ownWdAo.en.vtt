00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.089 
reupholstery we like to find old vintage
pieces<00:00:16.939> of<00:00:17.180> furniture<00:00:17.360> and<00:00:18.110> reuse<00:00:18.860> them<00:00:19.070> and

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
pieces of furniture and reuse them and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.970 
pieces of furniture and reuse them and
we<00:00:19.340> make<00:00:19.490> them<00:00:19.580> into<00:00:19.730> something<00:00:20.029> great<00:00:20.980> today

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
we make them into something great today

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.920 
we make them into something great today
we're<00:00:22.369> going<00:00:22.460> to<00:00:22.580> take<00:00:22.820> a<00:00:22.850> great<00:00:23.240> project<00:00:23.510> that

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
we're going to take a great project that

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.960 
we're going to take a great project that
we<00:00:24.050> found<00:00:24.260> down<00:00:24.800> to<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.100> frame<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:25.609> rebuild

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
we found down to the frame and rebuild

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:58.650 
we found down to the frame and rebuild
it<00:00:26.150> from<00:00:26.390> beginning<00:00:26.600> to<00:00:26.930> end

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.170 

I<00:00:58.980> think<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.070> most<00:01:00.220> rewarding<00:01:00.370> thing<00:01:00.880> about

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
I think the most rewarding thing about

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.660 
I think the most rewarding thing about
our<00:01:01.480> process<00:01:02.020> is<00:01:02.380> taking<00:01:02.830> something<00:01:03.070> that<00:01:03.520> was

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
our process is taking something that was

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.610 
our process is taking something that was
probably<00:01:04.180> headed<00:01:04.780> for<00:01:04.840> the<00:01:05.050> doubt<00:01:05.230> and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
probably headed for the doubt and

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.670 
probably headed for the doubt and
turning<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:05.980> into<00:01:06.070> something<00:01:06.250> really<00:01:06.790> great<00:01:06.970> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
turning it into something really great I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.740 
turning it into something really great I
don't<00:01:08.680> think<00:01:08.980> people<00:01:09.070> realize<00:01:09.430> how<00:01:10.000> bad<00:01:10.360> a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
don't think people realize how bad a

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.410 
don't think people realize how bad a
piece<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.080> furniture<00:01:11.260> can<00:01:12.250> be<00:01:12.430> where<00:01:13.210> it's

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
piece of furniture can be where it's

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.020 
piece of furniture can be where it's
still<00:01:13.660> salvageable<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.440> mean<00:01:14.770> as<00:01:15.580> long<00:01:15.730> as<00:01:15.790> the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
still salvageable I mean as long as the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.990 
still salvageable I mean as long as the
frame<00:01:16.300> isn't<00:01:16.810> broken<00:01:17.080> or<00:01:17.680> water<00:01:17.890> damaged<00:01:18.400> then

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
frame isn't broken or water damaged then

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.410 
frame isn't broken or water damaged then
you<00:01:19.510> really<00:01:19.780> can<00:01:20.020> take<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.290> piece<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.560> furniture

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you really can take a piece of furniture

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.080 
you really can take a piece of furniture
make<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.450> complete<00:01:22.900> turnaround<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:27.790> always

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
make a complete turnaround I'm always

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.810 
make a complete turnaround I'm always
really<00:01:28.570> interested<00:01:29.080> in<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.290> history<00:01:29.680> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
really interested in the history of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.340 
really interested in the history of
objects<00:01:30.820> or<00:01:31.000> when<00:01:31.210> we<00:01:31.300> find<00:01:31.570> things<00:01:31.810> we'll

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
objects or when we find things we'll

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.930 
objects or when we find things we'll
open<00:01:32.470> them<00:01:32.680> up<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.160> can<00:01:33.369> tell<00:01:33.550> that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
open them up and you can tell that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.330 
open them up and you can tell that
someone<00:01:34.510> put<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.750> lot<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:35.080> time<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:35.950> energy

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
someone put a lot of time and energy

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.410 
someone put a lot of time and energy
into<00:01:36.520> redoing<00:01:36.940> it<00:01:37.240> 50<00:01:37.900> 60<00:01:38.710> years<00:01:38.890> ago<00:01:39.009> also<00:01:39.970> you

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
into redoing it 50 60 years ago also you

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.090 
into redoing it 50 60 years ago also you
can<00:01:40.600> learn<00:01:40.810> about<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.350> history<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.890> trade

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
can learn about the history in the trade

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.950 
can learn about the history in the trade
you<00:01:42.310> need<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.520> take<00:01:42.640> things<00:01:42.820> apart<00:01:43.030> because

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
you need to take things apart because

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.450 
you need to take things apart because
you'll<00:01:44.290> find<00:01:44.500> different<00:01:44.830> materials<00:01:45.310> that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
you'll find different materials that

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.859 
you'll find different materials that
aren't<00:01:45.700> used<00:01:45.910> anymore

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
aren't used anymore

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.249 
aren't used anymore
maybe<00:01:47.110> vine<00:01:47.410> horsehair<00:01:48.040> we<00:01:48.460> found<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:49.259> found

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
maybe vine horsehair we found a found

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:57.670 
maybe vine horsehair we found a found
all<00:01:50.950> sorts<00:01:51.550> of<00:01:51.610> things<00:01:51.759> there

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.740 

a<00:01:57.710> lot<00:01:58.250> of<00:01:58.370> times<00:01:58.580> when<00:01:58.970> we're<00:01:59.150> taking<00:01:59.270> pieces

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
a lot of times when we're taking pieces

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.890 
a lot of times when we're taking pieces
apart<00:02:00.080> we<00:02:00.320> recognize<00:02:01.190> some<00:02:01.730> inventive<00:02:02.600> ways

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
apart we recognize some inventive ways

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.290 
apart we recognize some inventive ways
that<00:02:03.320> people<00:02:03.470> have<00:02:03.860> put<00:02:04.220> chairs<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.910> sofas

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
that people have put chairs and sofas

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.690 
that people have put chairs and sofas
back<00:02:05.450> together<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.230> we'll<00:02:07.040> take<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.250> little<00:02:07.580> bit

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
back together so we'll take a little bit

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.550 
back together so we'll take a little bit
of<00:02:07.820> their<00:02:07.940> techniques<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.750> fuse<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.530> with

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
of their techniques and fuse it with

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:35.360 
of their techniques and fuse it with
ours<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.280> make<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.790> process<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.210> little<00:02:11.450> easier

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.620 

what<00:02:36.370> Cole<00:02:36.550> string<00:02:36.820> is<00:02:36.910> one<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.210> those<00:02:37.390> really

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
what Cole string is one of those really

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.940 
what Cole string is one of those really
unique<00:02:37.870> traits<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.060> really<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.710> not<00:02:41.710> being

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
unique traits that really is not being

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.920 
unique traits that really is not being
taught<00:02:42.220> anymore<00:02:42.700> it's<00:02:43.000> kind<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.330> dying<00:02:43.570> art

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
taught anymore it's kind of a dying art

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.040 
taught anymore it's kind of a dying art
and<00:02:44.460> it's<00:02:45.460> really<00:02:45.640> hard<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.000> find<00:02:46.240> places<00:02:46.450> to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
and it's really hard to find places to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.250 
and it's really hard to find places to
even<00:02:47.320> learn<00:02:48.280> how<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.550> do<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:49.210> lot<00:02:49.960> of<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.140> is

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
even learn how to do it a lot of it is

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.110 
even learn how to do it a lot of it is
just<00:02:50.380> passed<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.830> between<00:02:51.100> family<00:02:51.790> members

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
just passed on between family members

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:06.440 
just passed on between family members
now<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.650> think<00:02:54.160> some<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.460> that's<00:02:54.580> even<00:02:54.850> lost

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.890 

many<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.810> pollsters<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.620> our<00:03:08.710> area<00:03:09.100> are<00:03:09.900> 70

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
many of the pollsters in our area are 70

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.400 
many of the pollsters in our area are 70
plus<00:03:11.200> men<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.880> probably<00:03:13.870> learned<00:03:14.200> from

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
plus men that probably learned from

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.170 
plus men that probably learned from
their<00:03:14.620> fathers<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.400> tried<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.670> pass<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.000> down

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
their fathers and tried to pass it down

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.300 

we<00:03:40.930> like<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.170> think<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.590> ourselves<00:03:41.739> as

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
we like to think of ourselves as

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.720 
we like to think of ourselves as
furniture<00:03:42.579> matchmakers<00:03:43.530> we<00:03:44.530> find<00:03:45.159> furniture

furniture matchmakers we find furniture

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.179 
furniture matchmakers we find furniture
pieces<00:03:45.969> and<00:03:46.510> we<00:03:47.109> may<00:03:47.260> sit<00:03:47.469> on<00:03:47.590> them<00:03:47.769> for<00:03:48.010> months

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
pieces and we may sit on them for months

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.610 
pieces and we may sit on them for months
before<00:03:48.579> we<00:03:49.000> actually<00:03:49.420> find<00:03:49.689> a<00:03:49.930> piece<00:03:50.439> of

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
before we actually find a piece of

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.039 
before we actually find a piece of
fabric<00:03:50.799> that<00:03:51.010> we<00:03:51.219> think<00:03:51.519> is<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:52.359> perfect<00:03:52.599> fit

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
fabric that we think is the perfect fit

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.470 
fabric that we think is the perfect fit
a<00:03:53.349> lot<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.620> times<00:03:53.859> we'll<00:03:54.250> look<00:03:54.909> for<00:03:55.150> vintage

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
a lot of times we'll look for vintage

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.330 
a lot of times we'll look for vintage
fabrics<00:03:56.099> we've<00:03:57.099> used<00:03:57.340> tablecloths<00:03:58.170> curtains

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
fabrics we've used tablecloths curtains

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.890 
fabrics we've used tablecloths curtains
anything<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.519> has<00:04:00.969> a<00:04:01.000> large<00:04:01.359> quantity<00:04:01.629> of

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
anything that has a large quantity of

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.220 
anything that has a large quantity of
fabric<00:04:02.829> we<00:04:03.010> can<00:04:03.189> use<00:04:03.459> as<00:04:04.299> long<00:04:04.450> as<00:04:04.659> it's<00:04:04.840> thick

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
fabric we can use as long as it's thick

fabric we can use as long as it's thick
enough<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:11.040> think<00:04:12.040> our<00:04:12.220> intent<00:04:12.579> was<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.790> bring

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
enough I think our intent was to bring

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.899 
enough I think our intent was to bring
an<00:04:13.180> updated<00:04:13.599> approach<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.109> upholstery<00:04:14.909> so

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
an updated approach to upholstery so

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.599 
an updated approach to upholstery so
that<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:17.079> really<00:04:17.410> don't<00:04:18.099> have<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.340> do<00:04:18.459> the

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
that you really don't have to do the

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.060 
that you really don't have to do the
same<00:04:18.759> thing<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.359> your<00:04:19.630> grandmother<00:04:20.019> did<00:04:20.259> you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
same thing that your grandmother did you

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.580 
same thing that your grandmother did you
can<00:04:21.250> do<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.489> same<00:04:21.639> process<00:04:21.940> but<00:04:22.479> apply<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:22.990> to

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
can do the same process but apply it to

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.830 
can do the same process but apply it to
yourself<00:04:23.949> in<00:04:24.160> your<00:04:24.310> life<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.789> get<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.479> pieces

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
yourself in your life and get the pieces

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.740 
yourself in your life and get the pieces
that<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.080> really<00:04:26.320> want<00:04:26.530> for<00:04:26.710> your<00:04:26.889> space

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.650 

I<00:04:30.340> really<00:04:31.340> love<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.820> before-and-after

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
I really love the before-and-after

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.040 
I really love the before-and-after
process<00:04:33.260> of<00:04:33.560> upholstery<00:04:34.090> just<00:04:35.090> seeing<00:04:35.450> what<00:04:35.840> a

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
process of upholstery just seeing what a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.810 
process of upholstery just seeing what a
piece<00:04:36.320> can<00:04:36.560> come<00:04:36.740> from<00:04:36.980> and<00:04:37.190> look<00:04:37.280> like<00:04:37.490> in<00:04:37.730> the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
piece can come from and look like in the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.970 
piece can come from and look like in the
end<00:04:38.000> is<00:04:38.270> just<00:04:38.600> really<00:04:38.900> rewarding<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.830> we

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
end is just really rewarding and we

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.480 
end is just really rewarding and we
really<00:04:40.250> enjoy<00:04:40.580> turning<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.510> piece<00:04:41.690> around<00:04:41.960> and

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
really enjoy turning a piece around and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.950 
really enjoy turning a piece around and
making<00:04:43.490> it<00:04:43.700> a<00:04:43.730> completely<00:04:44.330> new<00:04:44.690> piece<00:04:44.930> of
