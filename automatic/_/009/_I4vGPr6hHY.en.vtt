00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.490
 The guys are good 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.379
 so today is the next I'll do 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.650
 two videos one after the other the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.000
 first I'll make a contour one 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.849
 For you, how do we do it? 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.430
 contour on the skin and from there I go 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.529
 Make pressure from here, we can do it. 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.619
 as far as the west is very basic you 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.130
 need a first one we prepare 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.960
 the skin can contour with 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 creamy and liquid products or with 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 powder products 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.850
 I just made the skin and pink 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:47.870
 suntan a little pain and illuminator 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.870
 enough to help the contour 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.500
 I'm going to take a little bit of some 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.680
 lines 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.800
 I 'll pass on a corrective, right? 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.660
 and I go with such a smoking and sic brush 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.199
 the contusion it is interesting because 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.489
 it is made of synthetic bristles then it will not 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.489
 absorb so much product 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.590
 and just to make sure that all kakÃ¡ 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.590
 place 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.380
 will open here right at the forehead and 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.240
 nose 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.590
 ready, now we work with 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.690
 other types of brushes I'm going 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.880
 now use a brush and if with brush 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.590
 Shadow normally he is well reputed then 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.530
 It is interesting to do some 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.930
 markings ok I'll get the burner powder 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.220
 pick up a little bit of product 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.200
 I'm going to take a little of his excess 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.830
 on the hand not to bring had to stay 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.750
 everything here and there I'll start drawing 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.010
 and I have to leave a piece of my nose 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.720
 You see, we belong here. 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.170
 Clarinha, we'll leave and we'll go 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:24.450
 around the side and there goes 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:26.490
 come down more or less here, right? 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.640
 try to get so close to the eyes to 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.650
 not having a problem like lira and if it's a 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.660
 side and the other 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.660
 The interesting thing is to see from the eyebrow 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.959
 up to the nose 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.830
 now it was because the independent market 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.580
 only work for you to have more 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.580
 sense of action which they operate so O 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:58.519
 know where it is then just do this 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.519
 line 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:12.260
 and it is interesting close a bit here 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.260
 face was not going to do the drawings 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.170
 I like doing here 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.260
 and you can do it here too 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.200
 now I'll get a bigger brush 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.800
 in your greater good it is not so and I go 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.800
 start fading here on the cheek 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:01.030
 underneath chin nose even spread 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.269
 for him to be part of you see 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.129
 shadow and not a marked holy line 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:11.170
 now I'll get a brush a little bit 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:13.599
 bigger so I'll get some more 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.730
 amateur and I'm going to see him much more now 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.280
 Light 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:22.350
 here in the corner of the face to give 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.350
 even thinning sensation 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:36.500
 back and to finish from below you can 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:44.860
 take this line of the jaw if you 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.860
 you want and the other side too 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:57.520
 with the same brush we can pick up and 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:00.660
 do the beginning of the sinking here 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.699
 of the same concave for depth 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.680
 and from that we can achieve 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.290
 work the makeup better 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.240
 From here, you can pass the 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.270
 blush and lipstick is ready and if you 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.220
 Do you want to already define some outlines 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:23.740
 the face 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:26.020
 Now I'll get to the numerator with the 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.810
 brush so more side will get and there 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.229
 I'll do what I'm going to apply to him in 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:38.020
 temples to the siege around the 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:40.169
 eyebrow has seems to concentrate 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.990
 point him to take a little lift 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:48.910
 do not do the corner well 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.860
 here if you want the cheese at the 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.880
 phase mouth is happening here 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.389
 the cupid's bow and the other side the same 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.389
 thing 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.259
 and I do not spend much time there 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.919
 area but there goes from each 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:13.710
 the contour you work on is it already 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.509
 will leave the face set then the 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.910
 From this, you can make this mask. 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:21.840
 ready or make up the makeup 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.210
 From this you can see the face too. 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.860
 It changes quite a lot It gets well defined 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.430
 shapes because we play with 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.840
 lights are even so component today one 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.840
 big until the next
