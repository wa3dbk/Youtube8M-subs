 destination this time he left his inheritance and 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.309
 good we do 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.539
 the song is in C major 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.480
 and in this song a constant matures 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:35.760
 I made the right let's go 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:35.760
 making sun and the second highest 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.870
 and we're going to do it here too 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.660
 for example the production of our 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.989
 home 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.989
 Let's help 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.489
 and good 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.440
 in the introduction we have right as 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.440
 you see this that told them the sun and the 2 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.680
 let's find an end 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.769
 and this we practically repeat with 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.990
 every bass we're going to do and the basses 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.990
 of the imprecision are two fifths 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.570
 equal a fifth 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 the least 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.680
 and a drug 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.680
 the introduction they make 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.650
 well we passed in the part of the stanza 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.310
 what do you say 10 my destiny we come to 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.310
 do the same here 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.729
 only the low forever 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.909
 first it's two we're always going to go 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.100
 doing the same thing that they mark a j are 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.460
 those who are going to change the first 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.810
 if we are going to be under the sun 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.600
 then let's go to the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.600
 the eagerness is to make the stanza 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.829
 if it repeats is once again and there 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.629
 we went to the pre-cut part in the 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:24.219
 part of the pre we knew say the notes 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.219
 that are the sun 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.300
 and we make a little what it is if they are 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.300
 skeleton 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.140
 and 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:51.110
 Y 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:55.910
 this chorus here and a little more than 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.290
 same solid solid and the low ones with the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.510
 Cord notes to be sleeping 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.920
 Y 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.730
 If I get sick 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.870
 or yes 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.980
 the bass is yes 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.980
 total the same 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.840
 we went to a funk 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.260
 is the sun 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:28.160
 and a minor 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:33.830
 first not an ornament what is 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.430
 if I summarize the chorus will be like that 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.030
 two 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.030
 yes 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.470
 to 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.890
 Sun 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.200
 but 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.670
 let's be a fan and make the note the sun 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.940
 well that would be the chorus in the second 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.849
 as after a little knowledge to 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.849
 the band arrived a little more 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.129
 if they were like getting a little more I was going like 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.129
 we know 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:34.540
 and well let's move to the part of one 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.540
 in which we make the notes and we do 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.060
 Sun 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:55.010
 4 until we finish 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.450
 and good, we'll go back to the cut and go back to 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.480
 do everything that we had explained and 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:11.550
 for the end we do half of the 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.550
 introduction beginning seeing 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.960
 Y 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.630
 and to finish arpeggios the chord adores 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.000
 my life 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.409
 with its strong 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.800
