to<00:00:28.460> find<00:00:28.489> it<00:00:29.259> we<00:00:30.520> start<00:00:31.520> off<00:00:31.790> we've<00:00:32.149> made<00:00:32.390> for

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
to find it we start off we've made for

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.270 
to find it we start off we've made for
lots<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.800> X<00:00:34.040> for<00:00:34.340> increased<00:00:34.850> rounds<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:36.280> then

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
lots of X for increased rounds and then

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.669 
lots of X for increased rounds and then
crocheted<00:00:37.940> playing<00:00:38.360> for<00:00:38.809> another<00:00:39.079> three

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:39.679 
crocheted playing for another three

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.880 
crocheted playing for another three
rounds<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:40.600> that's<00:00:41.600> finish<00:00:42.050> off<00:00:42.230> we're<00:00:42.739> going

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
rounds and that's finish off we're going

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.369 
rounds and that's finish off we're going
to<00:00:42.949> do<00:00:43.100> some<00:00:43.340> decrease<00:00:43.730> rounds<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:44.840> I'm<00:00:45.230> going

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
to do some decrease rounds and I'm going

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.349 
to do some decrease rounds and I'm going
to<00:00:45.440> show<00:00:45.649> you<00:00:45.679> right<00:00:46.280> now<00:00:46.339> how<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.850> do<00:00:47.179> a

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
to show you right now how to do a

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.650 
to show you right now how to do a
decrease<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:51.260> like<00:00:51.739> with<00:00:52.370> every<00:00:52.820> round<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.359> far

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
decrease so like with every round so far

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.599 
decrease so like with every round so far
we<00:00:53.960> finished<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.440> previous<00:00:54.890> round<00:00:55.160> with<00:00:55.579> a

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
we finished the previous round with a

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.310 
we finished the previous round with a
slip<00:00:55.789> stitch<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:58.420> one<00:00:59.420> chain<00:00:59.719> stitch

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
slip stitch and one chain stitch

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.259 
slip stitch and one chain stitch
so<00:01:01.010> that's<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.370> first<00:01:01.550> stitch<00:01:01.879> of<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.120> round

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
so that's the first stitch of the round

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.100 
so that's the first stitch of the round
same<00:01:03.079> as<00:01:03.199> everywhere

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
same as everywhere

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.710 
same as everywhere
and<00:01:05.710> we're<00:01:05.980> going<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.190> decrease<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:07.150> next

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
and we're going to decrease the next

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.800 
and we're going to decrease the next
stitch<00:01:08.640> we're<00:01:09.640> going<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.850> turn<00:01:10.060> two<00:01:10.240> stitches

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
stitch we're going to turn two stitches

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.860 
stitch we're going to turn two stitches
into<00:01:11.050> one<00:01:11.940> so<00:01:12.940> we're<00:01:13.060> going<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.240> start<00:01:13.480> out<00:01:13.660> as

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
into one so we're going to start out as

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.140 
into one so we're going to start out as
if<00:01:14.050> we<00:01:14.290> were<00:01:14.380> doing<00:01:14.410> a<00:01:14.710> single<00:01:14.890> crochet<00:01:15.280> and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
if we were doing a single crochet and

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.290 
if we were doing a single crochet and
set<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.660> hook<00:01:16.810> through<00:01:17.620> the<00:01:17.740> stitch<00:01:18.270> pull<00:01:19.270> the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
set the hook through the stitch pull the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.170 
set the hook through the stitch pull the
yarn<00:01:19.510> through<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:21.070> this<00:01:21.250> time<00:01:21.550> we're<00:01:21.910> not

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
yarn through but this time we're not

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.500 
yarn through but this time we're not
going<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.200> create<00:01:23.500> these<00:01:23.860> two<00:01:24.160> we're<00:01:25.120> going<00:01:25.330> to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
going to create these two we're going to

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.560 
going to create these two we're going to
add<00:01:25.660> a<00:01:25.960> third<00:01:26.320> later<00:01:26.650> so<00:01:27.010> in<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.340> next<00:01:29.490> stitch

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
add a third later so in the next stitch

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.990 
add a third later so in the next stitch
again<00:01:31.830> pull<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.010> yarn<00:01:33.190> through<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.790> now

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
again pull the yarn through so now

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.359 
again pull the yarn through so now
you've<00:01:34.180> got<00:01:34.210> three<00:01:35.760> loops<00:01:36.760> on<00:01:37.000> York<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:39.130> that's

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
you've got three loops on York so that's

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.490 
you've got three loops on York so that's
your<00:01:39.490> first<00:01:39.700> stitch<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.450> then<00:01:41.200> you've

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
your first stitch and then you've

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.359 
your first stitch and then you've
brought<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.040> yarn<00:01:42.220> through<00:01:42.580> one<00:01:42.970> two<00:01:44.369> single

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
brought the yarn through one two single

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.880 
brought the yarn through one two single
crochets<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.300> then<00:01:47.020> we're<00:01:47.500> going<00:01:47.619> to<00:01:47.650> pull

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
crochets and then we're going to pull

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.170 
crochets and then we're going to pull
the<00:01:48.009> yarn<00:01:48.040> through<00:01:48.490> all<00:01:48.759> three<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:52.119> that's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
the yarn through all three so that's

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.260 
the yarn through all three so that's
just<00:01:52.570> one<00:01:52.810> stitch<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.490> pattern<00:01:54.940> calls

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
just one stitch now the pattern calls

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.310 
just one stitch now the pattern calls
for<00:01:56.670> decreasing<00:01:57.670> every<00:01:58.000> fourth<00:01:58.450> stitch<00:01:58.930> so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
for decreasing every fourth stitch so

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.830 
for decreasing every fourth stitch so
I'm<00:01:59.590> just<00:01:59.979> going<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.220> do<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.550> next<00:02:01.270> three

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840
