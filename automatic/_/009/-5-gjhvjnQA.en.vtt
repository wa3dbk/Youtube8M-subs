the far left is going to be for the
Ethernet<00:01:34.030> cable<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.409> we're<00:01:35.590> going<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.770> start

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
Ethernet cable so we're going to start

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.380 
Ethernet cable so we're going to start

again this is going to go to the one far

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
again this is going to go to the one far
left<00:01:42.220> in<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.520> back

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
left in the back

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.010

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
I just plugs right in and the other side

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.930 
I just plugs right in and the other side
is<00:01:47.260> going<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.440> go<00:01:47.619> to<00:01:47.680> your<00:01:48.310> internet<00:01:48.670> router

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
is going to go to your internet router

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.910 
is going to go to your internet router
and<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:49.540> can<00:01:49.900> go<00:01:50.020> just<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.560> side<00:01:50.740> as

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920
