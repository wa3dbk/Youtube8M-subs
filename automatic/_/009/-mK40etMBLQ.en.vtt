00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
you know at the same time I think it's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.999 
you know at the same time I think it's
deserved<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.930> think<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.320> should<00:01:49.560> happen<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
deserved I think it should happen it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.050 
deserved I think it should happen it
should<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.939> know<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:55.670> sure<00:01:56.670> my<00:01:56.759> opinion

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
should be you know it sure my opinion

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.670 
should be you know it sure my opinion
isn't<00:01:57.240> necessary<00:01:57.659> popular<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.200> community

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
isn't necessary popular with community

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.850 
isn't necessary popular with community
but<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> same<00:02:00.149> time<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.600> believe<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.229> span

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
but at the same time I believe that span

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.350 
but at the same time I believe that span
clicking<00:02:02.189> should<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.460> been<00:02:02.579> removed<00:02:02.939> simply

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
clicking should have been removed simply

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.780 
clicking should have been removed simply

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
just jump into the larger gauge I took a

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.940 
just jump into the larger gauge I took a
bunch<00:06:14.900> of<00:06:14.960> fall<00:06:15.110> damage<00:06:15.380> to<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.500> way<00:06:15.680> you<00:06:15.800> can

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
bunch of fall damage to that way you can

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.570 
bunch of fall damage to that way you can
come<00:06:16.070> in<00:06:16.330> fight<00:06:17.330> me<00:06:17.450> on<00:06:17.630> land<00:06:17.780> but<00:06:17.870> nope<00:06:18.580> first

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
come in fight me on land but nope first

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.960

this<00:06:24.470> disguise<00:06:24.950> the<00:06:25.130> plugin<00:06:25.490> and<00:06:25.610> has<00:06:26.270> an<00:06:26.390> API

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
this disguise the plugin and has an API

this disguise the plugin and has an API
and<00:06:27.020> I<00:06:27.680> say<00:06:28.310> it<00:06:28.460> all<00:06:28.520> up<00:06:28.730> so<00:06:28.760> that<00:06:29.030> way<00:06:29.150> it<00:06:29.240> works

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
and I say it all up so that way it works

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.850 
and I say it all up so that way it works

back<00:07:18.830> to<00:07:19.400> force<00:07:19.700> why<00:07:20.270> would<00:07:20.600> consider<00:07:21.080> it

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.170 
back to force why would consider it

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.420 
back to force why would consider it
would<00:07:21.500> be<00:07:21.620> enough<00:07:21.890> and<00:07:22.070> then<00:07:22.160> you<00:07:22.340> know

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 
would be enough and then you know

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.980 
would be enough and then you know
through<00:07:22.610> dimensions<00:07:22.850> even<00:07:23.330> and<00:07:23.660> nothing

through dimensions even and nothing

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:32.279 
through dimensions even and nothing
works
