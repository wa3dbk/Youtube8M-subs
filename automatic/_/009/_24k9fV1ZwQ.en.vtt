 that is, full of layers 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.800
 but otherwise the advice I would give 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.610

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.750
 sas summarize in three words minimalist 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.030
 clean and casual 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 so the brands guys in the big 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.070

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.479
 the coat for the winter in which one 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 want to snuggle in there is 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.290
 also the most the cnps and especially the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.590
 the bigger the mesh with shapes a 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.360
 atypical really nice 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.369
 libertine libertines it's really a 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.140
 very minimalist style for both 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.880
 men only for women satrap 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.350
 I really like it because it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 there are plaid patterns and the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.490
 colors are really pretty easy to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.649
 wear blue tones of nude 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.210
 exactly what a splendid chance the 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.100
 last gola collection that we have 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.409
 Presented today was born in Finland 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.890
 when did you think I was pleasantly 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.880
 surprised by the collection both on the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.100
 accessories for tablets 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.479
 phones the material is really 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.590
 nice it's leather and it's true that 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.689
 often I create a little leather since 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.090
 it smells strong and there instead it is 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.209
 a very sweet smell that pleasant to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.759
 touch there is a pretty little ones 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.819
 rather discreet printed I have a lot 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.409
 also loved the travel bag 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.940
 I would not even hesitate to put my 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.679
 computer my tablet 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.299
 it's nice to have a big bag 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.790
 but where does it take you, I 'll take you 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.959
 in the mountains because I live and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.000
 I lived for a long time next to 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.579
 mountains and I would take him well sell 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.560
 a chalet by the fireside to savor 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.890
 good little savoyard dishes super in 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.769
 come we take a hat so yes me 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.290
 I really like headgear 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.760
 including hat or hat 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.609
 why because it brings out my 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.930
 eyes and which my hats hats 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.280
 also I like a lot because I 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.480
 find that it gives a feminine touch 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.090
 to an outfit 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.080
 it's very elegant yeah I'm pretty 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.120
 clever head covers 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.530
 for now we are in lyon have you 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.480
 had some good plans to discover the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.790
 city we want a restaurant a bistro and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.980
 a few shops then in restaurant 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.970
 yes I have my favorite restaurant 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.519
 is called Mom's son 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.890
 so it's really an old vibe 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.590
 school back to childhood with the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.810
 decoration the dishes too are 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.120
 revisited it's recipes of moms 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.890
 we for example I was talking to you about 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.069
 beel baby parsnips or rise to the term 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.160
 carambar and the child side this duo 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.160
 until you pay, we put you in 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.810
 big big jar of candy and 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.720
 until the end it continues finally voila 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.490
 it's a real favorite in bistro 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.650
 I like the barracks and tijd 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.260
 especially one called the black 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.680
 forest society it's a mood a 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.360
 Austrian atmosphere a bit hipster 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.580
 held by boys so there is 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.570
 really very good moods must 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.700
 be careful since the hours of 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.260
 often pointed this was armored but 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.640
 if not here he revisits cocktails 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.580
 not found in other bars in 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.230
 cocktails so an address to note then 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.360
 for mosquitoes have to shop 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.430
 I really like going there 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.320
 since already that tomorrow it's a bit of a 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.240
 holy of loft showrooms 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.560
 we were a little at home and also 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.390
 they make the marks 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.460
 I think especially about leonard fear where 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.630
 agnel not found in lyon 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.360
 found in Paris but not in Lyon 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.680
 so it's true that me it's 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.100
 brands I like a lot and it's very 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.540
 nice to be able to find some at home 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.950
 then we hesitated what is a little 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.200
 plus an upscale boutique 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.650
 with marc jacobs from isabel 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.900
 but it's true that it's a 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.190
 room penguin that is worth it at last 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.440
 worth going to see just by 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.880
 curiosity and see the beautiful pieces and 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.160
 especially at the time of private sales 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.880
 or sales have made beautiful 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.790
 business 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.240
 it's noted back to your blog marie 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.030
 anne woods 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.890
 what is your mood mode of the moment then 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.830
 right now I confess I'm a fan 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.930
 to pulse a little addiction the epu in 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.080
 big fluffy mesh confided 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.570
 naked finally I love it I think it's 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.250
 really beautiful pieces that 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.100
 can completely dressed a simple 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.289
 kenny with guardian of the same bout or vice 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.630
 sneaker of choice or find 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.650
 all these inspirations 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.990
 I am very inspired by the blogosphere 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.940
 both in France and at 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.430
 international 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:05.320
 I think of zoÃ© macaroons with baby leaps 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.770
 or created killer here I am inspired too 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.810
 from the paulette flight and flight magazine press 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.190
 the internet sites and also the people that 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.419
 I cross in the street I want them to 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.130
 all their little little paw and that's 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.259
 more and more in vogue what do you think 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.599
 from youtube 2s impossibility for your 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.729
 blog you very much admired youtube 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.539
 I think in particular about life in him if 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.470
 hugh mcfadyen where his daughter caroline them 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.720
 make beautiful videos 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.419
 it presents very well in the 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.419
 beauty products that leads us it's 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.220
 a job that must not be obvious 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.050
 tension goes up to the way of speaking is 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.960
 this a possibility for your blog 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.560
 I thought why not now it's 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.450
 also another way to our work 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.360
 so for now I 'm going to stay at the 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.680
 photo and we will see for the future 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.300
 deal to follow almost last 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.650
 question your news for the next 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.940
 months for the coming months I always 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.070
 my collaborations that are going on 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.990
 with the blog but I would like so much 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.160
 went back to Paris because I did a 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.650
 very nice meeting at the level of 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.320
 blogosphere including the blogger 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.860
 blondy baby here I would like a lot 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:16.250
 see them we redo our days 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.630
 shooting shopping finally here is one 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.419
 found herself it was really a very 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.520
 nice meeting and that's a real 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.410
 blow of heart so here for the 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.680
 next few months I see a lot 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.700
 see her again thanks marie one last word 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.290
 following what happened in 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.820
 news that touched France 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.370
 I would like to say that the way of 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.280
 to dress is 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.930
 a way we have to express ourselves 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.870
 to affirm that one is and I think he 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.610
 must continue to express themselves through this 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.100
 that we wear a certain freedom that we have 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.710
 and here I find that clothes 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.000
 it's our way of expressing ourselves 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.419
 when it's not saying it when it's not 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.419
 do it verbally
