00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.490 

now<00:00:21.220> Lisa<00:00:22.220> one<00:00:22.369> liter<00:00:22.580> is<00:00:22.820> this<00:00:23.000> but<00:00:23.300> what<00:00:24.290> what

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
now Lisa one liter is this but what what

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.359 
now Lisa one liter is this but what what
is<00:00:24.590> it<00:00:24.820> he's<00:00:25.820> got<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.090> same<00:00:26.240> gray<00:00:26.450> course<00:00:27.340> 125

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
is it he's got the same gray course 125

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.790 
is it he's got the same gray course 125
I<00:00:28.550> think<00:00:28.730> 125<00:00:29.300> break<00:00:29.570> off<00:00:29.779> it<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:30.439> that's<00:00:30.650> the

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
I think 125 break off it so that's the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.420 
I think 125 break off it so that's the
equivalent<00:00:30.980> as<00:00:31.369> a<00:00:31.430> 1.6<00:00:32.239> yeah<00:00:32.599> and<00:00:33.100> it's<00:00:34.100> just<00:00:34.280> a

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
equivalent as a 1.6 yeah and it's just a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.660 
equivalent as a 1.6 yeah and it's just a
supercharged<00:00:35.090> 1<00:00:35.720> liter<00:00:36.320> engine<00:00:36.650> which<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:37.040> bub

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
supercharged 1 liter engine which is bub

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.580 
supercharged 1 liter engine which is bub
so<00:00:37.820> in<00:00:38.090> these<00:00:38.270> days<00:00:38.540> of<00:00:38.780> people<00:00:39.290> wanting<00:00:39.500> to

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
so in these days of people wanting to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.250 
so in these days of people wanting to
save<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:39.949> environment<00:00:40.239> leave<00:00:41.239> that<00:00:41.510> just

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
save the environment leave that just

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.439 
save the environment leave that just
think<00:00:42.470> about<00:00:42.650> saving<00:00:42.980> loads<00:00:43.309> of<00:00:43.430> money<00:00:43.550> yeah

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
think about saving loads of money yeah

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.020 
think about saving loads of money yeah
so<00:00:44.660> it's<00:00:44.930> 1.6<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:46.129> it's<00:00:46.220> really<00:00:46.400> one<00:00:46.790> liter

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.550 

what<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.580> think<00:03:09.880> if<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.150> focus<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:11.140> one-liter

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
what you think if I focus is a one-liter

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.410 
what you think if I focus is a one-liter
rather<00:03:11.890> than<00:03:12.130> at<00:03:12.250> one<00:03:12.370> point<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:13.060> do<00:03:15.420> well

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
rather than at one point I do well

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.800 
rather than at one point I do well
basically<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:17.230> is<00:03:17.350> 60<00:03:17.980> miles<00:03:18.160> per<00:03:18.250> gallon

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
basically it is 60 miles per gallon

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.550 
basically it is 60 miles per gallon
thank<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.930> very<00:03:20.110> much

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.470 

it<00:03:23.560> even<00:03:23.950> turns<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.400> even<00:03:24.820> parks<00:03:25.150> itself

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
it even turns it even parks itself

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.690 
it even turns it even parks itself
enough<00:03:26.250> hmm<00:03:27.250> pretty<00:03:28.210> clever

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.830 

amazing

well<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.730> test<00:03:35.970> that's<00:03:36.180> happening

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
well this is the test that's happening

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.890 
well this is the test that's happening
right<00:03:36.510> now<00:03:36.860> one<00:03:38.180> another<00:03:39.180> going<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.599> here<00:03:39.810> we

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
right now one another going on here we

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.420 
right now one another going on here we
go<00:03:40.050> here<00:03:40.319> we<00:03:40.349> go<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.920> test

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
go here we go this is the test

00:03:41.430 --> 00:04:02.580 
go here we go this is the test
Oh<00:03:47.870> fixing<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.020> hole<00:03:49.200> perfectly

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.089 

I'm<00:04:03.590> thinking<00:04:04.220> he<00:04:04.370> stopped<00:04:04.640> also<00:04:04.879> breaking

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
I'm thinking he stopped also breaking

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.520 
I'm thinking he stopped also breaking
that's<00:04:07.099> amazing<00:04:07.909> that<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.540> worth<00:04:09.290> every

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
that's amazing that is worth every

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.369 
that's amazing that is worth every
single<00:04:10.310> penny<00:04:10.579> that<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:11.959> sewed<00:04:12.200> you're

single penny that just sewed you're

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.949 
single penny that just sewed you're
going<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.220> back<00:04:13.400> end<00:04:13.640> of<00:04:13.760> this<00:04:13.909> board<00:04:14.299> here

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
going of the back end of this board here

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
motorway test on it as well now normally

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.339 
motorway test on it as well now normally
you'd<00:05:02.510> have<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.720> go<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:03.020> petrol<00:05:03.289> station

you'd have to go to a petrol station
right<00:05:03.830> below<00:05:04.520> but<00:05:04.940> this<00:05:05.300> is<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.510> same<00:05:05.780> amount

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
right below but this is the same amount

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.790 
of petrol that the one with style I died
there<00:05:08.300> might<00:05:08.510> actually<00:05:08.870> be<00:05:09.080> more<00:05:09.410> through

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
there might actually be more through
