00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the sausage and in hindsight I probably

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
the sausage and in hindsight I probably

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
would not have used the oil because the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.670 
would not have used the oil because the
sausage<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> fairly<00:01:06.060> greasy<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.260> garlic

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
sausage is fairly greasy so that garlic

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.929 
sausage is fairly greasy so that garlic

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
can just cook up with the sausage

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
can just cook up with the sausage
without<00:01:09.270> needing<00:01:09.630> those<00:01:09.720> extra<00:01:10.140> tablespoons

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
without needing those extra tablespoons

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.550
