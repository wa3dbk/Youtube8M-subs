first up let's cover it is this dye
expensive<00:00:15.269> now<00:00:15.389> if<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.660> want<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.990> run<00:00:16.170> like

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
expensive now if you want it run like

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.109 
expensive now if you want it run like
just<00:00:16.710> cards<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.100> quasar<00:00:17.490> librarian<00:00:17.970> like

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
just cards at quasar librarian like

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.580 
just cards at quasar librarian like
those<00:00:18.270> cards<00:00:18.600> though<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.320> pricey

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
those cards though we kind of pricey

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.720 
those cards though we kind of pricey
button<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.920> know<00:00:19.980> stuff<00:00:20.130> like<00:00:20.189> formula<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
button you know stuff like formula and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.400 
button you know stuff like formula and
spore<00:00:20.939> those<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.210> relatively<00:00:21.539> easy<00:00:22.199> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
spore those are relatively easy to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.980 
spore those are relatively easy to
obtain<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.920> I'd<00:00:23.010> say<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.760> neck<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.090> dependent

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
obtain so I'd say the neck is dependent

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.390 
obtain so I'd say the neck is dependent
on<00:00:25.050> what<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.470> want<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.740> play<00:00:25.920> first<00:00:26.130> yet

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
where it can get kind of pricey

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.580

first<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> sec<00:00:36.420> isn't<00:00:36.719> really<00:00:36.899> necessary

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
first in the sec isn't really necessary

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.990 
first in the sec isn't really necessary
I<00:00:37.410> know<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.070> open<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.489> 141

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
can go off from those kind of plays but

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.529 
can go off from those kind of plays but
you<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.309> not<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.610> deck<00:00:44.820> where<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.090> has<00:00:45.300> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
first turn and then you know kind of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.570 
first turn and then you know kind of
take<00:01:13.409> your<00:01:13.530> victory<00:01:13.830> from<00:01:13.950> there<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.460> it's

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
take your victory from there but it's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.249 
take your victory from there but it's
not<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> deck<00:01:14.909> i<00:01:15.000> would<00:01:15.150> say<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> stun<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
not a deck i would say that a stun so

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.840 
not a deck i would say that a stun so
it's<00:01:16.380> again<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.159> important<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> go

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it's again not that important to go

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's again not that important to go
first<00:01:18.060> now<00:01:18.720> next<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.080> I'm<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> talk

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.289 
first now next up I'm going to talk
about<00:01:19.590> difficulty<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> would<00:01:20.790> say<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
about difficulty now I would say this is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.789 
about difficulty now I would say this is
probably<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> most<00:01:21.990> difficult<00:01:22.200> next

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
probably one of the most difficult next

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
probably one of the most difficult next
apply<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.189> even<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.820> lot<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> trouble

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the right situation I would say this is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.679 
the right situation I would say this is
a<00:01:52.710> deck<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.000> difficult<00:01:54.149> you're

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
a deck that is kind of difficult you're

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.850 
a deck that is kind of difficult you're
going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> need<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.990> practice<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.470> lot<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
going to need to practice a lot and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.940 
going to need to practice a lot and
experience<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:58.170> card<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.590> need<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.799> go

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
for against which deck like again like I

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.510 
for against which deck like again like I
said<00:02:01.200> six<00:02:01.590> samurais<00:02:01.829> make<00:02:02.219> something

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
said six samurais make something

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.160 
said six samurais make something
stronger<00:02:02.790> than<00:02:02.820> 25<00:02:03.270> send<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
stronger than 25 send me one down a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.370 
stronger than 25 send me one down a
rabbit<00:02:04.439> make<00:02:04.649> something<00:02:04.950> stronger<00:02:05.960> then<00:02:06.960> 25<00:02:07.320> I

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
rabbit make something stronger then 25 I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.050 
rabbit make something stronger then 25 I
know<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.039> lance<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:08.910> have

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
know that they have lance and they have

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.119 
know that they have lance and they have
lines<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.629> basically<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.560> general<00:02:10.860> idea<00:02:11.069> is

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
lines but basically the general idea is

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.210 
lines but basically the general idea is
get<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> big

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
get a big

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.220 
get a big
monster<00:02:12.580> against<00:02:13.240> those<00:02:13.390> decks<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.930> again

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
monster against those decks and again

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.340 
monster against those decks and again
second<00:02:14.470> sectors<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:14.950> make<00:02:15.160> something<00:02:16.350> like

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
second sectors you make something like

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.200 
second sectors you make something like
Stardust<00:02:18.220> Dragon<00:02:18.520> which<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.850> stop<00:02:19.060> this

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
Stardust Dragon which you know stop this

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.940 
Stardust Dragon which you know stop this
destruction<00:02:19.360> effects<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.140> keep<00:02:20.650> in<00:02:20.770> mind

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
destruction effects so keep in mind

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.560 
destruction effects so keep in mind
it'll<00:02:21.520> be<00:02:21.610> very<00:02:21.790> difficult<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.240> you<00:02:22.390> need<00:02:22.540> a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
it'll be very difficult and you need a

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.210 
it'll be very difficult and you need a
practice<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.020> lot<00:02:23.140> that's<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.560> key<00:02:23.740> with<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> sec

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
practice a lot that's the key with a sec

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.620 
practice a lot that's the key with a sec
you<00:02:24.520> have<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.850> practice<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.540> to

because<00:02:47.620> other<00:02:48.160> thing<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.520> you're<00:02:48.760> gonna<00:02:48.850> have

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
because other thing is you're gonna have

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.460 
because other thing is you're gonna have
to<00:02:49.120> commit<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.810> know<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.200> field

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
to commit you know to the field

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.840 
to commit you know to the field
essentially<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.100> once<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.550> made<00:02:51.730> that

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
essentially and once you made that

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.310 
essentially and once you made that
commitment<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.720> field<00:02:52.990> they<00:02:53.050> can<00:02:53.170> escape

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
commitment to the field they can escape

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.110 
commitment to the field they can escape
Gemini<00:02:53.680> spark<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.130> then<00:02:54.670> they<00:02:54.760> could<00:02:54.820> ruin

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
Gemini spark and then they could ruin

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.520 
Gemini spark and then they could ruin
your<00:02:55.270> play<00:02:55.450> then<00:02:55.630> you'll<00:02:55.720> have<00:02:55.810> like<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.110> face

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
your play then you'll have like a face

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.020 
your play then you'll have like a face
ups<00:02:56.770> for<00:02:56.980> by<00:02:57.160> itself<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.640> then<00:02:57.730> you're<00:02:57.820> like<00:02:57.910> I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
ups for by itself and then you're like I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.790 
ups for by itself and then you're like I
can't<00:02:58.209> do<00:02:58.330> anything<00:02:58.360> with<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.500> is

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
can't do anything with it and that is

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.320 
can't do anything with it and that is
the<00:03:00.040> problem<00:03:00.280> i<00:03:00.610> would<00:03:00.760> say<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:00.910> plants<00:03:01.300> have

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
the problem i would say that plants have

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.270 
the problem i would say that plants have
if<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.930> stop<00:03:02.590> them<00:03:02.740> in<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.920> middle<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.130> play

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
if you stop them in the middle of play

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.420 
if you stop them in the middle of play
like<00:03:03.430> book<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.640> moon<00:03:04.260> hero<00:03:05.260> blast<00:03:05.650> gemini<00:03:06.190> spark

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
like book a moon hero blast gemini spark

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.860 
like book a moon hero blast gemini spark
you<00:03:06.520> stop<00:03:06.790> them<00:03:06.970> in<00:03:07.090> mid<00:03:07.330> play<00:03:07.600> that's

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
you stop them in mid play that's

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.449 
you stop them in mid play that's
essentially<00:03:08.350> what<00:03:08.530> hurts<00:03:08.770> them<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.130> that's

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
essentially what hurts them and that's

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.490 
essentially what hurts them and that's
essentially<00:03:09.760> what<00:03:10.090> causes<00:03:10.510> them<00:03:10.600> usually<00:03:10.900> to

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
essentially what causes them usually to

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.140 
essentially what causes them usually to
lose<00:03:11.650> i<00:03:11.680> know<00:03:11.860> sometimes<00:03:12.340> they<00:03:12.670> can<00:03:12.730> still<00:03:13.030> go

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
lose i know sometimes they can still go

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.240 
lose i know sometimes they can still go
on<00:03:13.180> even<00:03:13.630> if<00:03:13.720> they<00:03:13.930> get<00:03:14.110> warning<00:03:14.470> but<00:03:15.070> yeah

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
on even if they get warning but yeah

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.770 
on even if they get warning but yeah
that<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.610> thing<00:03:15.850> if<00:03:16.090> they<00:03:16.300> are<00:03:16.420> committing

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
that is a thing if they are committing

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.060 
that is a thing if they are committing
to<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.959> play<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.470> interrupt<00:03:17.890> them

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
to the play and you interrupt them

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.430 
to the play and you interrupt them
somehow<00:03:18.610> essentially<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.360> can<00:03:19.630> kind<00:03:20.320> of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
somehow essentially that can kind of

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.330 
somehow essentially that can kind of
shot<00:03:20.590> them<00:03:20.709> out<00:03:20.800> especially<00:03:20.950> if<00:03:21.190> they've

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
shot them out especially if they've

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.490 
shot them out especially if they've
already<00:03:21.550> went<00:03:22.180> for<00:03:22.360> their<00:03:22.480> spoor<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.200> you

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
already went for their spoor and you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.780 
already went for their spoor and you
know<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.680> argues<00:03:24.010> like<00:03:24.070> 14<00:03:24.459> they<00:03:24.580> want

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
know the argues like 14 they want

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.340 
know the argues like 14 they want
through<00:03:25.060> like<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.209> lot<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.450> their<00:03:25.540> cards<00:03:25.780> it's<00:03:26.290> a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
through like a lot of their cards it's a

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
through like a lot of their cards it's a
little<00:03:26.530> bit<00:03:26.620> difficult<00:03:26.860> for<00:03:27.130> them<00:03:27.310> to

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
little bit difficult for them to

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.520 
little bit difficult for them to
essentially<00:03:28.180> come<00:03:28.390> back<00:03:28.600> if<00:03:28.870> they've<00:03:29.350> already

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
essentially come back if they've already

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.400 
essentially come back if they've already
used<00:03:29.800> all<00:03:29.980> their<00:03:30.250> like<00:03:30.489> cards<00:03:30.910> essentially

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
used all their like cards essentially

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.900 
used all their like cards essentially
and<00:03:32.410> also<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.800> skill<00:03:33.370> drain<00:03:33.519> i<00:03:33.580> won't<00:03:33.790> talk

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
and also a skill drain i won't talk

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.000 
and also a skill drain i won't talk
about<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:34.180> because<00:03:34.440> some<00:03:35.440> heroes<00:03:35.860> are

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
about this because some heroes are

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.550 
about this because some heroes are
playing<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:36.519> card<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:38.230> know<00:03:38.320> Dark

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
playing this card and you know Dark

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.960 
playing this card and you know Dark
Worlds<00:03:38.680> usually<00:03:39.130> mein<00:03:39.310> dekha<00:03:39.489> at<00:03:39.640> least<00:03:39.790> one

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
Worlds usually mein dekha at least one

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.910 
Worlds usually mein dekha at least one
of<00:03:40.000> these<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.350> card<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.739> very

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
of these and so this card is very

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.370 
of these and so this card is very
problematic<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:42.580> if<00:03:42.730> you're<00:03:42.850> playing<00:03:42.970> this

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
problematic so if you're playing this

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.509 
problematic so if you're playing this
deck<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.739> have<00:03:44.890> trouble<00:03:45.100> against<00:03:45.370> dark

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
deck and you have trouble against dark

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.009 
deck and you have trouble against dark
woods<00:03:45.670> i<00:03:45.760> would<00:03:45.880> recommend<00:03:46.239> playing<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.959> little

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
woods i would recommend playing a little

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.170 
woods i would recommend playing a little
more<00:03:47.320> MSC<00:03:47.680> or<00:03:47.769> back<00:03:47.980> row<00:03:48.160> hate<00:03:48.340> because

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
more MSC or back row hate because

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.070 
more MSC or back row hate because
children<00:03:49.720> will<00:03:50.170> ruin<00:03:50.769> you<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.459> fast<00:03:51.790> um<00:03:52.090> pretty

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
children will ruin you so fast um pretty

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.660 
children will ruin you so fast um pretty
pretty<00:03:53.320> much<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.650> royal<00:03:53.860> oppression<00:03:54.100> when

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
pretty much like royal oppression when

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.039 
pretty much like royal oppression when
royal<00:03:54.910> pressure<00:03:55.120> was<00:03:55.330> legal<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.630> few<00:03:55.780> flip-up

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
royal pressure was legal a few flip-up

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.539 
royal pressure was legal a few flip-up
oppression<00:03:56.440> against<00:03:56.650> plants<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.220> was<00:03:57.400> pretty

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
oppression against plants it was pretty

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.740 
oppression against plants it was pretty
much<00:03:57.700> over<00:03:57.850> unless<00:03:58.120> they<00:03:58.269> have<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.570> Space

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
much over unless they have the Space

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.800 
much over unless they have the Space
typhoon<00:03:58.870> immediately<00:03:59.610> also<00:04:00.610> since<00:04:01.299> agents

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
typhoon immediately also since agents

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.150 
typhoon immediately also since agents
are<00:04:01.930> back<00:04:02.080> be<00:04:02.260> expected<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.739> play<00:04:02.890> against

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
are back be expected to play against

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160 
are back be expected to play against
this<00:04:03.640> deck<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.060> when<00:04:04.180> this<00:04:04.510> car<00:04:04.780> comes<00:04:04.930> out

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
this deck and when this car comes out

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.979 
this deck and when this car comes out
that<00:04:05.830> says<00:04:06.130> bye-bye<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:07.090> planets<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.630> pretty

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
that says bye-bye to planets a pretty

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.660 
that says bye-bye to planets a pretty
much<00:04:08.140> dark<00:04:08.380> hole<00:04:08.560> or<00:04:08.799> like<00:04:08.950> what's<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.280> trico<00:04:09.610> if

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
much dark hole or like what's a trico if

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.220 
much dark hole or like what's a trico if
you<00:04:09.760> play<00:04:09.910> Mike<00:04:10.120> oh<00:04:10.269> that<00:04:10.780> is<00:04:10.870> like<00:04:10.989> your<00:04:11.110> only

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
you play Mike oh that is like your only

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
very well and you have

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.260 
very well and you have
the<00:04:25.350> side<00:04:25.560> deck<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.070> right<00:04:26.670> card<00:04:26.910> pretty

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
the side deck on the right card pretty

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.240 
the side deck on the right card pretty
much<00:04:27.450> just<00:04:27.660> like<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:28.110> single<00:04:28.830> destruction

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
much just like a single destruction

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.640 
much just like a single destruction
cards<00:04:29.460> like<00:04:29.580> even<00:04:30.060> Righetti<00:04:30.450> break<00:04:30.780> but<00:04:31.470> just

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
cards like even Righetti break but just

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.440 
cards like even Righetti break but just
because<00:04:31.770> Ricky<00:04:32.490> break<00:04:32.730> will<00:04:32.910> also<00:04:33.210> deal<00:04:33.420> with

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
because Ricky break will also deal with

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.420 
because Ricky break will also deal with
the<00:04:33.750> back<00:04:34.050> row<00:04:34.320> as<00:04:34.500> well<00:04:34.980> as<00:04:35.070> like<00:04:35.190> something

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
the back row as well as like something

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.890 
the back row as well as like something
like<00:04:35.520> Christy<00:04:35.850> which<00:04:36.030> completely<00:04:36.510> shuts<00:04:36.810> down

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
like Christy which completely shuts down

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.840 
like Christy which completely shuts down
your<00:04:37.140> deck<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.680> know<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.130> maybe<00:04:38.460> could<00:04:38.700> try

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
your deck so I know you maybe could try

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.850 
your deck so I know you maybe could try
smashing<00:04:39.240> ground<00:04:39.420> but<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.570> thing<00:04:39.780> is

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
smashing ground but the thing is

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.130 
smashing ground but the thing is
Chrystia<00:04:40.860> will<00:04:41.430> hurt<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.790> deck<00:04:41.940> so<00:04:42.150> much<00:04:42.330> and

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
Chrystia will hurt the deck so much and

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.110 
Chrystia will hurt the deck so much and
i<00:04:43.230> would<00:04:43.350> say<00:04:43.470> probably<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:44.460> three<00:04:44.820> most

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
i would say probably the three most

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.070 
i would say probably the three most
relevant<00:04:45.420> decks<00:04:45.540> are<00:04:45.660> going<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.870> be<00:04:45.930> dark

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
relevant decks are going to be dark

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.950 
relevant decks are going to be dark
world<00:04:46.320> heroes<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:46.950> any<00:04:47.940> variant<00:04:48.390> of<00:04:48.450> agents

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
world heroes and any variant of agents

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.870 
world heroes and any variant of agents
maybe<00:04:49.140> some<00:04:49.500> lights<00:04:49.680> horn<00:04:49.920> but<00:04:50.340> i'd<00:04:50.700> say

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
maybe some lights horn but i'd say

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.160 
maybe some lights horn but i'd say
plants<00:04:51.180> can<00:04:51.300> usually<00:04:51.390> be<00:04:51.540> lights<00:04:51.810> more<00:04:51.990> just

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
plants can usually be lights more just

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.870 
plants can usually be lights more just
by<00:04:52.230> establishing<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.830> good<00:04:53.010> field<00:04:53.250> like<00:04:53.700> make

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
by establishing a good field like make

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.400 
by establishing a good field like make
Stardust<00:04:54.240> Dragon<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:54.690> then<00:04:54.990> make<00:04:55.140> something

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
Stardust Dragon and then make something

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.450 
Stardust Dragon and then make something
like<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.650> know<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:55.890> for<00:04:56.070> example<00:04:56.370> you

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
like you know it's for example you

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.210 
like you know it's for example you
utopia<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:57.300> they<00:04:57.390> can't<00:04:57.600> attack<00:04:57.690> your

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
utopia so they can't attack your

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.830 
utopia so they can't attack your
Stardust<00:04:59.220> so<00:04:59.430> then<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.730> way<00:04:59.880> you<00:05:00.090> know<00:05:00.780> you

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
Stardust so then that way you know you

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.570 
Stardust so then that way you know you
can<00:05:01.020> just<00:05:01.050> go<00:05:01.260> off<00:05:01.440> next<00:05:01.710> her<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.040> kind<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.280> get

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
can just go off next her and kind of get

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.950 
can just go off next her and kind of get
over<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:02.850> double<00:05:03.120> dragon<00:05:03.420> because<00:05:03.510> you<00:05:03.840> have

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
over the double dragon because you have

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.780 
over the double dragon because you have
so<00:05:04.050> many<00:05:04.110> options<00:05:04.380> i<00:05:04.710> would<00:05:04.830> say<00:05:04.980> as<00:05:05.370> far<00:05:05.430> as

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
so many options i would say as far as

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.100 
so many options i would say as far as
like<00:05:05.970> what<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.270> want<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.510> make<00:05:06.630> against<00:05:06.960> them

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
like what you want to make against them

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.860 
like what you want to make against them
so<00:05:07.290> keep<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.710> in<00:05:07.860> mind<00:05:08.010> as<00:05:08.160> well<00:05:08.720> next<00:05:09.720> up

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
from debrief dragons effect however i

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.330 
from debrief dragons effect however i
would<00:05:21.390> say<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.660> deck<00:05:21.870> is<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.080> little<00:05:22.350> bit<00:05:22.440> tough

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
would say the deck is a little bit tough

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.880 
would say the deck is a little bit tough
to<00:05:23.370> talk<00:05:23.970> back<00:05:24.240> with<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:24.780> subject<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.560> make<00:05:25.710> an

to talk back with and subject to make an

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.980 
to talk back with and subject to make an
establishment<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.670> a<00:05:26.760> field<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.210> need<00:05:27.540> a<00:05:27.750> lot

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
establishment of a field you need a lot

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.170 
establishment of a field you need a lot
of<00:05:28.020> cards<00:05:28.440> in<00:05:28.620> your<00:05:28.710> hand<00:05:28.980> in<00:05:29.790> order<00:05:29.910> to<00:05:30.060> make

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
of cards in your hand in order to make

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.430 
of cards in your hand in order to make
that<00:05:30.240> play<00:05:30.480> but<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.900> thing<00:05:31.020> is<00:05:31.080> if<00:05:31.260> you're

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
that play but the thing is if you're

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.190 
that play but the thing is if you're
alright<00:05:32.130> like<00:05:32.370> zero<00:05:32.610> cards<00:05:32.820> in<00:05:32.940> hand<00:05:33.090> it<00:05:33.930> can

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
alright like zero cards in hand it can

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.570 
alright like zero cards in hand it can
be<00:05:34.320> very<00:05:34.350> difficult<00:05:34.650> to<00:05:35.160> really<00:05:35.280> do<00:05:35.550> anything

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
be very difficult to really do anything

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.400 
be very difficult to really do anything
like<00:05:36.360> essentially<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.930> deck<00:05:37.080> relies<00:05:37.380> on

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
like essentially the deck relies on

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.470 
like essentially the deck relies on
thumbnail<00:05:37.950> removed<00:05:38.790> from<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:38.970> rayburn<00:05:39.240> spot

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
thumbnail removed from the rayburn spot
