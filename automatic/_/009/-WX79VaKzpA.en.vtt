00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hi there today we're going to replace a

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.340 
hi there today we're going to replace a
popcorn<00:00:02.280> ceiling<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:03.030> our<00:00:03.120> dining<00:00:03.540> room<00:00:03.570> with

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
popcorn ceiling in our dining room with

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.039 
popcorn ceiling in our dining room with
foam<00:00:04.650> tiles<00:00:05.000> given<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.089> us<00:00:06.240> by<00:00:06.420> ceiling<00:00:06.810> tiles

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
foam tiles given to us by ceiling tiles

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.610 
foam tiles given to us by ceiling tiles
by<00:00:07.440> us<00:00:11.120> the<00:00:12.120> first<00:00:12.360> step<00:00:12.599> isn't<00:00:12.840> required<00:00:13.380> but

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
by us the first step isn't required but

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.220 
by us the first step isn't required but
it's<00:00:13.950> recommended<00:00:14.580> use<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> two-by-four<00:00:16.199> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
it's recommended use a two-by-four and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.990 
it's recommended use a two-by-four and
scrape<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.830> popcorn<00:00:17.310> ceiling<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.760> remove

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
scrape the popcorn ceiling to remove

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.640 
scrape the popcorn ceiling to remove
some<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> low<00:00:18.480> hanging<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.529> loose

some of the low hanging and loose

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.519 
some of the low hanging and loose
material<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:21.270> tiles<00:00:21.660> will<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.960> easier<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
material the tiles will be easier to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:36.100 
material the tiles will be easier to
keep<00:00:22.680> even<00:00:23.100> them<00:00:23.279> when<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.670> install<00:00:24.119> them

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.740 

apply<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.170> material<00:00:37.559> liberally<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.600> dab<00:00:39.600> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
apply the material liberally I dab it

apply the material liberally I dab it
several<00:00:40.170> places<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.680> each<00:00:40.710> tile

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.869 

the<00:00:50.820> first<00:00:51.090> tile<00:00:51.359> is<00:00:51.629> very<00:00:51.960> important<00:00:52.879> measure

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the first tile is very important measure

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.729 
the first tile is very important measure
your<00:00:54.180> ceiling<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> determine<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> centerline

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
your ceiling to determine the centerline

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.549 
your ceiling to determine the centerline
then<00:00:56.489> mark<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.089> centerline<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.019> the<00:00:58.109> tile<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
then mark that centerline so the tile is

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.880 
then mark that centerline so the tile is
straight<00:00:59.089> press<00:01:00.089> the<00:01:00.300> tile<00:01:00.570> onto<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> ceiling

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
straight press the tile onto the ceiling

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.799 
straight press the tile onto the ceiling
and<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.489> gently<00:01:02.730> press<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> corners<00:01:03.719> in

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and then gently press all the corners in

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.660 
and then gently press all the corners in
the<00:01:03.899> center<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> mastic<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.129> evenly

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the center so the mastic will be evenly

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.139 
the center so the mastic will be evenly
spread<00:01:11.960> check<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.140> mark<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.670> make<00:01:14.820> sure<00:01:15.030> you

have it lined up exactly where you want
it<00:01:22.190> you<00:01:23.190> can<00:01:23.340> move<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.729> tile<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.360> bit

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479

it you can move the tile a little bit
either<00:01:24.659> way<00:01:24.929> just<00:01:25.649> by<00:01:25.860> sliding<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.550> with<00:01:26.700> your

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
shorter than the actual measurement you

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.540 
shorter than the actual measurement you
can<00:03:50.020> use<00:03:50.230> corner<00:03:50.590> molding<00:03:50.950> on<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.100> borders

it<00:04:05.950> cuts<00:04:06.190> very<00:04:06.250> easily<00:04:06.610> but<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:07.690> needs<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.930> good

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
it cuts very easily but it needs a good
