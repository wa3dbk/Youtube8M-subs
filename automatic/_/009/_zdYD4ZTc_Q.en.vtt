00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.910 
slovak republic and my work is called
loop<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.740> i<00:00:25.769> decided<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.400> play<00:00:27.140> with<00:00:28.140> exterior

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
loop so i decided to play with exterior

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.830 
loop so i decided to play with exterior
and<00:00:29.250> interior<00:00:29.310> situation<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> pavilion

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and interior situation of the pavilion

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.350 
and interior situation of the pavilion
and<00:00:31.650> very<00:00:31.859> much<00:00:31.980> interested<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.090> real

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
and very much interested in and real

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.330 
and very much interested in and real
experiences<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.350> whether<00:00:34.920> these<00:00:35.100> real

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
experiences and whether these real

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.630 
experiences and whether these real
experiences<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.739> transformed<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
experiences can be transformed to the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.049 
experiences can be transformed to the
context<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.180> art<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:41.399> good

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
context of art so this is a very good

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.319 
context of art so this is a very good
example<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.570> my<00:00:43.200> my<00:00:43.649> approach<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.430> art<00:00:45.120> making

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
example of my my approach to art making

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.440 
example of my my approach to art making
so<00:00:46.260> when<00:00:46.440> people<00:00:46.620> enter<00:00:47.000> they<00:00:48.000> don't<00:00:48.210> even

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
so when people enter they don't even

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
so when people enter they don't even
notice<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.980> they<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.280> telling<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
notice that they are in telling the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.790 
notice that they are in telling the
pavilion<00:00:51.120> or<00:00:51.270> they're<00:00:51.420> entering<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.989> space

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
pavilion or they're entering the space

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.889 
pavilion or they're entering the space
of<00:00:53.129> art<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.059> was<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.390> intention<00:00:54.719> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
of art and this was my intention that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.639 
of art and this was my intention that
the<00:00:55.140> experience<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:57.030> welcome<00:00:57.649> without

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the experience in welcome without

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
the experience in welcome without
noticing<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.309> there<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.550> any<00:00:59.930> borderline

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
noticing that there is any borderline

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
noticing that there is any borderline
between<00:01:01.260> exterior<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.129> failure<00:01:02.430> between

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
between exterior and failure between

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
between exterior and failure between
reality<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.860> an<00:01:05.150> exhibition<00:01:06.150> space<00:01:07.580> this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
reality and an exhibition space this

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.230 
reality and an exhibition space this
kind<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.530> double<00:01:10.530> take<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:11.240> understanding

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
kind of double take on understanding

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.130 
kind of double take on understanding
what<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> inside<00:01:14.479> represents<00:01:15.479> whether

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
what what is inside represents whether

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.840 
what what is inside represents whether
this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> sculpture<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.549> just

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
this is the sculpture was just

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.660 
this is the sculpture was just
continuation<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.600> reality<00:01:19.020> inside<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.490> can

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
continuation of reality inside and I can

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.920 
continuation of reality inside and I can
show<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.750> back

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
show you also a little bit of a back

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.999 
show you also a little bit of a back
stage<00:01:22.670> which<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.840> not<00:01:25.080> revealed<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
stage which is not it's not revealed to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
stage which is not it's not revealed to
the<00:01:26.130> visitors<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the visitors but here you can see that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.950 
the visitors but here you can see that
that's<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> difference<00:01:29.430> between

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
that's the that's the difference between

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.330 
that's the that's the difference between
what<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> floor<00:01:31.290> was<00:01:31.439> before<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.860> what<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.220> is

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
what the floor was before and what it is

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.450 
what the floor was before and what it is
now<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.390> no<00:01:33.689> one<00:01:34.049> millimeter<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
now so there is no one millimeter of the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.840 
now so there is no one millimeter of the
pavilion<00:01:36.229> pavilions<00:01:37.229> floor<00:01:37.530> left<00:01:37.799> visible<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
pavilion pavilions floor left visible to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.940 
pavilion pavilions floor left visible to
the<00:01:39.299> visitors<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.560> sort<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.420> elevated

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
the visitors so it's sort of elevated

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.260 
the visitors so it's sort of elevated
floor<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> same<00:01:44.729> time<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.119> might

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
floor but at the same time you might

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.960 
floor but at the same time you might
also<00:01:45.450> feel<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.290> whole<00:01:46.729> pavilion<00:01:47.729> was

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
also feel that the whole pavilion was

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.289 
also feel that the whole pavilion was
suppressed<00:01:48.420> down<00:01:49.340> underneath<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
suppressed down underneath of the of the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.749 
suppressed down underneath of the of the
of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.600> ground<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.159> installed

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
of the ground or it was just installed

on<00:01:53.880> top<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.969> technically<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.079> the

main ro this is the this is the path

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.710 
main ro this is the this is the path
which<00:02:00.920> visitors

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.810 

passed<00:02:06.720> through<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.260> pavilion<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.729> you

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
passed through the pavilion but what you

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.120 
passed through the pavilion but what you
see<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.210> site<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.720> either<00:02:09.869> side<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
see on the site on either side is the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.150 
see on the site on either side is the
simulation<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> bushes<00:02:12.570> which<00:02:12.870> are

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
simulation of the bushes which are

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.650 
simulation of the bushes which are
outside<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.640> pebble<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.150> very<00:02:15.540> much

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
outside of the pebble and I very much

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.350 
outside of the pebble and I very much
like<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.650> situation<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> pavilion

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
like the the situation of the pavilion

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.810 
like the the situation of the pavilion
which<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.690> white<00:02:18.900> outside<00:02:19.170> as<00:02:20.070> well<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.700> is

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
which is white outside as well as it is

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.850 
which is white outside as well as it is
inside<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.630> if<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.380> look<00:02:22.470> at<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
inside so if you if you look at the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.610 
inside so if you if you look at the
facet<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:24.090> side<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.540> pavilion<00:02:24.990> you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
facet of the side of the pavilion you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.980 
facet of the side of the pavilion you
might<00:02:25.830> probably<00:02:26.240> receive<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.450> very<00:02:27.690> similar

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
might probably receive a very similar

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.370

situation out there and I was happy to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.690 
situation out there and I was happy to
find<00:02:32.450> in<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:34.020> pavilion<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.770> roof<00:02:35.250> glass

find in this pavilion this roof glass
roof<00:02:35.970> which<00:02:36.240> reminds<00:02:36.690> greenhouse<00:02:37.560> very<00:02:37.920> much

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
roof which reminds greenhouse very much

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.880

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
this physical experience or transition

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.640 
this physical experience or transition
is<00:02:47.270> fulfilled<00:02:48.270> whether<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.570> are<00:02:48.690> leaving<00:02:48.900> the
