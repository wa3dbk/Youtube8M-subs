last<00:00:30.919> map<00:00:31.579> inside<00:00:32.570> here<00:00:32.840> we<00:00:32.990> have<00:00:33.020> a<00:00:33.260> few

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
last map inside here we have a few

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.400 
last map inside here we have a few
options<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:34.670> have<00:00:35.050> orientation<00:00:36.050> right<00:00:36.230> now

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
options we have orientation right now

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.740 
options we have orientation right now
let's<00:00:36.590> set<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:36.949> track<00:00:37.370> up<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:37.850> could<00:00:38.510> go<00:00:38.629> in

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
let's set the track up I could go in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.889 
let's set the track up I could go in
here<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:39.110> set<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.500> Northup<00:00:40.129> or<00:00:40.899> automobile

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
here and set it to Northup or automobile

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.910 
here and set it to Northup or automobile
mode<00:00:42.199> so<00:00:43.870> Northup<00:00:44.870> will<00:00:45.170> always<00:00:45.379> keep<00:00:45.590> north

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
mode so Northup will always keep north

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.130 
mode so Northup will always keep north
at<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.100> top<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.550> screen<00:00:46.789> track<00:00:47.570> up<00:00:47.840> your

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.279 
direction of travel at the top of the
screen<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:50.239> if<00:00:50.420> you're<00:00:50.539> going<00:00:50.750> south<00:00:50.989> and

different items start to show up on the
map<00:02:00.820> so<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.120> go<00:02:02.270> into<00:02:02.390> map<00:02:02.690> points<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.290> I

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
map so if I go into map points and I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.040 
map so if I go into map points and I
change<00:02:03.620> that<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.830> 5<00:02:04.250> meters<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.030> at<00:02:05.390> around<00:02:05.540> 5

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
change that to 5 meters so at around 5

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.450 
change that to 5 meters so at around 5
meters<00:02:06.260> oome<00:02:06.620> level<00:02:06.980> that's<00:02:07.100> when<00:02:07.340> those

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
meters oome level that's when those

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.170 
meters oome level that's when those
points<00:02:07.910> are<00:02:08.030> going<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.209> show<00:02:08.420> up<00:02:08.599> or<00:02:08.780> not<00:02:08.840> and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
points are going to show up or not and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.300 
points are going to show up or not and
then<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.420> can<00:02:11.750> do<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:11.989> bunch<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.439> other<00:02:12.680> ones

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.390 

we<00:02:15.850> have<00:02:16.150> our<00:02:16.480> text<00:02:16.840> size<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.709> how<00:02:17.920> big<00:02:18.190> that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
we have our text size so how big that

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.910 
we have our text size so how big that
text<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:19.240> on<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.720> screen<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:22.530> small<00:02:23.530> for

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
text is on the screen we have small for

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.750 
text is on the screen we have small for
user<00:02:24.100> locations<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:26.560> street<00:02:27.010> labels<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.550> set

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
user locations for street labels it set

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.640 
user locations for street labels it set
the<00:02:27.880> medium<00:02:28.240> land-cover<00:02:28.630> small<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.440> at<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
the medium land-cover small and at the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.960 
the medium land-cover small and at the
top<00:02:29.860> your<00:02:30.069> map<00:02:30.250> points<00:02:30.640> are<00:02:30.730> set<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.120> none<00:02:32.970> so

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
top your map points are set to none so

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.770 
top your map points are set to none so
let's<00:02:34.330> go<00:02:34.480> back<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.550> have<00:02:36.760> our<00:02:36.910> detail<00:02:37.450> we

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
let's go back then we have our detail we

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.260 
let's go back then we have our detail we
could<00:02:37.930> have<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:38.140> set<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.319> normal<00:02:38.880> more<00:02:39.880> most

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
could have it set to normal more most

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.190 
could have it set to normal more most
less<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:41.050> least<00:02:42.660> usually<00:02:43.660> normals

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
less or least usually normals

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.190 
less or least usually normals
recommended<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:48.600> then<00:02:49.600> we<00:02:49.720> have<00:02:49.930> shaded

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
recommended and then we have shaded

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.640 
recommended and then we have shaded
relief<00:02:50.440> whether<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.550> shows<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:52.360> or<00:02:53.019> off<00:02:53.290> or

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
relief whether that shows on or off or

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.960 
relief whether that shows on or off or
auto<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:57.720> last<00:02:58.720> we<00:02:58.930> have<00:02:58.959> our<00:02:59.410> map

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
auto and last we have our map

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.930 
auto and last we have our map
information<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.569> map<00:03:02.489> information<00:03:03.489> is<00:03:03.670> what

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
information so map information is what

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.840 
information so map information is what
map<00:03:04.269> we<00:03:04.690> see<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.290> if<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:05.709> have<00:03:05.920> multiple<00:03:06.580> maps

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
map we see so if we have multiple maps

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.870 
map we see so if we have multiple maps
in<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:08.170> unit<00:03:08.620> we<00:03:08.860> can<00:03:09.040> enable<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.760> disable

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
in the unit we can enable and disable

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.390 
in the unit we can enable and disable
them<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.540> this<00:03:10.720> menu<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.620> you're<00:03:12.220> going<00:03:12.340> to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
them in this menu and you're going to

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.640 
them in this menu and you're going to
want<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.209> if<00:03:13.569> one<00:03:13.870> map<00:03:14.110> over<00:03:14.440> rights

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
want to do that if one map over rights

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.979 
want to do that if one map over rights
the<00:03:14.890> other<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:16.180> can't<00:03:16.450> see<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.870> one

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
the other you can't see the one

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.479 
the other you can't see the one
underneath<00:03:17.470> so<00:03:17.830> you've<00:03:17.980> got<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.190> turn<00:03:18.340> that

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
underneath so you've got to turn that

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.060 
underneath so you've got to turn that
top<00:03:18.790> layer<00:03:19.060> off<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:20.200> was<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.380> quick<00:03:20.650> look<00:03:20.890> at

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
top layer off that was a quick look at

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.530 
top layer off that was a quick look at
the<00:03:21.190> map<00:03:21.400> settings<00:03:21.790> in<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.269> Garmin<00:03:22.750> Edge<00:03:22.870> 810
