00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.160
 all know windows and also use the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.679
 Most on 92 of the pcs and notebooks 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.080
 Windows is running a bit today 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.030
 brings more color into the game mac os 10 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.949
 then not only gray boxes and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.510
 black notebooks but real 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.300
 desktop fun and a bit too 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.340
 Exotic we show you today via 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 mac os can use without the expensive mac 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.289
 to simply buy an installation in 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.039
 the virtualbox and mac os 10 on windows 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.560
 try out 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.050
 yes here already looks to me the end result 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.840
 What we have here is quite normal 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.300
 installed windows 8 1 and then 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.809
 the virtual box has an installed mac 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.480
 os 10 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.640
 you need three things to do mac os 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.039
 10 in the virtualbox under windows 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.210
 the start gets the first little 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.559
 surprisingly you need one 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.199
 full version of mac os 10 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.379
 We recommend for this micro is enno 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.940
 buy leopard this is the last one 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 dvd version of the apple even in the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.699
 store offers the second point you 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.559
 must fill are the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.940
 hardware requirements who says now 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.540
 but we are also in the virtual box 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.900
 that said virtual box also needs 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.450
 a certain hardware basis it then 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.010
 go up through enough speak up comes 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.110
 For example, on which processor one 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.979
 You should go if you are using mac os 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.710
 10 possibly box rumprobiert on each 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.500
 case an intel platform get amd 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
 Also, not enough ram works 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.130
 and other standard components the apple 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.110
 also uses for example in the via 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.759
 graphics cards and point 3 on the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 checklist is of course the virtual box 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.650
 there is always in the freshest version 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.329
 at chip online for download 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.770
 what we do now is we lay down 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.740
 a new virtual machine in 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.290
 virtualbox is easy but on 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 new click and then jump in 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.460
 assistant at the one at the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.200
 The first thing we do is help the establishment 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.299
 make is we forgive clever names 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.909
 for our mac os 10 installation speak 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.799
 us ickx and virtual box will be the same 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.750
 so clever and certain type of 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.070
 operating system and the version easy 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.860
 already more correct so what we now 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.079
 make click on and on 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.259
 critical point define the rem size 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.750
 As mentioned earlier, there is a lot of room 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.370
 well more to fix it better 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.560
 the maximum and click on next 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.120
 after that, it's about getting one 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.660
 wants to generate hard disk or 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.760
 Not 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.750
 the default is absolutely appropriate 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.620
 it becomes a virtual disk 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.690
 The I take over by clicking 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.150
 on generate and also here the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.209
 preselection of file type of hard disk 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.160
 is right like a virtual disk 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.500
 image is created by clicking on 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.190
 I also confirm that and 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.720
 dynamically alu adorned means that the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.640
 Hard disk is just as big as it can be 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.320
 So it does not have to be a fixed size 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.550
 occupied but the hard drive grows 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.720
 if necessary, if you have more space 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.850
 needs that is also a good one 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.760
 language setting so also that it from 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.340
 virtualbox done very well then there is 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.680
 still the possibility that the size 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.110
 but we do not need anything changed 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.630
 standard settings are also great here 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.980
 wobbly reflex is absolutely served and 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.260
 I'll click one last time 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.120
 Create and finish what you do now 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.380
 you have to have the settings yet 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.250
 to adjust 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.519
 that is relatively easy and down here 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.989
 under it expands comes to evi one of 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.459
 or others will scan bios successor 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.299
 evi or evi mac os 10 uses the already 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.130
 for years 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.820
 we can not do that here 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.970
 need a second thing we then 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.030
 we have to change that first 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.030
 have to offer from a small software 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.549
 almut calls the institution in 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.380
 virtual box is hereby completed 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.450
 a list fine adjustment we 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.489
 we have to make that in the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.680
 virtual box still a small setting 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.430
 readjust and we will click below 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.290
 Mass storage on the cd symbol and 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.269
 use those of us down before 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.880
 loaded software courage to do so 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.860
 the cd icon click here right and then 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.049
 immediately select the first entry 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.630
 file for virtual cd dvd medium 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.390
 Select was then just almut from the 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.780
 specify the explorer and you can get the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.090
 virtual machine good for mac os 10 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.130
 what we do now we start the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.770
 newly created virtual machine easy 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.410
 Select and then click start and then 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.280
 Our little helper jumps well 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.440
 it starts too 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.010
 they do not deep down so fast 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.100
 really that is similar but what we do 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.610
 Now we're going to put those from us 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:42.870
 purchased snow leopard original dvd 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:47.520
 and click down through the dvd 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.639
 icon and then select that cd there 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.320
 or is a dvd excuse it 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.440
 press the display to refresh 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.600
 just retract once to f5 and then 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.810
 poverty does not appear in the middle 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.310
 but we have the mac os 10 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.990
 Install dvd selected now 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.500
 simply confirm again with enter 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.540
 and it starts immediately with the start of 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.669
 the dvd and immediately starts the installer 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.010
 and we can mac 10 with the 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.919
 normal installation wizard 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.500
 set up and ready for mac os antenna 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.919
 virtualbox cheaper one does not come 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.530
 it 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.419
 but one has seen that one or 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.340
 another step is needed at mac os 10 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.870
 Really it's about to run 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.000
 It does not do it on any hardware 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.500
 That's why I would say for 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.419
 Bastler it's a nice weekend 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.370
 project and who can do it? 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.050
 who wants to have a mac 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.260
 Of course, buying is a lot 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.260
 expensive
