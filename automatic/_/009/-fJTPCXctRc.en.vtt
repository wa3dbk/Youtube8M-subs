00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.860
 Yes everyone is hiding from this time 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.200
 I think that I want to post videos of Murase part 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.290
 This video is 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.350
 I thought of the fear Dochball 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.789
 Test towards the planning say 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.800
 I would like to go with fewer videos 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.400
 It is a column match 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.760
 Of my map made by the creators 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 If the test 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.510
 I think that I want to put it on 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.510
 Let's get started 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.790
 If you have a simple rule 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.790
 When the person of Dotchuboru erects the wall, the wall is closed with the wall 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.540
 Well then 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:56.080
 Of course I can not see the other party I can not see myself from the other party 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.080
 In that state, grenade poi poy throws from the other side of the wall 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:06.060
 It is a game of killing each other like Gracef 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:10.840
 If you go after the test of the clothes pom pom 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.250
 There is chaos of cp's 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.250
 Nde have become vulgar it 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.310
 First of all, it also serves as the test video for Grasef. 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.310
 At the same time, I hope that this deathmatch test 4 will come 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.930
 Raz 20km 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.580
 Good 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.970
 I think this kind of feeling is the wall 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.340
 Passing of the ins 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:44.700
 There are times when I 'll be outside of that, I'm opening such a gap for a while, but basically 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.430
 Without it 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.100
 After that you have to go 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.430
 The top is not closed because of the prop problem 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.670
 There is also a place where 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:01.630
 It's full of defects, but I'm just saying it's open in the test for the time being . 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.880
 Correction 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.880
 I feel like I'm going to throw poipo like this 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.020
 Dorner 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.080
 Look Hora' 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.260
 Come on Aura Night error 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.430
 It will be a silly talk of liger 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.569
 Sticking to the wall and throwing again this guy 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.300
 Angry 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.870
 Hey Buddhism is burning 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.140
 Ganbare 3 Kana 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.030
 A little 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.030
 It is in the REC smoked Gen'ichi it is difficult to have 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.660
 I'm the first creator 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.660
 I want to go back to old days 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.050
 Should bear the burden and stand up 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.270
 It was a little exciting 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.840
 It looks like this, cp is good 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.610
 Charab 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.910

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.910

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.360
 It is fun to announce everyone because there is a human being 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.540
 I think but 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.350
 It is like this in your home 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.440
 Is a stronger one 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.610
 Let's battle more hot 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.000

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.450

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.410
 In fact such overcoming the wall is gold water 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.410
