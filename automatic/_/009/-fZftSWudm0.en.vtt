00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:14.000
 hello welcome in champagne for 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.000
 the test of the hyundai i30 sport wagon 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.350
 compared to the sedan the jig 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.000
 increases slightly we have six 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.600
 centimeters and a half longer 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.660
 here we are at 4 m 48 and dust in 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.270
 width one is always at 1 m 78 and in 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.460
 height we gain 3 cm we are now 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.610
 at 1 meter 50 on the break 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.280
 the wheelbase is identical to both him 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.620
 meters 65 so that one keeps 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.559
 exactly the doors of the sedan 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.379
 obviously the interest of the sport version 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.049
 wagon is his chest 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.479
 here we have a chest of 528 liters instead 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.250
 of 360 18 on the sedan 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.590
 that is to say in the good average of the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.299
 category of compact breaks to 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.180
 inside whatever it is for the painting 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.409
 the front seats or 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.299
 the livability at the back is 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.479
 exactly the same as the sedan 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.189
 so we will not make you a big laius 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.930
 let you refer to the test of 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.420
 the sedan that is also entitled to his small 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.840
 video driving the break we found 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.729
 exactly the sensations of the sedan 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.869
 for the behavior it's quite 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.460
 that reassuring is not very player so 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.950
 a bit sad 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.690
 we do not have the agility of ford focus s 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.940
 go for example 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.310
 but good for a family is not 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.960
 bad at all scan a little better that's 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.330
 suspension comfort 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.970
 it's perfectly successful for 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.520
 engines on the break we can not find 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.760
 the 1 liter 4 as well in gasoline 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.860
 that in diesel we pass directly or a 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.630
 liter if what is available 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.020
 there also in 110 or 128 horses the 128 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.470
 horses 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.770
 it's really lacking in pepness especially 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.290
 because of a box too long 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.760
 that's the case for the manual 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.830
 automatic is not so much anymore 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.470
 expensive but the excellent ones either 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.990
 so our choice is really the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.810
 diesel a lead 6 in 110 horses 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.680
 It is 117 grams which is 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.750
 near 4 and 5 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.170
 gold consumption but is actually 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.390
 we are around 7 liters at the computer 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.099
 it's in the mean of the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.810
 category 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:42.629
 with this engine years in skeins we have the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:45.629
 same pair as the 128 which 269 ​​m which 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.689
 allows to have good times too 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.959
 well empty that charge again and 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:54.810
 there we still if we are five with 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.540
 the full chest is very useful to have 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.700
 a couple of this value the version 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.750
 wagon station of the i30 concerns 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.079
 qualities of the sedan 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.150
 ie benefits that are 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.669
 honorable in all areas but 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.290
 never exceptional is perhaps the 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.680
 the only complaint that can be made to this 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.060
 car 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.219
 its main interest is a report 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.049
 equipment / price benefit quite 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.739
 interesting in the very good average 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.439
 of the market 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.870
 equal for example a ford focus has 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.439
 saved this break is marketed only in 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.260
 diesel 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:31.560
 we strongly recommend version 110 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.810
 horses that goes in rates from 22 to 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.419
 25 thousand 250 euros here we have this 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.209
 last price for the business version 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.669
 who is eager and well equipped with 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.069
 series unlike her cousin at 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:49.019
 kia who has to resort to packs 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.449
 options to reach the same level 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.939
 equipment beyond the warranty 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:57.150
 traditional 50 offers since not bad 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.459
 of time this constructor there is a 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.389
 small to brake says who's the guarantee 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.329
 Job Loss 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.489
 it's actually a refund of 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.209
 monthly payments up to 300 euros 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.250
 for a year and coaching sessions 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.389
 always offered for a year and who 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.040
 are five in number 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.470
 that's it for those who are afraid 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.680
 to buy a new car and lose 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.680
 their jobs
