00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
in the rearview mirror and I saw a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.969

going to be wind powered it's an
eventualities<00:01:33.619> should<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.369> mean<00:01:35.790> ok

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
eventualities should do is I mean ok

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.270 
eventualities should do is I mean ok
it's<00:01:36.479> build<00:01:37.049> wind<00:01:37.290> generation<00:01:37.619> cars<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it's build wind generation cars so that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's build wind generation cars so that
once<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.670> gets<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> speed<00:01:39.060> literally<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
once it gets up to speed literally up to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.620 
once it gets up to speed literally up to
speed<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.920> 40<00:01:41.250> miles<00:01:41.400> an<00:01:41.549> hour<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
speed like 40 miles an hour then the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.810 
speed like 40 miles an hour then the
wind<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.439> wind<00:01:43.680> generator<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.399> continue<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
wind the wind generator will continue to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.690 
wind the wind generator will continue to
power<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> car<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.750> long<00:01:45.930> trips<00:01:46.259> for

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700

generate<00:01:54.720> enough<00:01:54.960> wind<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.670> power<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> car<00:01:57.060> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
generate enough wind to power the car so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.120 
generate enough wind to power the car so
you'd<00:01:57.450> still<00:01:57.659> use<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> gas<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.649> use<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> gas

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you'd still use the gas you use a gas

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.219 
you'd still use the gas you use a gas
wayne<00:01:59.520> combination<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.899> wouldn't<00:02:01.110> have

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
wayne combination and you wouldn't have

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.560 
wayne combination and you wouldn't have
to<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> battery<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.670> would<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.909> simple<00:02:03.390> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to have a battery it would be simple to

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
do this too it would just be a matter of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.449 
do this too it would just be a matter of
building<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.049> car<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.190> wouldn't

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
building the car but it's not wouldn't

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.520 
building the car but it's not wouldn't
be<00:02:08.520> an<00:02:08.580> expensive<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.270> mean<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.569> overly

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
be an expensive I mean not overly

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.070 
be an expensive I mean not overly
expensive<00:02:10.830> process<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
expensive process and then you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.190 
expensive process and then you
you<00:02:13.410> use<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.070> wind<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:15.780> being<00:02:16.110> created

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
you use the wind that is being created

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.530 
you use the wind that is being created
the<00:02:16.920> friction<00:02:17.610> that's<00:02:17.730> being<00:02:17.880> created<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.420> as

the friction that's being created it as

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.880 
the friction that's being created it as
long<00:02:18.810> as<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.110> creating<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.410> drag<00:02:19.680> that

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
long as it's creating the drag that

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.220 
long as it's creating the drag that
slowing<00:02:20.130> us<00:02:20.310> down<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:21.480> actually<00:02:21.660> help<00:02:22.110> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
slowing us down to actually help to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.340 
slowing us down to actually help to
sustain<00:02:22.560> us<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:24.240> becomes<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.690> sustainable

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
sustain us and it becomes a sustainable

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.450 
sustain us and it becomes a sustainable
process<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.040> could<00:02:26.160> drive<00:02:26.430> forever<00:02:31.460> wind

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
process you could drive forever wind

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.510 
process you could drive forever wind
power<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:33.480> cars<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.020> creates<00:02:34.320> wind<00:02:34.650> you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
power in with cars it creates wind you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.360 
power in with cars it creates wind you
have<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.760> wait<00:02:35.910> for<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.120> wind<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.160> gas

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
have to wait for the wind so the gas

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.000 
have to wait for the wind so the gas
would<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.880> would<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.390> would<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:40.010> mutual

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
would it would be it would be a mutual

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.340 
would it would be it would be a mutual
thing<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:42.210> gas<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.750> then<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> wind<00:02:44.960> man<00:02:45.960> I

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
thing the gas and then the wind man I

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.110 
thing the gas and then the wind man I
love<00:02:46.710> that<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.250> love<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.580> thought<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:47.940> don't

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
love that I love this thought I don't

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.880 
love that I love this thought I don't
never<00:02:48.450> heard<00:02:48.720> about<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.990> I've<00:02:49.230> never<00:02:49.410> thought

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
never heard about it I've never thought

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.830 
never heard about it I've never thought
really<00:02:50.310> about<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.670> before<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.030> wind<00:02:51.630> power

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
really about it before but wind power

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.050 
really about it before but wind power
cars<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.709> want<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.040> put<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.250> out<00:02:53.370> into

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
cars so I want to put that out into

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.490 
cars so I want to put that out into
people's<00:02:54.360> minds<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.959> mile<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.230> mind<00:02:55.380> I

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
people's minds in the mile in mind I

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.470 
people's minds in the mile in mind I
want<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.740> watch<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.890> listen<00:02:56.280> about<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.550> if<00:02:57.300> you

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
want to watch it listen about it if you

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.470 
want to watch it listen about it if you
have<00:02:57.600> any<00:02:57.750> more<00:02:57.930> thoughts<00:02:58.200> about<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:59.300> do<00:03:00.300> it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
have any more thoughts about it to do it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.680 
have any more thoughts about it to do it
put<00:03:01.410> them<00:03:01.530> out
