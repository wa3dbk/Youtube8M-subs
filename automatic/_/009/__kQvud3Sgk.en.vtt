00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
after a brief Horton she's somebody that

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.570 
after a brief Horton she's somebody that
that<00:01:10.150> we<00:01:10.420> wake<00:01:10.660> surf<00:01:10.900> with<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.410> she<00:01:12.220> told<00:01:12.460> us

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
that we wake surf with and she told us

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.800 
that we wake surf with and she told us
about<00:01:12.790> this<00:01:12.940> move<00:01:13.150> I'm<00:01:13.300> sure<00:01:13.450> she<00:01:13.570> didn't

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
about this move I'm sure she didn't

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.810 
about this move I'm sure she didn't
invent<00:01:14.020> it<00:01:14.170> but<00:01:14.350> we<00:01:14.680> needed<00:01:14.980> after<00:01:15.100> anyway<00:01:15.550> I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
invent it but we needed after anyway I

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.550 
invent it but we needed after anyway I
guess<00:01:16.480> we<00:01:16.600> could<00:01:16.750> have<00:01:16.840> named<00:01:17.020> it<00:01:17.080> after<00:01:17.230> a<00:01:17.380> dad

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
guess we could have named it after a dad

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.980 
guess we could have named it after a dad
Dennis<00:01:17.920> but<00:01:18.070> she's<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.280> lot<00:01:18.430> cuter<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.720> then

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
Dennis but she's a lot cuter and then

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.930 
Dennis but she's a lot cuter and then
the<00:01:20.140> other<00:01:20.290> move<00:01:20.560> we're<00:01:21.070> going<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.250> call<00:01:21.460> we're

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
and basically let's look at that again

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.670 
and basically let's look at that again
in<00:03:52.469> slow<00:03:52.530> motion<00:03:53.060> all<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.120> do<00:03:54.359> is<00:03:54.810> turn<00:03:55.439> the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
in slow motion all I do is turn the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.899 
in slow motion all I do is turn the
wheel<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.159> right<00:03:56.250> when<00:03:56.700> he<00:03:56.849> starts

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
wheel to the right when he starts

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.940 
wheel to the right when he starts
falling<00:03:57.480> back<00:03:57.689> I<00:03:57.989> turn<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.680> right<00:03:58.829> and

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
falling back I turn it to the right and

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.110 
falling back I turn it to the right and
you<00:03:59.040> can<00:03:59.159> only<00:03:59.250> do<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.549> for<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.760> couple<00:03:59.790> of

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
you can only do it for a couple of

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.030 
you can only do it for a couple of
seconds<00:04:00.540> every<00:04:00.780> boat<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.109> different<00:04:01.469> but<00:04:01.950> if

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
seconds every boat is different but if

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.830 
seconds every boat is different but if
you<00:04:02.129> look<00:04:02.310> at<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.519> way<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:03.150> extends<00:04:03.719> the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
you look at the way it extends the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.720 
you look at the way it extends the
pocket<00:04:04.260> for<00:04:04.439> a<00:04:04.469> few<00:04:04.620> seconds<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.219> then<00:04:05.669> he

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
pocket for a few seconds and then he

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.800 
pocket for a few seconds and then he
comes<00:04:05.939> right<00:04:06.180> back<00:04:06.359> in<00:04:07.250> okay<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.310> now<00:04:08.810> showing

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
comes right back in okay so now showing

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.360 
comes right back in okay so now showing
you<00:04:09.930> how<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.079> get<00:04:10.230> back<00:04:10.349> into<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.709> wave<00:04:10.859> we<00:04:11.189> got

shuffle<00:04:35.639> and<00:04:35.759> learn<00:04:35.940> what<00:04:36.180> works<00:04:36.389> for<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.720> to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
shuffle and learn what works for you to

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.180 
shuffle and learn what works for you to
get<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.080> back<00:04:37.229> in<00:04:37.409> the<00:04:37.470> way<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:37.620> then<00:04:37.919> as<00:04:38.009> want

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
get you back in the way so then as want

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.920 
get you back in the way so then as want
to<00:04:38.280> take<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.729> so<00:04:38.970> basically<00:04:39.090> what<00:04:39.599> you<00:04:39.750> do<00:04:39.900> is

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
to take that so basically what you do is

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.960 
to take that so basically what you do is
you<00:04:40.289> you<00:04:40.620> let<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:41.009> Rope<00:04:41.190> go<00:04:41.220> all<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.820> way<00:04:41.880> to

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
you you let the Rope go all the way to

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.580 
you you let the Rope go all the way to
the<00:04:42.150> answer<00:04:42.479> your<00:04:42.659> you're<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.050> barely

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
the answer your you're just barely

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.189 
the answer your you're just barely
hanging<00:04:44.009> on<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.610> then<00:04:45.180> from<00:04:45.389> that<00:04:45.419> point<00:04:45.599> I

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
hanging on and then from that point I

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.439 
hanging on and then from that point I
want<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.680> surf<00:04:47.039> back<00:04:47.340> into<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.729> wake<00:04:47.909> not

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
but learn how to get back into the wake

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.980 
but learn how to get back into the wake
from<00:04:56.250> from<00:04:56.729> a<00:04:56.820> distance<00:04:57.270> without<00:04:57.419> falling

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
from from a distance without falling

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.990 
from from a distance without falling
every<00:04:58.229> time<00:04:58.409> do<00:04:58.919> without<00:04:59.190> a<00:04:59.220> rope<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.759> try<00:04:59.940> to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
every time do without a rope you try to

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.640 
every time do without a rope you try to
do<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.539> run<00:05:00.720> out<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:00.990> back<00:05:01.169> now<00:05:01.199> they

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
do that you run out the back now they

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.499 
do that you run out the back now they
got<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.889> get<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.130> back<00:05:02.280> up<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.240> can<00:05:03.360> learn

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
got to get you back up so you can learn

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:04.969 
got to get you back up so you can learn
a<00:05:03.570> lot<00:05:03.750> quicker<00:05:03.990> because<00:05:04.229> you<00:05:04.440> can<00:05:04.590> practice

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
a lot quicker because you can practice

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.920 
a lot quicker because you can practice
it<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.310> fall<00:05:05.699> back<00:05:05.940> again<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.479> practice<00:05:06.900> that

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
it and fall back again the practice that

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.260 
it and fall back again the practice that
keep<00:05:07.289> doing<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.650> over<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:07.889> over<00:05:08.039> again<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:09.120> it

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
keep doing it over and over again and it

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.659 
keep doing it over and over again and it
just<00:05:09.479> it<00:05:09.750> gives<00:05:10.259> you<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.770> muscle<00:05:11.280> memory<00:05:11.580> so

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
just it gives you that muscle memory so

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.659 
just it gives you that muscle memory so
that<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.120> can<00:05:12.270> learn<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.750> do<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:14.220> fall<00:05:14.430> back

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
that you can learn to do to to fall back

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.300 
that you can learn to do to to fall back
and<00:05:14.880> get<00:05:15.630> back<00:05:15.659> in<00:05:16.139> so<00:05:16.800> when<00:05:16.949> you<00:05:17.009> start<00:05:17.250> doing

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
and get back in so when you start doing

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.089 
and get back in so when you start doing
bigger<00:05:17.759> tricks<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.509> you<00:05:19.110> end<00:05:19.409> up<00:05:19.590> further<00:05:19.919> out

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
bigger tricks and you end up further out

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.430 
bigger tricks and you end up further out
of<00:05:20.219> them<00:05:20.340> out<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.639> the<00:05:20.820> wake<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.659> can<00:05:21.840> correct

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
of them out of the wake you can correct

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.899 
of them out of the wake you can correct
yourself<00:05:22.560> get<00:05:23.009> back<00:05:23.159> in<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:23.580> continue

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
yourself get back in and continue

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:28.010 
yourself get back in and continue
writing<00:05:25.099> yeah<00:05:26.099> and<00:05:26.400> basically<00:05:27.240> this<00:05:27.780> also

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
writing yeah and basically this also

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.810 
writing yeah and basically this also
helps<00:05:28.500> because<00:05:28.590> then<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:29.009> driver<00:05:29.280> isn't

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
helps because then the driver isn't

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.459 
helps because then the driver isn't
always<00:05:30.120> turning<00:05:30.539> around<00:05:30.930> turning<00:05:31.229> around

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
always turning around turning around

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.379 
always turning around turning around
while<00:05:31.860> you're<00:05:32.009> practicing<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:33.120> know<00:05:33.240> going

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
while you're practicing you know going

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:34.670 
while you're practicing you know going
to<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.630> back<00:05:33.780> of<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:33.960> wake<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.229> falling<00:05:34.530> out

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
to the back of the wake and falling out

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.860 
to the back of the wake and falling out
so<00:05:34.889> it<00:05:35.430> helps<00:05:35.639> you<00:05:35.729> learn<00:05:35.909> a<00:05:35.969> lot<00:05:36.210> faster<00:05:36.659> we
