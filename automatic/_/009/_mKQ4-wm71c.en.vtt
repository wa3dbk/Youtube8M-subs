hi<00:00:04.480> guys<00:00:04.720> piers<00:00:05.050> ward<00:00:05.319> from<00:00:05.529> me<00:00:05.680> and<00:00:05.770> my<00:00:05.859> golf

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.130 
hi guys piers ward from me and my golf

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.620 
hi guys piers ward from me and my golf
today<00:00:06.700> we're<00:00:06.970> going<00:00:07.060> to<00:00:07.149> be<00:00:07.210> talking<00:00:07.479> about

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.630 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.540 
today we're going to be talking about
the<00:00:07.870> swing<00:00:08.139> plane<00:00:08.440> so<00:00:09.160> I'm<00:00:09.220> gonna<00:00:09.309> give<00:00:09.429> you<00:00:09.490> a

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.550 
the swing plane so I'm gonna give you a

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.090 
the swing plane so I'm gonna give you a
very<00:00:09.730> simple<00:00:10.059> concept<00:00:10.660> and<00:00:10.840> a<00:00:11.320> simple<00:00:11.710> drill

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
very simple concept and a simple drill

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.509 
very simple concept and a simple drill
in<00:00:12.340> which<00:00:12.880> to<00:00:13.060> achieve<00:00:13.390> a<00:00:13.420> better<00:00:13.660> swing<00:00:13.990> plane

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
in which to achieve a better swing plane

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.099 
in which to achieve a better swing plane
so<00:00:15.519> this<00:00:15.640> can<00:00:15.790> be<00:00:15.880> done<00:00:16.059> in<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.299> office<00:00:16.480> it<00:00:17.019> can

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109 
so this can be done in the office it can

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.550 
so this can be done in the office it can
be<00:00:17.260> done<00:00:17.519> at<00:00:18.519> home<00:00:18.849> in<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.300> garden<00:00:19.560> even

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
be done at home in the garden even

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.659 
be done at home in the garden even
indoors<00:00:20.980> a<00:00:21.339> mirror<00:00:21.909> is<00:00:22.179> preferable<00:00:23.579> give<00:00:24.579> you

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
indoors a mirror is preferable give you

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.419 
indoors a mirror is preferable give you
some<00:00:24.820> instant<00:00:25.150> feedback<00:00:26.069> here's<00:00:27.069> a<00:00:27.159> drill

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
some instant feedback here's a drill

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.559 
some instant feedback here's a drill
here's<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.730> concept<00:00:28.239> to<00:00:28.509> say<00:00:28.829> so<00:00:29.829> in<00:00:30.329> the<00:00:31.329> golf

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:31.569 
here's the concept to say so in the golf

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.830 
here's the concept to say so in the golf
swing<00:00:31.749> the<00:00:32.560> club<00:00:32.890> shaft<00:00:33.340> is<00:00:33.700> parallel<00:00:34.540> to<00:00:34.570> the

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
swing the club shaft is parallel to the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.110 
swing the club shaft is parallel to the
ground<00:00:35.399> five<00:00:36.399> times

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
ground five times

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.549 
ground five times
there's<00:00:37.600> point<00:00:38.019> one<00:00:39.300> point<00:00:40.300> two<00:00:40.719> not<00:00:41.230> always

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
there's point one point two not always

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.110 
there's point one point two not always
achieved<00:00:41.949> now<00:00:42.219> but<00:00:42.519> even<00:00:42.670> by<00:00:42.789> some<00:00:42.969> of<00:00:43.059> the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
achieved now but even by some of the

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.189 
achieved now but even by some of the
best<00:00:43.359> players<00:00:43.570> in<00:00:43.719> the<00:00:43.809> world<00:00:43.870> they<00:00:44.170> may

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
best players in the world they may

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.380 
best players in the world they may
prefer<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.649> slightly<00:00:44.980> shorter<00:00:45.129> swing<00:00:45.550> but

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
prefer a slightly shorter swing but

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.250 
prefer a slightly shorter swing but
there<00:00:47.289> is<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.440> parallel<00:00:47.769> point<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.219> potentially

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
there is a parallel point to potentially

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.750 
there is a parallel point to potentially
points<00:00:50.260> three<00:00:51.570> four<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:54.269> five<00:00:56.160> okay<00:00:57.190> here's<00:00:57.640> a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
points three four and five okay here's a

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.200 
points three four and five okay here's a
trick<00:00:57.940> if<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.859> when<00:01:00.550> you<00:01:00.670> are<00:01:00.789> swinging<00:01:01.089> the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
trick if you when you are swinging the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.610 
trick if you when you are swinging the
golf<00:01:01.269> club<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:03.129> reaches<00:01:04.290> parallel<00:01:05.290> point

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
golf club and it reaches parallel point

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.000 
golf club and it reaches parallel point
one<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:07.180> then<00:01:07.420> parallel<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.590> alignment

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
one it is then parallel to the alignment

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.240 
one it is then parallel to the alignment
aid<00:01:09.340> on<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.550> ground<00:01:09.970> our<00:01:10.360> target<00:01:10.900> line<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
aid on the ground our target line you

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.550 
aid on the ground our target line you
are<00:01:12.400> on<00:01:12.580> plane<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:16.630> we<00:01:16.750> have<00:01:16.900> it<00:01:17.020> parallel

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
are on plane so here we have it parallel

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.850 
are on plane so here we have it parallel
point<00:01:17.890> one<00:01:18.130> parallel<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.240> ground

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
point one parallel to the ground

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.820 
point one parallel to the ground
parallel<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.700> target<00:01:21.940> line<00:01:23.670> point<00:01:24.670> two

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
parallel to the target line point two

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.390 
parallel to the target line point two
here's<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.070> moneymaker<00:01:28.200> point<00:01:29.200> three<00:01:29.740> this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
here's the moneymaker point three this

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.770 
here's the moneymaker point three this
is<00:01:30.520> where<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.820> best<00:01:31.120> players<00:01:31.450> in<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.690> world

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
is where the best players in the world

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.540 
is where the best players in the world
are<00:01:32.140> if<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.680> want<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.920> hit<00:01:33.010> straight<00:01:33.190> golf

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
are if you want to hit straight golf

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.180 
are if you want to hit straight golf
shots<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:34.450> need<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.780> be<00:01:34.900> here<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.470> need<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.010> be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
shots you need to be here you need to be

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.690 
shots you need to be here you need to be
at<00:01:36.610> parallel<00:01:37.390> point<00:01:37.720> three<00:01:38.520> parallel<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.640> your

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
at parallel point three parallel to your

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.950 
at parallel point three parallel to your
target<00:01:40.060> line<00:01:41.130> point<00:01:42.130> four<00:01:42.780> happens<00:01:43.780> as<00:01:43.930> a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
target line point four happens as a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.830 
target line point four happens as a
result<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.500> three<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.070> then<00:01:45.970> parallel<00:01:46.480> point

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
result of three and then parallel point

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.420 
result of three and then parallel point
five<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.880> if<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.500> want<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.830> hit<00:01:50.920> straight<00:01:51.100> golf

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
five so if you want to hit straight golf

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.400 
five so if you want to hit straight golf
shots<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.510> want<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.780> drill<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.350> a

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
shots and you want to drill and a

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.560 
shots and you want to drill and a
concept<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.400> believe<00:01:55.030> this<00:01:55.150> is<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.420> most

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
concept I believe this is the most

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.080 
concept I believe this is the most
simple<00:01:56.170> one<00:01:56.290> you<00:01:56.320> can<00:01:56.590> use<00:01:56.860> what<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.700> would<00:01:57.880> like

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
simple one you can use what I would like

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.920 
simple one you can use what I would like
you<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.270> do<00:01:58.510> is<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:58.960> give<00:01:59.860> it<00:01:59.890> a<00:02:00.040> go<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.930> inform
