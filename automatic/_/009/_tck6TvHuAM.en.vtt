00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
for the hand you'll see it's split here

want to strip it very easy fix depending

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.910 
want to strip it very easy fix depending
on where<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:17.000> loose<00:01:17.240> mine<00:01:17.750> is<00:01:18.050> loose<00:01:18.320> right

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
on where it's loose mine is loose right

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.800 
on where it's loose mine is loose right
here<00:01:19.330> grab<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.479> screw<00:01:20.810> driver<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.570> give<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:23.690> a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
here grab the screw driver and give it a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.520 
here grab the screw driver and give it a
fair<00:01:24.619> amount<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:25.040> force<00:01:25.960> into<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.080> screw<00:01:27.350> so

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
fair amount of force into the screw so

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.539 
fair amount of force into the screw so
you<00:01:27.590> don't<00:01:27.799> just<00:01:27.890> spin<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.549> in<00:01:28.790> strip<00:01:29.689> it<00:01:30.549> right

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
you don't just spin it in strip it right

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.969 
you don't just spin it in strip it right
and<00:01:31.729> you'll<00:01:31.790> see<00:01:32.479> that's<00:01:33.080> all<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.500> took<00:01:33.710> for

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
and you'll see that's all it took for

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.060 
and you'll see that's all it took for
him<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.840> hold<00:01:35.840> up<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.080> gun<00:01:36.290> now<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.710> course<00:01:36.890> I

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
him to hold up the gun now of course I

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.640 
him to hold up the gun now of course I
can<00:01:37.310> go<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.820> screw<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.270> in<00:01:38.420> even<00:01:38.570> tighter<00:01:38.900> but

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
can go and screw it in even tighter but

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.530 
can go and screw it in even tighter but
at<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:39.799> point<00:01:40.130> I'm<00:01:41.119> going<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.360> risk

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
at that point I'm going to risk

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.480 
at that point I'm going to risk
stripping<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.229> what<00:01:42.799> you<00:01:42.890> might<00:01:43.100> want<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.400> do

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
stripping it what you might want to do

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.280 
stripping it what you might want to do
is<00:01:43.610> just<00:01:43.640> take<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.060> two<00:01:44.240> halves<00:01:44.509> off<00:01:44.780> maybe

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
is just take the two halves off maybe

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.289 
is just take the two halves off maybe
apply<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.799> little<00:01:46.009> nail<00:01:46.369> polish<00:01:46.790> in<00:01:46.939> between

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
apply a little nail polish in between

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.760 
apply a little nail polish in between
the<00:01:47.450> haves<00:01:47.900> just<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.350> get<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.530> little<00:01:48.650> more

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
the haves just to get a little more

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.789 
the haves just to get a little more
friction<00:01:49.189> going<00:01:50.000> on<00:01:50.270> there<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:50.900> yeah<00:01:51.439> I'm<00:01:51.560> kind

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
friction going on there so yeah I'm kind

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.590 
friction going on there so yeah I'm kind
of<00:01:51.830> glad<00:01:51.950> that's<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.640> only<00:01:52.820> issues<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.360> had
