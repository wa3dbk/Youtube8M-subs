00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
slight curve or bend and that isn't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.849 
slight curve or bend and that isn't
because<00:01:56.869> there's<00:01:57.139> another<00:01:57.349> bengay

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
because there's another bengay

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.589 
because there's another bengay
controversy<00:01:58.429> here<00:01:58.729> but<00:01:59.029> the<00:01:59.149> fact<00:01:59.359> that<00:01:59.450> the

controversy here but the fact that the

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.449 
controversy here but the fact that the
device<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.139> meant<00:02:00.499> to<00:02:00.590> be<00:02:00.619> curved<00:02:01.009> slightly

that<00:02:01.759> way<00:02:01.819> when<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:02.270> drop<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.659> facedown<00:02:02.899> it<00:02:03.499> is

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:03.889 
that way when you drop it facedown it is

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.099 
that way when you drop it facedown it is
twenty<00:02:04.249> percent<00:02:04.609> more<00:02:04.969> resistant<00:02:05.599> to<00:02:05.840> damage

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
twenty percent more resistant to damage

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.830 
twenty percent more resistant to damage
it<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:07.279> isn't<00:02:07.579> noticeable<00:02:07.849> at<00:02:08.209> all<00:02:08.239> and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
it really isn't noticeable at all and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.630 
it really isn't noticeable at all and
when<00:02:09.409> laying<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.709> down<00:02:09.739> I<00:02:09.890> have<00:02:10.129> to<00:02:10.250> say<00:02:10.429> it

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
when laying it down I have to say it

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.460 
when laying it down I have to say it
looks<00:02:10.909> pretty<00:02:11.239> cool<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.079> device<00:02:12.319> itself

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
tour around the device and the software

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.160 
tour around the device and the software
and<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.760> past<00:02:43.880> years<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.360> thing<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.990> is

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
and in the past years the thing that is

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.950 
and in the past years the thing that is
really<00:02:45.650> broken<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.520> for<00:02:46.730> me<00:02:46.850> with<00:02:47.030> LG<00:02:47.450> devices

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
really broken it for me with LG devices

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.950 
really broken it for me with LG devices
is<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.890> software<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.430> absolutely<00:02:50.210> hated<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.810> i

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
is the software I absolutely hated it i

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.260 
is the software I absolutely hated it i
thought<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.260> visual<00:02:51.680> experience<00:02:52.280> wasn't<00:02:53.030> the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
thought the visual experience wasn't the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.870 
thought the visual experience wasn't the
best<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.960> it<00:02:54.620> just<00:02:54.890> seemed<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.220> stutter<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.610> lot

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
best and it just seemed to stutter a lot

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.630 
best and it just seemed to stutter a lot
the<00:02:56.090> g3<00:02:56.600> experience<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.650> LG<00:02:57.950> flex<00:02:58.310> also

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
the g3 experience that the LG flex also

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.430 
the g3 experience that the LG flex also
experienced<00:02:59.240> that<00:02:59.390> but<00:02:59.810> playing<00:03:00.050> around<00:03:00.230> with

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
experienced that but playing around with

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.200 
experienced that but playing around with
the<00:03:00.590> softer<00:03:00.980> here<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.400> definitely<00:03:01.730> notice<00:03:02.090> that

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
the softer here I definitely notice that

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.180 
the softer here I definitely notice that
it<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.450> far<00:03:02.750> more<00:03:02.930> responsive<00:03:03.560> than<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.920> past

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
it is far more responsive than the past

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.700 
it is far more responsive than the past
years<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.840> be<00:03:05.870> expected<00:03:05.990> out<00:03:06.680> of

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
years and that is to be expected out of

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.740 
years and that is to be expected out of
a<00:03:06.890> flagship<00:03:07.310> device<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:08.030> was<00:03:08.240> quite<00:03:08.450> surprised

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
a flagship device I was quite surprised

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.770 
a flagship device I was quite surprised
when<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:08.990> noticed<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.710> in<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.340> g3<00:03:10.850> like<00:03:11.690> I

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
when I noticed like in the g3 like I

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.330 
when I noticed like in the g3 like I
mentioned<00:03:11.990> earlier<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.770> video<00:03:12.950> this

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
mentioned earlier in the video this

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.850 
mentioned earlier in the video this
display<00:03:13.790> is<00:03:13.820> much<00:03:14.510> brighter<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.260> probably

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
display is much brighter and probably

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.650 
display is much brighter and probably
one<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.460> brightest<00:03:16.820> displays<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.510> have

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
one of the brightest displays I have

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.050 
one of the brightest displays I have
ever<00:03:17.900> seen<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.680> as<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.130> result<00:03:19.400> of<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.730> if

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
ever seen and as a result of that if

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.820 
ever seen and as a result of that if
you're<00:03:20.180> using<00:03:20.300> your<00:03:20.540> vice<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.990> sunlight<00:03:21.620> it

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
you're using your vice in sunlight it

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.100 
you're using your vice in sunlight it
should<00:03:22.040> fare<00:03:22.250> very<00:03:22.280> well<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:23.510> viewing<00:03:23.810> angles

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
should fare very well the viewing angles

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.990 
should fare very well the viewing angles
are<00:03:24.230> also<00:03:24.380> great<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.100> what<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:25.580> notice<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:25.940> that

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
are also great and what I notice is that

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.720 
are also great and what I notice is that
the<00:03:26.210> colors<00:03:26.600> are<00:03:26.840> extremely<00:03:27.740> vivid<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.550> may

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
the colors are extremely vivid that may

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.160 
the colors are extremely vivid that may
not<00:03:28.850> offer<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.180> most<00:03:29.300> accurate<00:03:29.720> color

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
not offer the most accurate color

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.200 
not offer the most accurate color
representation<00:03:30.620> but<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.400> looks<00:03:31.580> damn<00:03:31.910> good<00:03:31.940> in

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
representation but it looks damn good in

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.090 
representation but it looks damn good in
my<00:03:32.390> opinion<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:33.110> if<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.800> want<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.070> more

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
my opinion and if you want a more

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.070 
my opinion and if you want a more
accurate<00:03:34.460> look<00:03:34.880> you<00:03:35.030> can<00:03:35.210> also<00:03:35.420> switch<00:03:35.960> the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
accurate look you can also switch the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.470 
accurate look you can also switch the
displays<00:03:36.500> mode<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.220> natural<00:03:37.940> which<00:03:38.210> will<00:03:38.360> kind
