00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.779 

when<00:00:26.439> breeding<00:00:26.830> snakes<00:00:27.130> it's<00:00:27.340> more<00:00:27.550> about

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
when breeding snakes it's more about

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.759 
when breeding snakes it's more about
procedure<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:28.660> diligence<00:00:29.259> than<00:00:29.439> it<00:00:29.590> is

procedure and diligence than it is
really<00:00:30.130> about<00:00:30.340> knowledge<00:00:30.820> don't<00:00:31.210> get<00:00:31.390> me

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
really about knowledge don't get me

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.360 
really about knowledge don't get me
wrong<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.960> knowledge<00:00:32.320> is<00:00:32.470> really<00:00:32.649> important

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
wrong the knowledge is really important

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.250 
wrong the knowledge is really important
but<00:00:33.700> it's<00:00:33.879> really<00:00:34.180> about<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.600> workout<00:00:35.020> that

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
but it's really about the workout that

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.350 
but it's really about the workout that
you<00:00:35.440> have<00:00:35.739> for<00:00:36.250> instance<00:00:36.460> with<00:00:36.640> ball<00:00:36.879> pythons

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
you have for instance with ball pythons

you have for instance with ball pythons
we<00:00:37.540> set<00:00:37.780> up<00:00:37.870> groups<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:38.290> are<00:00:38.440> one<00:00:38.650> male<00:00:38.890> to

you'll have as much success breeding is

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.240 
you'll have as much success breeding is
even<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.600> best<00:00:55.839> breeder<00:00:56.260> out<00:00:56.470> there<00:00:56.739> so<00:00:57.129> the

these<00:00:58.809> females<00:00:59.229> cages<00:00:59.710> is<00:00:59.830> in<00:01:00.040> hopes<00:01:00.369> to<00:01:00.519> get

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
these females cages is in hopes to get

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.000 
these females cages is in hopes to get
breeding<00:01:01.210> or<00:01:01.299> lock<00:01:01.720> ups<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.500> gives<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.860> the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
breeding or lock ups that gives you the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.160 
breeding or lock ups that gives you the
best<00:01:03.220> chance<00:01:03.580> of<00:01:03.729> getting<00:01:03.790> eggs<00:01:04.360> obviously

best chance of getting eggs obviously

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.170 
best chance of getting eggs obviously
now<00:01:05.560> every<00:01:05.950> time<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:06.310> put<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> male<00:01:06.760> in<00:01:06.970> you're

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
now every time you put a male in you're

now every time you put a male in you're
not<00:01:07.390> going<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.720> get<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:07.900> lock-up<00:01:08.439> but<00:01:08.770> you're

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
not going to get a lock-up but you're

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.800 
not going to get a lock-up but you're

babies or in this case eggs this is
actually<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.100> clutch<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.520> ball<00:01:24.670> pythons<00:01:25.180> this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
actually a clutch of ball pythons this

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.359 
actually a clutch of ball pythons this
is<00:01:25.479> a<00:01:25.509> head<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:25.990> Carmel<00:01:26.380> by<00:01:26.560> annal<00:01:26.770> bred<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.340> a

is a head for Carmel by annal bred to a
caramel<00:01:27.850> pinstripe<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:28.479> we<00:01:28.600> could<00:01:28.840> get<00:01:28.960> some

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
caramel pinstripe so we could get some

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.109 
caramel pinstripe so we could get some
caramel<00:01:29.530> pinstripes<00:01:30.009> as<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.549> can<00:01:30.700> see<00:01:30.880> she's

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
caramel pinstripes as you can see she's

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.489 
caramel pinstripes as you can see she's
on<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.299> clutch<00:01:31.539> of<00:01:31.689> eggs<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.079> she's<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.259> little

on a clutch of eggs and she's a little
bit<00:01:32.619> defensive<00:01:32.859> so<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.460> have<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.820> be<00:01:33.909> careful

eggs<00:01:54.130> here<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.549> one<00:01:54.789> slug<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:55.299> is<00:01:55.450> what<00:01:55.600> a

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
eggs here in one slug this is what a

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.480 
eggs here in one slug this is what a
slug<00:01:56.020> looks<00:01:56.259> like<00:01:56.409> but<00:01:56.619> these<00:01:56.740> five<00:01:57.009> eggs<00:01:57.249> look

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
perfect and what's neat is I don't even

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.629 
perfect and what's neat is I don't even
have<00:01:59.289> to<00:01:59.409> tear<00:01:59.619> these<00:01:59.770> apart<00:02:00.159> because<00:02:00.310> they're

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:00.639 
have to tear these apart because they're

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:02.399 
have to tear these apart because they're
laying<00:02:00.850> really<00:02:01.329> good<00:02:01.509> what<00:02:01.929> I'll<00:02:02.049> do<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.319> I'll

laying really good what I'll do is I'll

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.169 
laying really good what I'll do is I'll
just<00:02:02.590> lay<00:02:02.770> them<00:02:02.889> right<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.490> hatch<00:02:03.819> right

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
just lay them right in this hatch right

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.480 
just lay them right in this hatch right
just<00:02:04.689> like<00:02:04.840> they<00:02:05.020> are<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:05.530> what<00:02:06.009> I<00:02:06.039> do<00:02:06.159> is<00:02:06.399> I

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
just like they are and what I do is I

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.639 
just like they are and what I do is I
make<00:02:06.639> sure<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:06.909> mark<00:02:07.270> what<00:02:07.479> they<00:02:07.630> are<00:02:07.810> on<00:02:08.110> the

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
make sure to mark what they are on the

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.160 
make sure to mark what they are on the
egg<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.729> what<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.270> data<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.929> they<00:02:11.110> were

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
egg and what the data is that they were

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.990 
egg and what the data is that they were
laid<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:12.190> way<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.370> know<00:02:12.550> when<00:02:12.880> they're

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
laid and that way I know when they're

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.520 
laid and that way I know when they're
going<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.180> hatch<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.690> what<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.990> can<00:02:14.170> expect

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
going to hatch and what I can expect

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.020 
going to hatch and what I can expect
from<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:14.800> clutch<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.340> course<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.730> put<00:02:15.940> him

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
from this clutch and of course I put him

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.820 
from this clutch and of course I put him
down<00:02:16.209> an<00:02:16.390> egg<00:02:16.600> data<00:02:16.870> book<00:02:17.140> too<00:02:17.319> but<00:02:17.530> it's

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
down an egg data book too but it's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.230 
down an egg data book too but it's
always<00:02:18.069> great<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.430> get<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.730> clutch<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.000> eggs

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
always great to get a clutch of eggs

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.180 
always great to get a clutch of eggs
just<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.260> Python<00:02:20.440> room<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> clue

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
just like in the Python room the clue

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.070 
just like in the Python room the clue
bird<00:02:21.370> room<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.700> even<00:02:22.000> more<00:02:22.360> important<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.930> be

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
bird room is even more important to be

bred if we push them too far we may get

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.200 
bred if we push them too far we may get
some<00:02:32.920> infertility<00:02:33.459> which

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
some infertility which
