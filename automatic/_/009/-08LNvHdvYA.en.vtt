00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
like that but this is all about just

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.540 
like that but this is all about just
getting<00:01:42.180> some<00:01:42.570> reflexes<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.920> just

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.210 

ok<00:01:53.490> let's<00:01:53.819> just<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.210> some<00:01:54.950> ideas<00:01:55.950> what<00:01:56.100> we're

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
ok let's just have some ideas what we're

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.440 
ok let's just have some ideas what we're
trying<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.550> achieve<00:01:56.700> we're<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
trying to achieve we're just going to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.540 
trying to achieve we're just going to
hit<00:01:57.630> hit<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.200> ball<00:01:58.410> it's<00:01:59.190> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> bounce

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
hit hit the ball it's going to bounce

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.550 
hit hit the ball it's going to bounce
off<00:01:59.819> here<00:02:00.179> and<00:02:00.390> hopefully<00:02:00.630> not<00:02:01.020> hit<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.380> on

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
off here and hopefully not hit you on

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.160 
off here and hopefully not hit you on
the<00:02:02.130> rebound<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.509> you've<00:02:03.600> got<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.899> able<00:02:03.929> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the rebound so you've got to be able to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.010 
the rebound so you've got to be able to
move<00:02:04.350> forward<00:02:04.800> with<00:02:05.069> your<00:02:05.340> strike<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.509> what

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
move forward with your strike so what
