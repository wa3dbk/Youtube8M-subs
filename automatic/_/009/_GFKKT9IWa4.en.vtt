but<00:00:04.370> that's<00:00:05.690> okay

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
but that's okay

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.169 
but that's okay
here's<00:00:07.319> front<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.859> here's<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.580> head<00:00:08.880> that<00:00:09.059> we

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
here's front on here's a head that we

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.259 
here's front on here's a head that we
just<00:00:09.389> made<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:10.380> upper<00:00:10.920> arms<00:00:11.750> here<00:00:12.750> are<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
just made is upper arms here are the

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.250 
just made is upper arms here are the
blade<00:00:15.269> arms<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:17.029> here<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> legs<00:00:18.600> which

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
blade arms and here are the legs which

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.960 
blade arms and here are the legs which
probably<00:00:19.800> want<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.039> reshape<00:00:20.430> again<00:00:20.760> because

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
probably want to reshape again because

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.939 
probably want to reshape again because
they<00:00:21.060> got<00:00:21.240> messed<00:00:21.480> up<00:00:27.380> there's<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> carapace

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
they got messed up there's a carapace

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.460 
they got messed up there's a carapace
and<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.250> want<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> make<00:00:29.550> sure<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:30.349> it<00:00:31.349> gets

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and you want to make sure that it gets

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.830 
and you want to make sure that it gets
close<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:34.070> close<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> tail<00:00:35.780> you<00:00:36.780> can

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
close to the close to the tail you can

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
close to the close to the tail you can
you<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.350> fold<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.129> doesn't<00:00:38.160> look

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you can fold this in so it doesn't look

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
you can fold this in so it doesn't look
so<00:00:38.520> pointy<00:00:39.000> -<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:46.320> way<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.530> looks<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> little

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so pointy - that way it looks a little

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.160 
so pointy - that way it looks a little
better<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:48.239> tail<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.570> kind<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> sticks

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
better the tail just kind of sticks

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.680 
better the tail just kind of sticks
straight<00:00:49.320> out<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.989> you're<00:00:51.989> pretty<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.230> done

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
straight out and you're pretty much done

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.029 
straight out and you're pretty much done
one<00:00:54.690> thing<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> arms<00:00:55.590> are<00:00:55.710> sticking

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
one thing is that the arms are sticking

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.000 
one thing is that the arms are sticking
out<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> side<00:00:56.670> I'm<00:00:57.090> gonna<00:00:57.410> bend<00:00:58.410> them<00:00:58.680> in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
out to the side I'm gonna bend them in

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.819 
out to the side I'm gonna bend them in
because<00:00:59.460> zerglings<00:01:00.079> mom<00:01:01.079> start<00:01:01.440> kind<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> more

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
because zerglings mom start kind of more

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.289 
because zerglings mom start kind of more
in<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> out<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.229> bending<00:01:04.739> them<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
in and out so I'm just bending them in

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.609 
in and out so I'm just bending them in
and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> legs<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.930> kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.200> messed<00:01:07.409> up

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and then the legs are kind of messed up

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.480 
and then the legs are kind of messed up
I<00:01:07.890> think<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.729> need<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:08.970> crease<00:01:10.220> crease<00:01:11.220> them<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
I think I need to crease crease them a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.570 
I think I need to crease crease them a
little<00:01:11.790> harder<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.630> stay<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:12.960> shape

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.469 

harder<00:01:21.830> fold<00:01:22.830> them<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> little<00:01:23.310> bit

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.500 

hold<00:01:27.479> them<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:30.860> stay

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.150 

today<00:01:36.260> basically<00:01:38.110> not<00:01:39.110> all<00:01:39.440> tangled<00:01:39.830> up<00:01:39.950> with

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
today basically not all tangled up with

00:01:40.160 --> 00:02:00.350 
today basically not all tangled up with
each<00:01:40.280> other<00:01:47.590> okay<00:01:51.040> this<00:01:52.040> is<00:01:52.220> Irving

another<00:02:11.550> video<00:02:11.880> for<00:02:12.680> my<00:02:13.680> origami<00:02:14.640> Hydralisk

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
another video for my origami Hydralisk

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.590 
another video for my origami Hydralisk
that's<00:02:18.020> slow<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.470> one<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:19.950> narrated
