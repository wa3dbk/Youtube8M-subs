00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
back of his hand like so so that when he

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.050 
back of his hand like so so that when he
tips<00:00:32.930> his<00:00:32.990> hand<00:00:33.290> back<00:00:33.470> that<00:00:33.829> will<00:00:36.670> turn<00:00:37.670> this

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
tips his hand back that will turn this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.530 
tips his hand back that will turn this
push<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:39.079> hinged<00:00:39.739> piece<00:00:40.190> back<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.790> the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
push this hinged piece back and the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.690 
push this hinged piece back and the
effect<00:00:42.020> of<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.230> obviously<00:00:42.560> is<00:00:43.100> that<00:00:43.130> that

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
effect of that obviously is that that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.660 
effect of that obviously is that that
becomes<00:00:44.060> your<00:00:44.180> trigger<00:00:47.530> so<00:00:48.530> how<00:00:49.190> we<00:00:49.250> get<00:00:49.489> that

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
becomes your trigger so how we get that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.560 
becomes your trigger so how we get that
done<00:00:49.910> on<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:51.050> inside<00:00:51.410> I<00:00:52.360> apologize<00:00:53.360> for<00:00:53.480> the

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
done on the inside I apologize for the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.150 
done on the inside I apologize for the
horrible<00:00:53.809> focus<00:00:54.260> I<00:00:54.470> have<00:00:54.739> a<00:00:54.800> stripped<00:00:55.100> down

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
horrible focus I have a stripped down

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.790 
horrible focus I have a stripped down

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.200 
left but the speaker part of the circuit
board<00:01:00.160> cut<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:01.280> down<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.700> just<00:01:01.969> having<00:01:02.149> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
board cut it down to just having the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.370 
board cut it down to just having the
microprocessor<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:04.100> connections<00:01:04.549> for<00:01:04.760> power

connections to both power and to the
light<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.180> then<00:01:11.750> I've<00:01:11.870> wired<00:01:12.470> in<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.860> teeny

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
light and then I've wired in a teeny

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.250 
light and then I've wired in a teeny
tiny<00:01:13.610> little<00:01:13.940> micro<00:01:14.390> switch<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:14.870> think<00:01:15.140> I<00:01:15.200> took

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
tiny little micro switch I think I took

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.990 
tiny little micro switch I think I took
that<00:01:15.409> off<00:01:15.619> of<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.799> flash<00:01:16.070> camera<00:01:16.610> one<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:16.940> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
that off of a flash camera one of the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.620 
that off of a flash camera one of the
push<00:01:17.210> buttons<00:01:17.510> for<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:18.850> but<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.180> thing<00:01:20.420> that

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
push buttons for that but the thing that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.880 
push buttons for that but the thing that
makes<00:01:20.900> this<00:01:21.170> work<00:01:21.500> is<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.520> little<00:01:23.000> ribbon

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
makes this work is the little ribbon

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.859 
makes this work is the little ribbon
that<00:01:24.890> runs<00:01:25.190> back<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.850> forth<00:01:26.119> between<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:28.869> the

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
that runs back and forth between the the

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.480 
that runs back and forth between the the
piece<00:01:30.110> that's<00:01:30.290> in<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.530> back<00:01:30.740> here<00:01:31.070> where<00:01:31.340> it's

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
piece that's in the back here where it's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.730 
piece that's in the back here where it's
mounted<00:01:31.939> through<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.960> little<00:01:33.110> tunnel<00:01:33.439> here

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
mounted through the little tunnel here

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.679

and<00:01:34.040> then<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.549> slides<00:01:34.970> up<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.360> down<00:01:35.510> up

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
and then just slides up and down up

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.510 
and then just slides up and down up
there<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.409> has<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.560> stopper<00:01:37.070> on<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:37.369> that

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
there it has a stopper on and that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.399 
there it has a stopper on and that
stopper<00:01:38.060> when<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.330> pull<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:38.630> far<00:01:38.840> enough<00:01:38.960> hits
