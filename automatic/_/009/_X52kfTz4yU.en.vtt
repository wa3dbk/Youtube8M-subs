00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 boo 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.559
 voodoo 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.570
 Hmm 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.680
 Yes, it is this 51.8 to introduce from now on 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.070
 It took in this lens single 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.360
 So the power of this lens is 8 together 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.360
 I think if you can see it 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.670
 If you are in a party, please think that this is the power of the lens, not me 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:48.550
 For example, even if you take such a signboard, the flower in the foreground 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.550
 And come out the three-dimensional effect as before received in the moss come 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:01:01.800
 If you have light in the background that takes this kind of technology, it will turn out to be a very soft light 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.800
 And this can express a three-dimensional effect by feeling like floating 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.600
 Yes, I feel what I want to express when I take a cool difference in the way of expression 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.290
 When 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:19.770
 I feel a sense of quality now when I take it a little more up when I go through it while putting a blur in the background with a slight tendency 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.770
 Come 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.740
 A little I'd subtle when you want to show the texture of the craft name Toka You're those things cooking 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:33.450
 As it approaches 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:37.850
 The pre-sales are also together, showing the whole and using the blur well 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.850
 Go see a room mother at only approach a little in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:50.760
 As I mentioned earlier, I do not show only the food, but when I say the voice 63 generation I take in the effect bar 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.520
 It is also because you are effect is post-residents it is why not take showy but can 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.920
 You can show the depth if you shoot vertically 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.960
 In to here 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.230
 Whitish when the little dish looked at the color of I'd say even this yo anywhere in the wiener 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.690
 Toka I want to take 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.690
 Subtle change also changes the size of the dish 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.310
 Well, I like this side 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.900
 If it changes greatly, it may be different from taste and it will be delicious anywhere 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.240
 Do you see something that looks delicious? 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.470
 I already like it 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.470
 It means that you look at yourself in Larg view and judge your preference 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.370
 First, it is the point solder 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.370
 Organize the background 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:51.930
 Next, move the background to make it appear three-dimensional by moving it up 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.299
 Toshimashite next three eyes 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:01.969
 There are many small items together but there are many knife glasses and so on 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.969
 I'm making a house so as not to be overwhelmed 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:11.799
 Yes there is one more point that makes the food delicious 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.940
 I always want to go there when I'm taking food or taking pictures indoors . 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:19.220
 It's brightness and color 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.930
 When How about a little say orange is it going up vomiting 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.490
 You may not be able to completely challenge the brightness color 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.990
 At this time 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:34.270
 At first we make it bright with correction of brightness plus minus 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:39.280
 Don't look at the numbers The numbers will come later 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:43.150
 Determine the brightness by looking at the state of the screen 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.440
 If you think that the brightness is good with this , it's a white balance color now 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.790
 This color Oko 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.610
 It will change color by mark 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.410
 But I did not see the mark again 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.040
 Looking at the color of the screen 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.170
 This is exactly the same in the finder or ragout depending on the model 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.540
 Let the 8 child in 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:08.140
 But we still put one another first from here, also at 8 birds people that I wonder a little bluish now participate 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.569
 Because there is a little in the triangle direction 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.739
 In the case of 965, it falls here 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.739
 I can display the floor 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.160
 Because it becomes reddish now 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:27.170
 It is why the color has changed and will change the vector of this direction color 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:32.140
 If you also say: If you think this is No, and on the screen until dark 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.140
 Because I decided the color by this, I feel cold and beautiful 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.580
 You say and cooking can take is to use the camera 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.129
 So you ca n't get into the knowledge of photography as it is now 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.619
 You only need to remember this two operations 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.619
 Press the plus or minus button to adjust the brightness 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.470
 Then press the white balance button to change the color of the white balance 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.960
 And another winter here 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:14.940
 May be referred to as step which color quite a one-up you also have do not know any good 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:21.600
 I think there is something that I like my own but when I do not understand 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:25.169
 It's fine if there is a white thing will be about 150,000 use at the time of the old days in this film 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:32.270
 I have a meter in it What is said to be a color meter 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:32.270
 It is and how to set them up is going to far way from the previous white balance of 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.750
 I'm not saying the name custom student, but with a mark like a tulip flower 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.790
 There is a set length 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.980
 I will decide if you fit the mode here 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.849
 The manual comes out, so I'm using the shutter button to focus on the spot 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:53.619
 Say to capture data 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.990
 There is a spot focus in the middle of the maru that is not really because it is really white 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:06:00.900
 Though 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.070
 The camera automatically loads the current brightness even if the shutter is released by combining the white area . 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.129
 You are 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.330
 It seems to be a bright color and if it is decided by this 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.510
 Looks always white of 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.520
 This is 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:17.360
 It's called "white balance" or " sunset " attached to the camera . 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:22.520
 So while looking at here by yourself 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:27.969
 When any do not know color you are good now when it also that you want to match the KoAsa Lu by default 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.969
 Anyone can use a custom set to get a standard color 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.820
 wh 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:46.790
 Yes, I will also eat food and go out next time, so it was night, so study at night 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:46.790
 If you take it and the shop's open 2 billboards only the light around us will make a good picture 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:54.000
 It's all over the air, so we have a strong system to meet 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:09.889
 In this way, if you go in through the mouth and return a lot, it will spread when the photo's rating is on. 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:13.710
 Aware of such Fu rather than that you are Datte you take only the food the day to go to eat now 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:16.430
 I think it will be fun to take what you are getting 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.430
 me
