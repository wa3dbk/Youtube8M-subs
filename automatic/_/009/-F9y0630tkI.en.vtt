capable of doing things like search and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.599 
capable of doing things like search and
rescue<00:00:41.190> well<00:00:41.970> in<00:00:42.120> 2013<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.380> was<00:00:44.040> approached<00:00:44.460> by

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
rescue well in 2013 I was approached by

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.970 
rescue well in 2013 I was approached by
a<00:00:44.730> family<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.629> Garcia<00:00:46.079> family<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.800> they

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.310 
a family the Garcia family and they
asked<00:00:47.309> me<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:48.300> involved<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> search

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
asked me to get involved in the search

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.360 
asked me to get involved in the search
for<00:00:49.649> their<00:00:49.910> her<00:00:50.910> fiance<00:00:51.570> Eric<00:00:51.989> Garcia<00:00:52.469> he<00:00:53.250> had

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.169 
for their her fiance Eric Garcia he had
gone<00:00:53.579> missing

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
gone missing

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.310 
gone missing
somewhere<00:00:55.079> within<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.410> 44<00:00:56.160> miles<00:00:56.460> stretch<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
somewhere within a 44 miles stretch so I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200 
somewhere within a 44 miles stretch so I
decided<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.039> was<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.339> to<00:00:59.429> get<00:00:59.640> involved<00:00:59.940> in

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
decided I was going to get involved in

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.619 
decided I was going to get involved in
that<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:01.469> my<00:01:01.710> UAV<00:01:02.429> I<00:01:02.789> was<00:01:03.269> able<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that and with my UAV I was able to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.830 
that and with my UAV I was able to
narrow<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.379> search<00:01:04.620> field<00:01:05.040> down<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.240> 11

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
narrow the search field down to about 11

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.500 
narrow the search field down to about 11
miles<00:01:07.050> until<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:07.950> finally<00:01:08.430> found<00:01:08.670> him<00:01:08.940> it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
miles until they finally found him it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.870 
miles until they finally found him it
was<00:01:09.690> a<00:01:09.720> sad<00:01:10.080> ending<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.590> story<00:01:10.790> but<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
was a sad ending to that story but it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.060 
was a sad ending to that story but it
inspired<00:01:12.090> me<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:12.990> involved<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.710> search

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
inspired me to get involved in search

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.720 
inspired me to get involved in search
and<00:01:14.250> rescue<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:15.620> decided<00:01:16.620> to<00:01:16.830> start<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.280> network

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
and rescue I decided to start a network

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.830 
and rescue I decided to start a network
an<00:01:17.990> online<00:01:18.990> network<00:01:19.320> where<00:01:20.310> drone<00:01:21.300> pilots

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
an online network where drone pilots

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.500 
an online network where drone pilots
from<00:01:21.990> around<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.560> world<00:01:22.790> could<00:01:23.790> sign<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.300> and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
from around the world could sign up and

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.650 
from around the world could sign up and
offer<00:01:24.810> their<00:01:25.290> own<00:01:25.410> volunteer<00:01:26.190> services<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.540> go

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
offer their own volunteer services to go

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.200 
offer their own volunteer services to go
out<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> search<00:01:28.260> for<00:01:28.590> people<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:29.400> no<00:01:29.880> cost

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
out in the search for people at no cost

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.140 
out in the search for people at no cost
to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.660> family<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:31.890> started<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.640> group

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
to the family so we started a group

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
to the family so we started a group
called<00:01:33.570> SAR<00:01:34.170> drones<00:01:34.680> org<00:01:35.580> or<00:01:35.910> swarm<00:01:36.900> swarm

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
called SAR drones org or swarm swarm

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.720 
called SAR drones org or swarm swarm
stands<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.550> search<00:01:38.910> with<00:01:39.660> an<00:01:39.840> Ariel<00:01:40.350> RC<00:01:40.730> multi

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
stands for search with an Ariel RC multi

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.870 
stands for search with an Ariel RC multi
rotor<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.870> this<00:01:43.050> online<00:01:43.590> network<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.550> has

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
rotor so this online network now has

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
rotor so this online network now has
over<00:01:45.210> 1,100<00:01:46.080> members<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.870> whole<00:01:49.080> mission

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
over 1,100 members so the whole mission

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.149 
over 1,100 members so the whole mission
for<00:01:49.920> SAR<00:01:50.250> drones

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
for SAR drones

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.550 
for SAR drones
is<00:01:51.219> to<00:01:51.729> assist<00:01:52.119> families<00:01:52.509> in<00:01:52.960> finding<00:01:53.409> their

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
is to assist families in finding their

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.099 
is to assist families in finding their
missing<00:01:53.770> family<00:01:54.249> members<00:01:54.869> sometimes<00:01:55.869> it

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
missing family members sometimes it

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.469 
missing family members sometimes it
turns<00:01:56.319> out<00:01:56.560> for<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.219> better<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.670> sometimes

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
turns out for the better and sometimes

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.410 
turns out for the better and sometimes
it's<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.409> sad<00:01:59.649> ending<00:02:00.039> but<00:02:00.609> at<00:02:00.759> least<00:02:00.880> we<00:02:01.119> try<00:02:01.390> to

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
it's a sad ending but at least we try to

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.709 
it's a sad ending but at least we try to
provide<00:02:01.869> closure<00:02:02.319> for<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.829> families<00:02:03.719> there

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
provide closure for the families there

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.120 
provide closure for the families there
are<00:02:04.750> two<00:02:05.020> different<00:02:05.380> types<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.859> drawings

we<00:02:20.049> have<00:02:20.200> two<00:02:20.410> cameras<00:02:20.890> onboard<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.640> we<00:02:21.670> fly

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
we have two cameras onboard and we fly

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.170 
we have two cameras onboard and we fly
