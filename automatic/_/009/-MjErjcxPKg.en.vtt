00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
worked out and I think it sounds really

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.180

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
I added the rims on the drums within a

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.830 
I added the rims on the drums within a
certain<00:04:02.100> section<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.820> so<00:04:03.299> both<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.630> the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
actually teach some of those things it

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.840 
actually teach some of those things it
would<00:04:10.049> take<00:04:10.260> like<00:04:10.500> hours<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:10.980> hours<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.700> so
