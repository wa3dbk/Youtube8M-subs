00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
doctor will will sometimes make a bridge

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.419 
doctor will will sometimes make a bridge
to<00:00:12.240> replace<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:12.870> tooth<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.830> requires

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
to replace that tooth that requires

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.630 
to replace that tooth that requires
putting<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.089> crown<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.719> tooth<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:16.920> either<00:00:17.190> side

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
putting a crown on tooth on either side

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.090 
putting a crown on tooth on either side
of<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.140> these<00:00:19.380> teeth<00:00:19.650> here<00:00:19.980> are

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
of it and so these teeth here are

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.990 
of it and so these teeth here are
prepared<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.090> bridge<00:00:22.550> now<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
prepared for a bridge now this is a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.349 
prepared for a bridge now this is a
bridge<00:00:27.230> that's<00:00:28.230> been<00:00:28.740> made<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.880> see

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
bridge that's been made and you can see

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.250 
bridge that's been made and you can see
it<00:00:30.830> has<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.160> crown<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.360> will<00:00:33.480> go<00:00:33.600> over<00:00:33.989> that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
it has a crown that will go over that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.819 
it has a crown that will go over that
one<00:00:34.559> tooth<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.450> false<00:00:36.450> tooth<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> middle

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
one tooth a false tooth in the middle

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.720 
one tooth a false tooth in the middle
and<00:00:38.100> then<00:00:38.879> another<00:00:39.149> crown<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> other<00:00:40.170> side

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
and then another crown on the other side

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.660 
and then another crown on the other side
so<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.590> is<00:00:43.590> we'll<00:00:43.890> take<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
so what we do is we'll take that the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
so what we do is we'll take that the
dentist<00:00:45.090> will<00:00:45.570> cement<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
dentist will cement this on so that it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.880 
dentist will cement this on so that it
is<00:00:49.920> permanent<00:00:50.570> but<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> only<00:00:51.870> problem<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.500> now

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
is permanent but the only problem is now

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.600 
is permanent but the only problem is now
we<00:00:53.430> can't<00:00:53.730> floss<00:00:54.120> between<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.440> in

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
we can't floss between it like we do in

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.389 
we can't floss between it like we do in
normal<00:00:56.610> teeth<00:00:56.940> there's<00:00:57.449> no<00:00:57.690> there's<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
normal teeth there's no there's not the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
normal teeth there's no there's not the
space<00:00:59.640> because<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.180> connected<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
space because it's connected here and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.530 
space because it's connected here and
here<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.409> use<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
here so what we have to do is use a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.140 
here so what we have to do is use a
floss<00:01:06.540> threader<00:01:07.640> like<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.909> one<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:10.909> it<00:01:11.909> has

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
floss threader like this one here it has

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.910 
floss threader like this one here it has
a<00:01:12.180> loop<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.260> put<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> floss<00:01:14.040> through

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.060 

that<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.479> other<00:01:21.509> end<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.470> stiff

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that and then the other end is stiff

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.770 
that and then the other end is stiff
that<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.240> thread<00:01:24.570> through<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.470> bridge<00:01:26.780> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
that we can thread through the bridge so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.469 
that we can thread through the bridge so
we<00:01:28.020> take<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.619> stiff<00:01:29.070> end<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.790> remember

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
we take the stiff end and remember

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.719 
we take the stiff end and remember
here's<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> crown<00:01:31.409> here's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.009> crown<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
here's a crown here's a crown and this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.920 
here's a crown here's a crown and this
is<00:01:32.939> our<00:01:33.090> false<00:01:33.360> tooth<00:01:33.920> we're<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> thread

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
is our false tooth we're going to thread

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.319 
is our false tooth we're going to thread
with<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.170> threader<00:01:37.500> between<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.549> space<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
with the threader between that space of

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.499 
with the threader between that space of
the<00:01:39.450> false<00:01:40.079> tooth<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> crown<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.509> then

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the false tooth and the crown and then

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.440 
the false tooth and the crown and then
pull<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> floss<00:01:43.350> through<00:01:46.460> then<00:01:47.460> take<00:01:47.820> hold<00:01:48.180> of

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
pull the floss through then take hold of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.280 
pull the floss through then take hold of
either<00:01:49.110> end<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> floss<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
either end of the floss and you want to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.590 
either end of the floss and you want to
then<00:01:52.470> floss<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.430> tooth<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
then floss this tooth here like you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600 
then floss this tooth here like you
would<00:01:54.840> normally<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.189> underneath

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
would normally and you get up underneath

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.580 
would normally and you get up underneath
the<00:01:57.030> crown<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:59.360> then<00:02:00.360> take<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.869> floss<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the crown and then take the floss and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.520 
the crown and then take the floss and
come<00:02:01.799> up<00:02:02.009> over<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:02.969> ponic<00:02:03.689> or<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.290> false

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
wrap it around this

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.530 
wrap it around this
