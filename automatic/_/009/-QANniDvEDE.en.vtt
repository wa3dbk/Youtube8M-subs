 yo guests welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.650
 commentary 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.089
 and it is also here to glory 'like 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.440
 always because that is actually my channel 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.670
 now based on just my road trip 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.370
 by me you are nice to do 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.139
 she sees previous episodes indesit 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.210
 played and the division 1 lost 1 time 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.770
 and i fill it with my bundesliga team e 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.630
 probably think in the bundesliga tea 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
 have you bought full boy 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.930
 no yes bit rude I have a following 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.519
 I sell them items so that I have the best 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.710
 nice actually just not 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.080
 so much out because they don't have another one 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.060
 good favor for me if you are a fan of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.650
 bundesliga teams I would definitely go 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.410
 enjoy these last clips for it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.969
 is the last one with the pivot and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 Royce made one like that you are just like 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.540
 country continues well and then does the walk 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.520
 you I really never prefer patches 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.710
 13 I thought that didn't work out 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.450
 quite a bit than the fifa 12 and 11 and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.030
 works or us enjoying myself here I 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 case but now I pay I still pay 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.539
 still and here the royce will be fine again 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.340
 only with good luck 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.629
 Team Grain takes quite a bit 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.550
 neatly done over his head and then 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.750
 get him in the long corner 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.980
 sleep if you look at it that way 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.329
 only he makes 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.609
 second goal of the match 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.439
 and the third or well us to the city 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.700
 third goal in the way is already on 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.570
 his hat trick so one still proves 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.340
 but even that just really 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.439
 Beers and here I pass by the keeper 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.430
 buzzy koshalek is silent seems gone 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.720
 only there goes in again and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.540
 make him well 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.220
 the video in the 31st minute and you know what 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.710
 is going to happen of course yes you know 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.360
 it he love match 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.070
 yeah good boy once fit is a 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.869
 Mag Bassie chose 10 10 and it was last 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.009
 it from the bundesliga 10 is played them 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.170
 tackle quite three points 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.970
 always handy because look in the name and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.979
 love the via team i realize 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.570
 that yes I can invest 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.460
 in the team and they are still good 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.259
 options left for some positions 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.439
 what it is missing something 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.180
 the team is that factor that you just got over 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.970
 the stripe can help him best ones 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.460
 just that can win with 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.620
 which factor is also already 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.150
 oh yes p's and more tendon 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.190
 and as you can see it is yes 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.810
 average tendon of the 1020 up 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.730
 gone or so level along I had already been nice 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.770
 strong players or nice ones 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.330
 yes quick cameos space and therefore already 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.280
 they were not very high school 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.730
 1070 martine's tendon is just pure 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.740
 tendon 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.300
 for the rest there is a shit have the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.250
 first was the one with the new 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.290
 I will test new film teams 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.550
 counter gas with magic gamers that are around 80 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.260
 but those are the most dangerous teams 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.640
 that those 80 grams 10 sometimes really play 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.140
 I pebble well 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.340
 a this lesson it was not too bad in the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.930
 first half of them in the wall it 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.580
 first shot of the weather market 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.200
 song really fantastic what a 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.460
 with exaggeration was so beautiful she does 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.140
 it's not at all why he just got it 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.750
 neatly lose edge good midfielder 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.090
 is that can actually do everything and in the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.110
 31st trainers I have to get through nicely 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.459
 I would have I am laying it and leaking 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.250
 sweaty for that 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.690
 doing so late this time becomes who you are 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.370
 one is just pure so actually know 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.990
 so that the market does not go in and out anyway 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.459
 one year the second half I came with 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.230
 my third goal is a good one 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.580
 and had the market to establish crÃ¨ches 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.230
 him off with them inside you 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.940
 and this first goal for this club and after 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.310
 Shallow this page are for the public 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.140
 new fans it seems nothing wrong 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.880
 until this moment their defend I know 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.489
 not who it was or that I share it or 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.989
 that i r &amp; d or that or that the computer 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.220
 idea if that fifa I don't know what's up 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.450
 the hand is really terrible 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.150
 bad defending where by now 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.340
 slightly in again via 3g boat with 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.480
 something like that yes yes it was he or the game 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.310
 against that dynamite 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.630
 not too late in the earlier went in 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.400
 but say because it doesn't matter where they are 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.220
 that actually against texting that 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.390
 possible score from the rebound and on this 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.459
 moment of course I started candles 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.380
 trailer a story pinched you may 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.700
 I unpack it and just win 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.140
 three two and it's you again 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.820
 finally good wins again 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.410
 because that was really too long ago, yes 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.420
 last week with quests and of course also 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.830
 already a yes two and 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.269
 consecutive wins and the vision 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.070
 you don't see it that often 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.810
 I am really inconsistent with the player 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.910
 lately and it just changes 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.260
 to finish as you saw even more 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.140
 partying wide web at is just one 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.120
 service and then I come against him yes english 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.920
 team with only your wines and the pulse that 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.750
 do not come from England whose strong 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.489
 choosing with many green link that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.320
 the i know that 's all it just better 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.299
 am my way and the first 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.390
 Martinus Ge's sweaty goal 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.560
 have arrived is made and leave it 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.230
 Normally many come because I have him 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.180
 met for the sweaty doing it must 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.860
 and here he blocks the ball blockhouse 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.140
 kicking and in one go I get on and on 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.519
 on that another our penalty 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.379
 but at that moment my one trick nothing 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.470
 from I can make the 2 0 that it is one 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.060
 good starting position in the 26th minute 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.890
 grow above the keeper in the middle 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.209
 penalties as always works and I have 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.440
 for the first time this series was mine 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.790
 penalty shot not in the middle 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.290
 about to round off the right side of would 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.829
 the intention but immediately thereafter 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.389
 actually 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.040
 coating company about a ball and 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.270
 come to mean sliedrecht with his 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.790
 pension that my floor on you over the 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.470
 goalkeeper and their story gets worse 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.760
 in the 2nd half make the cut ones 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.680
 another ball for the paddles in that 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.620
 head it in and it's unbelievable 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.479
 in the 90th minute you see so immediately 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.500
 is going to make the three two i have it 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.300
 already tell but it doesn't matter 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.729
 whoever comes to play completely free lampert 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.500
 is a you just finish it and weaver 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.740
 fucking good starting position 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.940
 I don't understand why I'm okay 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.289
 do and how that comes i just stay 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.789
 play the risk and then you can 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.080
 to happen 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.090
 and that means i'm really that bad 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.340
 ripe from French police and so you eat this 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.169
 season of the vision a two win two 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.000
 yeah yeah that's just not there 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.310
 as special as you are then against one 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.660
 opponent comes with 9 upgrade tickets 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.729
 in different parties with also a whole one 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.169
 fast and good players yes then then 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.690
 it seems to be a difficult story 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.030
 also this season or this is mine again 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.620
 grab the title yes because he goes too 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.240
 cursed in the attack you really are the third 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.650
 minute he already takes a good lead 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.620
 with almost just a good player 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.300
 'm really right on the right winger than the 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.830
 rush shoes and her kill him but 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.139
 I do not give up and come nice and 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.160
 sweaty goal from my thesis marty 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.599
 they just carry on 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.460
 and this is really this do it was however 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.410
 bite off base and or thanks to kees 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.389
 rather a nice haske 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.099
 because a little later a lot goes on here 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.710
 three lives that ball canales ends up 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.990
 and channel is market him off and I come on 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.610
 two a head start and if I was like that 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.110
 welcome against such upgrade tickets as 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.880
 you also use a sermon case at work 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.470
 sometimes also as a counterproductive leave me 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.389
 say that the split or something against 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.710
 I get pretty often bothered by that 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.720
 when i use i actually use them 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.130
 engine but here come that just as well 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.990
 as you can see he makes the three 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.580
 two out of three are truly liberating 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.930
 hit and for the people that whole series 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.000
 have followed martine's made me real 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.169
 is he really the division 4 and 5 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.120
 with terrible for goals but 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.470
 dragged through and is nice for other 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.830
 participate in here I can make one on the 4th 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.790
 to good luck 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.260
 I sometimes bring him an under the 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.160
 sea ââgreetings are when i meet as i meet 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:19.240
 just sailed and whisper ball and or 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.380
 he does not care 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.670
 is just a good player 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.320
 finally making of a bowl 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.870
 marty 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.950
 the four was second and yes the then girl 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.450
 it just played 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.760
 good win again and yes the 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.800
 starting position is not special 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.330
 3 earnings are waverly it seems 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.340
 again impossible to get the title 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.090
 this season but it is not 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.830
 different 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.230
 this was not a special episode 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.600
 episode 1 to make it even more special 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.160
 I enter into quotation marks 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.140
 you still grab the end of this episode 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.820
 just a target path that I made with 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.710
 with a team it only type string 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.240
 with live reactions buddies it is 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.680
 funny to see I hope so 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.700
 you find it funny to see and 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.980
 I hope you like this episode 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.510

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.500
 really huge with me and thus also in 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.919
 this episode 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.470
 everything said until later guests 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.540
 so hard to create opportunities 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.310
 sometimes ps click and czech athlone 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.840

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:23.410
 miele on say poppa so miss or so high 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.180
 Jew and Kohl's this young delicious 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.390
 I think the pole connection goal 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:35.040
 That position to make you notice you just focus on 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:35.040
