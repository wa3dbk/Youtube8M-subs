00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
seats properly so you take the injector

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.480 
seats properly so you take the injector
and<00:02:05.410> you<00:02:05.619> slowly<00:02:07.110> work<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.259> in<00:02:08.380> there<00:02:08.530> till<00:02:09.340> it

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
and you slowly work it in there till it

and you slowly work it in there till it
clicks<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:12.990> now<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.050> know<00:02:14.319> when<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.590> put

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
clicks and now you know when you put

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.690 
clicks and now you know when you put
your<00:02:14.920> rail<00:02:15.610> back<00:02:15.850> on<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.890> o-ring<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.400> seated

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
your rail back on the o-ring is seated

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.250 
your rail back on the o-ring is seated
properly<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:20.560> ten<00:02:20.740> times<00:02:21.690> harder<00:02:22.690> to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
properly and it's ten times harder to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
properly and it's ten times harder to
put<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> new<00:02:24.400> one<00:02:24.580> on<00:02:24.640> then<00:02:25.630> old<00:02:26.140> one<00:02:26.500> they<00:02:27.069> come

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
put a new one on then old one they come

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.760 
put a new one on then old one they come
on<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.580> off<00:02:27.640> like<00:02:27.910> nothing<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.620> see

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
on and off like nothing so you can see

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.760 
on and off like nothing so you can see
the<00:02:29.890> difference<00:02:30.250> right<00:02:30.310> there<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:32.290> now<00:02:32.709> you

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
the difference right there and now you

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.640 
the difference right there and now you
can<00:02:33.190> see<00:02:33.430> if<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.600> come<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.230> little<00:02:35.260> closer

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
can see if you come in a little closer

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.449 
can see if you come in a little closer
you<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:36.069> see<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:38.110> o-ring<00:02:38.319> wall<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.190> no

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
you can see that the o-ring wall is no

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.640 
you can see that the o-ring wall is no
longer<00:02:39.730> flush<00:02:40.440> with<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.560> retainer<00:02:41.890> clip

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
longer flush with the retainer clip

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.600 
longer flush with the retainer clip
and<00:02:44.650> that's<00:02:44.920> how<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.100> do<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.370> without

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
and that's how you do it without

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.420 
and that's how you do it without
removing<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.240> paper
