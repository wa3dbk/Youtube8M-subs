00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
they're adding new stuff the robot

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.940

robotics<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> new<00:01:40.229> movement<00:01:40.770> techniques

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
robotics all the new movement techniques

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.490 
robotics all the new movement techniques
but<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.939> other<00:01:42.060> hand<00:01:42.479> I've<00:01:42.840> seen<00:01:43.350> it

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
haven't really seen that before and I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.330 
haven't really seen that before and I
kind<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.380> like<00:02:24.560> stuff<00:02:24.860> like<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
kind of like stuff like that in the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.740 
kind of like stuff like that in the
trailer<00:02:25.640> but<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:25.850> there<00:02:26.030> was<00:02:26.060> these<00:02:26.300> there

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
trailer but then there was these there

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.540 
trailer but then there was these there
was<00:02:26.840> these<00:02:26.960> points<00:02:27.530> which<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.130> was<00:02:28.250> impressed

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
was these points which I was impressed

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.680 
was these points which I was impressed
you're<00:02:28.760> going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> see<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.210> next<00:02:29.330> screenshot

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
you're going to see the next screenshot

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.720 
you're going to see the next screenshot
now<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.320> wall<00:02:30.530> running<00:02:30.800> we<00:02:31.280> see<00:02:31.490> a<00:02:31.520> bit<00:02:31.700> of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
now of the wall running we see a bit of

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.210 
now of the wall running we see a bit of
the<00:02:31.850> wall<00:02:32.030> running<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.810> trailer<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.500> was

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
the wall running in the trailer I was

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.430 
the wall running in the trailer I was
like<00:02:34.370> oh<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:35.240> looks<00:02:35.390> really<00:02:35.630> impressive<00:02:35.810> but

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
like oh this looks really impressive but

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.900 
like oh this looks really impressive but
then<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.650> was<00:02:36.770> just<00:02:36.800> like<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.400> titanfall

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
then I was just like is this titanfall

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.200 
then I was just like is this titanfall
it<00:02:38.450> just<00:02:38.720> didn't<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.590> me<00:02:39.770> then<00:02:40.430> want<00:02:40.670> one<00:02:40.970> main

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
it just didn't to me then want one main

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.300 
it just didn't to me then want one main
disadvantage<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.050> this<00:02:42.110> trailer<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.710> that<00:02:42.890> it

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
disadvantage of this trailer is that it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.210 
disadvantage of this trailer is that it
did<00:02:43.580> not<00:02:43.790> feel<00:02:44.180> like<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.840> black<00:02:45.140> ops<00:02:45.410> game<00:02:45.530> just

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
did not feel like a black ops game just

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.010 
did not feel like a black ops game just
personally<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.910> did<00:02:47.090> not<00:02:47.300> feel<00:02:47.510> like<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> black

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
personally it did not feel like a black

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.200 
personally it did not feel like a black
ops<00:02:48.230> game<00:02:48.350> I<00:02:48.770> know<00:02:49.070> black<00:02:49.460> ops<00:02:49.640> tumors<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
ops game I know black ops tumors in the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.690 
ops game I know black ops tumors in the
future<00:02:50.630> but<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.410> had<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> distinct<00:02:52.460> feel

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
future but that had a distinct feel

what happens it switches to another shot

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.350 
what happens it switches to another shot
also<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.020> crossbar<00:04:03.530> thing<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.160> i<00:04:04.730> believe<00:04:05.000> as

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
also the crossbar thing and i believe as

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.910 
also the crossbar thing and i believe as
a<00:04:05.840> character<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.500> looks<00:04:06.650> like<00:04:06.770> it's

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
a character it looks like it's

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.560 
a character it looks like it's
multiplayer<00:04:07.250> but<00:04:07.640> he<00:04:07.790> kind<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.060> hacks<00:04:08.300> into

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
multiplayer but he kind of hacks into

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.360 
multiplayer but he kind of hacks into
like<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.870> drone<00:04:09.200> that's<00:04:09.440> in<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.680> air<00:04:09.860> and<00:04:10.100> then

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
like a drone that's in the air and then

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.700 
like a drone that's in the air and then
start<00:04:10.640> shooting<00:04:11.090> enemies<00:04:11.240> but<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.440> could<00:04:12.680> be

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
start shooting enemies but that could be

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.350 
start shooting enemies but that could be
campaign<00:04:13.310> that's<00:04:13.520> what<00:04:13.700> i'm<00:04:13.790> saying<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.210> looks

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
campaign that's what i'm saying it looks

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.520 
campaign that's what i'm saying it looks
like<00:04:14.510> they're<00:04:14.630> going<00:04:14.780> for<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.020> destiny

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
like they're going for this destiny

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.440 
like they're going for this destiny
approach<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.130> campaign<00:04:16.609> where<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.299> can

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
approach to the campaign where you can

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.810 
approach to the campaign where you can
join<00:04:17.630> multiple<00:04:17.840> people<00:04:18.470> online<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:19.130> do<00:04:19.640> the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
join multiple people online and do the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.070 
join multiple people online and do the
missions<00:04:20.210> you<00:04:20.450> know<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:20.630> can<00:04:20.900> do<00:04:20.989> the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
missions you know you can do the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.900 
missions you know you can do the
missions<00:04:21.380> i'm<00:04:21.739> guessing<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.430> can<00:04:22.580> do<00:04:22.700> them<00:04:22.880> on

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
missions i'm guessing you can do them on

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.970 
missions i'm guessing you can do them on
your<00:04:23.030> own<00:04:23.210> but<00:04:23.540> then<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:23.780> can<00:04:23.930> also<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.710> know

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
your own but then you can also you know

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.430 
your own but then you can also you know
the<00:04:25.100> replayability<00:04:25.610> with<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.510> XP<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.140> also

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
the replayability with the XP and also

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.410 
the replayability with the XP and also
playing<00:04:27.740> them<00:04:27.950> online<00:04:28.580> with<00:04:28.790> other<00:04:28.880> people

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
playing them online with other people

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.120 
playing them online with other people
hopefully<00:04:30.020> they<00:04:30.170> do<00:04:30.230> different<00:04:30.770> missions

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
hopefully they do different missions
