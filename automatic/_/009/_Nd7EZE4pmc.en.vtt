with force weapon and familiar as
Portland<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:38.439> will<00:01:38.619> dramatically<00:01:39.460> increase

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
Portland that will dramatically increase

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:50.010 
Portland that will dramatically increase
your<00:01:40.119> DPS<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:44.170> here's<00:01:44.770> my<00:01:44.889> character<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
your DPS so here's my character so

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.590 
your DPS so here's my character so
so<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.979> text<00:01:52.640> beat<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:52.940> probably<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.570> most

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
so the text beat is probably the most

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.800 
so the text beat is probably the most
important<00:01:54.320> thing<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.770> have<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:55.790> if<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.750> are
