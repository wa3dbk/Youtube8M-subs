this<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.489> basically<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:39.440> moment<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.530> which<00:00:40.950> we

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this is basically a moment in which we

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.270 
this is basically a moment in which we
have<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:42.000> take<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.600> good<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.800> bad<00:00:43.890> as

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

well<00:00:44.539> certainly<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.660> Christians<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.140> would

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
well certainly as Christians we would

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.529 
well certainly as Christians we would
rather<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:47.039> someone<00:00:47.370> who<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.120> dedicated

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
rather have someone who is a dedicated

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.410 
rather have someone who is a dedicated
born-again<00:00:49.350> believer<00:00:50.100> who<00:00:50.370> expresses<00:00:50.940> godly

born-again believer who expresses godly

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900 
born-again believer who expresses godly
principles<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:52.890> simply<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.640> not

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
principles but that just simply is not

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.240 
principles but that just simply is not
the<00:00:54.120> case<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.809> election<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.190> a
