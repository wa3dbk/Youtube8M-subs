tweetdeck<00:03:46.660> now<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.980> had<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.459> go<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.790> download

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
tweetdeck now I had to go and download

the gingerbread from the market keyboard

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.479 
the gingerbread from the market keyboard
so<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.560> would<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.739> not<00:03:53.890> going<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.190> be<00:03:54.250> normal

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
so it would be not going to be normal

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.229 
so it would be not going to be normal

don't think the colonel has support for
it<00:06:21.480> yet<00:06:21.660> so<00:06:23.720> see<00:06:26.750> guess<00:06:27.750> that's<00:06:28.290> pretty<00:06:28.740> much

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.140 
working but he said that's going to be a

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.990 
working but he said that's going to be a
pretty<00:07:19.620> easy<00:07:19.920> fix<00:07:20.340> and<00:07:20.640> then<00:07:22.010> 4g<00:07:23.010> wimax<00:07:23.400> isn't

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 
pretty easy fix and then 4g wimax isn't

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.510 
pretty easy fix and then 4g wimax isn't
working<00:07:24.300> but<00:07:24.950> that's<00:07:25.950> not<00:07:26.130> in<00:07:26.280> a<00:07:26.340> lot<00:07:26.490> of

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
working but that's not in a lot of

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.100 
working but that's not in a lot of
places<00:07:26.760> it's<00:07:27.120> not<00:07:27.270> anywhere<00:07:27.480> near<00:07:27.570> me<00:07:27.840> so

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110 
places it's not anywhere near me so

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.600 
places it's not anywhere near me so
doesn't<00:07:28.860> really<00:07:28.980> matter<00:07:29.160> one<00:07:29.370> way<00:07:29.490> or<00:07:29.520> the

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
doesn't really matter one way or the

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.590 
doesn't really matter one way or the
other<00:07:29.670> but<00:07:30.380> yeah<00:07:31.380> I<00:07:31.410> think<00:07:31.590> that's<00:07:31.980> about<00:07:32.130> it

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:32.600 
other but yeah I think that's about it

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.380 
other but yeah I think that's about it
