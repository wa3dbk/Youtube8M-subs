holding<00:01:00.519> it<00:01:00.609> all<00:01:00.670> together<00:01:00.789> I<00:01:01.749> am<00:01:02.319> using<00:01:02.530> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
holding it all together I am using a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.470 
holding it all together I am using a
2800<00:01:03.760> milliamp<00:01:04.409> 3<00:01:05.409> cell<00:01:05.680> 11.1<00:01:06.520> volt<00:01:06.880> battery

2800 milliamp 3 cell 11.1 volt battery
it<00:01:08.380> seems<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.980> get<00:01:09.550> about<00:01:09.850> 5<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.450> 6<00:01:10.600> minutes<00:01:10.840> of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
it seems to get about 5 to 6 minutes of

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.950 
it seems to get about 5 to 6 minutes of
battery<00:01:11.230> life<00:01:11.410> and<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.970> seems<00:01:13.510> really

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
battery life and it seems really

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.370 
battery life and it seems really
powerful<00:01:14.380> which<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.650> really<00:01:15.400> good<00:01:16.050> now<00:01:17.050> I'm

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
powerful which is really good now I'm

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.270 
powerful which is really good now I'm
using<00:01:17.650> these<00:01:18.430> props<00:01:19.980> they<00:01:20.980> are<00:01:21.630> pretty<00:01:22.630> big

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
using these props they are pretty big

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.850 
using these props they are pretty big
I'd<00:01:24.280> say<00:01:24.460> 10<00:01:24.700> inch<00:01:24.850> props<00:01:25.180> on<00:01:25.540> here<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:25.990> they

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
I'd say 10 inch props on here and they

I'd say 10 inch props on here and they
are<00:01:26.890> all<00:01:27.040> bright<00:01:27.850> green<00:01:28.180> which<00:01:28.510> does<00:01:29.320> cause<00:01:29.590> a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
are all bright green which does cause a

so you want to go ahead and arm the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.800 
so you want to go ahead and arm the
motors<00:02:48.670> all<00:02:49.670> right<00:02:49.820> we<00:02:49.970> have<00:02:50.060> stabilization

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
motors all right we have stabilization

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.620 
motors all right we have stabilization
on<00:02:51.080> now<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.770> is<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.980> KK<00:02:52.430> -<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:52.910> stabilization

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
on now this is a KK - so stabilization

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.720 
on now this is a KK - so stabilization
is<00:02:53.720> not<00:02:53.930> fantastic<00:02:54.410> cover<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.130> does<00:02:55.340> seem<00:02:55.580> to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
is not fantastic cover it does seem to

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:12.110 
is not fantastic cover it does seem to
work<00:02:55.850> all<00:02:56.270> right

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.839 

you<00:03:13.120> see<00:03:13.329> it<00:03:13.480> does<00:03:13.689> hover<00:03:14.040> relatively<00:03:15.040> well

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.809 

that's<00:03:18.209> out<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.510> fun<00:03:18.959> whoa<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:20.370> shoots<00:03:20.670> up

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
that's out the fun whoa that shoots up

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.270 
that's out the fun whoa that shoots up
there<00:03:21.060> really<00:03:21.239> all<00:03:21.930> right<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.799> it's<00:03:22.920> got<00:03:23.040> tons

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
there really all right so it's got tons

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:43.320 
there really all right so it's got tons
of<00:03:23.430> power

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.930 

very<00:03:44.330> laggy<00:03:45.280> civilization<00:03:46.280> but<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.610> does<00:03:46.730> seem

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
very laggy civilization but it does seem

00:03:46.940 --> 00:04:20.830 
very laggy civilization but it does seem
to<00:03:46.970> work

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.300 

so<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:22.140> seemed<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.500> work<00:04:22.590> pretty<00:04:22.650> well<00:04:22.920> we

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
so this seemed to work pretty well we

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.010 
so this seemed to work pretty well we
can<00:04:23.460> go<00:04:23.550> ahead<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:23.790> turn<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.300> stabilization

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
can go ahead and turn the stabilization

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.390 
can go ahead and turn the stabilization
off<00:04:25.140> now<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:25.590> now<00:04:25.710> there<00:04:25.860> was<00:04:25.980> no<00:04:26.100> Auto

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
off now so now there was no Auto

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.310 
off now so now there was no Auto
leveling<00:04:26.880> on<00:04:27.320> much<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:29.180> blade<00:04:30.180> 180<00:04:30.810> QX

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
leveling on much like the blade 180 QX

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.350 
leveling on much like the blade 180 QX
without<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.860> auto<00:04:32.010> leveling<00:04:32.490> just<00:04:33.150> want<00:04:33.300> to

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
without the auto leveling just want to

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.520 
without the auto leveling just want to
be<00:04:33.420> really<00:04:33.630> careful<00:04:33.810> with<00:04:34.140> it

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
be really careful with it

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.560 
be really careful with it
but<00:04:34.950> it<00:04:35.070> seems<00:04:35.250> screw<00:04:35.520> performing<00:04:36.270> very<00:04:36.480> well

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
but it seems screw performing very well

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.410 
but it seems screw performing very well
so<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.650> really<00:04:38.340> impressed<00:04:38.700> him<00:04:38.940> I<00:04:39.060> built<00:04:39.270> this

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
so I really impressed him I built this

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.490 
so I really impressed him I built this
in<00:04:39.570> about<00:04:39.660> four<00:04:39.990> hours<00:04:40.350> so<00:04:40.680> that's<00:04:41.220> not<00:04:41.460> bad

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
in about four hours so that's not bad

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.870 
in about four hours so that's not bad
