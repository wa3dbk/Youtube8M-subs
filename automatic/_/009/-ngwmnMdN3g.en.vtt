usually love binds and what I did was I
concentrated<00:05:13.570> most<00:05:13.870> of<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.110> band<00:05:14.320> onto<00:05:14.710> one

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
concentrated most of the band onto one

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.790 
concentrated most of the band onto one
side<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:15.460> my<00:05:15.670> face<00:05:15.910> and<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:17.020> little<00:05:17.170> bit<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.710> the

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
side of my face and a little bit to the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.880 
side of my face and a little bit to the
other<00:05:17.950> side<00:05:18.190> but<00:05:18.610> I<00:05:18.670> can<00:05:18.940> always<00:05:19.590> Center<00:05:20.590> it<00:05:20.740> if

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
other side but I can always Center it if

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:28.150 
other side but I can always Center it if
I<00:05:21.100> wanted<00:05:21.400> to

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.390
