00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
will allow us to pull the radio out okay

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.870 
will allow us to pull the radio out okay
with<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> screws<00:01:20.250> removed<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:20.729> we're

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
with all the screws removed now we're

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
with all the screws removed now we're
going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> disassemble<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.680> pretty

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
going to disassemble it it's pretty

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
going to disassemble it it's pretty
simple<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.340> only<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.640> three<00:01:24.090> piece<00:01:24.270> puzzle<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
simple it's only a three piece puzzle so

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.120 
simple it's only a three piece puzzle so
you<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.229> take<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> bottom<00:01:25.740> piece<00:01:25.920> off

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you just can take the bottom piece off

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.130 
you just can take the bottom piece off
first<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> middle<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> radio

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
first in the middle and then the radio

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.480 
first in the middle and then the radio
itself<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.650> pull<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> expose<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
itself can pull out to expose the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.520 
itself can pull out to expose the
connectors<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> back

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
connectors in the back

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.749 
connectors in the back
okay<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.710> radio<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.070> been<00:01:32.189> pulled<00:01:32.490> loose

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
okay now the radio is been pulled loose

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.039 
okay now the radio is been pulled loose
we're<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> look<00:01:33.329> at<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> back<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
we're going to look at the back of the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.899 
we're going to look at the back of the
radio<00:01:34.200> bottom<00:01:34.740> right-hand<00:01:34.920> corner<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.759> have

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
radio bottom right-hand corner you have

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.179 
radio bottom right-hand corner you have
a<00:01:35.970> connector<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:36.900> we're<00:01:37.049> gonna

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
a connector this is the one we're gonna

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
a connector this is the one we're gonna
remove<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.520> such<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.479> plugging<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> t

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
remove as such and plugging the t

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.020 
remove as such and plugging the t
harness<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.250> another<00:01:41.460> word<00:01:41.610> our<00:01:41.700> connector

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
harness so another word our connector

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.010 
harness so another word our connector
from<00:01:42.150> our<00:01:42.299> harness<00:01:42.570> they're<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> plug

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
from our harness they're going to plug

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
from our harness they're going to plug
in<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.740> then<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.399> connector<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.030> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
in here and then the connector we just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.460 
in here and then the connector we just
took<00:01:45.329> loose<00:01:45.540> plugs<00:01:45.780> into<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> other<00:01:46.140> side<00:01:46.350> of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
took loose plugs into the other side of

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.120 
took loose plugs into the other side of
it<00:01:47.570> this<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> quick<00:01:48.960> look<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> final

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it this is a quick look of the final

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
it this is a quick look of the final
connections<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> plug<00:01:51.240> into<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
connections just going to plug into the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
connections just going to plug into the
interface<00:01:52.170> itself<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.610> there's<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:53.939> t

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
interface itself and then there's your t

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.789 
interface itself and then there's your t
harness<00:01:54.420> exposed<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> back<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.619> just

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
harness exposed in the back here we just

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
harness exposed in the back here we just
plugged<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.159> one<00:01:56.729> side<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.930> other

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
plugged in one side and then the other

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.700 
plugged in one side and then the other
side<00:01:58.229> plugs<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> radio<00:01:58.979> simple<00:02:00.710> okay

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
side plugs into the radio simple okay

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.990 
side plugs into the radio simple okay
now<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> radio<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.399> back<00:02:02.640> into<00:02:02.880> position

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
now that the radio is back into position

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.179 
now that the radio is back into position
we're<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> go<00:02:03.750> ahead<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.320> mount<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
we're going to go ahead and mount the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.039 
we're going to go ahead and mount the
box<00:02:05.520> cable<00:02:05.969> stuck<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.270> behind<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.630> radio<00:02:06.899> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
box cable stuck in behind the radio and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.449 
box cable stuck in behind the radio and
the<00:02:07.110> box<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> slide<00:02:07.860> back<00:02:07.890> under<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the box is going to slide back under the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.420 
the box is going to slide back under the
radio<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.929> position<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.500> such<00:02:10.739> then

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
radio in this position like such then

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.559 
radio in this position like such then
we'll<00:02:11.550> reassemble<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> panel's<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
we'll reassemble the panel's on the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.460 
we'll reassemble the panel's on the
bottom<00:02:12.870> here<00:02:13.020> doing<00:02:13.230> this

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
bottom here doing this

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.870 
bottom here doing this
water<00:02:13.710> again<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> middle<00:02:14.520> one<00:02:14.610> first

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
water again with the middle one first

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.410 
water again with the middle one first
and<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.390> bottom<00:02:15.870> plate
