00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.490
 Hello, here Olivier Roland. I'm going to share with you a stupid, simple trick 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.820
 to speed up your writing speed if you write a big text, a book, 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.730
 a report, a thesis, a thesis or a long article. 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:11.299
 It's one of the simplest, one of the most 20/80. It is part of the 20% effort that brings 80% 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.939
 of result. You will be upset, so simple is it. 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.390
 When you come to the end of your writing session, you know that you are going to stop, 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.119
 rather than finishing your sentence, start a sentence. That is, you write 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.649
 the first three or four words of the sentence and leave the sentence unresolved, 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.880
 quite simply. That's when you go back to 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.140
 write the next day or two days after or several hours after you have this 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.170
 sentence that is started and it helps you a lot to get back into the bath at 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.369
 to be immediately productive because often the problem is that we take turns, we 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.649
 thought: what did I mean? Etc. We have a warm-up time that can 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.749
 to waste a lot of time. With just those first sentences that are started, 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.100
 you are immediately productive. What I do, too, is that I do 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.099
 these first words below, in parentheses, in square brackets. It allows me to identify 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.739
 things. In square brackets, I put some guiding ideas of what I mean. 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.989
 I'll start the first three words, and after, I'll put the list smart, 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.959
 but in brackets of what I mean. I'm going to talk about productivity, I'm going to talk 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.209
 of that, that and that. Like that, I know I want to talk about that. 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.290
 It allows you to download your brain on the book and, after, to re-upload 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.810
 in your memory everything you had at the moment T. It's as if you had 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.510
 a transmission of "RAM" between the two situations and in time, and that 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.159
 saves you a lot of time It's a stupid trick that you can 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:57.470
 use right now and that, I think, will make a big difference in your productivity 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:18.720
 and maybe even 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.400
 your author creativity.
