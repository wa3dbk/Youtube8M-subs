00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.380
 what the human body is capable of 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.590
 do 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.139
 the human body is something incredible by 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.320
 misfortune is something that we take for granted 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.300
 almost every day we are able to 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.119
 do so many actions that not even 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.099
 we realize the next time you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.720
 You see complaining about your body for not giving 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.090
 more during training by 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.310
 stumble you on the sidewalk remember these 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.130
 things that the body always does and does 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.470
 a little more credit is a machine 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 Awesome 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.640
 the muscles that are in the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 eyes move around 100,000 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.930
 times a day 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.520
 you would need to walk 50 kilometers to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.710
 Give your legs the same training 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.870
 your navel is home to thousands of 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.460
 bacteria that form an ecosystem of 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.460
 size of an entire rainforest 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.980
 during the course of life they occur 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.820
 about 25 thousand liters of saliva which 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.610
 It is enough to fill two pools 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.280
 our nose can remember 50,000 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.860
 different smells 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.450
 red blood cells can travel 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.180
 whole body in about 20 seconds 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.640
 our eyes are so sensitive that if 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.910
 the earth outside flat we could see a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.410
 Sail about 30 kilometers away 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.560
 approximately 90% of our 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.780
 cells are not of human origin our 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.450
 cells originate mainly from 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.030
 fungi and bacteria 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.909
 our muscles are more powerful than 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.649
 what we believe our strength is limited 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.500
 to protect our tendons and 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.659
 muscles that are harmed is eliminated 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.789
 this limitation during a download of 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.770
 adrenaline in which some people 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.290
 are able to lift large weights 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.370
 like a car 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:06.170
 an adult consists of 7,000,000,000 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:08.429
 000 000 000 000 000 million 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.129
 atoms 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.959
 Our eyes can distinguish up to 10 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.549
 millions of different colors and 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.290
 enjoy more information than 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.599
 any telescope 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.060
 we are the best long runners 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.310
 distance on the planet so much so that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.970
 We used to run behind our 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.610
 prisoners until they died of exhaustion 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.980
 our bodies really shine in the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.900
 darkness but the light that we emit is 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.819
 a thousand times weaker than what our 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.519
 eyes can detect 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.610
 babies have 60 more bones than 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.770
 Adults 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.200
 and being in love makes the brain 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.700
 release the same neurotransmitters and 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.030
 hormones that are released with the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.030
 amphetamines 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.040
 we share 50 percent of our 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.200
 DNA with bananas 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.390
 our brain can produce 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.600
 enough electricity to feed 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.480
 a light bulb 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.070
 in our life we spend 10% of 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.790
 our vigil with our eyes closed 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.459
 by blinking 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.750
 the strongest muscle in the human body 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.420
 is our jaw muscle 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.700
 if the human brain were a computer 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.430
 I could make thirty eight thousand 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.890
 millions of operations per second the 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.790
 most powerful supercomputer in the world the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.490
 plugin can only handle 0 0 0 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.820
 2% of that 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.910
 the body produces 25 million cells 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.190
 new every second every 13 seconds 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.930
 produces more cells than the number of 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.930
 people that are in the usa 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.090
 our brains can read up to 1000 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.030
 words per minute 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.870
 we shed about 40 kilos of skin 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.810
 throughout our life 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.870
 if your body is a temple one really 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.260
 incredible take care of him and appreciate all the 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.860
 work that does 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.049
