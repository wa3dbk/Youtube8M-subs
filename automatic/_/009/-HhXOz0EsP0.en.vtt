 ... biologists found a tropical forest in 2013 

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.800
 which is accessible only by helicopter ... 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400
 ... and that hosts strange species 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.567
 that can only be seen in this place, 

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:47.167

 The greatest of them, Sima Humboldt, is so big 

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:15.100
 that has its own ecosystem in the background ... 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.967
 ... in which recent research found 

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:21.167
 a large number of plant species new to science. 

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.933
 Considered a mystical and evil place by locals, 

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:28.567

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.833
 They have been found in the hot and dark environment. 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.600
 So far, scientists have discovered a wide variety 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.967
 of albino species like this unidentified octopus ... 

00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:05.500
 ... like the lobster yeti, 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.933
 an amazing crab that seems to use his hair 

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.600
 to grow bacteria 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.900

 Like remnants of another world, 

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:37.233
 the scientists observed exotic species 

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.567
 that can not be seen elsewhere ... 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.233

 CRÁTER DE BOSAVI PAPUA NEW GUINEA 

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:04.433
 It was recently discovered that the 1km deep crater 

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:08.200
 it is the house of an ecosystem isolated from the world ... 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.867
 ... since the cone of the volcano 

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:14.833
 It collapsed during its last eruption about 200,000 years ago. 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.067
 It was investigated that in 2009, an expedition of scientists 

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:21.567
 filmed by the BBC for the documentary 

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:23.600
 "Lost Land of the Volcano" ... 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.500
 ... which discovered more than 40 unknown species, 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.533
 like this giant rat that measures 

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:33.067
 up to about 82 cm (32 pl) long.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.500
 Uncovered accidentally near Mangalia in 1986 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.000
 after digging about 30 meters deep 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.967
 to build a geothermal station ... 

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:50.567
 ... it was revealed that the Cave of Movile 

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:53.100
 it was a place completely sealed underground 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.067
 during the last 5.5 million years. 

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.267
 The scientists who were sent were amazed 

00:03:57.267 --> 00:03:59.800
 when finding an underground water ecosystem 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.300
 lacking light and oxygen ... 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.933
 ... that became a hostile environment 

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:07.333
 rich in hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide 

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:10.067
 where the captives managed to adapt. 

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:12.333
 After millions of years trapped 

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:14.600
 in a dark and toxic world, 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.533
 mutant forms of insects came out again ... 

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:20.600
 ... having become endemic translucent creatures 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.933
 now they depend surprisingly 

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:25.900
 of chemosynthesis instead of photosynthesis. 

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:32.933
 MONTE RORAIMA VENEZUELA-BRAZIL-GUYANA 

00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:36.200

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.567
 of 2 billion years old 

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:40.733
 which marks the border between Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana. 

00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:43.533
 The plateau hidden above is a difficult area to reach 

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.967
 by the great steep sides, which thrilled 

00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:48.533
 to many adventurers in the past ... 

00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:51.000
 ... whose stories of an island in the clouds 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.333
 it is said that they inspired the famous novel 

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.967
 by Arthur Conan-Doyle "The Lost World". 

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:59.000
 The 2,800-meter (9,200-foot) high plateau 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.767
 it was described as "a strange country of nightmares", 

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:04.733
 where unique species thrive ... 

00:05:04.967 --> 00:05:07.567
 ... that evolve in landscapes out of this world, 

00:05:07.567 --> 00:05:11.400

 It has the deepest known points on Earth ... 

00:05:27.233 --> 00:05:29.567
 ... but also a strange ecosystem 

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:33.000
 absent on another side of the ocean composed of unusual conduits 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.300
 that eject liquid carbon dioxide. 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.633
 This extreme environment hosts extraordinary ways of life 

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:41.833
 adapted to pressures a thousand times more than the sea level, 

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:43.467
 like a giant amoeboid ... 

00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:46.533
 ... usually unicellular microscopic organisms 

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:50.033
 that measured up to 10 cm (4 pl) in the pit. 

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:53.500
 Only 4 brief occasions in history were visited, 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.667
 the deepest area 

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:59.267
 It remains one of the most mysterious places in the world ... 

00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:02.767
 ... reaching a maximum depth of 10.9 km (6.8 mi) 

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:05.100

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.167
 deep in the vast and dense jungle 

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:22.600
 of the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park ... 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.967
 ... was unknown even by other locals 

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:26.933
 who avoided that area 

00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:29.633
 for the loud sounds and roars that came from the grotto. 

00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:32.300
 First explored in 2009, 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.400
 the place revealed hiding 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.500
 the largest grotto known in the world ... 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.100
 ... with a width of 200 m (650 ft) 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.567
 and 150 m high (500 feet), as seen in the photo 

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:45.933
 by the size of the cavers camping. 

00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:48.667
 With the appearance of a giant underground cathedral, 

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:54.000
 "Hang Son Doong" is so big that it has its own climate ... 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.867
 ... as well as an internal forest 

00:06:56.867 --> 00:07:00.400
 and a large and mighty river, among other curiosities. 

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:07.833

 Lake Vostok is the extension of Lake Ontario, 

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:15.700
 but twice as deep ... 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.567
 ... and has been sealed from the rest of the world 

00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:22.167
 under 4 km of ice (2.5 mi) for 15 million years. 

00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:24.900
 Under this almost impenetrable layer of ice, 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.200
 lies a Grail inaccessible to science ... 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.233
 ... since samples brought to the surface 

00:07:33.233 --> 00:07:35.700
 confirmed that a rich variety of life 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.833
 with unknown DNAs abounds below.
