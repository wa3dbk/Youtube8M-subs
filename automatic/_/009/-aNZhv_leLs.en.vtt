00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 and so hi to all friends is that 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.649
 either cover today on three small 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.519
 klitscho we can call it like that a 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.080
 glitch on on destiny so it's done 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.429
 weird to see destiny on machine 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.039
 while I did not talk about it in my 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.490
 video the future of my chair i'll get you 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.740
 to say why I did not talk about it 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.460
 simply because I had 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.230
 access to the beta for free 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.349
 and actually when I played at the beta is 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.349
 all 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.760
 all this finally this not that 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.150
 it was not over there was not big 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.130
 thing and quite frankly I was expecting 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.690
 to more things in the beta 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.270
 you can ride that level 8 in the end 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.730
 there is a level 1 30 with the come so 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.350
 I do not know a video except I 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.600
 think so 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.390
 rebound pursue that's why he 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.079
 is not mentioned in 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.010
 so 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.190
 let's go back to the subject of violence 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 drag it to go to the map that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.630
 is terminus terminus terminated by 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.700
 then will be available 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.730
 no 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.710
 in the edf it's the first dlc 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.210
 the monsters house is called 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:26.840
 like that a delirium like that so we do not 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:32.240
 has no access but hey I discovered 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:37.090
 a trick not really going through 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.090
 to go then you thought 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.630
 hurt against frankly I put a 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.409
 hour in the east a little near an hour 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.409
 to find the beach 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.680
 now has a friend and after him 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.900
 galley he galley like me and 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.260
 in fact me now I get there as 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.650
 that normally really if I do not believe 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.650
 there I mean 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.620
 because it's a habit to have 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.030
 2 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.120
 still dartois 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.120
 but 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.430
 he was really coming 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.170
 time you arrive here you take the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.200
 driving way I've been there since 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.860
 everyone so you see that here 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.560
 there is a thing which can not be bug 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.010
 go we agree we'll go then 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.560
 I cheated 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.050
 so here you see there is any 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.940
 picture is wrong so you have to play with 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.730
 the decor so first have to jump on 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.480
 this base after then we have to jump 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.770
 on that one 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.610
 c 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.900
 blue bombers 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.050
 I know she can do it seduced 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.980
 the first the second is 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.450
 then here is the second one 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.000
 third by the anointing threaten the most 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.190
 complicated because came out sinaÃ¯ 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.900
 an invisible wall 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.470
 the little advice is to shift like 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.930
 that both jumped and come back forward 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.810
 and tac and one class and the simplest 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.240
 in europe passed roughly on the right 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.270
 to dodge and so you will be there so 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.000
 then here the class the glitch actually 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.370
 they realize and you will run you 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.160
 jump the waves or you leave you 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.030
 plan everything and here and there it goes us 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.390
 do monte monte monte go up to the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.730
 map 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.209
 so the mapa is called the terminus as 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.880
 I was at the beginning of the video 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:02.170
 so apparently it will be an assault so 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.209
 here and there we arrive on the map 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.830
 so yes so in passing so here I am 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.930
 want to quickly make a little small 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.140
 presentation and I will show you a 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.519
 location the two locations of the 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.140
 two spectra spider so there will be one 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.459
 large 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.420
 here the second one it will be a little more a 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.710
 little more hide 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.790
 I think I took some time before 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:31.190
 find but hey I'm still 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.710
 found and so I'm going to share 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.710
 hop follow the path and it will be up 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:47.150
 of course it does not want it so it will be fair 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.200
 at the top of this two block subgroups 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.380
 when we turn and it will be there it will be 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.270
 here so that's all I can 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.260
 say So here I think there will 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.890
 a boss there I can already show you a 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.590
 spawn of enemies and now I'm going 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.960
 you do a little bonus because seen 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.040
 it's a map that is not yet 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.370
 accessible 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.070
 at the base it goes in addition to the east 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:22.580
 really everywhere and when giffard all 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:24.830
 and go see you're going to understand everything 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.180
 just finally me I think you 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.320
 can do it anywhere but I 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.580
 find them I found them at the beginning and 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.790
 I frankly find the beginning it is 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.710
 not bad so you arrive or jump a 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.449
 normal day 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.270
 so here I advise you to slow down the 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.970
 fall feel bad and so that's it 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.020
 so there you can walk in two 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.000
 maps I do not know if we can go down 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:50.060
 even more is no reason op to valves 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.310
 we do not do I think I'm going 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.470
 appear at the terminus it would be nice 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:02.810
 here I am re here appears so here 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:04.960
 it's great this announcement and its 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.960
 words 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:12.810
 okay so that's ready you can 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.220
 frankly explore for ya nothing to 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.710
 do I say right now 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.360
 good it's just for fun on it 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.960

 something in particular about destiny 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:46.240
 I'll be doing it either 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.790
