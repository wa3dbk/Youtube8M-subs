I'd say short gloves you don't want to
put<00:03:23.880> gloves<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.270> because<00:03:24.420> if<00:03:25.140> it's<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.620> know

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650

snowy than the players will wear gloves
themselves<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.130> some<00:03:29.130> players<00:03:29.340> wore

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
themselves and some players wore

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.250 
themselves and some players wore
different<00:03:30.060> things<00:03:30.210> so<00:03:30.360> drug<00:03:30.630> bore<00:03:30.810> a

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
different things so drug bore a

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.310 
different things so drug bore a
sweatband<00:03:31.800> for<00:03:32.190> example<00:03:32.750> sometimes<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.170> some

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
sweatband for example sometimes and some

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.400 
sweatband for example sometimes and some
players<00:03:34.560> have<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:35.100> different<00:03:35.430> Sakai<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.410> high

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
players have a different Sakai so high

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.160 
players have a different Sakai so high
for<00:03:37.710> example<00:03:37.770> you<00:03:38.340> could<00:03:38.490> do<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.960> attack<00:03:39.960> in

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
for example you could do that attack in

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.690 
for example you could do that attack in
so<00:03:40.380> this<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.620> where<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.860> get<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.160> stats<00:03:41.430> so

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
so this is where you get to the stats so

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.130 
so this is where you get to the stats so
crossing<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.630> know<00:03:42.750> stuff<00:03:42.960> like<00:03:43.020> that

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
crossing you know stuff like that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.620 
crossing you know stuff like that
finishing<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.760> want<00:03:44.940> might<00:03:45.210> want<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.450> put

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
finishing and you want might want to put

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.150 
finishing and you want might want to put
up<00:03:45.750> things<00:03:46.080> like<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.560> can<00:03:46.710> completely

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
up things like this you can completely

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.590 
up things like this you can completely
customize<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.760> player<00:03:47.850> how<00:03:48.180> good<00:03:48.420> they<00:03:48.570> are

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
customize the player how good they are

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.260 
customize the player how good they are
and<00:03:48.960> then<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.650> will<00:03:49.740> create<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.310> skill<00:03:51.090> moves

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
and then it will create a skill moves

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.730 
and then it will create a skill moves
thing<00:03:51.480> based<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.050> stats<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.470> put<00:03:52.650> in
