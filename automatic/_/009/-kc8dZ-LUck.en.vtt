episode 40 k we bought in force on 47

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240 
episode 40 k we bought in force on 47
and<00:00:30.000> these<00:00:30.630> five<00:00:30.929> items<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.470> about<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.009> sell<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.729 
and these five items are about to sell a
change<00:00:32.850> over<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> different<00:00:33.510> account<00:00:33.739> just

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
change over to a different account just

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.990 
change over to a different account just
so<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.010> could<00:00:35.100> air<00:00:35.340> low<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> web

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
so that I could air low on to the web

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.610 
so that I could air low on to the web
app<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.510> different<00:00:36.899> things<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
app and do different things like that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.790 
app and do different things like that
but<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.700> basically<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.600> concepts<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
but the basically the concepts this is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.639 
but the basically the concepts this is
now<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> change<00:00:41.399> from<00:00:41.910> me<00:00:42.090> doing

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
now going to change from me doing

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.830 
now going to change from me doing
because<00:00:43.649> trade<00:00:44.070> into<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.670> pack<00:00:44.910> opening<00:00:45.450> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
because trade into a pack opening is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.400 
because trade into a pack opening is
gonna<00:00:46.140> require<00:00:46.320> an<00:00:46.860> awful<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:48.140> coins<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
gonna require an awful lot like coins to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.279 
gonna require an awful lot like coins to
be<00:00:49.500> made<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:50.670> example<00:00:51.059> 100k<00:00:51.870> sells<00:00:52.170> about

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
be made for example 100k sells about

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.049 
be made for example 100k sells about
seven<00:00:52.800> pound<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> moment<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.579> probably

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
seven pound at the moment is probably

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.279 
seven pound at the moment is probably
just<00:00:54.210> gonna<00:00:54.270> keep<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.870> down<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.260> down

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
just gonna keep on going down and down

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.369 
just gonna keep on going down and down
and<00:00:55.410> down<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:57.600> gonna<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.899> changing<00:00:58.170> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and down so I'm gonna be changing it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.540 
and down so I'm gonna be changing it
because<00:00:58.440> by<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.770> time<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.010> managed<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> get

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
because by the time I managed to get

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.299 
because by the time I managed to get
about<00:00:59.760> 300<00:01:00.300> k<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.230> then<00:01:01.530> come<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> sound<00:01:02.100> it's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
about 300 k and then come to sound it's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.799 
about 300 k and then come to sound it's
not<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.550> worth<00:01:02.730> much<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> pack<00:01:03.480> opening

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
not be worth much and the pack opening

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.230 
not be worth much and the pack opening
won't<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.170> big<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.500> fifa<00:01:04.739> 14<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.909> I've

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
won't be that big for fifa 14 so I've

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.820

somewhere nice items might pick up nice

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.310 
somewhere nice items might pick up nice
and<00:01:58.259> cheap<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.450> first<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.140> be

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.520 
we are doing these were bought for 800
to<00:02:07.459> think<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.580> was<00:02:08.670> about<00:02:08.840> 720<00:02:09.840> 50<00:02:10.170> coins<00:02:10.319> are

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to think it was about 720 50 coins are

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.290 
to think it was about 720 50 coins are
paid<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.800> each<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.069> these<00:02:11.220> let<00:02:11.940> small<00:02:12.150> up

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
paid for each one of these let small up

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.220 
paid for each one of these let small up
for<00:02:12.420> three<00:02:12.569> point<00:02:12.780> two<00:02:12.930> three

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.619 
for three point two three
one<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.709> three<00:02:13.920> point<00:02:14.129> three<00:02:14.280> K<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.209> right

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
one and three point three K the right

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.720 
one and three point three K the right
knee<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.930> right<00:02:16.050> wing<00:02:16.230> card<00:02:16.470> was<00:02:17.099> about<00:02:17.310> seven

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
knee to right wing card was about seven

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.009 
knee to right wing card was about seven
hundred<00:02:17.760> coins<00:02:18.239> where<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.599> picked<00:02:18.810> them<00:02:18.930> up

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
hundred coins where we picked them up

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
for between 500 and 700 coins so that's

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.720 
for between 500 and 700 coins so that's
a<00:02:21.239> nice<00:02:21.390> one<00:02:21.599> or<00:02:21.840> 2k<00:02:22.049> profit<00:02:22.620> without<00:02:23.280> really

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.880 
a nice one or 2k profit without really
working<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.690> there's<00:02:25.409> a<00:02:25.440> couple<00:02:25.620> more

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
working it out there's a couple more

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.520 
working it out there's a couple more
plays<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.310> there<00:02:26.489> as<00:02:26.610> well<00:02:26.690> like<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.959> Jesus

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
plays in there as well like the Jesus

Navas<00:02:28.950> who<00:02:29.370> y'all<00:02:29.640> come<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.940> see<00:02:30.060> who<00:02:30.480> was

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
already converted before we listed him

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.940 
already converted before we listed him
up<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.450> think<00:02:33.569> we<00:02:33.690> might<00:02:33.810> put<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.200> CAC<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:34.769> up

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
up I think we might put the CAC as up

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.289 
up I think we might put the CAC as up
now<00:02:35.099> or<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:35.400> might<00:02:35.519> just<00:02:35.700> put<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.879> novice<00:02:36.120> up

now or we might just put the novice up
we<00:02:36.959> do<00:02:37.140> he<00:02:37.410> we<00:02:37.620> were<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:38.670> bought<00:02:38.910> him<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:39.450> one

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
