this<00:01:52.890> game<00:01:53.100> early<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.670> even<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
this game early but even think of in a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.030 
this game early but even think of in a
marketing<00:01:54.899> standpoint<00:01:55.170> maybe<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.799> played

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
marketing standpoint maybe you played

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and then obviously you don't buy this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.050 
and then obviously you don't buy this
game<00:01:58.950> since<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.310> play<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> demo<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
game since you play the demo and you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.969 
game since you play the demo and you
