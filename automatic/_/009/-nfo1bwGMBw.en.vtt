using cord blood stem cells is that it's

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.970 
using cord blood stem cells is that it's

processing<00:02:28.799> really<00:02:29.799> we<00:02:29.980> just<00:02:30.010> spin<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.610> bag

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
processing really we just spin the bag

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.930 
processing really we just spin the bag
of<00:02:31.090> cord<00:02:31.360> blood<00:02:31.510> we<00:02:32.290> take<00:02:32.739> off<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:32.980> plasma<00:02:33.610> and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
of cord blood we take off the plasma and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.150 
of cord blood we take off the plasma and
we<00:02:34.180> remove<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.690> red<00:02:34.840> cells<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.590> be<00:02:35.680> left<00:02:35.890> with

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
we remove the red cells to be left with

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.729 
we remove the red cells to be left with
a<00:02:36.190> white<00:02:36.459> cell<00:02:36.790> blood<00:02:37.599> product<00:02:38.049> which<00:02:38.530> it

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
a white cell blood product which it

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.690 
a white cell blood product which it
which<00:02:38.890> contains<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.970> blood<00:02:40.299> stem<00:02:40.690> cells

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
which contains the blood stem cells

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.270 
which contains the blood stem cells
within<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.880> product<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:44.079> is<00:02:44.349> then<00:02:44.620> frozen

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
within that product that is then frozen

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.840 
within that product that is then frozen
and<00:02:46.349> stored<00:02:47.349> in<00:02:47.560> our<00:02:47.650> liquid<00:02:47.829> nitrogen<00:02:48.310> tanks

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
and stored in our liquid nitrogen tanks

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.490 
and stored in our liquid nitrogen tanks
to<00:02:49.000> be<00:02:49.030> they're<00:02:49.299> ready<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.660> be<00:02:49.930> used

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
to be they're ready to be used

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.470 
to be they're ready to be used
if<00:02:50.560> anyone<00:02:51.069> requires<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:52.030> bone<00:02:52.299> marrow

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
if anyone requires a bone marrow

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.809 
if anyone requires a bone marrow
transplant<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.100> we<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> readily

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
transplant and so we have a readily

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.780 
transplant and so we have a readily
accessible<00:02:55.390> source<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.260> over<00:02:56.680> 8,000<00:02:57.430> cord

accessible source of over 8,000 cord

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.509 
accessible source of over 8,000 cord
blood<00:02:57.910> units<00:02:58.209> here<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:59.200> we<00:02:59.350> can<00:03:00.160> send<00:03:00.370> out

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
blood units here that we can send out

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.160 
blood units here that we can send out
for<00:03:00.730> patients<00:03:01.180> requiring<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:01.840> bone<00:03:01.989> marrow

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
for patients requiring a bone marrow

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.730 
for patients requiring a bone marrow
transplant

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.970 

at<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.760> moment<00:03:11.940> all<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.810> cord<00:03:13.020> blood

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
at the moment all the cord blood

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.550 
at the moment all the cord blood
we<00:03:14.159> sent<00:03:14.459> out<00:03:14.640> for<00:03:15.030> transplants<00:03:16.019> is<00:03:16.230> being

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
we sent out for transplants is being

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.970 
we sent out for transplants is being
used<00:03:16.950> for<00:03:17.909> bone<00:03:18.150> marrow<00:03:18.390> transplants<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.769> any

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
used for bone marrow transplants so any

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.070 
used for bone marrow transplants so any
disease<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.819> can<00:03:21.030> be<00:03:21.060> treated<00:03:21.420> with<00:03:21.599> the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
disease that can be treated with the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.710 
disease that can be treated with the
bone<00:03:22.290> marrow<00:03:22.319> transplant<00:03:22.909> can<00:03:23.909> actually<00:03:24.330> you

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
bone marrow transplant can actually you

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.750 
bone marrow transplant can actually you
can<00:03:24.870> actually<00:03:24.900> use<00:03:25.379> cord<00:03:25.709> blood<00:03:25.860> instead<00:03:26.640> of

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
can actually use cord blood instead of

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.740 
can actually use cord blood instead of
bone<00:03:26.970> marrow<00:03:28.099> so<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.220> types<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.730> diseases<00:03:29.940> of

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
bone marrow so the types of diseases of

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.360 
bone marrow so the types of diseases of
the<00:03:30.989> patients<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.560> we're<00:03:31.890> sending<00:03:32.129> out

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the patients that we're sending out

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.990 
the patients that we're sending out
units<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.030> includes<00:03:34.099> leukemias<00:03:35.099> aplastic

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
units for includes leukemias aplastic

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.089 
units for includes leukemias aplastic
anemia<00:03:37.280> metabolic<00:03:38.280> storage<00:03:38.730> disorders

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
anemia metabolic storage disorders

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.339 
anemia metabolic storage disorders
immunodeficiencies<00:03:41.099> so<00:03:41.670> it's<00:03:41.819> not<00:03:42.000> just

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
immunodeficiencies so it's not just

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.619 
immunodeficiencies so it's not just
leukemia<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:44.430> can<00:03:44.670> be<00:03:44.760> just<00:03:44.970> things<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.420> have

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
leukemia it can be just things that have

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.990 
leukemia it can be just things that have
gone<00:03:45.810> wrong<00:03:45.870> with<00:03:46.349> their<00:03:46.739> blood<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.849> just

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
gone wrong with their blood and you just

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.839 
gone wrong with their blood and you just
want<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.810> replace<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.560> blood<00:03:49.709> system<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.519> the

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
want to replace the blood system of the

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.970 
want to replace the blood system of the
patient<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.480> think<00:03:51.840> one<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.290> most<00:03:52.500> exciting

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
patient I think one of the most exciting

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.099 
patient I think one of the most exciting
developments<00:03:53.879> within<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.209> cord<00:03:54.540> blood<00:03:54.660> field

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
developments within a cord blood field

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.729 
developments within a cord blood field
has<00:03:55.560> been<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.220> discovery<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.349> can<00:03:58.560> use

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
has been the discovery that you can use

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.699 
has been the discovery that you can use
to<00:03:59.069> cord<00:03:59.819> blood<00:04:00.000> units<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.900> transplant<00:04:01.500> one

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
to cord blood units to transplant one

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.099 
to cord blood units to transplant one
patient<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.269> past<00:04:03.480> cord<00:04:03.989> blood

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
patient so in the past cord blood

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.259 
patient so in the past cord blood
transplant<00:04:04.500> were<00:04:05.040> really<00:04:05.310> only<00:04:05.430> limited<00:04:05.730> to

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
transplant were really only limited to

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.420 
transplant were really only limited to
baby<00:04:06.780> or<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.290> children<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:07.920> small<00:04:08.040> adults

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
baby or to children and small adults

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.460 
baby or to children and small adults
because<00:04:09.390> you're<00:04:09.540> really<00:04:09.810> limited<00:04:09.989> by<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
because you're really limited by the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.099 
because you're really limited by the
number<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.160> stem<00:04:11.430> cells<00:04:11.760> within<00:04:12.120> one<00:04:12.720> cord

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
number of stem cells within one cord

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.129 
number of stem cells within one cord
blood<00:04:13.230> unit<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:14.000> cord<00:04:15.000> blood<00:04:15.120> unit<00:04:15.629> is<00:04:15.780> what<00:04:15.989> we

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
blood unit a cord blood unit is what we

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.349 
blood unit a cord blood unit is what we
call<00:04:16.440> all<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.220> Bloods<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.150> get

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
call all the Bloods that you can get

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.629 
call all the Bloods that you can get
from<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:18.750> placenta<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.709> umbilical<00:04:19.799> cord

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
from one placenta and umbilical cord

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.210 
from one placenta and umbilical cord
that's<00:04:21.150> known<00:04:21.389> as<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.599> cord<00:04:21.900> blood<00:04:21.989> unit<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.710> so

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
that's known as a cord blood unit and so

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.190 
that's known as a cord blood unit and so
there's<00:04:23.789> really<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:24.060> finite<00:04:24.479> number<00:04:24.510> of<00:04:24.810> stem

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
there's really a finite number of stem

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.490 
there's really a finite number of stem
cells<00:04:25.500> in<00:04:25.770> there<00:04:26.599> what<00:04:27.599> was<00:04:27.750> discovered<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.349> few

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
cells in there what was discovered a few

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.469 
cells in there what was discovered a few
years<00:04:28.560> ago<00:04:29.010> now<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.639> that<00:04:29.970> you<00:04:30.090> could<00:04:30.300> actually

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
years ago now is that you could actually

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.379 
years ago now is that you could actually
use<00:04:30.930> two<00:04:31.229> cord<00:04:32.130> blood<00:04:32.250> units<00:04:32.520> for<00:04:32.910> one<00:04:33.090> patient

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
use two cord blood units for one patient

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.200 
use two cord blood units for one patient
which<00:04:34.200> doubles<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.130> number<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.580> stem<00:04:35.910> cells

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
which doubles the number of stem cells

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.450 
which doubles the number of stem cells
available<00:04:36.539> for<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.080> patient<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.770> this<00:04:38.190> means

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
available for the patient and this means

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.600 
available for the patient and this means
now<00:04:38.789> that<00:04:39.150> adults<00:04:40.110> can<00:04:40.680> have<00:04:40.979> cord<00:04:41.490> blood

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
now that adults can have cord blood

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.760 
now that adults can have cord blood
transplants<00:04:42.479> whereas<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.050> past<00:04:43.229> they

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
transplants whereas in the past they

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.909 
transplants whereas in the past they
were<00:04:43.830> too<00:04:44.039> big<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:45.050> actually<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.289> good

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
were too big and actually a good

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.740 
were too big and actually a good
proportion<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.820> cord<00:04:48.030> blood<00:04:48.150> units<00:04:48.450> that

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
proportion of the cord blood units that

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.390 
proportion of the cord blood units that
we<00:04:48.870> send<00:04:49.110> out<00:04:49.289> from<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.620> bank<00:04:49.800> now<00:04:50.070> are

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
we send out from the bank now are

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.700 
we send out from the bank now are
actually<00:04:51.150> for<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.720> transplantation<00:04:52.410> of

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
actually for the transplantation of

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:00.440 
actually for the transplantation of
adults

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.530 

we<00:05:01.230> do<00:05:01.440> know<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:02.010> cord<00:05:02.280> blood<00:05:02.460> does<00:05:02.970> contain

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
we do know that cord blood does contain

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.650 
we do know that cord blood does contain
other<00:05:03.900> stem<00:05:04.260> cells<00:05:04.590> other<00:05:05.010> than<00:05:05.430> blood<00:05:06.060> stem

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
other stem cells other than blood stem

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.160 
other stem cells other than blood stem
cells<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:08.120> there<00:05:09.120> are<00:05:09.300> stem<00:05:09.510> cells<00:05:09.540> there

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
cells and there are stem cells there

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.200 
cells and there are stem cells there
that<00:05:10.620> have<00:05:10.950> been<00:05:11.160> shown<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.670> be<00:05:11.760> able<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:12.030> give

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
that have been shown to be able to give

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.190 
that have been shown to be able to give
rise<00:05:12.450> to<00:05:12.480> nerve<00:05:12.990> muscle<00:05:13.800> and<00:05:14.040> bone<00:05:14.930> so<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:15.960> think

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
rise to nerve muscle and bone so I think

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.140 
rise to nerve muscle and bone so I think
the<00:05:16.590> future<00:05:16.920> potential<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.520> cord<00:05:17.790> blood<00:05:17.910> is

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
the future potential of cord blood is

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:26.240 
the future potential of cord blood is
very<00:05:18.570> exciting

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.310 

in<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.910> bank<00:05:27.120> here<00:05:27.420> we<00:05:27.660> have<00:05:27.900> stored<00:05:28.230> just

of patients all over the world quite a

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.390 
of patients all over the world quite a
few<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.780> them<00:05:40.900> are<00:05:41.169> used<00:05:41.470> within<00:05:41.770> Australia

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
few of them are used within Australia

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.710

that the public banks were set up in

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.760 
that the public banks were set up in
Australia<00:05:45.700> so<00:05:46.630> that<00:05:46.810> we<00:05:46.900> had<00:05:47.080> a<00:05:47.110> ready<00:05:47.410> source
