00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.830
 the list follows definition elements and most important properties 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.709
 the iese 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:08.869
 it's a tight curve and hope 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.919
 whose points constitute a locus that has the property of 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.810
 that the sum of distances from each of its points to two other fixed that and this 

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:23.369
 yamaha climate two bulbs is constant and even if at all to the length 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.439
 of the major axis to crimes 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.909
 The first thing we are going to do to understand this is to find the spotlights 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.730
 to find the few what we do is take the military is to say half of the 

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:36.570
 Month of May 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 and clicking on steven d indistinctly 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 we draw two arcs on each side of the major axis 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.220
 what to cut 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.960
 to the major axis itself in the spotlights 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.370
 we are going to designate these foci as efe 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.370
 and f respectively 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.560
 if we take a point 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.310
 any analyze 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.450
 a month point 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.300
 and we unite it with the spotlights 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.730
 what we are drawing are the radii of propeller towers and the 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.730
 We will designate desestimulos 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.470
 pierre climate equal such a point we have designated commented 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.280
 will be the property of what the slogan is repressed 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.660
 is matched to 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.180
 the distance between the spotlights 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.590
 we are going to call her 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.560
 2 p magnitude 2 p equal to the distance I left less that magnitude 2b 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.400
 dosa therefore 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.080
 plan the major axis 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.170
 2 that the distance between few 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.500
 painted supe 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.880
 distance 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.980
 between the ends of the efe - 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.810
 as we see in the drawing the distance 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.170
 gf 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 will be matched 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.410
 the center of the circumference 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.410
 that center of symmetry of it we designate as 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 and the ends of the minor axis like zaire 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.249
 just as the ends of this May will be 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.150
 commitment of these designations and these measures 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.749
 we can also see 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.679
 that the distance between a focus 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.449
 to the center 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.449
 We will be like faith 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.889
 I made the iquique relation to the square 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.619
 is equal to the square 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:41.659
 square mascia 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.489
 Well now what we are going to do is draw other elements of the crisis 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.150
 as we have seen it is easy conference that has as center the center of the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.619
 ellipse and radio peace 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.289
 that is, diameter 2 abbot 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.589
 this conference is called the main circle 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.159
 and the circumference 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.109
 principal 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.409
 of the ellipse is defined as the locus of the feet of the 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.369
 perpendiculars traced by the spotlights to each of the attendees 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:10.719
 in such a way that from a focus 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.069
 if we draw 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.409
 a 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.169
 straight 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.189
 to any point of the main circumference 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.049
 that is, we take a point in the main circle as we have 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.499
 seen in the drawing 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.519
 and we draw a line saying little to that point 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.369
 and from that point a perpendicular 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:37.109
 to the line drawn this perpendicular is a tangent to the ellipse as we are 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.139
 seeing in the drawing is tangential when leaving 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.509
 that's why it's said 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:45.679
 that in the main circle is defined as the locus of the 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:49.529
 faithful of the three films traced by the spotlights to each of the 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:53.009
 tangents 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.799
 as well 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.609
 then what we are going to do is draw other circles the 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.029
 called focal circumferences that have as focus center 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.759
 and radio thing is to say the measure of the major axis 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.769
 we click on so much nc 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.750
 with famous factual distanced this arc that we are drawing that is 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.239
 puebla pue girth frame 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.079
 focal 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.329
 it is decisive 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.779
 we would see all of you to the conference would be the focal circumference 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.359
 and clicking 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.360
 in this climate concentrated in this climate we will trace 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.360
 the symmetrical 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.949
 the focal symmetric circumference 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.770
 we already have the main circle and the two focal circles that 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.699
 designate 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.029
 like cd 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:44.129
 his thirteen as the main one says goodbye signa as jesus t live 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.110
 with the orange arrow 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.979
 that radio these 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.979
 wind if we catch a point the says any 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.909
 we will see what 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.229
 milk can also be defined as the locus of the centers of 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.969
 circumference is that they go through a focus and are target is to the circumference 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.080
 focal of the other focus 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.710
 that is happy 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.870
 at a point of the lix and passing through a focus that circumstance passer tangent to 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.440
 the focal circumference 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.370
 the other focus as we are seeing in the amount in the minute 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.120
 and themselves the center of the focal circumference is to say little efe 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.650
 with the point of the license 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.870
 we obtain 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.699
 is symmetric of the other focus on the focal circumference ie the 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.189
 point of tangency 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.199
 where it is short to the main circumference passing it 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.729
 within the circumference we have again 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.740
 a tangent 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.410
 a tangent line we can see it in the hotel the other point that we had heard 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.569
 at the beginning the main circle the initial point to Carlos Lapetra efe 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.289
 from the ine 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.479
 short in the focal 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.479
 at a point of tangency that will merge with the other focus 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.770
 will cut at the point of tangency the own says it will be 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.749
 turn the center of a circle 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.210
 that will go through a police fence 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.210
 and will be so people to the portal circumference of the other focus 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.960
 we are designated the elements 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.960
 we have solved in this way 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:34.059
 defining the most important elements and properties of the 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.589
 license
