00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
general it is very quickly very obvious

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719 
general it is very quickly very obvious
that<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.350> more<00:01:13.560> time<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.950> invest<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.700> a

at that warm task its Starcraft 2 it is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
at that warm task its Starcraft 2 it is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
obvious because you go up in ranks you
can<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.450> how<00:01:21.570> well<00:01:21.840> you're<00:01:22.049> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
can actually see how well you're you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.350 
can actually see how well you're you
know<00:01:22.560> competing<00:01:23.130> forces<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.610> opponents<00:01:24.119> but

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
know competing forces your opponents but

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
know competing forces your opponents but
in<00:01:24.479> real<00:01:24.630> life<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:25.020> exactly<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> same<00:01:25.770> if

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
in real life it's exactly the same if

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890 
in real life it's exactly the same if
you<00:01:26.070> spend<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> lot<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.790> time<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.210> something<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
you spend a lot of time in something it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.420 
you spend a lot of time in something it
will<00:01:28.140> obviously<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.860> better<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.280> will

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
will obviously get better it will

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.340 
will obviously get better it will
obviously<00:01:30.060> improve<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.659> that's<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
obviously improve and that's one of

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.780 
obviously improve and that's one of
these<00:01:31.470> main<00:01:31.799> things<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.520> definitely

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
these main things that I have definitely

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
these main things that I have definitely
learned<00:01:33.329> from<00:01:33.570> playing<00:01:33.720> years<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.619> years<00:01:34.770> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
learned from playing years and years of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.530 
learned from playing years and years of
video<00:01:35.009> games<00:01:35.310> number<00:01:35.729> two<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.150> actually<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
video games number two it's actually a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.660 
video games number two it's actually a
little<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.229> people<00:01:37.619> kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.009> skill<00:01:38.250> but

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
little bit of a people kind of skill but

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
little bit of a people kind of skill but
in<00:01:38.820> general<00:01:39.270> people<00:01:39.659> are<00:01:39.930> kind<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.350> mean

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
in general people are kind of mean

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.200 
in general people are kind of mean
especially<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.430> video<00:01:41.729> games<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.030> will

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
especially in video games you will

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.819 
especially in video games you will
notice<00:01:42.570> very<00:01:42.810> quickly<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.380> people<00:01:43.409> will

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
notice very quickly that people will

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.859 
notice very quickly that people will
never<00:01:44.159> ever<00:01:44.399> blame<00:01:44.759> themselves<00:01:45.000> even<00:01:45.840> though

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
never ever blame themselves even though

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389 
never ever blame themselves even though
it's<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:46.170> obvious<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.070> were<00:01:47.250> at<00:01:47.369> a

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
it's very obvious that they were at a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.330 
it's very obvious that they were at a
mistake<00:01:47.850> its<00:01:48.360> Starcraft<00:01:48.840> 2<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.140> example

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
mistake its Starcraft 2 for example

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.469 
mistake its Starcraft 2 for example
people<00:01:50.340> actually<00:01:50.490> rage<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.180> they've

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
people actually rage because they've

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.730 
people actually rage because they've
been<00:01:51.659> losing<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.170> they<00:01:52.259> will<00:01:52.409> blame

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
been losing and they will blame

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.039 
been losing and they will blame
everything<00:01:53.399> put<00:01:53.970> themselves<00:01:54.450> oftentimes

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
everything put themselves oftentimes

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
everything put themselves oftentimes
people<00:01:55.259> will<00:01:55.439> search<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.159> reason<00:01:56.579> while

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
people will search for a reason while

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
people will search for a reason while
they<00:01:57.299> are<00:01:57.479> actually<00:01:57.840> at<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> mistake<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
they are actually at a mistake so that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.230 
they are actually at a mistake so that
actually<00:01:59.189> means<00:01:59.340> they<00:01:59.549> will<00:01:59.700> either<00:01:59.880> like

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
actually means they will either like

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.789 
actually means they will either like
blame<00:02:00.630> something<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.200> balance<00:02:01.590> which<00:02:01.770> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
blame something like balance which is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.530 
blame something like balance which is
very<00:02:02.100> obvious<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.520> StarCraft<00:02:02.909> II<00:02:03.030> they<00:02:03.390> will

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
very obvious in StarCraft II they will

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.179 
very obvious in StarCraft II they will
blame<00:02:03.719> time<00:02:04.079> they<00:02:04.259> will<00:02:04.409> blame<00:02:04.590> other<00:02:04.829> people

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
blame time they will blame other people

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.980 
blame time they will blame other people
they<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.549> blame<00:02:05.969> everything<00:02:06.540> but

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
they will blame everything but

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.510 
they will blame everything but
themselves<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> these

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
themselves and this is one of these

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.859 
themselves and this is one of these
things<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.090> learned<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.450> Starcraft

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
things that I have learned is Starcraft

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.610 
things that I have learned is Starcraft
often<00:02:10.170> times<00:02:10.379> you're<00:02:10.800> actually

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
often times you're actually

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.899 
often times you're actually
you're<00:02:11.830> actually<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.220> problem<00:02:12.549> and<00:02:12.819> that's

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
you're actually the problem and that's

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.520 
you're actually the problem and that's
something<00:02:13.299> else<00:02:13.420> not<00:02:13.659> some<00:02:13.900> sort<00:02:14.049> of<00:02:14.140> balance

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
something else not some sort of balance

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.199 
something else not some sort of balance
but<00:02:14.890> you're<00:02:15.220> actually<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> one<00:02:15.909> that<00:02:16.030> should

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
but you're actually the one that should

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.509 
but you're actually the one that should
improve<00:02:16.540> number<00:02:17.290> three<00:02:17.500> focus<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.489> think

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
improve number three focus and I think

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.009 
improve number three focus and I think
this<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.909> one<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.269> most<00:02:19.420> important<00:02:19.930> things

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
this is one of the most important things

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.449 
this is one of the most important things
oftentimes<00:02:20.620> what<00:02:20.769> happens<00:02:20.799> is<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
oftentimes what happens is that you

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.610 
oftentimes what happens is that you
spent<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.819> ton<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.180> time<00:02:22.330> on<00:02:22.989> things<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.409> are

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
spent a ton of time on things that are

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.380 
spent a ton of time on things that are
actually<00:02:23.769> really<00:02:24.250> not<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.760> important<00:02:25.239> where

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
actually really not that important where

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.390 
actually really not that important where
you<00:02:25.450> think<00:02:25.659> about<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.959> later<00:02:26.080> on<00:02:26.319> usually<00:02:27.220> at

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
you think about it later on usually at

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.890 
you think about it later on usually at
least<00:02:27.430> I've<00:02:27.849> realized<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.540> spend<00:02:28.810> about

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
least I've realized that I spend about

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.839 
least I've realized that I spend about
80%<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.650> my<00:02:29.799> time<00:02:30.010> doing<00:02:30.190> things<00:02:30.549> that<00:02:30.670> are<00:02:30.819> not

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
80% of my time doing things that are not

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.300 
80% of my time doing things that are not
important<00:02:31.480> about<00:02:31.870> 20%<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.799> time<00:02:32.980> on

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
important about 20% of the time on

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.339 
important about 20% of the time on
things<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.700> are<00:02:33.879> actually<00:02:33.909> valuable<00:02:34.659> in<00:02:35.049> the

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
things that are actually valuable in the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.809 
things that are actually valuable in the
near<00:02:35.530> future<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.159> the<00:02:36.250> same<00:02:36.430> thing<00:02:36.640> goes<00:02:36.670> for

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
near future and the same thing goes for

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.640 
near future and the same thing goes for
StarCraft<00:02:37.390> II<00:02:37.480> if<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:37.750> gotta<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.260> know<00:02:38.319> spend

StarCraft II if you gotta you know spend

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.289 
StarCraft II if you gotta you know spend

are lacking
you<00:02:42.909> really<00:02:43.209> should<00:02:43.420> prioritize<00:02:44.109> your<00:02:44.560> focus

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
you really should prioritize your focus

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.800 
you really should prioritize your focus
if<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.760> actually<00:02:45.910> managed<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:46.450> do<00:02:46.569> that<00:02:46.720> in

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
if you actually managed to do that in

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.420 
if you actually managed to do that in
real<00:02:46.959> life<00:02:47.200> as<00:02:47.349> well<00:02:47.379> you<00:02:47.620> managed<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:47.980> focus

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
real life as well you managed to focus

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.009 
real life as well you managed to focus
on<00:02:48.519> only<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.940> tasks<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.660> are<00:02:49.870> either

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
on only the tasks that you are either

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.930 
on only the tasks that you are either
paid<00:02:50.379> to<00:02:50.590> do<00:02:50.739> or<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.489> past<00:02:51.730> if<00:02:51.910> you

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
paid to do or in the past if you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.479 
paid to do or in the past if you
actually<00:02:52.209> are<00:02:52.680> rewarded<00:02:53.680> for<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:54.310> will

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
actually are rewarded for you will

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.280 
actually are rewarded for you will
obviously<00:02:54.879> start<00:02:55.450> making<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.840> ton<00:02:56.140> more

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
obviously start making a ton more

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.890 
obviously start making a ton more
progress<00:02:56.799> if<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.340> spend<00:02:57.640> your<00:02:57.730> time

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
progress if you spend your time

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.880 
progress if you spend your time
efficiently<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.109> that<00:02:59.260> actually<00:02:59.560> brings<00:02:59.769> me

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
efficiently and that actually brings me

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.039 
efficiently and that actually brings me
to<00:03:00.040> number<00:03:00.220> four<00:03:00.640> as<00:03:00.819> well<00:03:01.060> which<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.510> finish

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
to number four as well which is finish

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.990 
to number four as well which is finish
what<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.500> started<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.549> actually<00:03:03.849> one<00:03:03.970> of

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
what you started this is actually one of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.399 
what you started this is actually one of
these<00:03:04.209> things<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.599> is<00:03:04.659> very<00:03:04.930> obvious<00:03:05.079> to

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
these things that is very obvious to

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.470 
these things that is very obvious to
start<00:03:05.650> if<00:03:05.769> -<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.310> can't<00:03:06.609> just<00:03:06.819> launch<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.269> game

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
start if - you can't just launch a game

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.210 
start if - you can't just launch a game
and<00:03:07.720> actually<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:08.409> know<00:03:08.530> walk<00:03:08.739> away<00:03:09.010> in<00:03:09.159> the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
and actually you know walk away in the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.649 
and actually you know walk away in the
middle<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.700> that's<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:10.299> not<00:03:10.480> gonna

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
middle of it that's just not gonna

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:11.160 
middle of it that's just not gonna
happen

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
happen

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.809 
happen
you<00:03:11.260> need<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.650> sit<00:03:11.859> down<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.069> actually<00:03:12.250> focus

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
you need to sit down and actually focus

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.789 
you need to sit down and actually focus
for<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.030> entire<00:03:13.390> duration<00:03:13.629> of<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.260> game<00:03:14.290> now

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
for the entire duration of the game now

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.379 
for the entire duration of the game now
this<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.159> obviously<00:03:15.609> through<00:03:15.880> for<00:03:16.060> real<00:03:16.180> life

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
this is obviously through for real life

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.000 
this is obviously through for real life
as<00:03:16.540> well<00:03:16.720> what<00:03:17.109> I<00:03:17.139> used<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.500> do<00:03:17.590> at<00:03:17.709> Sun<00:03:17.889> is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
as well what I used to do at Sun is

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.710 
as well what I used to do at Sun is
actually<00:03:18.310> just<00:03:18.519> sit<00:03:18.700> down<00:03:18.730> do<00:03:19.359> like<00:03:19.510> 10

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
actually just sit down do like 10

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.240 
actually just sit down do like 10
minutes<00:03:20.019> of<00:03:20.079> work<00:03:20.139> and<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.919> know<00:03:21.040> do

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
minutes of work and then you know do

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.589 
minutes of work and then you know do
something<00:03:21.489> else<00:03:21.730> for<00:03:21.880> like<00:03:22.000> 10<00:03:22.209> minutes<00:03:22.239> and

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
something else for like 10 minutes and

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.789 
something else for like 10 minutes and
then<00:03:22.690> eventually<00:03:22.989> get<00:03:23.319> back<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.620> work

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
then eventually get back to work

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.009 
then eventually get back to work
nowadays<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.760> can<00:03:24.910> actually<00:03:25.030> get<00:03:25.569> done<00:03:25.660> a

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
nowadays I can actually get done a

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.140 
nowadays I can actually get done a
lot<00:03:26.230> easier<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:26.829> just<00:03:27.190> sit<00:03:27.400> down<00:03:27.430> focus<00:03:27.879> on

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
lot easier and just sit down focus on

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.849 
lot easier and just sit down focus on
one<00:03:28.299> task<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.440> I'll<00:03:29.560> till<00:03:29.709> it's

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
one task and do it I'll till it's

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.470 
one task and do it I'll till it's
finished<00:03:30.040> four<00:03:30.340> hours<00:03:30.639> of<00:03:30.790> home<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.359> is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
finished four hours of home and that is

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.479 
finished four hours of home and that is
something<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.230> definitely<00:03:32.500> could<00:03:33.129> not<00:03:33.160> do

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
something that I definitely could not do

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.970 
something that I definitely could not do
before<00:03:33.910> playing<00:03:34.660> Starcraft<00:03:35.139> 2<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.500> number

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
before playing Starcraft 2 and number

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.289 
before playing Starcraft 2 and number
five<00:03:36.190> which<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.430> arguably<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.120> most

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
five which is arguably the most

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.420 
five which is arguably the most
important<00:03:37.900> one<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.200> pretty<00:03:38.680> much<00:03:38.769> like<00:03:39.250> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
important one I pretty much like the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.580 
important one I pretty much like the
ability<00:03:39.609> to<00:03:39.879> rage<00:03:40.209> nowadays<00:03:40.720> before<00:03:41.560> I

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
ability to rage nowadays before I

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.170 
ability to rage nowadays before I
actually<00:03:41.859> started<00:03:42.340> playing<00:03:42.579> soccer<00:03:42.790> field<00:03:43.120> I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
actually started playing soccer field I

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.939 
actually started playing soccer field I
used<00:03:43.389> to<00:03:43.480> get<00:03:43.599> mad<00:03:43.780> quite<00:03:44.109> often<00:03:44.290> about<00:03:44.590> little

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
used to get mad quite often about little

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.770 
used to get mad quite often about little
things<00:03:45.129> but<00:03:45.280> nowadays<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.790> realized<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.569> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
things but nowadays I realized in the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.629 
things but nowadays I realized in the
grand<00:03:47.109> scheme<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.470> things<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:48.010> really<00:03:48.099> no

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
grand scheme of things it's really no

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.000 
grand scheme of things it's really no
big<00:03:48.940> deal<00:03:48.970> if<00:03:49.389> you<00:03:49.810> actually<00:03:50.139> manage<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.470> you
