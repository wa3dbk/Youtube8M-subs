messes up my muscle memory different
games<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.510> very<00:00:24.900> different<00:00:25.439> settings<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
games have very different settings and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the acceleration and stuff like that so

it's the one that i've been using the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.389 
it's the one that i've been using the
most<00:00:41.840> holy<00:00:42.840> shit<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.649> fucking<00:00:43.980> hard<00:00:44.160> with

most holy shit it's so fucking hard with
a<00:00:44.600> view<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:47.219> play<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:47.640> new<00:00:47.760> computer<00:00:47.969> i

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
a view to play with my new computer i

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
a view to play with my new computer i
can<00:00:49.289> take<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> while<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.280> used<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
can take a while to get used to this I

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.200 
can take a while to get used to this I
know<00:00:51.570> where<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.910> maybe<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
know where it is really maybe it's the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.340 
know where it is really maybe it's the
monitor<00:00:54.600> resolution<00:00:54.899> that's<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> I

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
monitor resolution that's just it I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.920 
monitor resolution that's just it I
don't<00:00:58.350> know<00:01:00.050> well<00:01:01.460> it's<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.059> aspect<00:01:03.449> ratio<00:01:03.510> I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
don't know well it's the aspect ratio I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.859 
don't know well it's the aspect ratio I
would<00:01:04.080> say<00:01:04.939> yeah<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.750> big

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
would say yeah because it's a big

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.340 
would say yeah because it's a big
difference<00:01:07.229> between<00:01:07.729> 16<00:01:08.729> by<00:01:08.850> 10<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.330> 16<00:01:09.630> by<00:01:09.750> 9

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:24.569 

I'm<00:01:14.360> shield<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.479> generator<00:01:15.990> critical

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.249 

now<00:01:25.579> aside<00:01:26.000> from<00:01:26.030> just<00:01:26.570> being<00:01:26.810> away<00:01:27.020> from<00:01:27.079> the

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
now aside from just being away from the

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.980 
now aside from just being away from the
game<00:01:27.469> and<00:01:27.770> being<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.700> little<00:01:28.939> bit<00:01:29.060> unused<00:01:29.509> two

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
game and being a little bit unused two

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.050 
game and being a little bit unused two
different<00:01:30.710> things<00:01:30.829> I'm<00:01:31.250> not<00:01:31.549> entirely<00:01:31.880> sure

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
different things I'm not entirely sure

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.910 
different things I'm not entirely sure
what<00:01:32.689> part<00:01:33.170> of<00:01:33.380> my<00:01:33.979> new<00:01:34.189> rig<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.149> actually

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
what part of my new rig that actually

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.100 
what part of my new rig that actually
creates<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.219> biggest<00:01:37.939> changes<00:01:38.539> so<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.840> speak

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
creates the biggest changes so to speak

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.069 
creates the biggest changes so to speak
I<00:01:39.470> do<00:01:40.039> believe<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.610> aspect<00:01:40.939> ratio<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.600> my

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
I do believe that the aspect ratio of my

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.679 
I do believe that the aspect ratio of my
new<00:01:42.259> monitor<00:01:42.710> is<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:42.979> big<00:01:43.340> deal<00:01:43.490> but<00:01:44.210> I've<00:01:44.539> also

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
new monitor is a big deal but I've also

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.779 
new monitor is a big deal but I've also
heard<00:01:44.899> that<00:01:44.960> since<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:46.039> a<00:01:46.069> hundred<00:01:46.670> and

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
heard that since this is a hundred and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.760 
heard that since this is a hundred and
forty<00:01:47.060> four<00:01:47.210> Hertz<00:01:47.420> monitor<00:01:47.929> which<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.380> haven't

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
forty four Hertz monitor which I haven't

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.959 
forty four Hertz monitor which I haven't
said<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.039> you<00:01:49.130> by<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.280> way<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.490> have<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:49.850> set

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
said it to you by the way I have it set

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.999 
said it to you by the way I have it set
only<00:01:50.179> to<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> hundred<00:01:50.780> but<00:01:51.409> either<00:01:51.530> way<00:01:51.710> having

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
only to a hundred but either way having

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.639 
only to a hundred but either way having
a<00:01:52.100> higher<00:01:52.280> frequency<00:01:52.610> monitor<00:01:53.360> will<00:01:53.990> allow

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
a higher frequency monitor will allow

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.830 
a higher frequency monitor will allow
your<00:01:54.799> game<00:01:55.039> to<00:01:55.220> just<00:01:55.429> react<00:01:55.789> faster<00:01:56.299> as<00:01:56.479> far<00:01:56.720> as

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
your game to just react faster as far as

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.389 
your game to just react faster as far as
I've<00:01:56.990> heard<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.319> it<00:01:57.439> might<00:01:57.770> be<00:01:58.009> what<00:01:58.280> I'm

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
I've heard that it might be what I'm

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.249 
I've heard that it might be what I'm
experiencing<00:01:59.299> it's<00:01:59.720> just<00:01:59.869> that<00:02:00.020> when<00:02:00.170> you

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
experiencing it's just that when you

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.809 
experiencing it's just that when you
have<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:00.619> many<00:02:00.799> different<00:02:01.189> things<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:01.700> are

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
have so many different things that are

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.210 
have so many different things that are
new<00:02:01.970> at<00:02:02.209> once<00:02:02.630> then<00:02:03.319> it's<00:02:03.500> almost<00:02:03.890> impossible

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
new at once then it's almost impossible

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.669 
new at once then it's almost impossible
to<00:02:04.579> pinpoint<00:02:04.789> what<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.659> exact<00:02:06.079> specific

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
to pinpoint what is the exact specific

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.850 
to pinpoint what is the exact specific
thing<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:07.239> makes<00:02:08.239> you<00:02:08.390> as<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.539> player

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
thing that makes you as a player

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.259 
thing that makes you as a player
experience<00:02:09.860> one<00:02:10.099> thing<00:02:10.369> different<00:02:10.789> compared

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
experience one thing different compared

experience one thing different compared
to<00:02:11.450> another<00:02:11.510> Wow<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> lot<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.650> guys<00:02:12.769> might

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
to another Wow a lot of you guys might

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.650 
to another Wow a lot of you guys might
be<00:02:13.010> wondering<00:02:13.280> why<00:02:13.579> would<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:13.849> lower<00:02:14.269> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
be wondering why would I lower the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.620 
be wondering why would I lower the
refresh<00:02:15.110> rate<00:02:15.290> from<00:02:15.709> 144<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.819> hundred<00:02:17.150> and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
refresh rate from 144 to a hundred and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.780 
refresh rate from 144 to a hundred and
the<00:02:18.440> answer<00:02:18.799> is<00:02:18.829> quite<00:02:19.069> simple<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.579> don't

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
the answer is quite simple I don't

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.640 
the answer is quite simple I don't
expect<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.390> have<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.840> high<00:02:21.049> frames<00:02:21.410> per

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
expect to have that high frames per

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.850 
expect to have that high frames per
second<00:02:21.950> implants<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.370> do<00:02:22.519> anyway<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.390> mean<00:02:24.049> 144

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
second implants I do anyway I mean 144

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.830 
second implants I do anyway I mean 144
frames<00:02:25.130> per<00:02:25.280> second<00:02:25.579> in<00:02:25.910> planetside<00:02:26.420> it's

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
frames per second in planetside it's

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.890 
frames per second in planetside it's
just<00:02:27.139> not<00:02:27.290> going<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.530> happen<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:28.370> any<00:02:28.970> relevant

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
just not going to happen in any relevant

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.440 
just not going to happen in any relevant
situation<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.680> for<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.459> same<00:02:31.609> reason<00:02:31.639> I<00:02:32.180> did

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
situation and for the same reason I did

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.349 
situation and for the same reason I did
of<00:02:32.630> course<00:02:32.810> also<00:02:33.109> set<00:02:33.650> my<00:02:33.829> FPS<00:02:34.340> limiter<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:34.970> 100

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
of course also set my FPS limiter to 100

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.000 
of course also set my FPS limiter to 100
and<00:02:35.600> there's<00:02:36.139> something<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:36.470> can<00:02:36.530> do<00:02:36.709> in<00:02:36.889> the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
and there's something you can do in the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.759 
and there's something you can do in the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
250 which is a quite too ridiculously

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.590 
250 which is a quite too ridiculously
high<00:02:51.019> number<00:02:51.350> i<00:02:51.380> might<00:02:51.620> add<00:02:55.329> hey<00:02:56.329> can<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.540> get

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
high number i might add hey can I get

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.270 
high number i might add hey can I get
the<00:02:56.930> score<00:02:57.230> later<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.470> need<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.709> put<00:02:58.100> up<00:02:58.160> a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
the score later I need to put up a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.460 
the score later I need to put up a
beacon<00:02:58.459> air<00:02:58.670> yeah<00:02:59.450> sure

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
beacon air yeah sure

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.270 
beacon air yeah sure
just<00:03:02.470> be<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.550> thong<00:03:03.730> here

see<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> quick<00:03:13.830> reader<00:03:14.130> go<00:03:14.310> there<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.760> order<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
see a quick reader go there in order to

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.750 
see a quick reader go there in order to
redeploy<00:03:16.260> into<00:03:16.710> my<00:03:16.830> spawn<00:03:17.190> beacon<00:03:17.340> because<00:03:17.730> I

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
redeploy into my spawn beacon because I

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.670 
redeploy into my spawn beacon because I
was<00:03:17.910> running<00:03:18.180> out<00:03:18.240> of<00:03:18.300> ammo<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.870> one<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
was running out of ammo and one of the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.620 
was running out of ammo and one of the
things<00:03:19.740> that<00:03:20.070> I've<00:03:20.250> also<00:03:20.520> been<00:03:21.000> trying<00:03:21.330> out<00:03:21.450> is

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
things that I've also been trying out is

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.660 
things that I've also been trying out is
to<00:03:21.840> play<00:03:22.080> infantry<00:03:22.650> with<00:03:22.890> higher<00:03:23.160> render

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
to play infantry with higher render

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.500 
to play infantry with higher render
distance<00:03:23.910> than<00:03:24.510> 500<00:03:25.440> 500<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.310> lowest<00:03:26.910> at

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
distance than 500 500 is the lowest at

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.960 
distance than 500 500 is the lowest at
least<00:03:27.750> with<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.050> in-game<00:03:28.410> slider<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.730> know

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
least with the in-game slider and I know

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.780 
least with the in-game slider and I know
this<00:03:30.210> is<00:03:30.330> something<00:03:30.480> i<00:03:30.630> don't<00:03:30.840> recommend<00:03:31.110> and

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
this is something i don't recommend and

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.370 
this is something i don't recommend and
normally<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.880> would<00:03:33.270> just<00:03:33.480> deliver<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.050> down<00:03:34.230> to

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
normally I would just deliver it down to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.440 
normally I would just deliver it down to
500<00:03:34.620> because<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.280> no<00:03:35.430> reason<00:03:35.610> not<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:36.000> in

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
500 because there is no reason not to in

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.360 
500 because there is no reason not to in
my<00:03:36.720> opinion<00:03:36.900> except<00:03:37.710> for<00:03:37.860> one<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.250> that's

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
my opinion except for one and that's

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.650 
my opinion except for one and that's
what<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.670> saw<00:03:38.820> when<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.060> was<00:03:39.180> really<00:03:39.420> proving

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
what you saw when I was really proving

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.960 
what you saw when I was really proving
there<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.440> need<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.800> have<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.280> horrendous

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
there you need to have a horrendous

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.610 
there you need to have a horrendous
distance<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.230> think<00:03:43.440> eight

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
distance it to like I think eight

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.380 
distance it to like I think eight
hundred<00:03:43.950> or<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.100> thousand<00:03:44.700> in<00:03:44.850> order<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.210> see

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
hundred or a thousand in order to see

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.050 
hundred or a thousand in order to see
the<00:03:45.570> ground<00:03:45.810> when<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.590> first<00:03:46.890> start<00:03:47.430> dropping

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
the ground when you first start dropping

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.240 
the ground when you first start dropping
down<00:03:48.240> and<00:03:48.660> for<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.410> ones<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.770> didn't<00:03:50.160> know

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
down and for the ones of you didn't know

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.070 
down and for the ones of you didn't know
it<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.180> kind<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.450> engagements<00:03:52.050> that

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
it this is the kind of engagements that

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.610 
it this is the kind of engagements that
I<00:03:52.230> choose<00:03:52.590> my<00:03:52.620> carbines<00:03:53.340> for<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:54.380> out<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.530> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
I choose my carbines for and out of the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.020 
I choose my carbines for and out of the
Terran<00:03:55.920> Republic<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.460> believe<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
Terran Republic I believe that the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.870 
Terran Republic I believe that the
difference<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.840> best<00:03:58.170> about<00:03:58.680> some<00:03:59.610> people

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
difference is the best about some people

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.940 
difference is the best about some people
like<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.120> Cougar<00:04:00.330> better<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:00.750> just<00:04:00.870> don't<00:04:01.290> now

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
like the Cougar better I just don't now

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.770 
like the Cougar better I just don't now
