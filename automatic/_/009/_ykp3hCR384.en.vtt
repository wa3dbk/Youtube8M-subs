00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.680
 hello mushroom friends today there is one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.680
 small and very spontaneous video 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.970
 I'm actually only one today 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.460
 bit by bike on the way 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.470
 and as always, of course, I'm looking left 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 and on the right what the mushrooms do 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.920
 and yes, I have a little something 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.920
 discovered that I want to show you once 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.090
 We are now worth starting at the beginning of June 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.750
 she is actually already after the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:51.390
 First roan watching here 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 let's see she also shows some things 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.350
 I still have a spontaneous thing 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.300
 not included but if you are in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 deciduous forest is on the way worth focusing on 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.250
 all times to look 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.550
 yes, what did we find here? 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.550
 are 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.630
 I'll pick one up and there 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.440
 it immediately shows what it is like that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.000
 are flakes of stellar witches 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.390
 These are pretty much the first ones 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.800
 apprentices who show each other in the year where 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.580
 then it really worth it 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.350
 gather 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.780
 I 'm going around a bit here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.250
 what I still have to find you have to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.960
 Have a good look here 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.490
 they like to hide themselves in the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.050
 grass is quite strong and young whole 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.270
 crisp wonderful very nice copy 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.210
 fine thing if we again 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.390
 continue to look here too 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:02:01.110
 really nice boobs looks very tight 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:03.660
 very wonderful from soja one more time 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.880
 a very big so even this 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.350
 very big a bit torn up 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.720
 through the dryness of the last few days 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.570
 So even this big one still looks 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.590
 wonderful from it really very firm and 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.709
 scary heavy down from style a bit 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.250
 eroded by the snail quite big 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.000
 class 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.950
 Let's see what I do here 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.019
 still found is a summer 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.700
 boletus also the first for this year 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.220
 The drought has badly here already 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.690
 added here were several of the goods 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.380
 but no longer usable 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.390
 he still looks pretty neat 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.709
 Of course, this is worth it if you are in the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.519
 deciduous forest on the way before all things 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.920
 under oak trees 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.870
 It is also called a porcini mushroom 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.910
 you can already find in principle already 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.080
 Here we have to see if it is 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.510
 after use can be said as the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.890
 others were already too old already too 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.510
 I'm really late over there 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.230
 come and here is something else 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.459
 found another 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.330
 I also want to show you that 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.680
 It's the first women's baptism for this 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.489
 year 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.489
 because it looks quite good 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.420
 so the yield I have here 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.720
 put together on a small pile 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.950
 that's really won doll well 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.050
 I do not have any at all today 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.510
 counting was not prepared and 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.360
 I have no basket at the same time 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.010
 means the mushrooms must be careful behind 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.320
 put into theampfkorb because 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.480
 I always go with it and then I will 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.930
 I drive home carefully yes that 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.800
 the things arrive safely home 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.840
 that's it for today mushroom friends only 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.580
 very short spontaneous video and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.670
 Maybe we'll see each other next time 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.670
 again
