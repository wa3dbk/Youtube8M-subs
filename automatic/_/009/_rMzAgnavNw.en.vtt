making video reviews on YouTube though I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.130 
making video reviews on YouTube though I

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
stopped doing that which was basically a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740 
stopped doing that which was basically a
year<00:00:37.590> ago<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> past<00:00:38.879> year<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> haven't

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750

reread<00:00:40.079> anything<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.829> that's<00:00:41.280> because<00:00:41.700> I

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
reread anything and that's because I

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
reread anything and that's because I
felt<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.420> was<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.870> backwards<00:00:43.530> movement

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
felt that it was a backwards movement

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that I was not progressing in my reading

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.810 
that I was not progressing in my reading
that<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:46.559> looking<00:00:46.829> backwards<00:00:47.340> instead<00:00:47.550> of

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
that I was looking backwards instead of

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.299 
that I was looking backwards instead of
forwards<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.289> being<00:00:49.500> redundant<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
it it is such a great new novel I just

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.770 
it it is such a great new novel I just
want<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> fly<00:01:41.250> through<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.909> see<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.360> happens

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and usually you're more focused on the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.420 
and usually you're more focused on the
plot<00:01:45.720> aspect<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.590> not<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.860> everything<00:01:47.130> else

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
plot aspect and not on everything else

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.800 
plot aspect and not on everything else
because<00:01:47.729> you're<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.149> enthralled<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
because you're just so enthralled in the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
because you're just so enthralled in the
story<00:01:49.130> therefore<00:01:50.130> when<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.579> back<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
story therefore when you go back for the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060 
story therefore when you go back for the
second<00:01:51.450> time<00:01:51.630> around<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> ability

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
second time around you have the ability

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.620 
second time around you have the ability
to<00:01:53.100> pick<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> lot<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.119> things<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.479> might

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
to pick up on a lot of things you might

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.149 
to pick up on a lot of things you might
have<00:01:54.780> missed<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.350> classics<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.009> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
have missed with classics when you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.670 
have missed with classics when you
reread<00:01:56.549> them<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.090> usually<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.049> ability

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
reread them you usually have the ability

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
pick up on more symbolism that you

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.790 
pick up on more symbolism that you
didn't<00:02:00.360> notice<00:02:00.570> first<00:02:00.810> time<00:02:01.050> or<00:02:01.290> with<00:02:01.620> more

didn't notice first time or with more
complex<00:02:02.220> plots<00:02:02.550> like<00:02:02.760> Harry<00:02:03.000> Potter<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.780> more

complex plots like Harry Potter the more

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.230 
complex plots like Harry Potter the more
you<00:02:04.200> reread<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.280> more<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.610> figure<00:02:06.090> out

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you reread them the more you figure out

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.660 
you reread them the more you figure out
more<00:02:06.510> things<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.200> more<00:02:07.460> foreshadowing<00:02:08.460> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
more things and more foreshadowing and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.700 
more things and more foreshadowing and
more<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.330> tricky<00:02:09.810> little<00:02:10.170> pieces<00:02:10.500> of

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
more just tricky little pieces of

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.750 
more just tricky little pieces of
awesome<00:02:11.670> complexity<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:13.050> JK<00:02:13.440> Rowling<00:02:13.760> wove

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
awesome complexity that JK Rowling wove

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.820 
awesome complexity that JK Rowling wove
in<00:02:15.090> there<00:02:15.360> just<00:02:15.840> wove<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.500> all<00:02:16.650> together

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
in there just wove it all together

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.280 
in there just wove it all together
reading<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.760> book<00:02:17.940> though<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.810> not<00:02:19.080> like<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
reading a book though is not like a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.110 
reading a book though is not like a
movie<00:02:19.680> watching<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.280> movie<00:02:20.520> takes<00:02:20.820> three

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
movie watching the movie takes three

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.970 
movie watching the movie takes three
hours<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.630> most<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.170> doesn't<00:02:22.620> really

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
hours at most and it doesn't really

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.400 
hours at most and it doesn't really
usually<00:02:23.370> take<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.150> much<00:02:24.420> thought<00:02:25.020> unless

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
usually take that much thought unless

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.010 
usually take that much thought unless
you're<00:02:26.070> watching<00:02:26.190> inception<00:02:26.940> what<00:02:27.510> books<00:02:27.840> on

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
you're watching inception what books on

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.110 
you're watching inception what books on
the<00:02:28.170> other<00:02:28.320> hand<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:29.010> take<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> lot<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.610> time<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the other hand do take a lot of time and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.880 
the other hand do take a lot of time and
they<00:02:30.209> do<00:02:30.270> take<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> lot<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:30.989> thought<00:02:31.290> process

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
they do take a lot of thought process

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.260 
they do take a lot of thought process
you<00:02:32.040> can't<00:02:32.250> talk<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.700> other<00:02:32.820> people<00:02:32.970> while

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
you can't talk to other people while

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.120 
you can't talk to other people while
you're<00:02:33.390> reading<00:02:33.780> or<00:02:33.959> do<00:02:34.500> other<00:02:34.680> things<00:02:34.950> while

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
you're reading or do other things while

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.350 
you're reading or do other things while
you're<00:02:35.250> reading<00:02:35.550> it's<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.760> pretty<00:02:35.970> committed

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
you're reading it's a pretty committed

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.320 
you're reading it's a pretty committed
task<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.080> does<00:02:37.290> take<00:02:37.590> quite<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.920> while

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
task and it does take quite a while

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.210 
task and it does take quite a while
therefore<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.050> valid<00:02:40.470> point<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:41.070> put

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
therefore it's a valid point to put

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.310 
therefore it's a valid point to put
across<00:02:41.489> you're<00:02:42.300> wasting<00:02:42.750> your<00:02:42.780> time<00:02:43.050> in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
across you're wasting your time in

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.100 
across you're wasting your time in
rereading<00:02:43.770> books<00:02:43.890> because<00:02:44.670> you've<00:02:44.820> already

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
rereading books because you've already

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.150 
rereading books because you've already
experienced<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.200> adventure<00:02:47.010> you've

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
experienced that adventure you've

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.710 
experienced that adventure you've
already<00:02:47.430> learned<00:02:47.940> what<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.239> have<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.600> learn

from that book move on to another one
keep<00:02:50.940> moving<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.720> you're<00:02:51.870> always<00:02:52.050> learning

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
keep moving on so you're always learning

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.290 
keep moving on so you're always learning
more<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.920> always<00:02:53.190> picking<00:02:53.520> up<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:53.970> stuff

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
more and always picking up on more stuff

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.650 
more and always picking up on more stuff
I<00:02:54.600> knew<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> girl<00:02:55.620> who<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.550> flat-out<00:02:57.000> told<00:02:57.420> me

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
I knew a girl who just flat-out told me

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.080 
I knew a girl who just flat-out told me
that<00:02:57.989> she<00:02:58.230> doesn't<00:02:58.440> reread<00:02:58.980> books<00:02:59.250> she<00:02:59.820> loved

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that she doesn't reread books she loved

that she doesn't reread books she loved
to<00:03:00.480> read<00:03:00.720> though<00:03:01.020> but<00:03:01.320> she<00:03:01.530> told<00:03:01.770> me<00:03:01.920> she<00:03:02.070> never

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
to read though but she told me she never

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.340 
to read though but she told me she never
reads<00:03:02.940> books<00:03:03.239> because<00:03:03.570> she<00:03:03.720> seemed<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.110> feels

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
reads books because she seemed it feels

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.140 
reads books because she seemed it feels
to<00:03:04.530> her<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> waste<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.280> time<00:03:05.340> when<00:03:05.910> she's

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to her like a waste of time when she's

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.090 
to her like a waste of time when she's
reading<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.080> predictable<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.950> her

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
reading it it's so predictable to her

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.960 
reading it it's so predictable to her
she<00:03:08.280> doesn't<00:03:08.580> enjoy<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.090> experience<00:03:09.750> of

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
she doesn't enjoy the experience of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.699 
she doesn't enjoy the experience of
re-experiencing<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.269> tail<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.230> that's

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
re-experiencing the tail and that's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.100 
re-experiencing the tail and that's
valid<00:03:14.250> how<00:03:14.459> do<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.790> feel<00:03:15.120> about<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.600> another

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
valid how do you feel about that another
