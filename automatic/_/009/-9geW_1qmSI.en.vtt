that<00:02:01.170> there<00:02:01.320> aren't<00:02:01.469> very<00:02:01.560> many<00:02:01.710> shades<00:02:02.159> yet

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that there aren't very many shades yet

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.490 
that there aren't very many shades yet

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.130 
already tell this one's lighter than the
laura<00:02:08.160> mercier<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.539> feels<00:02:09.750> pretty<00:02:09.899> good

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
laura mercier one it feels pretty good

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.770 
laura mercier one it feels pretty good
it's<00:02:10.860> weird<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.310> feels<00:02:11.459> almost<00:02:11.730> powdery<00:02:12.420> if

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
it's weird it feels almost powdery if

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.600 
it's weird it feels almost powdery if
that's<00:02:13.080> possible<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.250> know<00:02:14.459> I'm

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
that's possible and just so you know I'm

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.729 
that's possible and just so you know I'm
actually<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:15.090> going<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.540> use<00:02:15.750> concealer

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
actually not going to use concealer

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.430 
actually not going to use concealer
today<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.120> see<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.660> fully<00:02:19.049> how

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
today so that I can see like fully how

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.830 
today so that I can see like fully how
they<00:02:19.680> hold<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.280> against<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:20.970> dark<00:02:21.420> circles

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
they hold up against like dark circles

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:32.360 
they hold up against like dark circles
and<00:02:22.110> zits<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.830> stuff<00:02:22.980> with<00:02:23.190> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.550 

so<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.550> feels<00:02:33.760> pretty<00:02:34.060> good<00:02:34.210> on<00:02:34.450> my<00:02:34.570> skin<00:02:34.630> it

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
so it feels pretty good on my skin it

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.370 
so it feels pretty good on my skin it
has<00:02:35.710> slightly<00:02:36.040> less<00:02:36.850> coverage<00:02:37.240> i<00:02:37.690> think<00:02:37.960> then

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
has slightly less coverage i think then

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.800 
has slightly less coverage i think then
the<00:02:38.650> laura<00:02:38.860> mercier<00:02:39.310> one<00:02:39.610> but<00:02:40.390> that's<00:02:40.540> okay

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
the laura mercier one but that's okay

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.240 
the laura mercier one but that's okay
though<00:02:40.960> because<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.380> actually<00:02:41.500> feels<00:02:42.010> really

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
though because it actually feels really

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.180 
though because it actually feels really
okay<00:02:43.210> honestly<00:02:43.930> up<00:02:44.200> close<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.560> can't<00:02:45.040> even

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
okay honestly up close you can't even

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.830 
okay honestly up close you can't even
really<00:02:45.490> tell<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.820> difference<00:02:45.940> between<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.690> two

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
really tell a difference between the two

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.260 
really tell a difference between the two
which<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.080> awesome<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:48.400> only<00:02:48.670> thing<00:02:48.850> that's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
which is awesome the only thing that's

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.700 
which is awesome the only thing that's
different<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.900> think<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.500> laura

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
different is that I think the laura

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.650 
different is that I think the laura
mercier<00:02:51.070> shade<00:02:51.340> i<00:02:51.370> picked<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.120> little<00:02:52.480> bit

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
mercier shade i picked is a little bit

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.980 
mercier shade i picked is a little bit
more<00:02:53.610> not<00:02:54.610> orange<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.630> little<00:02:55.900> bit

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
more not orange but like a little bit

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.260 
more not orange but like a little bit
more<00:02:56.110> tan<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.470> guess<00:02:56.920> even<00:02:57.610> though<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.820> matches

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
more tan I guess even though it matches

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.820 
more tan I guess even though it matches
my<00:02:58.450> skin<00:02:58.510> perfectly<00:02:59.200> like<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.620> one's<00:02:59.770> a

only<00:03:38.470> reason<00:03:38.800> why<00:03:39.070> I<00:03:39.100> think<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.820> can<00:03:40.000> tell<00:03:40.209> a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
only reason why I think I can tell a

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.880 
only reason why I think I can tell a
difference<00:03:40.360> between<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.290> left<00:03:41.530> side<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.800> my

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
face and the right side of my face is

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.420 
face and the right side of my face is
because<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:44.200> know<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.830> there's<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.040> difference

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
because I know that there's a difference

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.980 
because I know that there's a difference
I<00:03:45.580> think<00:03:45.790> it's<00:03:45.940> just<00:03:45.970> cuz<00:03:46.150> I'm<00:03:46.300> wanting<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.780> see

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
I think it's just cuz I'm wanting to see

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.740 
I think it's just cuz I'm wanting to see
one<00:03:47.230> honestly<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.970> looks<00:03:49.180> exactly<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.690> same

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
one honestly it looks exactly the same

like and and the only thing that's

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.600 
like and and the only thing that's
different<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:53.380> side<00:03:53.680> like<00:03:54.100> my<00:03:54.310> left

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
different is that this side like my left

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.990 
different is that this side like my left
side<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:55.320> slightly<00:03:56.320> lighter<00:03:56.950> but<00:03:57.340> not<00:03:57.580> even

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
side is slightly lighter but not even

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.830 
side is slightly lighter but not even
like<00:03:59.160> it<00:04:00.160> looks<00:04:00.370> exactly<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.880> same<00:04:00.970> this<00:04:01.690> is

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.900 
difference so the pros for Revlon nearly
naked<00:04:22.780> is<00:04:23.200> that<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.770> is<00:04:24.160> comparable<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.790> a

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
naked is that it is comparable to a

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.600 
naked is that it is comparable to a
high-end<00:04:25.360> foundation<00:04:26.169> it<00:04:27.100> feels<00:04:27.490> really

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
high-end foundation it feels really

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.520 
high-end foundation it feels really
light<00:04:28.120> on<00:04:28.450> your<00:04:28.570> skin<00:04:28.840> like<00:04:29.050> when<00:04:29.200> you<00:04:29.290> touch

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
it actually when i touch the left side

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.780 
it actually when i touch the left side
of<00:04:32.080> my<00:04:32.169> face<00:04:32.200> versus<00:04:32.919> the<00:04:33.100> right<00:04:33.250> side<00:04:33.460> the

my skin the right side you can tell i
have<00:04:37.419> foundation<00:04:37.870> on<00:04:37.990> like<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.220> actually<00:04:40.180> that

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
have foundation on like so actually that

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.640 
have foundation on like so actually that
is<00:04:40.390> something<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:41.260> beats<00:04:41.680> laura<00:04:42.040> mercier

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
is something that it beats laura mercier

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.280 
is something that it beats laura mercier
or<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:43.070> has<00:04:43.310> about<00:04:43.790> medium<00:04:44.360> coverage<00:04:44.870> it's

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
or it has about medium coverage it's

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.499 
or it has about medium coverage it's
very<00:04:45.680> blendable<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.970> dries<00:04:47.180> really<00:04:47.360> fast

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
very blendable and it dries really fast

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.930 
very blendable and it dries really fast
the<00:04:48.139> cons<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.710> this<00:04:48.740> foundation<00:04:49.400> are<00:04:49.610> that<00:04:49.790> it

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
the cons to this foundation are that it

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.760 
the cons to this foundation are that it
comes<00:04:50.180> in<00:04:50.419> one<00:04:50.600> of<00:04:50.630> these<00:04:50.870> like<00:04:51.169> pour<00:04:51.560> out

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
comes in one of these like pour out

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.830 
comes in one of these like pour out
bottles<00:04:52.340> which<00:04:52.669> are<00:04:53.030> sometimes<00:04:53.389> kind<00:04:53.780> of

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
bottles which are sometimes kind of

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.260 
bottles which are sometimes kind of
messy<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.590> comes<00:04:54.800> in<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:55.009> glass<00:04:55.220> bottle<00:04:55.520> which<00:04:56.000> I

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
messy it comes in a glass bottle which I

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.150 
messy it comes in a glass bottle which I
have<00:04:56.479> broken<00:04:56.780> before<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.380> it<00:04:57.470> spilled<00:04:57.830> all

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
have broken before and it spilled all

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.010 
have broken before and it spilled all
over<00:04:58.220> everything<00:04:58.940> in<00:04:59.240> my<00:04:59.330> purse<00:04:59.539> it<00:04:59.870> only

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
over everything in my purse it only

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.620 
over everything in my purse it only
comes<00:05:00.229> in<00:05:00.530> a<00:05:00.800> certain<00:05:01.070> amount<00:05:01.520> of<00:05:01.759> shades<00:05:02.240> and

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
comes in a certain amount of shades and

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.420 
comes in a certain amount of shades and
if<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:03.020> had<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.350> choice<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.740> would<00:05:03.889> pick<00:05:04.100> a<00:05:04.130> shade

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
if I had the choice I would pick a shade

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.520 
if I had the choice I would pick a shade
darker<00:05:04.669> than<00:05:05.120> this<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:05.780> I<00:05:06.110> think<00:05:06.169> that's<00:05:06.350> all

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
darker than this and I think that's all

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.010 
darker than this and I think that's all
