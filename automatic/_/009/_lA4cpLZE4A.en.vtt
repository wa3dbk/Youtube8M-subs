00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hi, chicas, the video of today is de fazer 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.470
 yourself 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.590
 I'll teach you to customize key 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.639
 and make them fun and colorful 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.639
 so come on 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.200
 The first thing I 'm going to do is support 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.689
 the key in a bitch of hair to 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.790
 able to mount both sides without 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.110
 expect a drying side that could 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.180
 mount the other 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.849
 I'm going to start taking it with a 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.280
 Matte cover to leave texture 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.780
 of the keys smoother and thus leave the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.780
 most beautiful finish 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.150
 now with a touch of anger from the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.440
 I went back and dismantled mine. 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.230
 first key 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.070
 remembering that you can choose the color 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.070
 what you want 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.479
 now with eliana's enamel that is 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.260
 one blue whiting whom I very cute collor 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:57.009
 I'm going and my second key is bad as 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.009
 this enamel it spots a lot I go 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:05.710
 is always three layers of him 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.399
 vibrating to dry but the other is in all 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.670
 keys 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.130
 I spend two former comrades of enamel 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.870
 to get a more beautiful finish 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.610
 now with a black impala glaze I 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.950
 return enameled to my third key 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.890
 never forgetting to pass the enamel 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.320
 on the side of the key is also to give a 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.440
 more perfect finish is also 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.450
 quite important because in this area 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.420
 the enamel will begin to peel 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.860
 the faster the better the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.250
 The finishing you give the longer it will last 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.329
 now I'll wait a few minutes 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:53.079
 death to dry completely with my 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.900
 White ink flex and a thin brush 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.750
 I'll start making the decoration of 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.630
 my key is red key piece I 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.700
 I chose heart fans tied for I 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.700
 I thought it was super romantic 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.480
 on the black key I chose to do only with the 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.480
 I love damn 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.230
 with an enamel power change that is 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.450
 a fluorescent orange 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.970
 I'm making stripes on my key. 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.490
 green and I thought that key was 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.490
 very cute with only those colors of collor 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.989

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.269

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.959
 now with this shelter or else a base 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.539
 colorless 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.740
 I'm going out riding my keys. 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:31.100
 for a glossy finish and the 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.440
 Hard enamel more in the key now is just 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.680
