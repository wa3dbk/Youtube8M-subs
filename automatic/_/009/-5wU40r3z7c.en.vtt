00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 how 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.040
 very good people I am poor and average 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.080
 for call of duty modern warfare 3 and 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.570
 Well, I'm going to introduce you some 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.100
 products that has given us support for 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.810
 this old ailment on one side mark 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.150
 and well, he has given us two products 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.640
 I will present the first 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.990
 that are some glasses for any gamer 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.450
 and well, that I want to explain more or 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.190
 minus the features that are that 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.489
 The main characteristic is that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 reduces eyestrain when playing 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.120
 so the truth that very comfortable 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.030
 for any player 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.050
 since good I think the color 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.560
 yellowish is what makes 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.180
 do not have in sight 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.220
 and then one of the features 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.610
 also more important is that also 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.800
 increases visibility , contrast and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.020
 color so the good body is a product 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.840
 and the truth that quite affordable for 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.760
 any player, I will open it like this 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.580
 so you see a little 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.260
 come here the glasses and the case of call of 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.340
 duty black ops' 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.340
 Well, I'm going to open them 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.049
 the first thing the glasses the sleeve the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.049
 it's also very good 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.950
 ah 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.510
 and good as you can see here are the glasses 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.910
 the other truth gratifies very important 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.830
 that has remained without saying the sideburns 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.900
 they are very flexible to which as you can see 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.150
 it adapts very well 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.129
 how to say it to the head ear of each 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.629
 player and when they put the helmets 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.220
 because the pins when doing that are 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.000
 flexible because the truth that they are super 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.360
 comfortable and the truth that aesthetically 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.330
 pretty pretty the truth 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.150
 as you can see the glasses 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.690
 brand product the truth that 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.650
 super useful for any player 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.650
 and I will be more 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.910
 in the black ops case that is also 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.910
 quite 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.360
 and now I'm going to present you with a product 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.400
 and this the truth that is something else I think 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:22.220
 more useful for the player 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:25.640
 what are 720 plus or more helmets and 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.459
 Well, the truth is that they are the last 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.420
 Triton jacket and the truth that he has very 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.390
 good looking I will not open it 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.200
 I am going to apply more or less the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.989
 characteristics that the respect to the 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.989
 another helmet more or less that already knows 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.020
 buenavista the helmets truth that as 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.270
 you see aesthetically beautiful 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.400
 and as you see the truth that very comfortable to 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.760
 the time to handle them and turn the 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.799
 Earmuffs 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.620
 and as you can see here in the part 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:09.360
 from above carries like a pad 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.700
 to fit him well in the head 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.220
 that are very well aesthetically like 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.410
 I said 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.700
 you already apply it more or less 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.489
 very important feature that 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.200
 appreciated me before putting me the ones that is 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.780
 that you know because the truth you 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.760
 you put and of the few that I have seen that 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.250
 they completely isolate you from all the 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.950
 sound 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.050
 a word 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.900
 completely isolate from the sound true 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.120
 that with the beautiful ones you are well perfect 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.000
 and isolates you completely is a very 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.370
 important in a helmet I believe for 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.330
 any player 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.259
 and well you can 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.360
 that is the main characteristic and a 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.939
 characterizes also 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.900
 that complement the other helmets 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:58.389
 prior to these is that these go 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.550
 plugged in by usb and the others go 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.219
 you plug into the network, which is why 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.490
 comfort I think to the area of 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.490
 connectivity 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.610
 here you can see the driver of 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.610
 volume 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.850
 and I think it's little more in signal 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.930
 the theme of the anp mix or fields like 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.150
 I already said they are or are going by current van 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.789
 for usb so I think there's 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.880
 much more comfort compared to the 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.440
 with the other previous module 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.030
 I think it's the biggest feature 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.690
 who have these helmets and clear 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.340
 obviously they are 7.1 in the quality of the 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.340
 sound pretty better than us 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.569
 then the cable package I guess 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.970
 and from the brand for these pieces of 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.100
 products and represented and the truth that 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.729
 we hope we use it quite well and 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:08.690
 that looks good the thing is heading 2012 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:11.050
 valencia and nothing if we say time is 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.050
 by name 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.460
 Y
