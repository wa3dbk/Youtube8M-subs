00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.080
 Yes is very much Shichimi it is today 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.059
 peach 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.059
 As you see it is here 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.700
 I bought 835 rounds 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.880
 When the 815 Maruka' and I'd not passed still half a year 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.880
 Oh dear 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.960
 As 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.510
 It is inevitable that you want something new when it comes out 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.150
 Hmm 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.770
 Contents 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.770
 It is a manual 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 In the usual way 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.530
 It entered the Pashikko 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.770
 is not it 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.950
 cpu 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.510
 It is the main body 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.079
 high school 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.079
 It is this way 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.760
 fx's 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.230
 It comes with a sticker 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.239
 What do than things and for before and a little 815 rare softening 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.530
 Like a little good-looking design 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.370
 Agano 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.130
 It looks like the red part is a bit darker 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.000
 I feel like it has changed 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.000
 I just feel like 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.460
 It is a cooler of 1 tail 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.990
 He I do not Kedomo leave at a house 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.990
 Yeah 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.790
 Occurrence 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.350
 Is it a fan? 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.350
 8 cm fan's 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.430
 How is the lager contact surface grease is also painted 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.620
 I'm a heat pipe 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.930
 Japan 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.110
 That's why 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.119
 It is a type of 8 cm funday 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.560
 It is considerable to say that this cpu is cold 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.439
 I have to turn it 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.439
 I think it will not disappear , it will be quite noisy 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.380
 It is people 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.580
 Put 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.440
 Next time 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.660
 Now I am moving with 815 Maruo 4.7 feeling though 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.500
 Next time 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.200
 Here 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.100
 I want to aim for 5 gigs 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.280
 Maybe I think it's impossible 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.750
 Withhold a little 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:41.200
 There is 4.4 point ball technique 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.200
 If it can be run low, it will move to much 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.960
 I'm happy 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.629
 It is more than you would like to report When you have mounted successful overclocking person
