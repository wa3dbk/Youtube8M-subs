there's Tony nice little slot away in

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.300 
there's Tony nice little slot away in
the<00:05:25.330> 90th<00:05:25.750> minute<00:05:25.900> of<00:05:26.259> course<00:05:26.680> got<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:27.069> do<00:05:27.190> it

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
the 90th minute of course got to do it

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.279 
the 90th minute of course got to do it
for<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:27.669> think<00:05:28.000> that<00:05:28.150> was<00:05:28.240> like<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.479> 95th

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
for that I think that was like the 95th

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.499 
for that I think that was like the 95th
or<00:05:29.470> six<00:05:29.680> minute<00:05:30.009> but<00:05:30.669> here's<00:05:30.849> to<00:05:30.909> rot<00:05:31.210> once

or six minute but here's to rot once

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.060 
or six minute but here's to rot once

but some guys this is a great team to

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.230 
but some guys this is a great team to
put<00:06:17.050> people<00:06:17.469> on<00:06:17.620> just<00:06:18.490> so<00:06:18.580> that<00:06:18.699> they<00:06:18.849> can<00:06:19.030> rest

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
put people on just so that they can rest

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.060 
put people on just so that they can rest
but<00:06:19.389> this<00:06:19.539> team<00:06:19.719> plays<00:06:19.900> brilliant<00:06:20.500> I<00:06:20.590> wanna

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
but this team plays brilliant I wanna

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.680 
but this team plays brilliant I wanna
pretty<00:06:21.460> much<00:06:21.669> eighty-five<00:06:22.210> percent<00:06:22.389> of<00:06:22.630> the

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
pretty much eighty-five percent of the

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.149 
pretty much eighty-five percent of the
games<00:06:22.900> I<00:06:23.080> played<00:06:23.289> with<00:06:23.409> him<00:06:23.530> I<00:06:23.620> think<00:06:23.650> I<00:06:23.919> lost

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
games I played with him I think I lost

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.480 
games I played with him I think I lost
maybe<00:06:24.490> two<00:06:24.969> out<00:06:25.840> of<00:06:25.900> maybe<00:06:26.830> the<00:06:26.979> eight<00:06:27.219> games

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
maybe two out of maybe the eight games

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.610 
maybe two out of maybe the eight games
so<00:06:27.669> that's<00:06:27.820> about<00:06:27.940> 75%<00:06:28.659> of<00:06:29.020> the<00:06:29.139> games<00:06:29.380> that<00:06:29.500> I

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
so that's about 75% of the games that I

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.680 
so that's about 75% of the games that I
played<00:06:30.550> with<00:06:30.669> this<00:06:30.820> team<00:06:31.000> I<00:06:31.120> actually<00:06:31.300> won<00:06:31.570> in

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
played with this team I actually won in

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.769 
played with this team I actually won in
