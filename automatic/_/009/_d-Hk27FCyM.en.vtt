00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
one of the big challenges when designing

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.029 
one of the big challenges when designing
an<00:00:15.400> open-world<00:00:15.820> sandbox<00:00:16.289> game<00:00:17.289> like<00:00:17.650> Albion

an open-world sandbox game like Albion
online<00:00:18.189> is<00:00:18.999> that<00:00:19.449> a<00:00:19.990> common<00:00:20.470> strategy<00:00:20.949> for

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
online is that a common strategy for

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.130 
online is that a common strategy for
players<00:00:21.460> is<00:00:21.820> to<00:00:22.029> group<00:00:22.240> up<00:00:22.509> in<00:00:22.689> very<00:00:22.960> large

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140

players is to group up in very large
groups<00:00:23.320> called<00:00:23.859> zerks<00:00:24.189> so<00:00:24.640> we<00:00:25.150> came<00:00:25.359> up<00:00:25.419> with

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
groups called zerks so we came up with

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.140 
groups called zerks so we came up with
the<00:00:25.900> idea<00:00:26.169> of<00:00:26.230> hell<00:00:26.470> gates<00:00:26.710> hell<00:00:27.669> gates<00:00:27.880> are
