point<00:00:10.889> zero<00:00:11.190> i<00:00:11.280> think<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.670> was<00:00:11.759> mainly<00:00:12.000> for

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
point zero i think it was mainly for

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.060 
point zero i think it was mainly for
multiplayer<00:00:12.780> stuff<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.349> still<00:00:13.679> wanted<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
multiplayer stuff but I still wanted to

changed<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:19.560> are<00:00:19.619> my<00:00:19.650> settings<00:00:20.539> 1080p<00:00:21.539> I

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
changed and here are my settings 1080p I

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:30.710 
changed and here are my settings 1080p I
just<00:00:24.119> did<00:00:24.300> an<00:00:24.330> SLI<00:00:24.810> test<00:00:25.109> 29<00:00:26.099> 80s<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:29.510> we<00:00:30.510> drop

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
just did an SLI test 29 80s and we drop

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.740 
just did an SLI test 29 80s and we drop
below<00:00:31.099> 60<00:00:32.099> frames<00:00:32.309> per<00:00:32.369> second<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:33.270> these<00:00:33.540> same

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
below 60 frames per second at these same

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.310 
below 60 frames per second at these same
settings<00:00:36.290> which<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.469> beyond<00:00:38.010> me<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.870> let's<00:00:39.870> do

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
settings which is beyond me but let's do

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.160 
settings which is beyond me but let's do
a<00:00:40.680> race<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.090> haven't<00:00:42.750> done<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.020> these

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
a race I haven't done one of these

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.800 
a race I haven't done one of these
before<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.710> youtube<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:46.940> would<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.489> here

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.360 

ok<00:00:53.810> that<00:00:53.990> was<00:00:54.050> just<00:00:54.110> a<00:00:54.380> meeting<00:00:54.830> now<00:00:55.010> we're<00:00:55.220> off

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
ok that was just a meeting now we're off

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.050 
ok that was just a meeting now we're off
to<00:00:56.200> do<00:00:57.200> a<00:00:57.230> race<00:00:57.560> just<00:00:58.490> have<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:58.730> get<00:00:58.880> there

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
to do a race just have to get there

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.529 
to do a race just have to get there
first

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.050 

as<00:01:03.539> performance<00:01:04.080> improved<00:01:04.440> as<00:01:04.760> my<00:01:05.760> driving

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
as performance improved as my driving

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:15.380 
as performance improved as my driving
improved<00:01:06.570> oh<00:01:06.810> shit<00:01:07.640> that<00:01:08.640> bit<00:01:08.850> always<00:01:09.030> gets<00:01:09.330> me

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.820 

so<00:01:16.020> an<00:01:16.500> SLI<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.670> drop<00:01:18.060> below<00:01:18.409> 50<00:01:19.550> at<00:01:20.550> one<00:01:20.760> point

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
so an SLI we drop below 50 at one point

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.520 
so an SLI we drop below 50 at one point
so<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> single<00:01:23.159> GPU<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.790> holding<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.530> better

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
so a single GPU is holding up better

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.600 
so a single GPU is holding up better
than<00:01:25.740> SLI<00:01:26.310> did<00:01:26.550> not<00:01:27.150> all<00:01:27.300> games<00:01:27.510> are<00:01:27.690> optimized

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
than SLI did not all games are optimized

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.340 
than SLI did not all games are optimized
well<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.540> sli

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.110 

damn<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:37.210> doing<00:01:37.509> pretty<00:01:37.540> good

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.000 

I<00:01:40.210> did<00:01:40.870> to<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.020> maxed<00:01:41.470> out<00:01:41.680> test<00:01:42.070> two<00:01:43.860> we're<00:01:44.860> at

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
I did to a maxed out test two we're at

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.470 
I did to a maxed out test two we're at
40<00:01:45.340> frames<00:01:45.490> per<00:01:45.700> second<00:01:46.120> at<00:01:46.750> SLI<00:01:47.350> one<00:01:47.680> point

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
40 frames per second at SLI one point

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
40 frames per second at SLI one point
move<00:01:49.480> out<00:01:49.690> of<00:01:49.720> my<00:01:49.900> way<00:01:51.300> I'm<00:01:52.300> sorry<00:01:52.600> didn't<00:01:53.320> see
