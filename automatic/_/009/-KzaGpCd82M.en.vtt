just need to import item food if it'll
let<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:34.020> import<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.369> you'll<00:01:35.579> see<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:35.909> going

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
let me import and you'll see it's going

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.109 
let me import and you'll see it's going
to<00:01:36.180> give<00:01:36.390> us<00:01:36.420> an<00:01:36.659> error<00:01:37.070> now<00:01:38.070> i'm<00:01:38.790> actually

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to give us an error now i'm actually

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.630 
to give us an error now i'm actually
going<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> create<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.229> constructor<00:01:40.979> myself

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
going to create this constructor myself

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.770 
going to create this constructor myself
because<00:01:41.939> there's<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.210> couple<00:01:42.360> things<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.750> want

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
to explain with it so this is going to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.469 
to explain with it so this is going to
be<00:01:44.990> public<00:01:47.600> item<00:01:48.600> tutorial<00:01:49.500> food<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.520> then<00:01:51.329> we

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
be public item tutorial food and then we

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.789 
be public item tutorial food and then we
have<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> few<00:01:51.869> parameters<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:54.140> int

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:06.289 

int<00:01:59.509> ID<00:02:01.070> int<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.750> now<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.060> this

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
int ID int and now we have so this

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.130 
int ID int and now we have so this
parameter<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.930> going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:08.840> I'm<00:02:09.840> not

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
parameter is going to be the I'm not

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.589 
parameter is going to be the I'm not
quite<00:02:10.349> sure<00:02:10.379> how<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.649> describe<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:12.450> is

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
quite sure how to describe this this is

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.229 
quite sure how to describe this this is
going<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.900> be<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.170> amount<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.709> food<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.640> heals

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
going to be the amount of food it heals

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.330 
going to be the amount of food it heals
so<00:02:15.599> I'm<00:02:15.720> going<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.989> say<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.569> food

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
so I'm going to say this is the food

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.220 
so I'm going to say this is the food
amount<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.709> then<00:02:22.709> we<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:23.040> float<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.230> this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
amount and then we have float and this

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.680 
amount and then we have float and this
is<00:02:25.379> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:25.770> saturation<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.120> I'm<00:02:27.420> going

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
is going to be saturation so I'm going

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.140 
is going to be saturation so I'm going
to<00:02:27.750> say<00:02:29.180> sat<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.530> then<00:02:31.530> finally<00:02:32.150> boolean<00:02:33.680> is

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
to say sat and then finally boolean is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.880 
to say sat and then finally boolean is
wolf<00:02:36.620> me<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.840> then<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.290> finish<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
wolf me and then we can finish up the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.369 
wolf me and then we can finish up the
constructor<00:02:41.569> now<00:02:42.569> you'll<00:02:42.810> see<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.110> going<00:02:43.230> to

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
constructor now you'll see it's going to

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:51.530 
constructor now you'll see it's going to
give<00:02:43.620> us<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:48.599> what<00:02:49.140> did<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.379> mess<00:02:49.560> up<00:02:50.540> okay

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
give us to do what did I mess up okay

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.150 
give us to do what did I mess up okay
let<00:02:51.989> me<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.220> restart<00:02:53.220> all<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:55.129> okay<00:02:56.129> I

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
let me just restart all of that okay I

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.770 
let me just restart all of that okay I
don't<00:02:56.370> quite<00:02:56.730> see<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.090> messed<00:02:57.360> up<00:02:57.510> there

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
don't quite see what I messed up there

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.850 
don't quite see what I messed up there
but<00:02:58.379> I<00:02:58.620> messed<00:02:58.950> something<00:02:59.370> up<00:02:59.700> oh<00:03:00.659> I<00:03:01.349> forgot<00:03:01.620> to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
but I messed something up oh I forgot to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.140 
but I messed something up oh I forgot to
add<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:01.980> super<00:03:02.340> line<00:03:02.519> yeah<00:03:03.420> um<00:03:04.700> yeah<00:03:05.700> be<00:03:05.940> sure

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.000 
add the super line yeah um yeah be sure
that<00:03:06.599> when<00:03:06.840> you're<00:03:06.959> creating<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.440> constructor

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
that when you're creating a constructor

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.430 
that when you're creating a constructor
you<00:03:08.159> add<00:03:08.310> super<00:03:08.700> part<00:03:09.480> 1<00:03:09.629> part<00:03:09.900> 2<00:03:09.930> part<00:03:10.019> 3<00:03:10.290> part

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
you add super part 1 part 2 part 3 part

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.050 
you add super part 1 part 2 part 3 part
4<00:03:10.620> um<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:12.290> that's<00:03:13.290> all<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:14.280> actually<00:03:14.700> need<00:03:14.909> to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
do we just need to add the normal public

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:27.670 
do we just need to add the normal public
string<00:03:19.819> get<00:03:20.819> texture<00:03:21.480> file<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:24.530> then<00:03:25.549> return

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.220 
tutorial food stuff um to save time but
I'm<00:03:53.610> just<00:03:53.819> going<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.090> say<00:03:56.360> tutorial<00:03:57.360> food

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
I'm just going to say tutorial food

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.039 
I'm just going to say tutorial food
equals<00:03:59.129> new<00:03:59.939> item<00:04:01.010> tutorial<00:04:02.010> food<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.049> then

tutorial<00:04:04.830> food<00:04:05.760> ID<00:04:06.390> I've<00:04:07.319> stated<00:04:07.950> previously

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
tutorial food ID I've stated previously

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.729 
tutorial food ID I've stated previously
I've<00:04:08.849> declared<00:04:09.180> all<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.659> already<00:04:09.840> but

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
I've declared all of this already but

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.750 
I've declared all of this already but
it's<00:04:10.920> just<00:04:11.220> like<00:04:12.620> this<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.920> right<00:04:14.220> up<00:04:14.459> here

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
it's just like this it's right up here

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.449 
it's just like this it's right up here
actually<00:04:15.199> tutorial<00:04:16.199> food<00:04:16.350> ID<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.799> then<00:04:17.280> we're

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
actually tutorial food ID and then we're

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.620 
actually tutorial food ID and then we're
going<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.699> say<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.299> food<00:04:18.870> level<00:04:19.880> that<00:04:20.880> we

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
going to say the food level that we

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.570 
going to say the food level that we
declared<00:04:22.530> in<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.830> constructor

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
declared in the constructor

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.119 
declared in the constructor
so<00:04:24.000> if<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.449> were<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.659> say<00:04:24.750> one<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.470> would<00:04:25.889> heal

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:26.129 
so if I were to say one it would heal

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.879 
so if I were to say one it would heal
half<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> heart<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.990> players<00:04:28.319> hunger<00:04:28.710> bar

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
half a heart of the players hunger bar

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.300 
half a heart of the players hunger bar
when<00:04:29.370> eaten<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:31.800> i'm<00:04:32.430> going<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.210> say<00:04:33.949> for<00:04:34.949> so

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
when eaten so i'm going to say for so

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.559 
when eaten so i'm going to say for so
it'll<00:04:35.580> heal<00:04:35.759> too<00:04:36.080> little<00:04:37.080> chicken<00:04:38.009> sticks<00:04:38.569> now

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
it'll heal too little chicken sticks now

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.800 
it'll heal too little chicken sticks now
we<00:04:39.629> have<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.259> saturation<00:04:40.969> level<00:04:41.969> and<00:04:42.150> i'm

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
we have the saturation level and i'm

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.969 
we have the saturation level and i'm
going<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.349> set<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:44.659> 2<00:04:45.659> point<00:04:46.020> 0<00:04:46.199> f<00:04:46.560> and

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
going to set this to 2 point 0 f and

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.670 
going to set this to 2 point 0 f and
that's<00:04:47.789> a<00:04:48.000> float<00:04:48.270> value<00:04:48.449> hopefully<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:49.500> know

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
that's a float value hopefully you know

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.360 
that's a float value hopefully you know
what<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.009> if<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.669> know<00:04:50.789> java<00:04:51.289> it's<00:04:52.370> going

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
what that is if you know java it's going

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.839 
what that is if you know java it's going
to<00:04:53.400> be<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.610> float<00:04:53.969> value<00:04:54.090> i<00:04:54.240> could<00:04:54.539> say<00:04:54.689> 2.5<00:04:55.319> f<00:04:55.849> 2

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
to be a float value i could say 2.5 f 2

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.189 
to be a float value i could say 2.5 f 2
point<00:04:57.090> 0<00:04:57.180> f<00:04:57.360> is<00:04:57.680> going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.830> be<00:04:59.039> about<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.960> set

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
point 0 f is going to be about the set

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.089 
point 0 f is going to be about the set
it's<00:05:02.129> not<00:05:02.460> much<00:05:03.229> i'm<00:05:04.229> not<00:05:04.500> quite<00:05:04.710> sure<00:05:04.740> what

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
it's not much i'm not quite sure what

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.159 
it's not much i'm not quite sure what
all<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.669> numbers<00:05:05.849> compared<00:05:06.389> to<00:05:06.569> you<00:05:06.960> can

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
all of the numbers compared to you can

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.869 
all of the numbers compared to you can
play<00:05:07.289> around<00:05:07.409> with<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.770> when<00:05:08.759> you're

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:08.879 
play around with that when you're

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:11.899 
play around with that when you're

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
actually creating your mod now we just

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.119 
actually creating your mod now we just
say<00:05:12.090> true<00:05:12.539> or<00:05:12.569> false<00:05:12.870> so<00:05:13.319> I'm<00:05:13.530> going<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:13.830> say

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
if you were to say true then it's going

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.149 
if you were to say true then it's going
to<00:05:21.419> make<00:05:21.629> it<00:05:21.810> so<00:05:21.960> that<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.229> can<00:05:22.439> feed<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.800> to
