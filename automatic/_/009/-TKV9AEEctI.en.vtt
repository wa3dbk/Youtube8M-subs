 this is for those who come economically 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.630
 I spoke with several residents and the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.790
 question is that if there is crime, what do I know? 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.250
 and they tell me not to notice here this 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.550
