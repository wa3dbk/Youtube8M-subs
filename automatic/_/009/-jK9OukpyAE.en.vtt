00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
that you guys have seen me do a couple

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.830 
that you guys have seen me do a couple
tests<00:00:08.309> already<00:00:08.519> with<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.450> did<00:00:09.599> remove

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
tests already with this we did remove

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.089 
tests already with this we did remove
the<00:00:10.019> coating<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.590> one<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.860> remove<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
the coating on this one we remove the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.209 
the coating on this one we remove the
coating<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.580> 16<00:00:12.000> but<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.719> have<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.990> say

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
coating on the 16 but I have to say

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.379 
coating on the 16 but I have to say
surprisingly<00:00:14.219> enough<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.820> thought<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.330> this

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
surprisingly enough I thought that this

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.970 
surprisingly enough I thought that this
one<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:15.960> least<00:00:16.260> favorite<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
one was with my least favorite of the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.859 
one was with my least favorite of the
trio<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:18.180> some<00:00:18.330> reason<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.779> my

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
trio and for some reason it's my

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.660 
trio and for some reason it's my
favorite<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.439> think<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> little<00:00:20.460> it

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
favorite I think because a little it

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.099 
favorite I think because a little it
feels<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> little<00:00:20.970> bit<00:00:21.180> lighter<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.869> blade

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
feels a little bit lighter the blade

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.660 
feels a little bit lighter the blade
profile<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.680> little<00:00:22.920> bit<00:00:23.039> different<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.519> do

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
profile is a little bit different we do

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.609 
profile is a little bit different we do
have<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.970> nice<00:00:24.180> sweeping<00:00:24.900> tip<00:00:25.170> here<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
have this nice sweeping tip here and

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.160 
have this nice sweeping tip here and
this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.550> fast<00:00:26.880> light<00:00:27.240> blade<00:00:27.539> now<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
this is just a fast light blade now the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.900 
this is just a fast light blade now the
blade<00:00:28.560> geometry<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> little<00:00:29.789> bit

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
blade geometry on this is a little bit

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.759 
blade geometry on this is a little bit
better<00:00:30.060> even<00:00:30.840> though<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.320> five<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
better even though we do have a five and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.959 
better even though we do have a five and
a<00:00:31.830> half<00:00:31.890> inch<00:00:32.219> blade<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:32.759> bit<00:00:32.850> larger

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
a half inch blade a little bit larger

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.810 
a half inch blade a little bit larger
than<00:00:33.180> its<00:00:33.390> brethren<00:00:34.250> overall<00:00:35.250> length<00:00:35.460> i<00:00:35.610> think

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
than its brethren overall length i think

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.520 
than its brethren overall length i think
is<00:00:35.910> still<00:00:36.120> under<00:00:36.450> ten<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> half<00:00:37.230> inches

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
is still under ten and a half inches

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
is still under ten and a half inches
it's<00:00:37.829> about<00:00:37.950> 10.3<00:00:38.700> 75<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> blade

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it's about 10.3 75 but the blade

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.200 
it's about 10.3 75 but the blade
geometry<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:41.040> amazing<00:00:41.700> with<00:00:41.790> its<00:00:41.940> use<00:00:42.059> some

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
geometry is amazing with its use some

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.479 
geometry is amazing with its use some
nice<00:00:42.420> slices<00:00:42.719> real<00:00:43.559> thin<00:00:43.770> cuts<00:00:44.040> right<00:00:44.340> now

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
