00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.679
 Hello and welcome again about new ones 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.900
 it's long since blog today it's about 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:14.589
 the layout in the garden as i will in 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.999
 I planned this year so I had 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.320
 first thought about four last year 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.660
 to make pieces out of this whole 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.340
 long hose of garden 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.710
 I'll leave it that way 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.210
 It did not work out somehow 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.339
 I will turn the whole garden into three 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.880
 big pieces divided plus a small one 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:34.780
 for permanent crops so three large pieces 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.920
 each about 22 23 meters 8 one 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.329
 a vegetable and a cereal 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.989
 potatoes and something else because so 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.420
 we do not need many potatoes 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.410
 sojabohnen maintenance always so these three 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.910
 pieces that change 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.820
 that 's the first planning for this 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.500
 year and how do I get this vegetable piece that 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.480
 must be subdivided again 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.519
 yes, how are the pieces of vegetables now 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.820
 want to share that's what it's all about today 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.699
 and I do not like him about this 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.259
 land just run over it that is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.860
 I do not know because of the 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.140
 precursors these plates where the horses 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.460
 here it went to I have in 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.630
 always used the last years 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.110
 I will also this year 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.079
 use 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.579
 I will take our step distance 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:22.930
 put gap always so 120 130 have 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.009
 I have nice beds I need 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.549
 actually only on these plates 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:30.250
 running around detriment as we change weeds 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.040
 it is not clear by that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.110
 prevent but it is still better 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.100
 so it's always wild to run 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.990
 I do not like that 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.119
 and for that I need each first now 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.119
 they give us a lot now 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.690
 here they are stored at the 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.040
 chickens in there are in good hands 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.040
 nobody bothers you 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.040
 I dug them all out here 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:24.709
 at the chicken all the whole 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:28.959
 Opel bayer goes full time with something sweet 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.959
 100 120 pieces will need 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:51.310
 every row twelve pieces maybe 10 11 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.310
 I have to see me get along 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.250
 I like everything a bit too formal 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.860
 but a bit of order heard 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.570
 just in there 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.459
 I can not get away from here until here 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.810
 grain comes from here vegetables one 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.400
 I was curious yesterday 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.209
 tinkered and there are now loud 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.209
 these treads purely 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.440
 I just have to protect myself like you 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.600
 everything in between with a lot 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.920
 grow too big and plant to flag 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.860
 are there one no longer comes namely 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.600
 I've got through last year 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.010
 or the past years always like that 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.430
 I made here between the 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.920
 plates was planted in between and that 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.220
 then became so great 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.600
 there was no getting through yes I am even 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.790
 fair so hectic has everything still 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.720
 from 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.350
 i have nothing else to do so always 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.350
 from plate to plate 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.370
 125 so as 25 1 30 then I have one 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.370
 good picture width 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.340
 who will regularly he looks 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.510
 determine 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.370
 I will have this piece here 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:44.500
 It was picked briefly with the cutter 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:44.500
 edited that was yet so he looks 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:53.450
 so that's it look now says whole 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:00.410
 still an overview and then told 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:05.960
 this was meaningful thing that lies 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:13.930
 whole game would be finished that gives me 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:17.660
 12 38 meters 20 wide to plant 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.160
 So then it's okay if there 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.460
 not enough vegetables why come 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.250
 should be advised is pretty much 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.870
 I admit to spending while also here in 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.310
 nuremberg in the garden, yes, just about vegetables 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.260
 then I would have nice little beets 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.900
 stabbed in the lawn 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.910
 who can not have been a problem at all 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.850
 but you are only a little bit 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.030
 Growing more than vegetables is a bit 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.440
 more than in the garden and that is the 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.479
 method had the chance but have 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.130
 yet another big advantage there 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.460
 There is nothing bad for weeks 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.380
 is wet and you can not do anything 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.110
 no matter where you go runs the third wet 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.210
 Stuck tight 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.800
 The shoes are lumps of dirt 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.050
 the school that's the very last one 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.450
 Here I can move in the garden 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.770
 without even once on the 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.510
 earth to have to step are only the 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:11.810
 put where the plates are so far 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.610
 Now first to the planning I think 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.479
 so that I could live another one 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.729
 have another opinion 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.070
 I think that's okay I can 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.130
 You gentlemen love these rows 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.720
 plant and finish you're there 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.070
 Can you make a lot of who's more 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.010
 wants to know the other day is in the garden de 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.530
 live blog youtube-channel haase a lot 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.680
 feed ducks chickens meadows themselves 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.750
 everything so together 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.280
 an interesting thing just times 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.080
 there are still movies from me 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.090
