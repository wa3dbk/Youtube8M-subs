00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.980 
into the overnight hours this complex of
thunderstorms<00:05:45.190> will<00:05:45.760> be<00:05:45.810> developing<00:05:46.810> out

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
thunderstorms will be developing out

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.200 
thunderstorms will be developing out
toward<00:05:47.229> northeast<00:05:47.530> Kansas<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.070> then<00:05:48.639> racing

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
toward northeast Kansas and then racing

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.560 
toward northeast Kansas and then racing
down<00:05:49.419> toward<00:05:49.870> the<00:05:49.960> southeast<00:05:50.440> across

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
down toward the southeast across

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.940 
down toward the southeast across
southeast<00:05:52.570> Kansas<00:05:52.930> into<00:05:53.169> western<00:05:53.560> Missouri<00:05:53.830> I

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
southeast Kansas into western Missouri I

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.680 
southeast Kansas into western Missouri I
think<00:05:54.250> this<00:05:54.370> model<00:05:54.700> maybe<00:05:54.850> just<00:05:55.150> a<00:05:55.210> little<00:05:55.510> bit

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
think this model maybe just a little bit

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.440 
think this model maybe just a little bit
too<00:05:55.960> far<00:05:56.229> east<00:05:56.590> with<00:05:57.400> this<00:05:57.610> convection<00:05:58.090> I

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
too far east with this convection I

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.300 
too far east with this convection I
think<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.020> convection<00:05:59.320> will<00:05:59.710> be<00:05:59.800> shifted

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
think the convection will be shifted

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.800 
think the convection will be shifted
just<00:06:00.580> a<00:06:00.669> little<00:06:00.880> bit<00:06:00.970> further<00:06:01.120> to<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.479> west

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
just a little bit further to the west

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.320 
just a little bit further to the west
across<00:06:02.560> southeast<00:06:03.160> Kansas<00:06:03.669> right<00:06:04.120> there

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
across southeast Kansas right there

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.110 
across southeast Kansas right there
along<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.630> Missouri<00:06:05.139> Kansas<00:06:05.530> border<00:06:06.280> this<00:06:06.970> is

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
along the Missouri Kansas border this is

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.170 
along the Missouri Kansas border this is
again<00:06:07.330> midnight<00:06:07.870> tonight<00:06:08.490> 3am<00:06:09.490> you<00:06:09.700> get<00:06:10.090> the

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
again midnight tonight 3am you get the

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.270 
again midnight tonight 3am you get the
same<00:06:10.389> idea<00:06:10.780> again<00:06:11.050> just<00:06:11.260> shift<00:06:11.500> this<00:06:11.650> complex

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
same idea again just shift this complex

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.430 
same idea again just shift this complex
just<00:06:12.490> a<00:06:12.610> little<00:06:12.940> bit<00:06:13.030> toward<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.360> west<00:06:13.600> across

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
just a little bit toward the west across

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.500 
just a little bit toward the west across
the<00:06:14.580> missouri-kansas<00:06:15.580> border<00:06:16.060> across

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
the missouri-kansas border across

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.659 
the missouri-kansas border across
southwest<00:06:17.229> Missouri<00:06:17.560> in<00:06:17.710> southeast<00:06:18.070> Kansas<00:06:18.220> a

southwest Missouri in southeast Kansas a

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.960 
southwest Missouri in southeast Kansas a
3am<00:06:19.300> time<00:06:19.690> frame<00:06:20.140> and<00:06:20.349> then<00:06:20.830> 6am<00:06:21.580> looks<00:06:21.820> like

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
3am time frame and then 6am looks like

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.330 
3am time frame and then 6am looks like
most<00:06:22.240> of<00:06:22.390> it<00:06:22.479> will<00:06:22.599> be<00:06:22.780> out<00:06:23.200> of<00:06:23.260> our<00:06:23.560> area

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
most of it will be out of our area

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.210 
most of it will be out of our area
off<00:06:24.610> into<00:06:25.000> Arkansas<00:06:25.600> and<00:06:26.139> points<00:06:26.620> south<00:06:26.680> and

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
off into Arkansas and points south and

off into Arkansas and points south and
east<00:06:27.370> of<00:06:27.580> there<00:06:27.760> so<00:06:28.000> again<00:06:28.300> isolate

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
east of there so again isolate
