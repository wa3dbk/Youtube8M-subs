00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.400
 of course, the darkness that 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.800
 we call emergency power 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.670
 in use so you were all 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:28.259
 can also watch 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:30.660
 400 8406 the big love probably 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:35.450
 better use future because 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.450
 the power of firefighters 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:47.210
 we have then at high tide and 3 o'clock 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.030
 operational forces must withdraw 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.670
 because the waves are so 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.260
 Sandbags had washed over and there 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.030
 just check then wait though 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.559
 The water fell short so we 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.320
 could give a warning and then the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.040
 have operational forces also withdrawn so 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.180
 you are at rest 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.100
 but overall , you can see this 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.450
 discussion here is a dike or 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.860
 no such 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.380
 I think this storm has played 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.810
 I answer that on a back 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.619
 was really quick to find a solution 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 where are I for the folk chamber 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.320
 the forces of nature in total at this 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.450
 organ sarah like me on island 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.190
 come open because then I still knew 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.009
 not that he has the direction of the airport 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.950
 was clearly only received 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.649
 We have 27 hours continuously 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.670
 not yet had the height of the 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.009
 water levels 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.180
 we can say 62 76 2013 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.910
 that can 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.070
 say we are not through yet 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.360
 now at noon on 2 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:05.650
 but I think if we lower something 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:08.289
 out so then 15 clock 27 points out 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.570
 but we still have strong ones 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.190
 better sound so he too 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.900
 go out that it always announced 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.459
 250 will remain what else 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.440
 of course, worry now too 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.510
 to beat that wind is just 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.540
 storm damage in the city roofs 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.750
 Covered trees also turned everything over 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.680
 things that solve our forces 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.600
 but that with a bravura and only 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.280
 the night in the harbor has it all 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.830
 All gates work on time 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.810
 so decided the gates of 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.430
 anderson press worked and 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.080
 I have just the school year is still 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.150
 talked to school where was still 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:53.170
 bombig satisfied no damage on 3 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:56.090
 Everything is safe for the population 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.380
 thank you very much for the conversation with me 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.420
 wish that it continues so well 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.420
 is proceeding so far been spared
