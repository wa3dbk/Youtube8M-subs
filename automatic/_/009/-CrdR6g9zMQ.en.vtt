00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.289
 hello friends welcome to another tutorial 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.890
 tutorial today a little resource like 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.710
 abandon a sport climbing path 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.500
 leaving the least amount of material in 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.960
 the necessary material way for this 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.730
 maneuver a greater certificate than 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 endure more than 22 kilos newton 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.230
 once reached the point of the path that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.600
 for having excessive difficulty or 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.949
 tiredness of the climber decides 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 abandon we will act as follows 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.970
 and we 'll make sure we hang the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 veneers if we do not have a rope 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.190
 anchoring we will be able to splice express ribbons 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 but never from carabiner to carabiner 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.540
 once hung from this one and with the rope 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.170
 relaxed we will use a May 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.880
 22 minute certificate urgency or 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.430
 forest where safe 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.320
 we will always place it below the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.899
 Express tape that serves as anchor cao 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.759
 since if we do it above when 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.070
 we are hanging again from the rope 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.079
 we will not be able to remove the express tape 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.390
 because the greatest pressure will make the 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.000
 carabiner of the tape during all the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.549
 maneuver the insurer must be attentive 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.399
 before a possible fall due to failure in the 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.110
 execution once hung from the mayon or 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.509
 carabiner our partner 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.310
 can lower us and we will recover the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.619
 material that we have put for 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.689
 secure us during the road if the anchor 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.759
 is not totally trustworthy and yet we have 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.039
 I decide to pick up from him we can 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.959
 act using the maneuver 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.599
 unsafe precarious descent 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.159
 that we have already seen in another tutorial if 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.659
 we have anchor rope we 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.360
 clarify the upper carabiner of the 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.330
 last express tape we hung on this one 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.480
 and we performed the same previous operation 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.180
 do not forget that in all maneuvers 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.720
 where two people interact is 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.979
 communication is very important 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.560
 communicating does not mean talking the same 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.020
 language for understanding we should 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.220
 have the same code 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.180
 and remember, help us make the mountains 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.180
 more secure
