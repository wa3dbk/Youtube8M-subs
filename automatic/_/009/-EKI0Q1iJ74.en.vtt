just going to run through a few basic
things<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.239> do<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
things that you can do with it on the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.260 
things that you can do with it on the
ring<00:00:37.890> modulator<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> Freak<00:00:38.730> box<00:00:38.940> pedal

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
ring modulator and the Freak box pedal

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.350 
ring modulator and the Freak box pedal
then<00:00:39.809> we'll<00:00:39.989> show<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.739> boss<00:00:40.920> pedals

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
then we'll show the boss pedals

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.840 
then we'll show the boss pedals
so<00:00:42.360> right<00:00:42.629> now<00:00:42.950> I've<00:00:43.950> got<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.550> ring

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so right now I've got on the ring

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
so right now I've got on the ring
modulator<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.050> plugged<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
modulator I have it plugged into the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:01:21.010 
modulator I have it plugged into the
frequency<00:00:47.579> input<00:01:04.070> delay<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.220> that

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.810 

we<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.320> plugged<00:01:22.590> into<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.010> mix<00:01:23.310> input

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
we have this plugged into the mix input

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
we have this plugged into the mix input
by<00:01:24.480> the<00:01:24.540> way<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
by the way that you want to do is you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.940 
by the way that you want to do is you
want<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.010> set<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.750> knob<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> pedal<00:01:28.740> all

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
want to set the knob on the pedal all

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
want to set the knob on the pedal all
the<00:01:29.100> way<00:01:29.190> down<00:01:29.480> that<00:01:30.480> way<00:01:30.660> to<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.050> full

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the way down that way to get the full

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.870 
the way down that way to get the full
range<00:01:31.410> of<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.830> sweep<00:01:35.130> from<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> pedal

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
range of the of the sweep from the pedal

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
range of the of the sweep from the pedal
so<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.660> turn<00:01:36.870> this<00:01:36.990> knob<00:01:37.260> on<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.530> mix<00:01:37.830> knob

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
so if I turn this knob on the mix knob

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:50.929 
so if I turn this knob on the mix knob
on<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.250> rim<00:01:38.490> modulator<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.120> the<00:01:39.180> way<00:01:39.270> down

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:02:07.100 

once<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.780> start<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> move<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.530> up

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.249 

you<00:02:07.860> can<00:02:08.009> actually<00:02:08.130> set<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.880> maximum<00:02:09.869> range

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
you can actually set the maximum range

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.400 
you can actually set the maximum range
of<00:02:10.910> what<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> pedal<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.720> stop<00:02:13.170> at

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
of what the pedal is going to stop at

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.230 
of what the pedal is going to stop at
with<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.010> little<00:02:14.250> noun<00:02:14.400> at<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.670> bottom<00:02:15.030> so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
with this little noun at the bottom so

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.970 
with this little noun at the bottom so
instead<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.570> going<00:02:15.870> all<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.380> way<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.830> can

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
instead of going all the way up we can

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.980 
instead of going all the way up we can
get<00:02:17.160> let's<00:02:17.820> see<00:02:18.000> let's<00:02:18.210> take<00:02:18.420> let's<00:02:18.600> take<00:02:18.750> this

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
get let's see let's take let's take this

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.390 
get let's see let's take let's take this
about<00:02:19.230> halfway<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:21.890> okay<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:22.950> we've<00:02:23.160> still

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
about halfway and okay so we've still

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
about halfway and okay so we've still
got<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> mixin<00:02:24.210> foot<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:28.050> once<00:02:28.500> this

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
got this on the mixin foot and once this

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.880 
got this on the mixin foot and once this
is<00:02:28.800> set<00:02:29.280> halfway<00:02:29.840> once<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.990> turned<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.440> pedal

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
is set halfway once I turned this pedal

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.199 
is set halfway once I turned this pedal
all<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.100> way<00:02:32.310> up<00:02:32.460> it's<00:02:32.670> only<00:02:32.820> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.120> go

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
all the way up it's only going to go

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:43.300 
all the way up it's only going to go
halfway

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.860 

okay<00:02:44.310> I've<00:02:44.430> got<00:02:44.459> something<00:02:44.939> else<00:02:45.150> patched<00:02:45.540> in

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
okay I've got something else patched in

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.349 
okay I've got something else patched in
I've<00:02:46.109> got<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.579> expression<00:02:47.579> pedal<00:02:47.909> into<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
I've got the expression pedal into the

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.069 
I've got the expression pedal into the
envelope<00:02:48.810> amount<00:02:49.379> on<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.159> Freak<00:02:50.670> box<00:02:51.079> I've

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
envelope amount on the Freak box I've

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.709 
envelope amount on the Freak box I've
got<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.409> LFO<00:02:52.890> from<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.250> ring<00:02:53.430> modulator

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:53.719 
got the LFO from the ring modulator

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.020 
got the LFO from the ring modulator
plugged<00:02:54.719> into<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.590> waveform<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.939> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
plugged into the waveform so the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.330 
plugged into the waveform so the
waveform<00:02:57.450> itself<00:02:57.659> is<00:02:57.989> moving<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.379> its<00:02:58.409> own<00:02:58.680> but

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
waveform itself is moving on its own but

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.069 
waveform itself is moving on its own but
I'm<00:02:59.700> able<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.939> control<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.480> envelope<00:03:00.810> amount

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
I'm able to control the envelope amount

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.750 
I'm able to control the envelope amount
of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> Freak<00:03:01.439> box<00:03:01.650> which<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.459> going<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.639> give

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
of the Freak box which is going to give

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:22.180 
of the Freak box which is going to give
me<00:03:02.849> kind<00:03:03.359> of<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.540> crazy<00:03:03.810> synth<00:03:04.680> wah<00:03:04.950> kind<00:03:05.549> of

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.880 

Oh

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.130 

okay<00:03:27.790> now<00:03:27.940> I've<00:03:28.090> got<00:03:28.240> this<00:03:28.360> expression<00:03:28.660> pedal

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
okay now I've got this expression pedal

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.730 
okay now I've got this expression pedal
plug<00:03:29.440> into<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:30.540> head<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.660> your<00:03:31.750> boss<00:03:32.020> PS<00:03:32.500> five

plug into the head to your boss PS five

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.830 
plug into the head to your boss PS five
super<00:03:33.100> shifter<00:03:33.430> if<00:03:34.390> you've<00:03:34.570> got<00:03:34.720> an

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
super shifter if you've got an

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.360 
super shifter if you've got an
expression<00:03:35.170> pedal<00:03:35.380> plugged<00:03:35.800> in<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.040> pedal

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
expression pedal plugged in that pedal

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.980 
expression pedal plugged in that pedal
you<00:03:36.850> can<00:03:36.880> actually<00:03:37.240> make<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.420> sound<00:03:37.690> like<00:03:37.840> a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
you can actually make it sound like a

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.040 
you can actually make it sound like a
digitech<00:03:38.650> win<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:39.540> we're<00:03:40.540> going<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.780> start

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
digitech win so we're going to start

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.220 
digitech win so we're going to start
with<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.610> dry<00:03:42.610> tone<00:03:42.880> here<00:03:43.240> in<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.690> 12:00

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
with a dry tone here in the 12:00

00:03:44.230 --> 00:04:00.800 
with a dry tone here in the 12:00
position<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.890> we'll<00:03:45.430> get<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.790> octave<00:03:46.540> up<00:03:46.690> in

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.289 

that's<00:04:01.810> all<00:04:01.959> I've<00:04:02.080> got<00:04:02.110> for<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.650> bogey<00:04:03.069> p2<00:04:03.459> if

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
that's all I've got for the bogey p2 if

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.720 
that's all I've got for the bogey p2 if
you're<00:04:04.480> about<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.959> get<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.379> rollin<00:04:06.040> eb-5

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
you're about to get the rollin eb-5

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.880 
you're about to get the rollin eb-5
expression<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.659> would<00:04:08.230> suggest<00:04:08.379> hitting<00:04:08.799> this

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
expression I would suggest hitting this

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.759 
expression I would suggest hitting this
instead<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.239> still<00:04:10.959> made<00:04:11.140> out<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.349> plastic

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
instead it is still made out of plastic

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.470 
instead it is still made out of plastic
like<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.040> rolling<00:04:12.370> but<00:04:12.970> this<00:04:13.150> is<00:04:13.269> a<00:04:13.299> little

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
like the rolling but this is a little

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.869 
like the rolling but this is a little
bit<00:04:13.569> heavier<00:04:13.840> it's<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.140> little<00:04:14.290> bit<00:04:14.410> tougher<00:04:14.879> it

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
bit heavier it's a little bit tougher it

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.199 
bit heavier it's a little bit tougher it
works<00:04:16.150> better<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:17.530> Roland<00:04:18.370> I've<00:04:18.609> noticed<00:04:19.030> and

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
works better the Roland I've noticed and

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.750 
works better the Roland I've noticed and
I've<00:04:19.389> had<00:04:19.600> two<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.959> them<00:04:20.079> in<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.410> past<00:04:20.760> the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
I've had two of them in the past the

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.760 
I've had two of them in the past the
sweep<00:04:22.060> doesn't<00:04:22.449> start<00:04:22.750> until<00:04:22.990> you're<00:04:23.530> about

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
sweep doesn't start until you're about

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.040 
sweep doesn't start until you're about
almost<00:04:24.580> halfway<00:04:24.820> through<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:25.630> then<00:04:25.870> the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
almost halfway through and then the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.379 
almost halfway through and then the
sweep<00:04:26.290> starts<00:04:26.740> which<00:04:27.520> doesn't<00:04:28.060> really<00:04:28.210> give

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
sweep starts which doesn't really give

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.029 
sweep starts which doesn't really give
you<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.510> full<00:04:28.720> range<00:04:28.960> in<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.199> pedal<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:29.650> you're

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
you a full range in the pedal so you're

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.580 
you a full range in the pedal so you're
kind<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.340> guessing<00:04:30.820> where<00:04:31.120> you're<00:04:31.240> at<00:04:31.590> this

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
kind of guessing where you're at this

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.170 
kind of guessing where you're at this
head<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:33.010> you<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.190> full<00:04:33.400> range<00:04:33.639> throughout<00:04:34.030> the

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
head is you a full range throughout the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.890 
head is you a full range throughout the
entire<00:04:35.880> throughout<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.060> entire<00:04:37.180> sweep<00:04:37.690> there

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
entire throughout the entire sweep there

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.990 
entire throughout the entire sweep there
and<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:40.320> don't<00:04:41.320> know<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.530> doesn't<00:04:41.889> really<00:04:42.039> spend

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
and I don't know it doesn't really spend

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.460 
and I don't know it doesn't really spend
so<00:04:43.210> much<00:04:43.330> time<00:04:43.389> trying<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.990> promote<00:04:44.199> this

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
so much time trying to promote this

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.610 
so much time trying to promote this
thing<00:04:45.210> they've<00:04:46.210> got<00:04:46.419> their<00:04:46.630> multi<00:04:47.169> pedal<00:04:47.500> the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
thing they've got their multi pedal the

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.640 
thing they've got their multi pedal the
NP<00:04:47.919> 201<00:04:48.430> multi<00:04:48.760> pedal<00:04:49.030> but<00:04:49.630> this<00:04:50.050> is<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.260> really

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
NP 201 multi pedal but this is a really

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.270 
NP 201 multi pedal but this is a really
really<00:04:50.860> basic<00:04:51.090> solid<00:04:52.090> tool<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:54.100> will<00:04:54.250> help

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
really basic solid tool that will help

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.610 
really basic solid tool that will help
you<00:04:54.550> shape<00:04:54.850> your<00:04:54.910> tone<00:04:55.240> if<00:04:56.169> you've<00:04:56.350> got<00:04:56.590> a

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
should not have one of these especially

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.800 
should not have one of these especially

getting those motor fogers you should

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.180 
getting those motor fogers you should
have<00:05:07.300> at<00:05:07.419> least<00:05:07.450> one<00:05:07.930> of<00:05:08.020> these<00:05:08.139> that's<00:05:08.950> all<00:05:09.099> I
