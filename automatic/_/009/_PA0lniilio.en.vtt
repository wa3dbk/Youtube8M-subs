00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
really with with haulin and you know I

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.669 
really with with haulin and you know I
think<00:01:21.340> I'll<00:01:21.850> always<00:01:22.060> give<00:01:22.299> my<00:01:22.450> all<00:01:22.630> always<00:01:23.380> and

think I'll always give my all always and
but<00:01:24.039> I<00:01:24.069> think<00:01:24.280> there's<00:01:24.429> a<00:01:24.460> lot<00:01:24.579> more<00:01:24.639> time

but I think there's a lot more time
again<00:01:25.149> and<00:01:25.289> got<00:01:26.289> energy<00:01:26.439> and<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.880> think<00:01:28.179> I'm

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
again and got energy and I think I'm

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.469

technically quite good so and I believe

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.419 
technically quite good so and I believe
I'm<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.749> lot<00:01:31.929> to<00:01:32.049> get<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.469> you<00:01:32.709> have<00:01:32.740> utility

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.080 
think I think you know it was the right
decision<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:04.100> know<00:03:04.160> what<00:03:04.550> options<00:03:04.880> did<00:03:04.970> you

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
decision you know what options did you

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.210 
decision you know what options did you
have<00:03:05.209> at<00:03:05.300> this<00:03:05.390> point<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.739> be<00:03:06.830> honest<00:03:07.070> not

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
have at this point and to be honest not

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.479 
have at this point and to be honest not
not<00:03:07.519> loads<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.150> just<00:03:08.959> couple<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.830> sniffs<00:03:10.070> Omni

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
not loads and just couple of sniffs Omni

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.030
