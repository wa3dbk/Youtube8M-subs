is your twitter user i don't usually do

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.440 
is your twitter user i don't usually do
that<00:03:11.859> because<00:03:12.220> i<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.670> link<00:03:12.850> for

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
that because i have the link for

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.720 
that because i have the link for
directly<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.109> twitter<00:03:14.320> anyway<00:03:14.620> i<00:03:14.950> don't<00:03:15.519> like

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
directly the twitter anyway i don't like

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.710 
directly the twitter anyway i don't like
to<00:03:15.760> show<00:03:16.380> timestamps<00:03:18.269> hyperlinks<00:03:19.269> are<00:03:19.390> okay

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
to show timestamps hyperlinks are okay

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.460 
to show timestamps hyperlinks are okay
and<00:03:20.640> replies<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.970> tweets<00:03:22.299> I<00:03:22.690> don't<00:03:23.350> think

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
and replies and tweets I don't think

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.259 
and replies and tweets I don't think
that's<00:03:23.590> necessary<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.370> show<00:03:24.519> on<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.819> sidebar

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
that's necessary to show on the sidebar

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.210 
that's necessary to show on the sidebar
so<00:03:26.519> that's<00:03:27.519> done<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.060> then<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.890> want<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.130> make

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
so that's done and then you want to make

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.099 
so that's done and then you want to make
it<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.790> links<00:03:31.060> open<00:03:31.359> into<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.630> new<00:03:31.810> tab

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
it so that the links open into a new tab

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.020 
it so that the links open into a new tab
so<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:33.130> if<00:03:33.220> somebody<00:03:33.370> does<00:03:33.609> click<00:03:33.850> on<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> link

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
so that if somebody does click on a link

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.910 
so that if somebody does click on a link
in<00:03:34.359> your<00:03:34.510> sidebar<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.139> doesn't<00:03:35.440> take<00:03:35.590> them<00:03:35.769> off

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
in your sidebar it doesn't take them off

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.129 
in your sidebar it doesn't take them off
of<00:03:36.100> your<00:03:36.190> site<00:03:36.489> just<00:03:37.480> takes<00:03:37.720> them<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:38.019> new

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
of your site just takes them in a new

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.379 
of your site just takes them in a new
window<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.530> then<00:03:38.889> they're<00:03:39.370> still<00:03:39.579> around<00:03:39.700> so
