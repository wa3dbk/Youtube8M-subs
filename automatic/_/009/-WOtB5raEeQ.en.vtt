00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello youtube people to see a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.420
 immense amount of comments from 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.700
 video of the origin of the pokemon is 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.740
 decided to make this video respond to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.099
 the questions that you consider good and that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.780
 worth it so let's start who 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.150
 he created humans 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.850
 good in any medium of this game 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.740
 specific but remember the pokemons do not 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.720
 they inhabited the earth before but 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.550
 they arrived on an asteroid and populated the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.369
 ground as shown in a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.180
 episode where the glazers came out that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.980
 good research but lack more 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.960
 missing missing for more and continue to the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.059
 creator it seems that he will try to continue with 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.969
 this until you run out of ideas but 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.739
 Believe me for that, it will be quite short but 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.230
 to answer your question, I just need 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.539
 what about black and white pokemon and the future 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.690
 game of xy that will be released soon 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.329
 Newton is a Pokémon because it was 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.399
 created by humans also because in 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.079
 the movie on youtube south new youtube 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.899
 refers to as the most coach 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 strong of the universe u2 is still a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.549
 pokémon because it's made from 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.960
 adn of one in this case of a thousand so 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.119
 you practically follow 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.040
 1 and he said he is the best coach 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.650
 just to say that it's more than the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.450
 humans if we see the series from a point 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.210
 of view in which the pokemon are 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.950
 being recently discovered like this 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.100
 when it leaves the village palette there is only 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.399
 discovered 150 that does not mean that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.860
 there are only 150 and it is also true that 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.600
 already within the series of mohamed the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 truth is that all you have said is 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.130
 true the pokemon just like the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.070
 species exist different in parts 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.410
 of the world in this case of regions and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.360
 three evolutions of hebe and he had no 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.399
 no participation in the creation of 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.710
 the origins of the Pokémons so 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.630
 mentioning it is irrelevant but as 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.369
 Curious data is one of the few 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.009
 pokémons that can change type 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.530
 when they evolve they knew that being is a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.320
 fly on se with a vapor and on and rayco is 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.509
 a hit on is possible but the story 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.820
 that count on either the anime or the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.990
 games does not mention anything that pokémons 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.209
 they die in the tower where they were created 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.549
 555 is not good at all I chose this question 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.360
 because I thought it was funny where 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.880
 start 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.590
 first good is not written with vv 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.050
 girl depending on what you call her or 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.530
 you know you write with violent candle what 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.810
 see big and second 555 is a circuit 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.910
 integrated and if you want to know what that is 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.760
 I invite you to look for it, let's go to the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.680
 next gelatin our death is 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.870
 based on antimatter 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.030
 that is also true but it was locked 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.820
 because it was very violent and possibly 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.640
 he had killed pokémons and dragons where 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.940
 it fits into creation nothing but it's just 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.740
 a pokemon something old and dioxide is not 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.020
 he knows a lot about this pokemon just that he has 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.730
 come from space but God did not have 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.220
 participation in the creation of 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.230
 pokémons only created him and now 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.820
 it is said that it emerged from a space virus 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.520
 and it's one of the type pokemon 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.680
 most powerful psychic that exist if you already 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.170
 they pulled out more legendary pokémon are in 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.900
 the fifth generation make a video of that 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.390
 I will effectively do one but I will wait 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.370
 play the new ones I mean x and aie 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.500
 so that you do not have to update the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.870
 video again so have a bit of 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.180
 patience until they take out the game this 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.879
 October and 1 month 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.500
 of the ones you know very little is one of 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.390
 the most mysterious pokemones that 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.519
 exist and the truth has not been revealed 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.890
 much of it because of its existence nor 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.659
 What relationships do they have with the ruins like this? 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.670
 that can not be clarified if 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.069
 they participated in the creation of 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.750
 the pokemons one thing that the 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.689
 legendary pokémon is that they were 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.730
 created by other legendary pokémon 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.010
 very true since the ceus was the origin 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.019
 where all this started could be 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.239
 say that a legendary pokemon created a 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.430
 others in sequence and so forged 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.250
 this entertaining story of appearance 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.319
 endless this October 2013 the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.659
 sixth generation will shit for inside 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.359
 your video and even legend will then come out 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.189
 another until the seventh that you said 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.469
 is not entirely true since in the 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.540
 origins of the pokémons will follow everything 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.430
 equal to the ceus will remain the one that 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.069
 created he will remain the god of the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.959
 pokemon and if indeed they will continue 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.909
 taking out and extending the story until 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.039
 that the fans get bored do not buy the 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.650
 games do not watch the anime or manga but 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.680
 Believe me, that's a long way from now 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.990
 this weon knows where it is for thanks 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.090
 but I 'm not an expert on the subject 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.889
 and only that unlike some 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.870
 people I like to enjoy the 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.819
 story and go a little bit to this one and 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.680
 be in the game of anime not only 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.419
 enjoy the gameplay or effects 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.240
 luminic without understanding what is 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.340
 happening and the reason for these good ones 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.080
 I appreciate seeing the video and many 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.910
 they had requested a second video 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.190
 including the story of white pokemon 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.650
 and black 2 but I'll wait until it comes out 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.690
 x and if you want to keep asking them 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.460
 I invite you to leave your doubts here in the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.620
 comment box of this video and 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.810
 when there is an acceptable amount 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.970
 I will respond in another video a greeting to 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.220
 all the subscribers and youtube those who 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.300
 see this video by chance we are 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.300
 in the next video
