00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.690
 tonic 310 a chapter where I start 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.790
 to do the tonic review so then 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.610
 they are going to be very exhausting and good this 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.710
 monkey king and his testicles are passed on 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.779
 In this chapter, let's analyze what is not 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.010
 we know how others how to start 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.869
 get around the ring to 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.250
 contemplate the situation since this 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.320
 festival with rosary turned every time 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.660
 more serious and involves challenging the king 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.489
 to try to steal the post but this 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.840
 it's not easy because the art type 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.850
 martial will change you can not touch 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.160
 anything and this time in this case 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.740
 we have to fight free to be more 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.060
 specific monkey wrestling we have 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.320
 to play that is quite hurt him 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.670
 also very the guest by the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.590
 three - day training that took 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.450
 of language so the resistance of 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.340
 everyone is half of what is usually 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.050
 be so they are not in the commissions 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.120
 that they should but won for the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:02.410
 testicles of the banana monkey and everything goes 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:04.030
 to solve and those who are right 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.680
 and casually this monkey with his 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.420
 testicles week the veil but that 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.729
 basically it's food through 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.530
 sound which immediately recovers 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.000
 and it's all how you feel as if 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.710
 was full is the first time that 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.040
 they fill with sounds that is something 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.040
 quite 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.020
 but this does not occur imagine what 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.210
 which must be definitely is like the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.770
 psuv to be saved will be for another 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.930
 side was created sounds restore 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.030
 destroy wow that includes sebrae 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.040
 historical request for thermal and nikisch 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.259
 I want to take care of komatsu that you already know are 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.940
 ancestral enemies of the monkey but good 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.920
 that understands the situation and good the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.840
 fight is about to start there are rules but 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.820
 let's say the most important candle and that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.580
 within all there are no rules and there is no 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.380
 referrals are worth practically everything 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.119
 who wants to fight zebra but knows 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.649
 and tells him that please pepe lara that 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.539
 that you have as something personal against this 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.630
 monkey for eating in shape and ass before 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.970
 ridiculous ridiculous like those all 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.500
 days geeks without life good people count 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.870
 saliva to be and fight but the monkey 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.640
 appears 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.040
 the ropes so it is expected to be 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.230
 well away but zebra appears behind the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.570
 monkey grabs him for when he returns to 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.040
 pass by and hit him with all said and done 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.550
 is free for a mobile hit is very 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.470
 impacts the end of the chapter conclusions 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.300
 a chapter like this action I can not 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.370
 believe that this is not so powerful the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.110
 I really hate bandina obviously with 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.640
 that goal but when finishing the least sure 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.440
 that nobody's going to be a game of 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.110
 wrestling techniques a role 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.850
 suples let's say and maybe today I found the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.100
 plan of action although it is also not passed 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.600
 a miracle and excel are enough 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.310
 at least this pretty one is 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.390
 emitting is very gross I liked the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.740
 example that works in the chapter 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.600
 previous when we compared it with a 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.070
 tiger that for more than one can as if 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.540
 was a kitten you have then health is 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.130
 after killing at any time 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.290
 well this is something like that but at least the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.730
 animal is happy and the testicles good 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.010
 the truth that seems to me a little 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.690
 strange and I guess most of the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.610
 that if he sends too but good 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.200
 I hope your comments and theories I decided 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.880
 start with the tonic video we're going to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.860
 see how it is when you follow them 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.450
 because I do not know how many we will be 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.000
 an opportunity that they have because it 's very 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.150
 good 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.770
 better blood and anything you do not want 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.810
 if possible more related meals 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.790
 it's bad against the many adventures 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.190
 to live but good many impeachment in 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.430
 this video we see in the next chau 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.430
 bye
