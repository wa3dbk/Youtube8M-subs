00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.700 
at all here's the new one
I<00:01:13.830> lose<00:01:14.830> smoothly<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.910> goes<00:01:16.380> you'll<00:01:17.380> see<00:01:17.590> how

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
I lose smoothly that goes you'll see how

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.020 
I lose smoothly that goes you'll see how
smooth<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.220> is<00:01:18.250> when<00:01:18.490> it's<00:01:18.610> all<00:01:18.700> back<00:01:18.850> together

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
smooth it is when it's all back together

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.090 
smooth it is when it's all back together
as<00:01:19.390> well<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.970> it<00:01:22.240> that's<00:01:22.840> why<00:01:23.140> one<00:01:23.860> two

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
as well that's it that's why one two

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.760 
as well that's it that's why one two
gets<00:01:24.670> messed<00:01:24.910> up<00:01:25.149> missing<00:01:25.990> gears<00:01:26.200> what

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
gets messed up missing gears what

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.850 
gets messed up missing gears what
happens<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:28.750> this<00:01:28.930> swings<00:01:29.259> forward<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:29.770> the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
happens when this swings forward to the

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.249 
happens when this swings forward to the
next<00:01:30.040> actually<00:01:30.910> engaged<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.600> collar<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:32.110> the

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
next actually engaged the collar on the

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.920 
next actually engaged the collar on the
gear<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:33.310> gets<00:01:33.520> smeared<00:01:33.940> so<00:01:34.240> then<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.509> wedges

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
gear it gets smeared so then it wedges

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.570 
gear it gets smeared so then it wedges
being<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.440> factory<00:01:35.800> collars<00:01:36.250> are<00:01:36.399> so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
being that the factory collars are so

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.630 
being that the factory collars are so
tight<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.170> this<00:01:38.500> is<00:01:38.649> six<00:01:39.100> hundred<00:01:39.369> dollars

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
tight so this is six hundred dollars

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.340 
tight so this is six hundred dollars
list<00:01:39.970> just<00:01:40.360> from<00:01:40.569> the<00:01:40.690> dealer<00:01:40.929> that's<00:01:41.170> why

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
list just from the dealer that's why

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.040 
list just from the dealer that's why
these<00:01:41.410> tranny<00:01:41.890> repairs<00:01:42.310> are<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:42.640> expensive

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
these tranny repairs are so expensive

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.210 
these tranny repairs are so expensive
from<00:01:44.050> what<00:01:44.200> I've<00:01:44.319> read<00:01:44.530> this<00:01:44.740> one<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.100> this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
from what I've read this one is this

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.160 
from what I've read this one is this
different<00:01:45.640> material<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.660> it<00:01:46.810> has<00:01:46.840> little

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
different material and it has little

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.350 
different material and it has little
looser<00:01:47.560> clearances<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.759> definitely<00:01:49.240> want

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
looser clearances so you definitely want

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.669 
looser clearances so you definitely want
to<00:01:49.390> replace<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.869> you<00:01:49.899> don't<00:01:50.080> want<00:01:50.259> to<00:01:50.319> just<00:01:50.440> try

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
to replace it you don't want to just try

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.340 
to replace it you don't want to just try
to<00:01:50.740> free<00:01:51.009> this<00:01:51.130> one<00:01:51.340> up<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.610> file<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.060> down<00:01:52.350> on

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
to free this one up and file it down on

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.609 
to free this one up and file it down on
my<00:01:53.500> own<00:01:53.530> personal<00:01:53.830> vehicle<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:55.500> switched<00:01:56.500> to

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
my own personal vehicle I switched to

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.889 
my own personal vehicle I switched to
this<00:01:56.860> probably<00:01:57.759> about<00:01:58.090> thirty<00:01:58.450> thousand

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
this probably about thirty thousand

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.859 
this probably about thirty thousand
miles<00:01:59.200> ago<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.830> about<00:02:00.450> 150<00:02:01.450> quarter-mile

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
miles ago and about 150 quarter-mile

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.190 
miles ago and about 150 quarter-mile
passes<00:02:02.319> so<00:02:02.679> I've<00:02:03.220> had<00:02:03.459> no<00:02:03.610> problem<00:02:04.090> with<00:02:05.020> this

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
passes so I've had no problem with this

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.029 
passes so I've had no problem with this
new<00:02:05.410> setup<00:02:05.770> at<00:02:05.890> all<00:02:07.410> now<00:02:08.410> here<00:02:08.619> is<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.860> gear

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
new setup at all now here is the gear

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.859 
new setup at all now here is the gear
assembly<00:02:09.310> it's<00:02:09.700> reassembled<00:02:10.149> now<00:02:10.479> with<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
assembly it's reassembled now with the

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.290 
assembly it's reassembled now with the
brand<00:02:11.140> new<00:02:11.230> one<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.860> shift<00:02:12.100> collar<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
brand new one to shift collar and the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.570 
brand new one to shift collar and the
new<00:02:13.480> one<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.050> synchronize<00:02:14.800> your<00:02:14.830> rings<00:02:17.580> so

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
new one to synchronize your rings so

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.500 
new one to synchronize your rings so
that's<00:02:18.700> basically<00:02:18.940> what<00:02:19.090> happens<00:02:19.300> when<00:02:19.360> you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that's basically what happens when you

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.449 
that's basically what happens when you
ship<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:19.930> would<00:02:20.170> grab<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.830> gear<00:02:21.250> and

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
ship this would grab this gear and

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.309 
ship this would grab this gear and
engage<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.270> gear<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.630> gear<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.959> already

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
engage this gear this gear is already

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.050 
engage this gear this gear is already
touching<00:02:23.950> another<00:02:24.310> gear<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.849> don't

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
touching another gear so you don't

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.480 
touching another gear so you don't
really<00:02:25.240> shift<00:02:25.510> gears<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.680> engage<00:02:27.069> them<00:02:27.310> with

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
really shift gears you engage them with

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.880 
really shift gears you engage them with
the<00:02:27.610> shift<00:02:27.849> collar<00:02:28.120> which<00:02:28.810> hooks<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.709> to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the shift collar which hooks it up to

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.190 
the shift collar which hooks it up to
the<00:02:30.010> shaft<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.640> if<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.819> see<00:02:31.030> when<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.660> grab<00:02:31.930> that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
the shaft so if you see when I grab that

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.380 
the shaft so if you see when I grab that
it<00:02:32.470> turns<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.860> whole<00:02:32.920> thing<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.270> how

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
it turns the whole thing but this is how

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:45.020 
it turns the whole thing but this is how
it<00:02:34.510> should<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.840> worked

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:03:10.540 

you

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.680 

here<00:03:11.550> are<00:03:11.640> some<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.910> synchronizer<00:03:12.390> rings

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
here are some of the synchronizer rings

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.360 
here are some of the synchronizer rings
this<00:03:12.960> is<00:03:13.110> what<00:03:13.290> allows<00:03:13.650> your<00:03:13.800> car<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.130> shift

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
this is what allows your car to shift

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.540 
this is what allows your car to shift
smoothly<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.450> ever<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.080> car<00:03:16.440> that

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
smoothly if you ever have a car that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.470 
smoothly if you ever have a car that
shifts<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.730> makes<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.060> little<00:03:18.240> bit<00:03:18.360> of

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
shifts and makes that little bit of

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.720 
shifts and makes that little bit of
crunch<00:03:18.750> even<00:03:19.230> under<00:03:19.440> normal<00:03:19.470> driving<00:03:19.800> these

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
crunch even under normal driving these

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.690 
crunch even under normal driving these
are<00:03:20.910> what<00:03:21.060> wear<00:03:21.210> out<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:22.620> way<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:23.070> OEM<00:03:23.430> ones

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
are what wear out the way the OEM ones

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.500 
are what wear out the way the OEM ones
are<00:03:24.030> brass<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:26.160> ring<00:03:26.459> right<00:03:26.640> here<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.180> used

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
are brass this ring right here is used

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.660 
are brass this ring right here is used
for<00:03:27.690> third<00:03:28.320> fourth<00:03:28.740> fifth<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.160> sixth<00:03:29.550> the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
for third fourth fifth and sixth the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.020 
for third fourth fifth and sixth the
same<00:03:29.880> ring<00:03:30.770> these<00:03:31.770> two<00:03:32.040> rings<00:03:32.280> are<00:03:32.580> first<00:03:32.850> and

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
same ring these two rings are first and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.480 
same ring these two rings are first and
second<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.440> see<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.709> first<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.190> also

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
second you can see the first is also

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.790 
second you can see the first is also
brass<00:03:35.840> this<00:03:36.840> one<00:03:37.020> actually<00:03:37.200> has<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.470> friction

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
brass this one actually has a friction

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.910 
brass this one actually has a friction
material<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.520> it<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:39.810> brass<00:03:40.170> design<00:03:40.709> has

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
material on it this brass design has

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.530 
material on it this brass design has
been<00:03:41.100> used<00:03:41.340> since<00:03:41.520> way<00:03:42.030> back<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
been used since way back in the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.530 
been used since way back in the
muscle-car<00:03:42.900> era<00:03:43.050> so<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:44.580> works<00:03:44.850> well<00:03:45.180> but

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
muscle-car era so it works well but

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.240 
muscle-car era so it works well but
actually<00:03:46.200> you're<00:03:46.350> gonna<00:03:46.410> see<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.860> new<00:03:47.040> ones

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
actually you're gonna see the new ones

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.560 
actually you're gonna see the new ones
are<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.459> little<00:03:47.580> different<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.239> these<00:03:48.450> are

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
are a little different that these are

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
are a little different that these are
even<00:03:48.810> what<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.080> dealer<00:03:49.380> gets<00:03:51.140> now<00:03:52.140> here<00:03:52.440> are

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
even what the dealer gets now here are

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.860 
even what the dealer gets now here are
the<00:03:52.680> new<00:03:52.830> synchronizer<00:03:53.340> rings<00:03:53.640> here<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.600> new

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
the new synchronizer rings here is a new

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.140 
the new synchronizer rings here is a new
three<00:03:55.470> four<00:03:55.739> five<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.220> six<00:03:56.310> they're<00:03:56.880> all<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
three four five and six they're all the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.130 
three four five and six they're all the
same<00:03:57.200> but<00:03:58.200> if<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.380> notice<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:58.830> style<00:04:00.140> is

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
same but if you notice this style is

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.930 
same but if you notice this style is
different<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.980> got<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.220> old<00:04:02.340> brass<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.880> you

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
different you got the old brass and you

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.490 
different you got the old brass and you
got<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.180> new<00:04:03.300> friction<00:04:03.660> material<00:04:03.989> it's

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
got the new friction material it's

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.350 
got the new friction material it's
obviously<00:04:04.770> gonna<00:04:04.890> allow<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.459> grab<00:04:06.030> gears<00:04:06.300> a

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
obviously gonna allow it to grab gears a

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.210 
obviously gonna allow it to grab gears a
little<00:04:06.540> quicker<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.620> just<00:04:07.830> actually<00:04:07.980> a

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
little quicker this is just actually a

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.250 
little quicker this is just actually a
factory<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.820> know<00:04:09.060> an<00:04:09.209> OEM<00:04:09.630> update<00:04:10.050> through

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
factory you know an OEM update through

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.350 
factory you know an OEM update through
the<00:04:10.350> dealership<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:11.640> anytime<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.120> get<00:04:12.270> it

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
the dealership so anytime you get it

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.509 
the dealership so anytime you get it
rebuilt<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.200> get<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.440> right<00:04:13.590> parts<00:04:13.950> it's

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
rebuilt and you get the right parts it's

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.509 
rebuilt and you get the right parts it's
going<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.700> be<00:04:14.820> upgraded<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:16.470> if<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.280> look<00:04:17.430> at

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
going to be upgraded and if you look at

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.340 
going to be upgraded and if you look at
this<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:17.790> one's<00:04:18.000> real<00:04:18.239> aggressive<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:19.200> one

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
this this one's real aggressive for one

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.170 
this this one's real aggressive for one
to<00:04:19.650> both<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.070> first<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.549> second<00:04:20.850> gear<00:04:20.970> have

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
to both the first and second gear have

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.600 
to both the first and second gear have
this<00:04:21.590> versus<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.740> old<00:04:22.890> first<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.310> second

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
this versus the old first and second

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.880 
this versus the old first and second
gear<00:04:23.729> one<00:04:23.910> was<00:04:24.060> brass<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:25.050> one<00:04:25.200> was<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.350> milder

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
gear one was brass and one was a milder

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.980 
gear one was brass and one was a milder
friction<00:04:26.430> material<00:04:26.790> this<00:04:27.300> actually<00:04:27.750> feels

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
friction material this actually feels

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.380 
friction material this actually feels
like<00:04:28.200> sandpaper<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:29.490> one<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.000> two<00:04:30.150> are<00:04:30.270> going

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
like sandpaper so one and two are going

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.270 
like sandpaper so one and two are going
to<00:04:30.479> feel<00:04:30.630> great<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.080> that's<00:04:31.740> another<00:04:32.070> reason

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
to feel great and that's another reason

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.450 
to feel great and that's another reason
why<00:04:32.460> you<00:04:32.490> have<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:33.180> upgrade<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.720> shift<00:04:34.080> collar

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
why you have to upgrade the shift collar

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.469 
why you have to upgrade the shift collar
just<00:04:35.460> even<00:04:35.760> if<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:35.940> want<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.150> change<00:04:36.330> the

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
just even if you want to change the

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.719 
just even if you want to change the
synchronizers<00:04:37.140> because<00:04:37.950> this<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.460> lot<00:04:38.700> more

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
synchronizers because this is a lot more

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.340 
synchronizers because this is a lot more
abrasive<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.450> that<00:04:39.540> new<00:04:39.720> synchronizer

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
abrasive and that new synchronizer

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.740 
abrasive and that new synchronizer
collar<00:04:40.710> is<00:04:40.950> actually<00:04:41.370> stronger<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.120> pretty

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
collar is actually stronger so pretty

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.000 
collar is actually stronger so pretty
much<00:04:42.900> mandatory<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.530> change<00:04:43.770> all<00:04:43.919> your

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
much mandatory to change all your

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.580 
much mandatory to change all your
synchronizer<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.910> that<00:04:45.810> one<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.140> shift<00:04:46.350> color

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
synchronizer and that one to shift color

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.469 
synchronizer and that one to shift color
but<00:04:46.979> that<00:04:47.250> one<00:04:47.729> to<00:04:47.850> shift<00:04:48.060> color<00:04:48.240> almost

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
but that one to shift color almost

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.000 
but that one to shift color almost
always<00:04:48.900> gets<00:04:49.080> messed<00:04:49.320> up<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.740> that's<00:04:49.860> usually

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
always gets messed up and that's usually

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.219 
always gets messed up and that's usually
why<00:04:50.250> they<00:04:50.370> get<00:04:50.520> taken<00:04:50.640> apart<00:04:50.990> so<00:04:51.990> in<00:04:52.110> my

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
why they get taken apart so in my

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.140 
why they get taken apart so in my
experience<00:04:52.770> usually<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.220> trannys<00:04:53.850> just<00:04:54.000> need

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
experience usually the trannys just need

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.330 
experience usually the trannys just need
a<00:04:54.180> reseal<00:04:54.600> new<00:04:55.200> synchronizers<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.040> once<00:04:56.250> you

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
a reseal new synchronizers and once you

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.890 
a reseal new synchronizers and once you
shift<00:04:56.550> collar<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:56.940> that's<00:04:57.090> it<00:04:57.300> people

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
shift collar and that's it people

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.719 
shift collar and that's it people
sometimes<00:04:58.410> tell<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.800> that<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.130> gears<00:04:59.370> break

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
sometimes tell you that the gears break

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.210 
sometimes tell you that the gears break
this<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:00.390> if<00:05:00.630> your<00:05:01.410> only<00:05:01.530> issue<00:05:01.770> is<00:05:02.040> not

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
this and that if your only issue is not

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.890 
this and that if your only issue is not
going<00:05:02.610> into<00:05:02.760> first<00:05:03.030> or<00:05:03.180> second<00:05:03.540> think<00:05:03.720> it's

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
going into first or second think it's

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.510 
going into first or second think it's
not<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.200> gears<00:05:04.440> it's<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.950> one<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.280> shift

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
not the gears it's the one to shift

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.520 
not the gears it's the one to shift
color<00:05:05.729> you<00:05:06.330> obviously<00:05:06.720> got<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:06.870> inspect<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
color you obviously got to inspect the

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.750 
color you obviously got to inspect the
other<00:05:07.680> side<00:05:08.040> where<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.340> shift<00:05:08.520> collar

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
other side where the shift collar

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.270 
other side where the shift collar
engages<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.390> gear<00:05:09.720> but<00:05:10.560> usually<00:05:10.919> that<00:05:11.070> just

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
engages the gear but usually that just

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
engages the gear but usually that just
can<00:05:11.400> be<00:05:11.460> taken<00:05:11.729> care<00:05:11.910> with<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.090> file

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300

of<00:05:34.950> how<00:05:35.160> exactly<00:05:35.550> how<00:05:35.730> they<00:05:35.880> work<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.750> help

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
of how exactly how they work and to help

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.980 
of how exactly how they work and to help
you<00:05:37.169> understand<00:05:37.620> them<00:05:37.770> better<00:05:38.810> number<00:05:39.810> one

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
you understand them better number one

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.870 
you understand them better number one
you're<00:05:40.560> gonna<00:05:40.650> have<00:05:40.860> a<00:05:40.889> shift<00:05:41.220> shaft<00:05:41.430> this<00:05:41.730> is

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
you're gonna have a shift shaft this is

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.340 
you're gonna have a shift shaft this is
usually<00:05:42.030> sitting<00:05:42.360> in<00:05:42.510> a<00:05:42.600> different<00:05:42.720> housing

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
usually sitting in a different housing

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.800 
usually sitting in a different housing
and<00:05:43.530> this<00:05:44.250> is<00:05:44.430> gonna<00:05:44.550> move<00:05:44.880> this<00:05:45.210> way<00:05:45.389> in<00:05:45.540> this

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
and this is gonna move this way in this

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.750 
and this is gonna move this way in this
way<00:05:46.020> when<00:05:46.230> you're<00:05:46.350> going<00:05:46.380> in<00:05:46.919> neutral<00:05:47.340> side<00:05:47.610> to

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
way when you're going in neutral side to

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.970 
way when you're going in neutral side to
side<00:05:47.940> this<00:05:48.180> is<00:05:48.240> going<00:05:48.419> like<00:05:48.720> this<00:05:48.889> when<00:05:49.889> you

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
side this is going like this when you

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.310 
side this is going like this when you
shift<00:05:50.250> this<00:05:50.430> is<00:05:50.610> twisting<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.419> grabbing

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
shift this is twisting and grabbing

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.620 
shift this is twisting and grabbing
these<00:05:52.440> gates<00:05:52.910> for<00:05:53.910> instance<00:05:54.210> this<00:05:54.330> gate<00:05:54.600> right

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
these gates for instance this gate right

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.900 
these gates for instance this gate right
here<00:05:54.810> is<00:05:55.110> reversed

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
here is reversed

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.810 
here is reversed
this<00:05:56.910> one<00:05:57.120> right<00:05:57.270> here<00:05:57.330> next<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:57.960> it<00:05:58.490> is<00:05:59.490> one

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
this one right here next to it is one

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.900 
this one right here next to it is one
two<00:06:00.090> this<00:06:01.020> one's<00:06:01.260> three<00:06:01.320> four<00:06:01.770> and<00:06:02.610> this<00:06:02.730> one

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
two this one's three four and this one

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.600 
two this one's three four and this one
right<00:06:02.970> here<00:06:03.180> is<00:06:03.390> five<00:06:03.930> six<00:06:04.290> what<00:06:05.220> you<00:06:05.340> can<00:06:05.460> see

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
right here is five six what you can see

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.130 
right here is five six what you can see
right<00:06:05.790> here<00:06:06.030> is<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.240> three<00:06:06.630> four<00:06:08.750> so<00:06:09.750> we<00:06:09.840> spin

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
right here is the three four so we spin

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.530 
right here is the three four so we spin
the<00:06:10.290> input<00:06:10.620> shaft<00:06:11.000> and<00:06:12.000> you<00:06:12.090> want<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.300> see<00:06:12.419> how

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
the input shaft and you want to see how

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.850 
the input shaft and you want to see how
it<00:06:12.660> works<00:06:12.980> basically<00:06:15.320> just<00:06:16.320> moves<00:06:16.620> this

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
it works basically just moves this

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
it works basically just moves this
collar<00:06:17.190> which<00:06:17.580> engages<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.510> shaft<00:06:18.840> itself

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
collar which engages the shaft itself

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.330 
collar which engages the shaft itself
into<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:21.000> gear<00:06:21.710> so<00:06:22.710> you<00:06:22.770> don't<00:06:22.979> shift<00:06:23.220> the

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
into the gear so you don't shift the

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.170 
into the gear so you don't shift the
gears<00:06:24.260> you're<00:06:25.260> engaging<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:26.400> gears<00:06:26.669> with<00:06:27.150> a

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
gears you're engaging the gears with a

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.659 
gears you're engaging the gears with a
collar<00:06:27.860> so<00:06:28.860> these<00:06:28.979> are<00:06:29.160> the<00:06:29.220> synchronizer

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
collar so these are the synchronizer

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.000 
collar so these are the synchronizer
rings<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.150> updated<00:06:30.600> ones<00:06:30.810> and<00:06:31.080> these<00:06:31.800> are<00:06:31.919> the

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
rings the updated ones and these are the

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.110 
rings the updated ones and these are the
little<00:06:32.100> frictions<00:06:32.610> that<00:06:32.729> allow<00:06:32.850> you<00:06:32.910> to<00:06:33.060> shift

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
little frictions that allow you to shift

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.850 
little frictions that allow you to shift
smooth<00:06:33.630> so<00:06:33.840> when<00:06:33.990> these<00:06:34.110> wear<00:06:34.410> that's<00:06:34.710> what

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
smooth so when these wear that's what

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.140 
smooth so when these wear that's what
makes<00:06:35.040> your<00:06:35.190> car<00:06:35.370> crunch

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.310 

here's<00:06:39.150> fifth<00:06:39.419> and<00:06:39.570> sixth<00:06:39.840> gear<00:06:39.960> at<00:06:40.050> the<00:06:40.110> rear

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
here's fifth and sixth gear at the rear

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.230 
here's fifth and sixth gear at the rear
of<00:06:40.350> the<00:06:40.440> transmission<00:06:41.070> as<00:06:41.520> I'm<00:06:41.729> turning<00:06:42.120> it

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
of the transmission as I'm turning it

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.210 
of the transmission as I'm turning it
helps<00:06:42.660> engage<00:06:42.930> it<00:06:43.880> see<00:06:44.880> I<00:06:44.910> grab<00:06:45.240> a<00:06:45.270> gear<00:06:45.630> and

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
helps engage it see I grab a gear and

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.760 
helps engage it see I grab a gear and
I'll<00:06:47.220> go<00:06:47.400> the<00:06:47.520> other<00:06:47.640> way<00:06:47.760> and<00:06:51.260> that's<00:06:52.260> the<00:06:52.560> two

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
I'll go the other way and that's the two

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.260 
I'll go the other way and that's the two
four<00:06:52.979> fifth<00:06:53.190> and<00:06:53.370> six<00:06:53.610> so<00:06:53.850> that's<00:06:54.000> how<00:06:54.150> it

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
four fifth and six so that's how it

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.409 
four fifth and six so that's how it
works<00:06:54.479> and<00:06:54.810> then<00:06:55.710> what<00:06:56.220> you<00:06:56.340> feel<00:06:56.729> when<00:06:57.270> you

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 
works and then what you feel when you

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:58.909 
works and then what you feel when you
feel<00:06:57.660> it<00:06:57.780> click<00:06:57.990> when<00:06:58.260> it<00:06:58.350> goes<00:06:58.500> in<00:06:58.650> gears

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
feel it click when it goes in gears

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.860 
feel it click when it goes in gears
there's<00:06:59.669> actually<00:06:59.970> these<00:07:00.060> little<00:07:00.120> detents

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
there's actually these little detents

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.400 
there's actually these little detents
little<00:07:01.650> spring-loaded<00:07:02.250> balls<00:07:03.050> right<00:07:04.050> behind

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
little spring-loaded balls right behind

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.590 
little spring-loaded balls right behind
it<00:07:04.590> and<00:07:04.770> these<00:07:05.460> go<00:07:05.669> in<00:07:05.789> here<00:07:06.060> and<00:07:06.180> sit<00:07:06.419> and

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
it and these go in here and sit and

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.170 
it and these go in here and sit and
little<00:07:06.810> there's<00:07:07.320> little<00:07:07.530> divots<00:07:08.010> for<00:07:08.760> all<00:07:08.880> the

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
little there's little divots for all the

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.029 
little there's little divots for all the
shift<00:07:09.419> all<00:07:09.630> these<00:07:09.810> shift<00:07:10.380> shafts<00:07:10.650> for<00:07:10.860> all<00:07:10.950> the

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
shift all these shift shafts for all the

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.219 
shift all these shift shafts for all the
gears<00:07:11.310> there's<00:07:12.060> two<00:07:12.240> holes<00:07:12.450> here<00:07:12.570> there's<00:07:13.080> two

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
gears there's two holes here there's two

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.200 
gears there's two holes here there's two
here<00:07:13.500> so<00:07:14.100> this<00:07:14.250> is<00:07:14.430> what<00:07:14.550> you<00:07:14.640> feel<00:07:14.880> the<00:07:15.060> actual

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
here so this is what you feel the actual

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.750 
here so this is what you feel the actual
spring<00:07:15.660> tension<00:07:16.020> of<00:07:16.110> this<00:07:16.200> ball<00:07:16.560> hitting<00:07:17.490> a

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.760 
spring tension of this ball hitting a

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.810 
spring tension of this ball hitting a
tiny<00:07:18.030> little<00:07:18.270> ramp<00:07:18.600> inside<00:07:19.400> so<00:07:20.400> that's<00:07:20.550> what

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820 
tiny little ramp inside so that's what

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.460 
tiny little ramp inside so that's what
you<00:07:20.940> everybody<00:07:21.330> thinks<00:07:21.690> is<00:07:21.810> the<00:07:21.900> notch<00:07:22.080> enos

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
you everybody thinks is the notch enos

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.520 
you everybody thinks is the notch enos
this<00:07:23.400> spring<00:07:23.820> tension<00:07:24.270> is<00:07:24.360> why<00:07:24.479> the<00:07:24.539> B<00:07:25.020> 5s

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
this spring tension is why the B 5s

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.520 
this spring tension is why the B 5s
force<00:07:25.940> six<00:07:26.940> speeds<00:07:27.180> feel<00:07:27.419> so<00:07:27.690> not<00:07:28.110> you<00:07:28.289> so<00:07:28.470> to

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530 
force six speeds feel so not you so to

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.260 
force six speeds feel so not you so to
speak<00:07:28.890> these<00:07:29.400> are<00:07:29.520> really<00:07:29.700> stiff<00:07:29.910> Springs

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270 
speak these are really stiff Springs

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.559 
speak these are really stiff Springs
versus<00:07:30.690> other<00:07:30.900> versions

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:33.569
