Milan Juke which about panoramic

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.370 
Milan Juke which about panoramic
photography<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:32.880> loved<00:00:33.149> his<00:00:33.930> workshop

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
photography I really loved his workshop

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.830 
photography I really loved his workshop
and<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.010> great<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.120> learned<00:00:36.570> few

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and was really great and I learned few

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.250 
and was really great and I learned few
tricks<00:00:37.910> it's<00:00:38.910> not<00:00:39.059> even<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> week<00:00:39.540> after<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
tricks it's not even a week after and I

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.080 
tricks it's not even a week after and I
have<00:00:40.440> already<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> equipment<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
have already all the equipment and I

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
have already all the equipment and I
want<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.450> share<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.680> some<00:00:44.070> good

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
want to share with you some some good

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.119 
want to share with you some some good
stuff<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.210> basically<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.829> biggest

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
stuff so basically you know the biggest

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
stuff so basically you know the biggest
trick<00:00:47.430> about<00:00:48.680> both<00:00:49.680> panoramic<00:00:50.870> photography

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
trick about both panoramic photography

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.029 
trick about both panoramic photography
is<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> parallax<00:00:53.329> basically<00:00:54.329> when<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.039> when

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
is a parallax basically when you when

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
is a parallax basically when you when
you<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> camera<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> tripod<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.260> when

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you have a camera on the tripod and when

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.779 
you have a camera on the tripod and when
you<00:00:58.649> turn<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.280> around

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you turn it around

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.270 
you turn it around
actually<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.690> axis<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.160> your

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
actually the axis is on the back of your

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
actually the axis is on the back of your
camera<00:01:02.489> which<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.690> good<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
camera which is not good because the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
camera which is not good because the
parallax<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.339> strict<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:06.030> show

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
parallax is really strict I will show

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.350 
parallax is really strict I will show
you<00:01:06.210> later<00:01:06.860> what<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> need<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.970> set

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you later what you need to do is to set

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.109 
you later what you need to do is to set
back<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.930> camera<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.520> why<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> bought

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
back your camera and that's why I bought

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.080 
back your camera and that's why I bought
this<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.380> baby<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:15.799> its<00:01:16.799> head<00:01:17.090> panorama

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
this this baby it's its head panorama

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.010 
this this baby it's its head panorama
it's<00:01:18.360> money

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it's money

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:36.080 
it's money
proto<00:01:20.750> 303<00:01:21.750> plus<00:01:32.450> okay<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.549> this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
proto 303 plus okay so this is you this

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.020 
proto 303 plus okay so this is you this
is<00:01:36.150> how<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> usually<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:37.070> basically<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.549> axis

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
is how it usually is basically the axis

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.050 
is how it usually is basically the axis
is<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> back<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> camera<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.850> now

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
is on on the back of the camera but now

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.120 
is on on the back of the camera but now
when<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.780> turn<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> around<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.799> it's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
when you turn it around it's not it's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.969 
when you turn it around it's not it's
it's<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.149> cool<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.680> nodal

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
it's it's not cool it's not it the nodal

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.289 
it's it's not cool it's not it the nodal
point<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.340> actually<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> middle<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
point is actually in the middle of the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.999 
point is actually in the middle of the
lens<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.430> head<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.939> can

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
lens so with this with this head I can

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.490 
lens so with this with this head I can
move<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.189> backwards<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:55.790> that's<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
move it backwards and that's it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.730 
move it backwards and that's it
really<00:01:59.130> cool<00:01:59.310> angles<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.480> has<00:02:01.050> also<00:02:01.290> degrees

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
really cool angles and has also degrees

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
really cool angles and has also degrees
as<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.730> hear<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> when<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.360> move<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
as you can hear it so when you move it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.780 
as you can hear it so when you move it
around<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.500> know<00:02:07.710> exactly<00:02:08.130> how<00:02:08.400> many<00:02:08.460> degrees

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
around you know exactly how many degrees

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.090 
around you know exactly how many degrees
did<00:02:09.150> you<00:02:09.270> move<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:10.170> most<00:02:10.350> easiest<00:02:10.650> way<00:02:10.920> how

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
did you move it the most easiest way how

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.100 
did you move it the most easiest way how
to<00:02:11.130> establish<00:02:11.640> where<00:02:11.880> your<00:02:12.150> normal<00:02:12.540> point<00:02:12.810> of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to establish where your normal point of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.280 
to establish where your normal point of
your<00:02:13.590> lens<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.450> following<00:02:15.690> basically

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
your lens is is the following basically

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.430 
your lens is is the following basically
you<00:02:16.410> put<00:02:16.590> your<00:02:16.770> two<00:02:17.040> tripods<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> back<00:02:17.910> and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
you put your two tripods in the back and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.280 
you put your two tripods in the back and
then<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.760> now<00:02:20.940> now<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.510> camera<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:21.900> said<00:02:22.260> that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
then and now now the camera is said that

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.220 
then and now now the camera is said that
the<00:02:22.740> nodal<00:02:23.070> point<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.820> on<00:02:24.450> behind<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.020> camera

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the nodal point is on behind the camera

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.110 
the nodal point is on behind the camera
it's<00:02:25.830> not<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> middle<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.700> lens<00:02:26.880> so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
it's not on the middle of the lens so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.460 
it's not on the middle of the lens so
when<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.050> shift<00:02:29.780> your<00:02:30.780> shift<00:02:31.110> when<00:02:31.410> you

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
when you shift your shift when you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.350 
when you shift your shift when you
change<00:02:31.770> your<00:02:31.950> perspective<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.880> see<00:02:32.910> that

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
change your perspective you can see that

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.810 
change your perspective you can see that
there<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:34.100> parallax<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:36.300> um<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.530> what<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.640> do

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
there is parallax so um and what I do

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.470 
there is parallax so um and what I do
with<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:39.840> head<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.190> move<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.730> back<00:02:41.760> back

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
with this head I just move it back back

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.580 
with this head I just move it back back
back<00:02:42.510> back<00:02:42.750> back<00:02:42.960> back

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
back back back back

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.270 
back back back back
so<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.400> nodal<00:02:45.000> point<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> middle<00:02:45.900> so

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
so the nodal point is in the middle so

00:02:46.280 --> 00:03:06.940 
so the nodal point is in the middle so
let's<00:02:47.280> see

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.339 

that's<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.099> that's<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.849> trick<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.930> I

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
that's it that's the trick that I

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.030 
that's it that's the trick that I
learned<00:03:10.530> last<00:03:11.519> week<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:13.019> photo<00:03:13.260> days<00:03:13.499> on

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
people work two farmers working just the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.879 
people work two farmers working just the
field<00:04:11.250> beside<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.019> asked<00:04:13.259> them<00:04:13.409> to<00:04:13.470> take<00:04:13.739> up

me for this portrait and then I've done
picture<00:04:21.019> left<00:04:23.000> three<00:04:24.000> four<00:04:24.419> pictures<00:04:24.659> on<00:04:24.930> the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
picture left three four pictures on the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.820 
picture left three four pictures on the
left<00:04:25.199> and<00:04:25.440> then<00:04:25.560> on<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.800> right<00:04:26.009> as<00:04:26.220> well<00:04:27.830> then

left and then on the right as well then

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.870 
left and then on the right as well then
I<00:04:28.860> stitch<00:04:29.310> them<00:04:29.340> together<00:04:29.729> into<00:04:31.190> this<00:04:32.190> image<00:04:32.610> I

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
I stitch them together into this image I

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.010 
I stitch them together into this image I
mean<00:04:33.599> it's<00:04:33.750> huge<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.289> see<00:04:34.550> 28,000<00:04:35.550> by<00:04:36.020> 4200

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020

bad<00:05:16.660> example<00:05:16.840> of<00:05:17.410> stitching<00:05:18.280> with<00:05:18.670> parallax

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.070 

see<00:05:25.480> this<00:05:25.930> is<00:05:26.050> actually<00:05:26.260> only<00:05:26.980> two<00:05:27.460> images

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
see this is actually only two images

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.590 
see this is actually only two images
merged<00:05:29.080> together<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:30.060> from<00:05:31.060> far<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.450> can

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
merged together and from far you can

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.960 
merged together and from far you can
tell<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:32.170> can<00:05:32.200> you<00:05:32.650> would<00:05:32.800> say<00:05:33.010> it's<00:05:33.220> nice<00:05:33.490> but

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
tell you can you would say it's nice but

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.970 
tell you can you would say it's nice but
you<00:05:34.150> know<00:05:34.210> if<00:05:34.570> you<00:05:34.750> large<00:05:35.200> it<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.560> can<00:05:35.740> see

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
you know if you large it you can see

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.490 
you know if you large it you can see
that<00:05:36.250> I<00:05:36.460> was<00:05:37.020> Photoshop<00:05:38.020> couldn't<00:05:38.320> merge

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
that I was Photoshop couldn't merge

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.100 
that I was Photoshop couldn't merge
those<00:05:38.860> two<00:05:39.070> images<00:05:39.430> together<00:05:39.960> parallax<00:05:40.960> was

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
those two images together parallax was

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.100 
those two images together parallax was
too<00:05:41.320> big<00:05:41.530> so<00:05:42.130> that's<00:05:42.310> why<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:42.520> used<00:05:43.000> I<00:05:43.390> try<00:05:43.870> to<00:05:43.930> do

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
too big so that's why I used I try to do

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.410 
too big so that's why I used I try to do
it<00:05:44.230> manually<00:05:44.560> but<00:05:44.950> you<00:05:45.160> know<00:05:45.280> it<00:05:45.730> is<00:05:45.940> as<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.270> is

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
it manually but you know it is as it is

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.710 
it manually but you know it is as it is
it's<00:05:47.140> not<00:05:47.350> really<00:05:47.620> good<00:05:47.800> actually<00:05:48.010> so<00:05:48.540> this<00:05:49.540> is

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
it's not really good actually so this is

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.020 
it's not really good actually so this is
these<00:05:49.810> are<00:05:49.990> two<00:05:50.440> into<00:05:50.980> two<00:05:51.340> examples<00:05:51.850> of

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
these are two into two examples of

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.270 
these are two into two examples of
