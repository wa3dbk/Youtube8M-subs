it's<00:00:20.730> tend<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:22.529> way<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.519> clean<00:00:24.210> my

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it's tend the way to do that I clean my

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.870 
it's tend the way to do that I clean my
tip<00:00:24.630> by<00:00:24.750> using<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.170> scouring<00:00:25.500> pad<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.430> do<00:00:26.550> that

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
tip by using a scouring pad I do that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.870 
tip by using a scouring pad I do that
between<00:00:27.150> every<00:00:27.990> solder<00:00:28.439> joint<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.160> use<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
between every solder joint I use a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420 
between every solder joint I use a
scouring<00:00:30.269> pad<00:00:30.480> as<00:00:30.960> opposed<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.980> know<00:00:32.009> wet

your<00:00:40.200> tip<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.219> take<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.399> solder<00:00:42.050> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
your tip you can just take your solder I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.979 
your tip you can just take your solder I
use<00:00:43.680> point<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.160> 3<00:00:44.430> 1<00:00:44.579> diameter<00:00:45.000> solder<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
use point at 3 1 diameter solder which I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.400 
use point at 3 1 diameter solder which I
find<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.320> easiest<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.930> as<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
find to be easiest and as you see the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.510 
find to be easiest and as you see the
smoke<00:00:49.710> that's<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> flux<00:00:50.460> burning<00:00:50.910> off<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:52.520> roll

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
smoke that's the flux burning off I roll

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.729 
smoke that's the flux burning off I roll
that<00:00:53.730> around<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.420> go<00:00:54.809> ahead<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.230> clean<00:00:55.469> that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that around I go ahead and clean that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.430 
that around I go ahead and clean that
with<00:00:56.309> my<00:00:56.489> scouring<00:00:56.910> pad<00:00:58.730> and<00:01:00.020> it<00:01:01.020> reveals<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
with my scouring pad and it reveals a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.080 
with my scouring pad and it reveals a
nice<00:01:01.620> shiny<00:01:01.920> tip<00:01:02.280> by<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> way<00:01:02.789> I've<00:01:02.940> been

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
nice shiny tip by the way I've been

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
nice shiny tip by the way I've been
using<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.570> same<00:01:03.899> tip<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.710> probably<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
using the same tip now for probably a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.429 
using the same tip now for probably a
year<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> half<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.350> imagine

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
year and a half and as you can imagine

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
year and a half and as you can imagine
I've<00:01:07.799> used<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.790> quite<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> few<00:01:09.210> projects<00:01:11.479> so

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
I've used it on quite a few projects so

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.270 
I've used it on quite a few projects so
that<00:01:12.869> comes<00:01:13.409> from<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.830> setting<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that comes from not setting the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.469 
that comes from not setting the
temperature<00:01:14.580> too<00:01:14.939> high<00:01:16.430> now<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.180> clean

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
temperature too high now when I clean

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.200 
temperature too high now when I clean
the<00:01:18.630> tip<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.009> flux<00:01:20.820> springing

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the tip and you see the flux springing

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.929 
the tip and you see the flux springing
off<00:01:21.360> also<00:01:22.080> keep<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.560> mind<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.890> flux<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.670> what

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
off also keep in mind that flux is what

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.149 
off also keep in mind that flux is what
makes<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> solder<00:01:25.259> stick<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.830> gives<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
makes the solder stick and gives you a

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.190 
makes the solder stick and gives you a
good<00:01:26.400> solid<00:01:26.729> joint<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.330> opposed<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.869> cold

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
good solid joint as opposed to a cold

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.640 
good solid joint as opposed to a cold
joint<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:30.240> idea<00:01:30.689> when<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.110> solder<00:01:31.380> your

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
joint so the idea when you solder your

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.940 
joint so the idea when you solder your
joints<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.030> make<00:01:33.210> sure<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:34.740> you're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
joints is to make sure that you're

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.010 
joints is to make sure that you're
touching<00:01:35.400> both<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.180> lead<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.790> joint

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
touching both the lead and the joint

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.389 
touching both the lead and the joint
with<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.049> solder<00:01:40.920> tip<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:41.939> touch<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
with your solder tip and then touch the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.620 
with your solder tip and then touch the
solder<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.470> joint<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.549> lead<00:01:47.790> not

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
solder to the joint and the lead not

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.310 
solder to the joint and the lead not
your<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.890> your<00:01:50.070> solder<00:01:50.310> tip<00:01:50.579> itself<00:01:51.320> because

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
your just your solder tip itself because

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.690 
your just your solder tip itself because
what<00:01:52.470> you'll<00:01:52.649> end<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.829> doing<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.220> burning<00:01:53.399> off

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
what you'll end up doing is burning off

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.030 
what you'll end up doing is burning off
the<00:01:53.850> flux<00:01:54.149> which<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.810> makes<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.649> stick<00:01:55.920> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the flux which is what makes it stick to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.719 
the flux which is what makes it stick to
the<00:01:56.159> joint<00:01:56.460> let<00:01:56.909> me<00:01:57.030> give<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> an<00:01:57.360> example<00:01:58.729> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the joint let me give you an example the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.310 
the joint let me give you an example the
next<00:02:00.030> component<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.649> this
