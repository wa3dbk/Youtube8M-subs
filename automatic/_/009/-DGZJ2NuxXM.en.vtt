00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 the guy is ugly the thing is nintendo still 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.389
 Do not be told that they are very 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.219
 damage caused by the river that did not 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.630
 very well also the question of the president 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 is earning half the value was 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.590
 reduced by 20% and 30% of the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.160
 employees 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.970
 now comes another that made the drug there 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.099
 in Belgium a drug called nintendo and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.040
 It is white and has the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.910
 nintendo in the face drug imagine what thing 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.750
 terrible 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.360
 looks that alone is through common put 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.160
 known names in the famous drugs by 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.789
 two reasons first that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.379
 worry because it's you that's not who 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.110
 creates the drug does not have to worry 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.449
 with corals because very much love of crime 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.059
 informal and has no way of knowing who 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.420
 who created it and also something else because 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.000
 helps the law not to identify you 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.920
 're talking about drugs sometimes if someone 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.449
 said the cell is being monitored 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.549
 You can talk, I do not understand that you put it in the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.080
 nintendo internet that person will not 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.110
 That's the function of the drug you're talking about. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.790
 of the video game that tense is not very tense to 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.830
 nintendo has to go through this said 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.799
 not his own already has many of these 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.900
 ready to worry and now comes this more 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.689
 property this drug is more or less 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 similar to ecstasy interned drug 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.590
 I do not know exactly what makes it much more 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.390
 beauty the level of quality 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.119
 so we really expect the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.860
 nintendo this crisis for having 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.549
 so much talking badly and simply 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.409
 they throw something or are 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.259
 a very creative way that are very 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.450
 creatives to get around all this has 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.759
 some rumor we've already talked about new 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.869
 consoles a new console of nintendo more 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.390
 nothing confirmed 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.509
 We talk about this with you more 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.509
