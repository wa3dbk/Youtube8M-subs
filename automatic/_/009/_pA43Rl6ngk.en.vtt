night<00:04:37.660> Gracie<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:40.060> don't<00:04:40.720> know<00:04:40.870> if<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:41.110> GV<00:04:41.410> did

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
night Gracie so I don't know if a GV did

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.270 
night Gracie so I don't know if a GV did
this<00:04:41.680> on<00:04:41.890> purpose<00:04:42.300> but<00:04:43.300> i<00:04:43.690> would<00:04:44.500> expect<00:04:44.920> they

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
this on purpose but i would expect they

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.060 
this on purpose but i would expect they
had<00:04:45.760> some<00:04:46.000> thought<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.420> it<00:04:46.570> this<00:04:47.530> acts<00:04:47.800> as<00:04:47.920> a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
had some thought of it this acts as a

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.730 
had some thought of it this acts as a
huge<00:04:48.730> crumple<00:04:49.150> zone<00:04:49.360> you've<00:04:50.050> got<00:04:50.260> an<00:04:50.410> extra

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
huge crumple zone you've got an extra

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.280 
huge crumple zone you've got an extra
probably<00:04:51.150> half<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.570> a<00:04:52.600> quarter<00:04:52.900> inch<00:04:53.260> of<00:04:53.880> crush

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
probably half to a quarter inch of crush

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.530 
probably half to a quarter inch of crush
before<00:04:56.290> you<00:04:56.440> start<00:04:56.880> getting<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.150> rapid

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
before you start getting the rapid

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.170 
before you start getting the rapid
deceleration<00:04:58.690> zone<00:04:59.410> your<00:04:59.650> helmet<00:05:00.180> allows

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
deceleration zone your helmet allows

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.930 
deceleration zone your helmet allows
your<00:05:01.480> helmet<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.020> decelerate<00:05:02.860> somewhat<00:05:03.610> more

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
your helmet to decelerate somewhat more

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.570 
your helmet to decelerate somewhat more
than<00:05:04.750> your<00:05:05.140> standard<00:05:05.440> helmet<00:05:06.010> where<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.370> have

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
than your standard helmet where you have

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.870 
than your standard helmet where you have
less<00:05:07.480> area<00:05:07.750> of<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.020> helmet<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.410> crush<00:05:08.650> in<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.580> I

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
less area of the helmet to crush in so I

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.360 
less area of the helmet to crush in so I
think<00:05:10.210> it's<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.360> good<00:05:10.450> idea<00:05:10.600> I<00:05:11.050> like<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:11.980> I<00:05:12.130> feel

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
think it's a good idea I like it I feel

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.520 
think it's a good idea I like it I feel
very<00:05:12.490> safe<00:05:12.730> in<00:05:12.940> his<00:05:13.030> helmet<00:05:13.240> this<00:05:14.230> is<00:05:14.350> rich

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
very safe in his helmet this is rich

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.460 
very safe in his helmet this is rich
