coming that aside what this does is not

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.370 
coming that aside what this does is not
so<00:00:35.940> different<00:00:36.180> than<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:36.870> steward<00:00:37.230> has

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
so different than what steward has

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.190 
so different than what steward has
happened<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.800> mention<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.239> designed<00:00:39.780> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
happened to mention this is designed to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.250 
happened to mention this is designed to
you<00:00:40.320> give<00:00:40.649> dual<00:00:41.640> toning<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.050> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you give dual toning so with that you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.580 
you give dual toning so with that you
can<00:00:43.469> split<00:00:43.860> 100<00:00:44.640> watts<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:46.020> 100

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
can split 100 watts so you can have 100

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.160 
can split 100 watts so you can have 100
watts<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.129> tone<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.610> another<00:00:48.329> 100<00:00:48.960> watts

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
watts of one tone and another 100 watts

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.380 
watts of one tone and another 100 watts
of<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.559> secondary<00:00:50.100> tone<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.730> maximum

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
of a secondary tone so maximum

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.959 
of a secondary tone so maximum
attention-grabbing<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.640> addition<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
attention-grabbing in addition to that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.650 
attention-grabbing in addition to that
it<00:00:54.480> gives<00:00:55.020> low<00:00:55.680> frequency<00:00:56.430> siren<00:00:57.120> tones<00:00:57.390> as

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it gives low frequency siren tones as

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.139 
it gives low frequency siren tones as
well<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.469> not<00:00:58.680> only<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.730> ability

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
well so not only do you have the ability

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.720 
well so not only do you have the ability
to<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.600> tones<00:01:00.930> audibly<00:01:01.649> heard<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.520> can

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
to have tones audibly heard you can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.090 
to have tones audibly heard you can
actually<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.449> folks<00:01:03.840> feel<00:01:04.320> siren<00:01:04.830> tones

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
actually have folks feel siren tones

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.850 
actually have folks feel siren tones
through<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.909> low<00:01:06.090> frequency<00:01:06.689> pulsation<00:01:07.590> for

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
through the low frequency pulsation for

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.820 
through the low frequency pulsation for
the<00:01:07.920> dual<00:01:08.070> amp<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:09.030> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.530> its

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the dual amp you got kind of it is its

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.850 
the dual amp you got kind of it is its
dual<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.760> dual<00:01:12.240> tone<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.780> dual<00:01:13.500> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
dual in dual tone and dual in

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
functionality with normal tones and low

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.840 
functionality with normal tones and low
frequency<00:01:16.590> tones<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.130> said<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.549> would<00:01:17.670> work

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
frequency tones you said it would work

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.070 
frequency tones you said it would work
with<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.060> variety<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.420> different<00:01:18.540> amplifiers

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
with a variety of different amplifiers

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
with a variety of different amplifiers
it<00:01:19.320> will<00:01:19.590> work<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> variety<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.970> different

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it will work with a variety of different

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960 
it will work with a variety of different
units<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.340> team<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.790> up

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
units so you don't have to team this up

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.320 
units so you don't have to team this up
with<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.869> code<00:01:25.409> three<00:01:25.799> specific<00:01:26.340> siren

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
with a code three specific siren

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.539 
with a code three specific siren
amplifier<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.320> team<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.130> other

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
amplifier you can team it up with other

harnesses<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.299> are<00:02:03.630> included<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.170> well<00:02:04.380> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
harnesses that are included as well so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.620 
harnesses that are included as well so
you<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> main<00:02:05.490> ground<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.479> lead

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
you have a main ground and lead

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.749 
you have a main ground and lead
connection<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.290> then<00:02:07.619> an<00:02:07.740> accessory<00:02:08.280> harness

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
connection and then an accessory harness

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.580 
connection and then an accessory harness
as<00:02:08.940> well<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.690> will<00:02:09.810> branch<00:02:10.080> off<00:02:10.319> as

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
as well that will branch off as

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.000 
as well that will branch off as
specified<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> install<00:02:12.030> guide

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
specified in the install guide

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.250 
specified in the install guide
so<00:02:14.010> there<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.190> have<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.970> code<00:02:15.960> three

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
so there you have it the code three

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.880 
so there you have it the code three
banshee<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.470> whaler<00:02:21.680> let's<00:02:22.680> take<00:02:22.860> down
