PFS brand of software and it's the one

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
PFS brand of software and it's the one
that's<00:00:48.719> been<00:00:48.930> very<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.350> popular<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that's been very very popular on the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
Apple to line and we think the new

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
Apple to line and we think the new
technology<00:00:51.780> represented<00:00:52.289> by<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> mac<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
technology represented by the mac is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.750 
technology represented by the mac is
going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> very<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.430> big<00:00:53.670> opportunity

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
going to be a very very big opportunity

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.660 
going to be a very very big opportunity
for<00:00:54.239> us<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:55.129> certainly<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.280> very<00:00:56.460> excited

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
for us so we certainly are very excited

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.790 
for us so we certainly are very excited

and the reason that I'm interested in it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.280 
and the reason that I'm interested in it
personally<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.700> much<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.970> same<00:01:06.000> reason<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
personally is much the same reason that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410 
personally is much the same reason that
I<00:01:07.350> originally<00:01:07.740> got<00:01:08.010> involved<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> Apple

I originally got involved with the Apple
to<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.920> 1977<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.280> exciting<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.570> new<00:01:12.900> but

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
to in 1977 it's exciting it's new but

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.100 
to in 1977 it's exciting it's new but
beyond<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.750> something

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
beyond that we can really do something

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.520 
beyond that we can really do something
in<00:01:16.530> software<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.759> value<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.869> people<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
in software that's a value to people to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
in software that's a value to people to
lots<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.009> lots<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.340> people<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.030> simply

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
lots and lots of people that we simply

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
lots and lots of people that we simply
couldn't<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.810> before<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.650> technology<00:01:23.460> that's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
couldn't do before the technology that's

couldn't do before the technology that's
in<00:01:24.000> McIntosh<00:01:24.509> makes<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> possible<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:26.280> think

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
in McIntosh makes it possible we think

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.749 
in McIntosh makes it possible we think
for<00:01:26.610> us<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.240> move<00:01:27.990> ahead<00:01:28.340> move<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> state<00:01:29.729> of

the art ahead in software and that's

the art ahead in software and that's
what's<00:01:32.250> exciting<00:01:32.369> that's<00:01:32.850> why<00:01:33.060> we're<00:01:33.270> in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
what's exciting that's why we're in
