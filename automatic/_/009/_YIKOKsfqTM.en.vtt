not how in a game which is we give you
very<00:00:44.460> simple<00:00:44.850> objectives<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.230> tell<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
very simple objectives we don't tell you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.009 
very simple objectives we don't tell you
how<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.680> do<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.149> leave<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.930> to

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
how to do it we really leave that up to

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.540 
how to do it we really leave that up to
your<00:00:49.079> imagination<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.829> try<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.100> build<00:00:50.339> on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
your imagination and try and build on

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.610 
your imagination and try and build on
our<00:00:50.579> game<00:00:50.909> mechanics<00:00:51.420> such<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:52.440> allow

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
our game mechanics such that they allow

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.380 
our game mechanics such that they allow
you<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.829> fair<00:00:53.070> degree<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.339> creativity<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.269> how

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
you a fair degree of creativity and how

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
you a fair degree of creativity and how
you<00:00:54.449> approach<00:00:54.839> different<00:00:55.199> solutions<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.549> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you approach different solutions so you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
you approach different solutions so you
know<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:56.790> instance<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:58.079> semi

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
know for instance with that that semi

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.719 
know for instance with that that semi
could<00:00:58.589> have<00:00:58.680> dropped<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.280> something<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
could have dropped that on something and

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.610 
could have dropped that on something and
destroyed<00:01:00.089> it

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.020 

so<00:01:05.130> we're<00:01:05.220> heading<00:01:05.460> towards<00:01:05.610> our<00:01:05.850> main

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so we're heading towards our main

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.240 
so we're heading towards our main
objective<00:01:06.180> here

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:21.240 

looking<00:01:10.850> at<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.060> map<00:01:11.240> see<00:01:11.510> where<00:01:11.660> we're<00:01:11.780> at

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.370 

now<00:01:21.760> i'm<00:01:21.880> taking<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.330> we're<00:01:23.020> taking<00:01:23.290> the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
now i'm taking the we're taking the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.380 
now i'm taking the we're taking the
Coweta<00:01:23.710> gunship<00:01:24.280> over<00:01:24.520> here<00:01:24.700> could<00:01:25.300> have

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
Coweta gunship over here could have

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.760 
Coweta gunship over here could have
driven<00:01:25.570> over<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.080> area<00:01:26.260> that<00:01:26.530> we<00:01:26.620> also

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
driven over to this area that we also

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.320 
driven over to this area that we also
have<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:27.040> transit<00:01:27.520> system<00:01:27.850> this<00:01:28.000> time<00:01:28.180> around

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
have a transit system this time around

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.990 
have a transit system this time around
it<00:01:28.630> allows<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.530> players<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:30.040> go<00:01:30.190> instantly

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
it allows the players to go instantly

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.969 
it allows the players to go instantly
from<00:01:31.270> location<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:31.930> location<00:01:32.050> in<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:32.710> world

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
from location to location in the world

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.100 
from location to location in the world
they<00:01:33.729> don't<00:01:33.910> have<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.090> incur<00:01:34.450> long<00:01:34.720> drive

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
they don't have to incur long drive

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.290 
they don't have to incur long drive
times<00:01:35.440> that<00:01:35.770> are<00:01:35.950> commonplace<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.060> open

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
times that are commonplace and open

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.840 
times that are commonplace and open
world<00:01:37.510> game<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:38.020> should<00:01:38.650> it<00:01:38.770> give<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.790> a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
world game so should it give you a

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:52.000 
world game so should it give you a
gateway<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.540> fight<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.869> lot<00:01:41.050> faster

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.830 

looking<00:01:52.730> at<00:01:52.820> our<00:01:52.910> radar<00:01:53.300> here<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.540> actually

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
looking at our radar here we actually

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.610 
looking at our radar here we actually
see<00:01:53.990> some<00:01:54.170> anti<00:01:54.530> air<00:01:54.770> jamming<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.380> before<00:01:57.380> we

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
see some anti air jamming so before we

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.800 
see some anti air jamming so before we
can<00:01:57.800> call<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.070> any<00:01:58.280> support<00:01:58.760> vehicles<00:01:59.720> we're

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
can call it any support vehicles we're

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.910 
can call it any support vehicles we're
going<00:01:59.930> to<00:01:59.990> have<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.170> take<00:02:00.290> care<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.740> but

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
going to have to take care of that but

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.980 
going to have to take care of that but
looks<00:02:01.100> like<00:02:01.160> a<00:02:01.280> enemy<00:02:02.180> is<00:02:02.270> actually<00:02:02.570> hijacker

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
looks like a enemy is actually hijacker

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.380 
looks like a enemy is actually hijacker
helicopter<00:02:03.650> we're<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.310> hijack<00:02:04.700> at<00:02:04.850> backe's<00:02:05.030> in
