that a little bit and then somewhere a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.899 
that a little bit and then somewhere a
little<00:01:21.780> further<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.830> Mark<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:23.490> inches

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
little further up and Mark two inches

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.910 
little further up and Mark two inches
and<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.780> draw<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> line<00:01:26.210> across<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.750> two<00:01:27.960> dots

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.090 

okay<00:01:33.920> my<00:01:34.190> first<00:01:34.640> cut<00:01:35.090> is<00:01:35.960> going<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.470> be<00:01:36.800> right

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
here and I'm going to cut right to the

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.370 
here and I'm going to cut right to the
line<00:01:39.320> as<00:01:40.190> straight<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.030> can<00:01:41.210> if<00:01:42.050> you're

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
line as straight as you can if you're

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.180 
line as straight as you can if you're
not<00:01:42.800> a<00:01:42.830> straight<00:01:43.340> cutter<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.880> could<00:01:45.160> take<00:01:46.160> a

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
not a straight cutter you could take a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.060 
not a straight cutter you could take a
ruler<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.970> draw<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.870> line<00:01:48.140> before<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.710> cut

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
ruler and draw that line before you cut

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.680 
ruler and draw that line before you cut
it<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:52.460> cut<00:01:52.729> right<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.290> line<00:01:54.470> exactly<00:01:55.690> and

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
it and cut right to the line exactly and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.610 
it and cut right to the line exactly and
then<00:01:57.050> we're<00:01:57.200> going<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.380> fold<00:01:58.510> up<00:01:59.510> onto<00:02:00.470> that

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
then we're going to fold up onto that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.880 
then we're going to fold up onto that
line<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.360> if<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.170> have<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.560> hard

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
line you can if you have a hard

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.199 
line you can if you have a hard
cardstock<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:05.720> can<00:02:05.960> take<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.710> blunt<00:02:07.160> bit<00:02:07.910> of

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
cardstock you can take the blunt bit of

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.940 
cardstock you can take the blunt bit of
the<00:02:08.360> scissor<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.160> run<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.369> along<00:02:11.560> your<00:02:12.560> line

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
the scissor and run it along your line

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.060 
the scissor and run it along your line
and<00:02:13.570> that<00:02:14.570> will<00:02:14.780> help<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:16.209> make<00:02:17.209> your<00:02:17.239> fold

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
and that will help you make your fold

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.670 
and that will help you make your fold
see<00:02:19.070> how<00:02:19.220> nice<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.790> makes<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.360> fold<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:21.500> you

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
see how nice that makes the fold and you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.550 
see how nice that makes the fold and you
fold<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.220> out<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:24.550> okay
