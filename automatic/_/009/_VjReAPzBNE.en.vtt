the racetrack he likes both products he
did<00:02:58.150> note<00:02:58.359> that<00:02:58.390> perhaps<00:02:59.140> there<00:02:59.500> was<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> bit

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
did note that perhaps there was a bit

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.099 
did note that perhaps there was a bit
more<00:03:00.099> attraction<00:03:00.910> from<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:02.379> stomper<00:03:03.220> okay

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
more attraction from the stomper okay

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.479 
more attraction from the stomper okay
not<00:03:05.109> a<00:03:05.140> humongous<00:03:05.739> difference<00:03:05.769> but<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> bit

more traction difference between the two
the<00:03:09.940> tech<00:03:10.209> spec<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.870> little<00:03:11.620> more<00:03:11.739> sublime

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
the tech spec is a little more sublime

reinstalled on the tank up to eight

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.740 
reinstalled on the tank up to eight

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
times that's not something we personally

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.800 
times that's not something we personally
try<00:03:32.019> here<00:03:32.410> but<00:03:33.010> tech<00:03:33.280> spec<00:03:33.519> does<00:03:33.760> may<00:03:34.450> claim<00:03:34.750> to

that<00:03:35.579> installing<00:03:36.579> this<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:38.049> lot<00:03:38.349> easier

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that installing this is a lot easier

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.039 
that installing this is a lot easier
than<00:03:39.040> installing<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.940> stock<00:03:40.480> grip<00:03:40.750> for

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
than installing the stock grip for

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.599 
than installing the stock grip for
obvious<00:03:41.410> reasons<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.859> can't<00:03:42.069> see<00:03:42.280> through<00:03:42.489> it

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
obvious reasons you can't see through it

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.550 
obvious reasons you can't see through it
okay<00:03:43.239> so<00:03:43.299> even<00:03:43.690> if<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:44.019> get<00:03:44.139> a<00:03:44.169> little<00:03:44.290> air

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
okay so even if you do get a little air

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.839 
okay so even if you do get a little air
bubble<00:03:44.859> behind<00:03:45.099> there<00:03:45.280> you're<00:03:45.459> never<00:03:45.609> going

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
bubble behind there you're never going

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.390
