00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
like on all these positions all in one

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.610 
like on all these positions all in one
day<00:04:49.790> that<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.150> would<00:04:50.300> do<00:04:50.450> just<00:04:50.990> straight<00:04:51.350> on

day that you would do just straight on
either<00:04:52.430> seated<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.720> I'll<00:04:53.990> then<00:04:54.200> this

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
either seated and I'll then this

one leg so after you do like press
straight<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:02.330> doing<00:05:02.570> 1520<00:05:03.320> reps<00:05:03.670> you<00:05:04.670> know

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
straight and doing 1520 reps you know

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.530 
straight and doing 1520 reps you know
right<00:05:05.030> into<00:05:05.270> step<00:05:06.200> on<00:05:06.380> up<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.890> block<00:05:07.310> or<00:05:07.640> a<00:05:08.000> step

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
right into step on up a block or a step

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.880 
right into step on up a block or a step
and<00:05:08.840> you're<00:05:09.110> going<00:05:09.290> to<00:05:09.350> be<00:05:09.440> just<00:05:09.470> like<00:05:09.650> this

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
and you're going to be just like this

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.950 
and you're going to be just like this
you<00:05:10.580> call<00:05:10.850> something<00:05:11.120> so<00:05:11.240> you<00:05:11.330> don't<00:05:11.360> lose

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
you call something so you don't lose

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.240 
you call something so you don't lose
your<00:05:12.110> balance<00:05:12.230> and<00:05:12.440> you<00:05:12.530> into<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.800> total<00:05:13.130> raised

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
your balance and you into a total raised

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.300 
your balance and you into a total raised
with<00:05:14.090> one<00:05:14.270> leg<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:15.080> then<00:05:15.560> you<00:05:15.650> come<00:05:15.860> down<00:05:16.070> heel

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
with one leg and then you come down heel

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.350 
with one leg and then you come down heel
down<00:05:16.520> touch<00:05:17.620> toe<00:05:18.620> raised<00:05:18.830> up<00:05:19.010> and<00:05:19.880> it's<00:05:20.150> for

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
down touch toe raised up and it's for

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.700 
down touch toe raised up and it's for
both<00:05:20.510> sides<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:21.080> can<00:05:21.230> do<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.350> same<00:05:21.500> thing

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
both sides so you can do the same thing

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.130 
both sides so you can do the same thing
on<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.830> other<00:05:21.890> side<00:05:22.450> so<00:05:23.450> you<00:05:23.510> try<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:23.810> it's

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
on the other side so you try to it's

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.430 
on the other side so you try to it's
really<00:05:24.230> really<00:05:24.590> hard<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.860> do<00:05:25.570> Electress<00:05:26.570> for

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
really really hard to do Electress for

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.620 
really really hard to do Electress for
15<00:05:27.800> reps<00:05:28.040> and<00:05:28.370> I'm<00:05:28.820> going<00:05:29.000> to<00:05:29.060> do<00:05:29.240> it<00:05:29.330> this<00:05:29.450> by

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
15 reps and I'm going to do it this by

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.090 
15 reps and I'm going to do it this by
10<00:05:29.840> reps<00:05:30.020> you're<00:05:30.140> going<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.320> feel<00:05:30.500> good<00:05:30.860> burn

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
10 reps you're going to feel good burn

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.400 
10 reps you're going to feel good burn
your<00:05:31.610> cap<00:05:31.850> so<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.660> thing<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.020> that<00:05:33.080> when<00:05:33.320> we

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
your cap so the thing is that when we

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.600 
your cap so the thing is that when we
walk<00:05:33.620> we're<00:05:33.770> just<00:05:33.890> walking<00:05:34.100> on<00:05:34.310> a<00:05:34.340> flat

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
walk we're just walking on a flat

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.210 
walk we're just walking on a flat
surface<00:05:34.640> so<00:05:35.090> no<00:05:35.330> more<00:05:35.480> work<00:05:35.720> or<00:05:35.930> cat<00:05:36.200> are<00:05:36.680> not

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
surface so no more work or cat are not

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.160 
surface so no more work or cat are not
meant<00:05:37.460> to<00:05:37.550> go<00:05:37.580> down<00:05:38.420> and<00:05:38.570> get<00:05:38.630> deep<00:05:38.900> stretch

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
meant to go down and get deep stretch

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.230 
meant to go down and get deep stretch
like<00:05:39.350> this<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:40.430> it's<00:05:40.580> very<00:05:40.670> important<00:05:41.060> to<00:05:41.090> get

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
like this so it's very important to get

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.340 
like this so it's very important to get
a<00:05:41.270> deep<00:05:41.480> stretch<00:05:41.660> going<00:05:42.200> down<00:05:42.550> squeeze<00:05:43.550> up

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
a deep stretch going down squeeze up

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.740 
a deep stretch going down squeeze up

motion is clean it up and you cannot do
i<00:05:50.620> would<00:05:51.160> recommend<00:05:51.490> doing<00:05:51.520> an<00:05:51.760> angle<00:05:52.150> like<00:05:52.330> v

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
i would recommend doing an angle like v

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.190 
i would recommend doing an angle like v
