00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.770
 the presentation 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.770
 This is the Maracana 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.110
 give it a look 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.680

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.790
 group phase be attentive 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.520
 We are in the maracana stadium of 150 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.729
 and you need to have the largest stadium 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.980
 now they have according to Brazilians the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.400
 maracana 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.830
 and 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.830
 known before I saw this now 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:33.189
 with an open mouth 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.189
 Brazil was playing in front 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.440
 we are going to an intro of a brazil-colombia 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.500
 people improve the importance of the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.900
 bars plus it's more now with the 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.040
 world 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.040
 anthem of colombia 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.860
 to cover all the South American teams 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.860
 from literally 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.319
 could not be bigger 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.890
 there are many expectations to see 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.540
 this brazil I had a 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.540
 let's say lend for dollar 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.709
 hoping for the best of this selection 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.459
 presenting randomly 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.459
 necessarily each country 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.670
 in the 90s and they can hit 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.790
 is that step that maybe 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.620
 they were expected in 90 to give and not 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.450
 they could get me I think now what 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.159
 they can get there because they have 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.930
 come out new litter of players 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.569
 important players 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.920
 He left us until the next video 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.579
 we continue to know the stadiums of the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.579
