of how it works so first let me just
touch<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.000> why<00:00:21.300> I've<00:00:21.830> eventually<00:00:22.830> moved<00:00:23.070> all

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
touch on why I've eventually moved all

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.790 
touch on why I've eventually moved all
of<00:00:23.340> my<00:00:23.699> blogs<00:00:24.000> away<00:00:24.449> from<00:00:24.689> other<00:00:24.840> hosts<00:00:25.350> like

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
of my blogs away from other hosts like

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
of my blogs away from other hosts like
hostgator<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.760> page<00:00:27.090> over<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.779> Bluehost<00:00:28.199> um

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
hostgator and I page over to Bluehost um

hostgator and I page over to Bluehost um
the<00:00:28.949> first<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> most<00:00:29.519> important<00:00:30.060> reason<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the first and most important reason is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.170 
the first and most important reason is
that<00:00:30.599> blue<00:00:31.230> host<00:00:31.410> hosting<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.099> really<00:00:32.790> really

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
that blue host hosting is really really

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.450 
that blue host hosting is really really
fast<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> their<00:00:35.010> hosting

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
quad processors and for those of you

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.030 
quad processors and for those of you
that<00:00:42.329> aren't<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.230> internet<00:00:43.620> marketing

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that aren't you know internet marketing

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.330 
that aren't you know internet marketing
nerds<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.730> website<00:00:45.239> geeks<00:00:45.539> all<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.860> means<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
nerds or website geeks all that means is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
nerds or website geeks all that means is
that<00:00:47.399> they're<00:00:47.700> hosting<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.750> fast<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that they're hosting is really fast and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.770 
that they're hosting is really fast and
as<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.890> know<00:00:50.309> people<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> internet<00:00:51.449> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
as you know people on the internet you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
as you know people on the internet you
know<00:00:51.899> they're<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.710> impatient<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.370> don't

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
know they're really impatient they don't

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520 
know they're really impatient they don't
have<00:00:53.760> time<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.360> wait<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.840> your<00:00:54.930> site<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.350> load

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
have time to wait for your site to load

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
have time to wait for your site to load
so<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> slow<00:00:57.180> loading<00:00:57.390> site<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
so if you have a slow loading site it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
so if you have a slow loading site it
just<00:00:58.410> makes<00:00:58.590> your<00:00:58.969> promotion<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.090> your<00:01:00.210> site<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
just makes your promotion of your site a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.439 
just makes your promotion of your site a
lot<00:01:00.539> harder<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.350> also<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.699> search<00:01:03.000> engine

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
lot harder and also for search engine

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.840 
lot harder and also for search engine
optimization<00:01:03.570> purposes<00:01:04.460> google<00:01:05.460> prefers

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
optimization purposes google prefers

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.300 
optimization purposes google prefers
sites<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.479> load<00:01:06.810> faster<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.280> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
sites that load faster and it's one of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
sites that load faster and it's one of
the<00:01:08.460> reasons<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.939> I've<00:01:09.150> found<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.630> my<00:01:09.869> blue

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

quite a bit harder on other hosting
providers<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:16.000> mean<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.860> first<00:02:18.099> one<00:02:18.340> is

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
providers I mean so the first one is

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.000 
providers I mean so the first one is
cloud<00:02:18.790> fair<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.300> cloud<00:02:19.510> fair<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:20.080> called<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
cloud fair the cloud fair is called the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.550 
cloud fair the cloud fair is called the
CDN<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.819> all<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.599> is<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.349> is<00:02:23.500> that

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
CDN and all that is is that is that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.040 
CDN and all that is is that is that
cloud<00:02:24.130> fair<00:02:24.400> works<00:02:24.670> with<00:02:24.819> bluehost<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.810> host

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
cloud fair works with bluehost to host

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.050 
cloud fair works with bluehost to host
some<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.530> your<00:02:26.680> site<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.099> their<00:02:27.310> servers<00:02:27.790> and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
some of your site on their servers and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.180 
some of your site on their servers and
their<00:02:28.480> servers<00:02:28.840> are<00:02:28.989> even<00:02:29.230> faster<00:02:29.590> than<00:02:30.010> blue

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
their servers are even faster than blue

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.339 
their servers are even faster than blue
ho<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:30.640> what<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.209> does<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.810> makes<00:02:31.989> your

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
ho so what that does is it makes your

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.100
