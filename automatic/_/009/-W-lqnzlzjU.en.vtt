00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
this was I think the second time I ever

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.380 
this was I think the second time I ever
I<00:00:28.740> ever<00:00:29.010> used<00:00:29.369> Urgal<00:00:29.760> i<00:00:29.880> don't<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.119> i<00:00:30.150> didn't

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
I ever used Urgal i don't know i didn't

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.030 
I ever used Urgal i don't know i didn't
even<00:00:30.480> know<00:00:30.599> how<00:00:30.840> good<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.170> was<00:00:31.289> until<00:00:31.679> I'd<00:00:31.800> use

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
even know how good it was until I'd use

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.549 
even know how good it was until I'd use
it<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:33.210> was<00:00:33.390> recorded<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:33.899> maybe<00:00:34.230> three

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it and it was recorded about maybe three

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.370 
it and it was recorded about maybe three
or<00:00:35.010> four<00:00:35.309> weeks<00:00:35.399> ago<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.840> before<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
or four weeks ago so this was before the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
or four weeks ago so this was before the
update<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.010> ergo<00:00:38.550> still<00:00:38.879> had<00:00:39.030> strength<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
update and ergo still had strength to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.020 
update and ergo still had strength to
thurs<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> little<00:00:40.680> team<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.850> i

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
thurs a little team over here and i

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
thurs a little team over here and i
think<00:00:42.239> they're<00:00:42.360> probably<00:00:42.540> about<00:00:42.960> tower<00:00:43.260> up

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
think they're probably about tower up

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.250 
think they're probably about tower up
and<00:00:43.680> i<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:43.770> run<00:00:44.489> over<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> crap

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.310 
and i just run over it and I get a crap
