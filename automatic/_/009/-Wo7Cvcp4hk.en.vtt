power to the explosion and of course you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
power to the explosion and of course you
have<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:58.949> opportunities<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.609> kill<00:01:00.030> the

enemy by destruction 2.0 so for the type
of<00:01:06.240> game<00:01:06.630> too<00:01:07.170> large<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.790> enemy

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
of game too large because the enemy

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.920 
of game too large because the enemy
focuses<00:01:09.630> more<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.380> income<00:01:10.740> station<00:01:11.220> CMB

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
focuses more on the income station CMB

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.859

for<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> map<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.830> set<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> camera<00:01:14.520> desert<00:01:14.970> so

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
for the map to set the camera desert so

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.080 
for the map to set the camera desert so
now<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:17.220> these<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.939> you

be behind the enemy and there are two
different<00:01:23.430> ways<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:25.080> how<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:25.950> these

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
different ways and how you can get these

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.609 
different ways and how you can get these
skills<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.060> first<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.600> by<00:01:27.930> planting<00:01:28.439> see

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
skills the first one is by planting see

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.100 
skills the first one is by planting see
force<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.280> every<00:01:29.579> corner<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> bottom

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
force in every corner and at the bottom

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.370 
force in every corner and at the bottom
of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.009> house<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.060> improvisation<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
of the house of the improvisation be of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.730 
of the house of the improvisation be of
course<00:01:35.250> outside<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> house<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.140> after<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
course outside the house and after that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
course outside the house and after that
plan<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.400> pump<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:39.119> away<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:40.049> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
plan the pump and go away and when you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.819 
plan the pump and go away and when you
see<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.710> enemy<00:01:40.860> diffuses<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> bomb

see that the enemy diffuses the bomb

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.520 
see that the enemy diffuses the bomb
detonator<00:01:43.829> sequels<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.869> other<00:01:45.990> way<00:01:46.259> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
detonator sequels and the other way is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.039 
detonator sequels and the other way is
by<00:01:46.920> planting<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.579> force<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.180> any<00:01:48.509> other<00:01:48.689> house

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
by planting see force on any other house

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.460 
by planting see force on any other house
and<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.049> enemies
