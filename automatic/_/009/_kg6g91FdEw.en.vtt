gotta<00:01:14.040> wait<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:15.829> gooseberries<00:01:16.829> to<00:01:17.220> break

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
gotta wait for the gooseberries to break

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.080 
gotta wait for the gooseberries to break
up<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:19.200> must<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.640> dissin<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> Greg<00:01:20.880> quite

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
up and it must be dissin to Greg quite

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.560 
up and it must be dissin to Greg quite
quickly<00:01:21.329> but<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.560> gooseberries<00:01:23.420> take<00:01:24.420> that

quickly but the gooseberries take that

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.320 
quickly but the gooseberries take that
time<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.079> effectively<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> heat<00:01:26.330> causes

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
time and effectively the heat causes

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.530 
time and effectively the heat causes
them<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.479> burst<00:01:27.870> but<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.670> far<00:01:29.790> yet<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.390> go
