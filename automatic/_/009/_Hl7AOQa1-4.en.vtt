120 and not as network is done as well

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.770 
120 and not as network is done as well
so<00:00:14.099> we'll<00:00:14.280> see<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:15.089> he's<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.570> with

so we'll see what he's going to do with

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.460 
so we'll see what he's going to do with
that<00:00:15.960> warm<00:00:16.760> but<00:00:17.760> at<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> moment<00:00:18.470> there's

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
that warm but at the moment there's

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.410 
that warm but at the moment there's
really<00:00:19.650> no<00:00:19.920> no<00:00:20.310> overlords<00:00:20.820> near<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> Terran

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.200 
really no no overlords near the Terran
base<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.810> he's<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.380> able<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
base so he's not going to be able to

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.640 
base so he's not going to be able to
tunnel<00:00:24.210> towards<00:00:24.689> their<00:00:24.810> base<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> again<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
tunnel towards their base and again the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.650 
tunnel towards their base and again the
hooks<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> way<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.580> baiting<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.090> now

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
hooks on the way for the baiting and now

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
hooks on the way for the baiting and now
we<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.170> also<00:00:28.560> discovered<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> way

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
we do have a also discovered on the way

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.640 
we do have a also discovered on the way
plus<00:00:29.640> two<00:00:29.939> more<00:00:30.240> expansions<00:00:30.900> actually<00:00:31.560> got

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
finishing and he's probably just putting

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.750 
finishing and he's probably just putting
this<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:34.950> because<00:00:35.040> they<00:00:35.309> actually<00:00:35.399> died

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
expression goes up at the 12 here and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.359 
expression goes up at the 12 here and
actually<00:01:58.259> what's<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.829> here<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.100> drop

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
oh my goodness it's going to actually

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
oh my goodness it's going to actually
try<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> snipe<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.560> also<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.950> Cameron<00:02:02.280> but

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
try to snipe this also is Cameron but

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.609 
try to snipe this also is Cameron but
there<00:02:02.579> aren't<00:02:02.790> already<00:02:03.060> six<00:02:03.450> ultras<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
there aren't already six ultras on the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.130 
there aren't already six ultras on the
way<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.420> already<00:02:06.630> built<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
really running really really fast but

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.099 
really running really really fast but
the<00:02:30.790> Marines<00:02:31.209> was<00:02:31.450> able<00:02:31.659> to<00:02:31.750> kill<00:02:31.959> those

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
position as there are so many tanks and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.589 
position as there are so many tanks and
I<00:02:35.980> think<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.879> boro<00:02:37.060> should<00:02:37.299> be<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.510> to

I think the boro should be going to
research<00:02:37.870> right<00:02:38.049> now<00:02:38.079> just<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.500> kill<00:02:38.920> those

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
you get taken out really fast as this

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.710 
you get taken out really fast as this
mac<00:03:36.489> army<00:03:36.729> achieved<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.150> another<00:03:37.419> attack

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
coming from this side and real just

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.969 
coming from this side and real just
getting<00:03:39.220> plus<00:03:39.489> away<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.209> fast<00:03:40.599> by<00:03:41.409> these<00:03:41.650> tanks

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:41.979 
getting plus away so fast by these tanks

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.309 
getting plus away so fast by these tanks
while<00:03:42.129> I<00:03:42.159> entire<00:03:42.639> army<00:03:43.120> melting<00:03:43.479> away<00:03:43.569> look<00:03:44.199> at

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
while I entire army melting away look at

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.159 
while I entire army melting away look at
that<00:03:44.409> 171<00:03:45.340> over<00:03:46.000> 102<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:48.400> definitely<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.510> do

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
that 171 over 102 so definitely I do

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.170 
that 171 over 102 so definitely I do
think<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:50.650> top<00:03:51.280> here<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.639> will<00:03:51.849> be<00:03:51.970> able<00:03:52.120> to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
think that top here is will be able to

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.059 
think that top here is will be able to
push<00:03:52.359> in<00:03:52.510> here<00:03:52.690> at<00:03:53.139> that<00:03:53.379> Makka<00:03:53.650> Marie<00:03:53.889> was

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
push in here at that Makka Marie was

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.030 
push in here at that Makka Marie was
just<00:03:54.220> too<00:03:54.400> strong<00:03:54.760> for<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.829> fort<00:03:56.829> for<00:03:56.859> the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
just too strong for the fort for the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.860 
just too strong for the fort for the
week<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.849> roaches<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.269> mean<00:03:58.419> there's<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.659> way<00:03:58.810> to

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
week the roaches I mean there's a way to

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.539 
week the roaches I mean there's a way to
maintain<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.620> source<00:03:59.859> and<00:04:00.010> Marines<00:04:00.400> you

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
maintain and the source and Marines you

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.399 
maintain and the source and Marines you
know<00:04:00.639> now<00:04:01.239> just<00:04:01.449> a<00:04:01.569> nice<00:04:01.780> mix<00:04:02.109> of<00:04:02.229> everything

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
know now just a nice mix of everything

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.439 
know now just a nice mix of everything
here<00:04:02.889> but<00:04:03.669> do<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:03.819> think<00:04:03.879> that<00:04:04.000> sir<00:04:04.209> Alfred

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
here but do you think that sir Alfred

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.420 
here but do you think that sir Alfred
could<00:04:04.810> not<00:04:04.989> really<00:04:05.349> attacked<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:05.799> mean<00:04:06.069> he<00:04:06.220> if

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
could not really attacked I mean he if

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.979 
could not really attacked I mean he if
you<00:04:06.549> attack<00:04:06.909> him<00:04:07.060> earlier<00:04:07.629> he<00:04:07.659> might've

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
you attack him earlier he might've

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.809 
you attack him earlier he might've
actually<00:04:08.139> did<00:04:08.470> some<00:04:08.620> damage<00:04:08.799> but<00:04:08.949> now<00:04:09.189> now

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
actually did some damage but now now

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.129 
actually did some damage but now now
this<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.030> just<00:04:10.150> looking<00:04:10.509> not<00:04:10.750> very<00:04:10.930> good<00:04:11.109> for

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
this is just looking not very good for

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.170 
this is just looking not very good for
the<00:04:11.319> circular<00:04:11.709> as<00:04:11.889> that<00:04:12.310> natural<00:04:12.609> did<00:04:12.970> get

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
the circular as that natural did get

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.759 
the circular as that natural did get
taken<00:04:13.389> out<00:04:13.479> and<00:04:13.689> they<00:04:14.319> are<00:04:14.349> going<00:04:14.439> to<00:04:14.590> try<00:04:14.739> to

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
taken out and they are going to try to

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.589 
taken out and they are going to try to
push<00:04:15.009> up<00:04:15.159> as<00:04:15.280> one<00:04:15.459> push<00:04:15.699> push<00:04:15.939> in<00:04:16.150> here<00:04:16.359> as<00:04:16.449> well

push up as one push push in here as well
greatest<00:04:17.169> fire<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.560> going<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.859> thinking

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
greatest fire is going to thinking

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.879 
greatest fire is going to thinking
they're<00:04:18.190> most<00:04:18.430> likely<00:04:19.409> and<00:04:20.409> these<00:04:20.650> guys<00:04:20.829> are

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
they're most likely and these guys are

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.100 
they're most likely and these guys are
just<00:04:21.250> doing<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.789> hell<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.389> job<00:04:22.419> here<00:04:22.750> killing

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
just doing a hell of a job here killing

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.460 
just doing a hell of a job here killing
stuff<00:04:23.349> that<00:04:24.190> main<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.610> pretty<00:04:24.820> much<00:04:24.909> done<00:04:25.120> here

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
stuff that main is pretty much done here

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.810 
stuff that main is pretty much done here
as<00:04:25.530> there<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.830> another<00:04:26.070> force<00:04:26.370> coming<00:04:26.610> here

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
as there is another force coming here

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.760 
as there is another force coming here
with<00:04:26.970> tanks<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.330> Marines<00:04:27.660> going<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.440> probably

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
with tanks and Marines going to probably

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.820 
with tanks and Marines going to probably
kill<00:04:29.070> everything<00:04:29.370> over<00:04:29.700> here<00:04:29.910> as<00:04:30.060> well<00:04:30.300> and

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
kill everything over here as well and

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.900 
kill everything over here as well and
look<00:04:31.830> at<00:04:31.920> these<00:04:32.010> guys<00:04:32.160> actually<00:04:32.400> siege<00:04:32.760> up

away<00:05:23.520> by<00:05:23.669> the<00:05:23.730> tank<00:05:24.060> so<00:05:24.270> this<00:05:24.600> game<00:05:24.900> i<00:05:24.930> do<00:05:25.290> think

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
away by the tank so this game i do think

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.320 
away by the tank so this game i do think
that<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:25.950> top<00:05:26.160> should<00:05:26.850> be<00:05:27.000> able<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.180> win<00:05:27.270> i

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
that the top should be able to win i

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.400 
that the top should be able to win i
mean<00:05:27.510> look<00:05:27.570> at<00:05:27.630> 156<00:05:28.440> /<00:05:28.910> 153<00:05:29.910> so<00:05:30.840> army<00:05:31.200> count

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
mean look at 156 / 153 so army count

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.470 
mean look at 156 / 153 so army count
definitely<00:05:31.800> favoring<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.220> idea<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:33.240> terror

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480
