is this brush right here this brush is
quite<00:01:58.890> amazing<00:01:59.219> because<00:01:59.549> it<00:02:00.090> has<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
quite amazing because it has the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.690 
quite amazing because it has the
bristles<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.500> wear<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.189> way<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.579> are

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
bristles the wear it the way they are

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.450 
bristles the wear it the way they are
aligned<00:02:03.240> um<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:04.950> make<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
aligned um I think they make a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.639 
aligned um I think they make a
difference<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.450> they're<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:07.049> even

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
difference just because they're not even

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.180 
difference just because they're not even
though<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
though you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.219 
though you
can<00:02:08.310> find<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.940> find<00:02:09.180> short<00:02:09.540> bristles<00:02:09.810> in

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
can find like you find short bristles in

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.590 
can find like you find short bristles in
the<00:02:10.380> middle<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.340> pull<00:02:11.700> ones<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.210> the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
the middle and then pull ones on the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.320 
the middle and then pull ones on the
side<00:02:12.840> around<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.440> edges<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.700> think<00:02:15.030> that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
side around the edges and I think that

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.690 
side around the edges and I think that
makes<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.780> application<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.920> much<00:02:17.190> easier<00:02:17.550> and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
makes the application so much easier and

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.210 
makes the application so much easier and
so<00:02:17.790> much<00:02:18.060> smoother<00:02:18.810> because<00:02:19.050> you're<00:02:19.980> not

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
so much smoother because you're not

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.160 
so much smoother because you're not
going<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.640> create<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.150> line<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.990> goes

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
going to create that line that goes

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.340 
going to create that line that goes
straight<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.310> then<00:02:23.910> goes<00:02:24.150> blonde<00:02:24.600> or<00:02:24.900> wrong

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
straight and then goes blonde or wrong

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.530 
straight and then goes blonde or wrong
color<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.550> line<00:02:26.910> around<00:02:27.180> your

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
color and it's like a line around your

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.380 
color and it's like a line around your
hair<00:02:27.840> um<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.490> make<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:30.030> brush
