00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 we are back with a recipe 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.000
 wonderful good to me has me 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.849
 delighted a yoghurt and lemon pie 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 because it is a diet that is alive is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.920
 well it's a country that allows you to eat 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.420
 during the diet aisha then that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.640
 let's use some cookies 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.050
 crushed we're going to put butter 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.439
 that in this case it will already be melted 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.010
 the yoghurt n that I recommend you to be 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.269
 a yogurt then without sugar and most 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.219
 natural possible water grenetina powder 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.300
 because it 's going to hydrate it here in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.950
 Water 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.870
 We're going to need some cream cheese 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.350
 lemon juice and sugar substitute 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.690
 a little lemon baskets 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.670
 and a little coloring to give you that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.980
 characteristic green color of the pay of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.050
 lemon is very simple to do so is 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.130
 that I give him we are going to grab a mold 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.550
 we are going to put the cookies 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.699
 and there we are going to make our our 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 base let's mix this with a little bit of 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.280
 Butter 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.259
 and you know that I like to do the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.250
 mix once here not to mess 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:19.810
 dishes and it's easier it 's faster 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.470
 then we mix our 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.470
 pass 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.659
 and we started to support 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.540
 for 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.740
 do 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.780
 those that are all in the crust until 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.960
 down I tell them there are people who put the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.850
 coast as well as around me 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.550
 like to leave it down because at the time of 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.090
 unmold they look very parents the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.250
 layers look more interesting then 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.570
 I'm going to do it that way for another 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.170
 part this you have to take it to 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.720
 refrigerator and let the butter 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.690
 it becomes hard so that then the crust 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.160
 it looks so good 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.950
 now let's in the blender we're going to 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.170
 liquefy other legs 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.860
 let's put the yogurt 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.990
 but not 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.180
 let's incorporate everything ready 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.469
 we are going to put 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.469
 sugar substitute 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.230
 and the lemon juice 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.879
 cream cheese 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.340
 the cream cheese we also get it 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.290
 low in fat then the world in the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.569
 cultural data and we're going to put the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.000
 Droplets of dye does not need much 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.690
 with some that will be three 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.230
 a 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.230
 two 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.980
 at this time if we are going to paint green 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.980
 this blender 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.540
 and in ten mixed 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.810
 the wall panels that there is not no 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.209
 there are corneas it's really that you want 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.569
 at the end the body is no longer free 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.569
 mines 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.710
 appointments think you have to give as 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.710
 my 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:37.660
 and if it is necessary to put it in the microwave 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.220
 so that the grains of the grenetina 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.440
 undo here for example still 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.660
 it's like with granites 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.400
 and what I 'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.190
 put in the microwave so that those grains 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.920
 begin to give way and start doing 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.050
 an emulsion then let's go to the 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.160
 micro 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.160
 let's give it 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.500
 ten seconds to make it look good and if 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.470
 the joke if you need like that 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.290
 integrate so that at the time that 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.020
 set in the refrigerator to stay one 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.460
 homogeneous consistency and it's not like 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.790
 that everywhere is also 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.450
 destine the grenetina is very good for 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.630
 let the nails grow 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:27.600
 hair, everything is not 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.360
 it is super good to this then 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.870
 let's add the grenetina 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.710
 to the blender and we're going to give it a 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.710
 little more 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.370
 well now what we are going to do is 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.370

 if I 'm not going to stumble around 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.300
