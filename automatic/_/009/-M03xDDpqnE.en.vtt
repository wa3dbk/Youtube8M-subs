basic things to your car so the first

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.160 
basic things to your car so the first
thing<00:00:26.610> you<00:00:26.700> want<00:00:26.850> to<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.270> look<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
thing you want to do is look at the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.550 
thing you want to do is look at the
actual<00:00:28.439> air<00:00:28.650> filters<00:00:29.270> which<00:00:30.470> should<00:00:31.470> look

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
actual air filters which should look

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.460 
actual air filters which should look
something<00:00:31.770> like<00:00:31.860> this<00:00:32.930> but<00:00:33.930> when<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.080> bought<00:00:34.440> it

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
something like this but when I bought it

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.710 
something like this but when I bought it
I'll<00:00:34.980> also<00:00:35.220> look<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.730> arrow<00:00:35.970> it<00:00:36.449> tells

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
I'll also look for that arrow it tells

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.700 
I'll also look for that arrow it tells
you<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.900> direction<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> air<00:00:37.530> has<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
you the direction that the air has to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.549 
you the direction that the air has to
flow<00:00:37.980> into<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.750> where<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.050> gonna<00:00:40.140> find<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.500> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
flow into so where you gonna find it is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.049 
flow into so where you gonna find it is
gonna<00:00:40.680> find<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.980> right<00:00:41.070> behind<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.430> glove<00:00:41.670> box

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
gonna find it right behind the glove box

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.400 
gonna find it right behind the glove box
so<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.239> start<00:00:42.449> to<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.809> here's<00:00:43.080> a<00:00:43.199> little

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
gotta put it down we gotta pull it down

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:04.219 
gotta put it down we gotta pull it down
I'm<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.180> strong<00:01:02.150> okay<00:01:03.150> so<00:01:03.210> that's<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:03.900> one

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
looks like an initial for the glovebox

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
looks like an initial for the glovebox
it<00:01:21.330> falls<00:01:21.540> straight<00:01:21.720> down<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.800> where<00:01:22.980> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070

these<00:01:35.250> two<00:01:35.370> notches<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.390> whole<00:01:36.570> air

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
these two notches and the whole air

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.690 
these two notches and the whole air
filter<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.080> come<00:01:37.200> out

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
filter will come out

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.760 
filter will come out
as<00:01:38.539> you<00:01:38.659> can<00:01:38.780> see<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:38.990> haven't<00:01:39.259> changed<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.649> air

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
as you can see I haven't changed the air

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.510 
as you can see I haven't changed the air
filter<00:01:40.130> or<00:01:41.740> they<00:01:42.740> haven't<00:01:43.070> changed<00:01:43.189> your<00:01:43.399> air

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.190 
filter or they haven't changed your air
filter<00:01:43.880> in<00:01:43.939> such<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.450> long<00:01:44.689> time<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:47.210> I'm<00:01:48.079> gonna

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
filter in such a long time so I'm gonna

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.399 
filter in such a long time so I'm gonna
go<00:01:48.289> ahead<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.500> take<00:01:48.710> them<00:01:48.799> all<00:01:48.950> out<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:51.170> it's

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
go ahead and take them all out and it's

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.590 
go ahead and take them all out and it's
going<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.560> look<00:01:51.649> like<00:01:51.829> this<00:01:52.179> you<00:01:53.179> get<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.420> new

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
going to look like this you get the new

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.539 
going to look like this you get the new
one<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.020> then<00:01:54.679> you<00:01:54.860> have<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.130> follow<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
one and then you have to follow the

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.660 
one and then you have to follow the
direction<00:01:55.700> at<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.270> air<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.600> see<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.840> arrow

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
direction at the air to see the arrow

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.209 
direction at the air to see the arrow
says<00:01:58.670> therefore<00:01:59.149> is<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.360> way<00:01:59.539> so<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.979> same

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
says therefore is this way so the same

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.980 
says therefore is this way so the same
thing<00:02:01.460> with<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.789> actual<00:02:02.179> arrows<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.840> got

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
thing with the actual arrows so you got

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.679 
thing with the actual arrows so you got
to<00:02:03.079> make<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.289> face<00:02:03.469> down<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.850> they<00:02:05.090> both<00:02:05.329> are

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
to make it face down so they both are

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.910 
to make it face down so they both are
going<00:02:05.929> in<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.110> same<00:02:06.140> direction<00:02:08.590> once<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.769> is

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
going in the same direction once that is

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.140 
going in the same direction once that is
done<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.720> put<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.840> new<00:02:11.989> one<00:02:12.140> back<00:02:12.170> in<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.970> put

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
done you put the new one back in you put

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.569 
done you put the new one back in you put
the<00:02:14.269> clip<00:02:14.510> back<00:02:14.660> on<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:16.220> close<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
the clip back on and you close the

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.720 
the clip back on and you close the
glovebox<00:02:17.079> and<00:02:18.079> that's<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.579> close<00:02:19.579> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
glovebox and that's it close the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.430 
glovebox and that's it close the
glovebox<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.480> you're<00:02:20.840> good<00:02:21.019> you're<00:02:21.170> good<00:02:21.319> to
