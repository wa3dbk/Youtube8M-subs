and then set up and throw and then

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.680 
and then set up and throw and then
you've<00:02:20.470> got<00:02:20.620> balls<00:02:21.090> where<00:02:22.090> you're<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.630> to

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
you've got balls where you're going to

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.140 
you've got balls where you're going to
have<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.960> do<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.110> backhand<00:02:23.760> generally<00:02:24.760> speaking

it

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
it

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.260 
it
I'd<00:02:32.860> rather<00:02:33.130> get<00:02:33.340> around<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.850> then<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
I'd rather get around it then do the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.420 
I'd rather get around it then do the
backhand<00:02:35.070> but<00:02:37.470> I'll<00:02:38.470> let<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.770> ball<00:02:38.950> dictate

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
backhand but I'll let the ball dictate

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.190 
backhand but I'll let the ball dictate
on<00:02:39.580> what<00:02:39.730> I'm<00:02:39.820> going<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.000> do<00:02:40.150> there<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.570> if<00:02:41.110> you

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
on what I'm going to do there so if you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.220 
on what I'm going to do there so if you
want<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.380> do<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.500> few<00:02:41.680> balls<00:02:41.890> over<00:02:42.130> there<00:02:43.230> right

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
want to do a few balls over there right

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.170 
want to do a few balls over there right
here<00:02:44.410> I'll<00:02:44.500> do<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.740> banana<00:02:45.040> come<00:02:45.730> through<00:02:46.000> it

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
here I'll do the banana come through it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.110 
here I'll do the banana come through it
set<00:02:46.720> my<00:02:46.870> feet<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.380> throw<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.920> first

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.790 

now<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.180> key<00:02:52.420> getting<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.380> ground<00:02:53.530> ball

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
now the key getting a ground ball

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.210 
now the key getting a ground ball
especially<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.430> my<00:02:54.550> right<00:02:54.820> is<00:02:55.500> angles<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.740> you

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
especially to my right is angles and you

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.250 
especially to my right is angles and you
want<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.490> feel<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.790> ball<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.780> want<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.020> have<00:02:59.230> a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
want to feel the ball you want to have a

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.020 
want to feel the ball you want to have a
tendency<00:02:59.770> of<00:02:59.800> going<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.430> way<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.940> going

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
tendency of going this way and going

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.780 
tendency of going this way and going
that<00:03:01.660> way<00:03:01.870> rather<00:03:02.440> than<00:03:02.620> going<00:03:02.920> back<00:03:03.280> because

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
that way rather than going back because

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.370 
that way rather than going back because
you're<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.390> tough<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.720> create<00:03:04.990> momentum

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
you're it's tough to create momentum

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:19.680 
you're it's tough to create momentum
going<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.650> first<00:03:05.890> base

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.110 

now<00:03:20.690> I'll<00:03:20.840> show<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:21.050> few<00:03:21.140> backhands<00:03:22.040> once<00:03:22.550> again

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
now I'll show a few backhands once again

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.030 
now I'll show a few backhands once again
generally<00:03:23.960> speaking<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.500> would<00:03:24.530> like<00:03:24.800> to<00:03:24.920> feel

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
generally speaking I would like to feel

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.550 
generally speaking I would like to feel
the<00:03:25.220> backhand<00:03:25.730> on<00:03:26.000> an<00:03:26.540> angle<00:03:26.900> going<00:03:27.020> that<00:03:27.380> way

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
the backhand on an angle going that way

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.860 
the backhand on an angle going that way
rather<00:03:28.310> than<00:03:28.520> that<00:03:28.670> way<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.540> speed<00:03:29.780> of

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
rather than that way but the speed of

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.240 
rather than that way but the speed of
the<00:03:29.930> ball<00:03:30.050> is<00:03:30.260> also<00:03:30.410> going<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.680> dictate<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.100> lot

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
the ball is also going to dictate a lot

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:43.330 
the ball is also going to dictate a lot
of<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:41.710> you<00:03:42.710> want<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:42.950> create<00:03:43.070> as<00:03:43.220> much

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
of that you want to create as much

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.550 
of that you want to create as much
muscle<00:03:43.760> as<00:03:44.360> much<00:03:44.630> momentum<00:03:44.930> going<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.320> first

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
muscle as much momentum going to first

00:03:45.560 --> 00:04:04.170 
muscle as much momentum going to first
base<00:03:45.770> as<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.100> can<00:03:57.610> do<00:03:58.610> one<00:03:58.790> more<00:03:58.820> of<00:03:59.000> those

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.420 

plant<00:04:05.180> row<00:04:08.350> so<00:04:09.350> once<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.650> do<00:04:09.710> about<00:04:10.040> ten<00:04:10.280> of

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
plant row so once I do about ten of

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:30.200 
plant row so once I do about ten of
those<00:04:10.520> and<00:04:10.820> I<00:04:10.910> go<00:04:11.090> ten<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.480> my<00:04:11.600> left

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.480 

the<00:04:31.139> key<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.440> these<00:04:31.560> drills<00:04:31.889> is<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.280> getting

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
the key to these drills is just getting

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.189 
the key to these drills is just getting
your<00:04:32.550> rhythm<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.690> you're<00:04:33.840> most<00:04:34.020> comfortable

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
your rhythm so you're most comfortable

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:43.560 
your rhythm so you're most comfortable
further<00:04:34.860> for<00:04:35.759> when<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:35.970> game<00:04:36.120> starts

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.150 

and<00:04:44.050> then<00:04:44.230> I<00:04:44.260> like<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.620> finish<00:04:44.800> with<00:04:45.040> a<00:04:45.100> few

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
and then I like to finish with a few

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:59.970 
and then I like to finish with a few
just<00:04:45.610> right<00:04:45.760> Abney

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.320 

and<00:05:00.980> that<00:05:01.250> will<00:05:01.370> pretty<00:05:01.490> much<00:05:01.610> finish<00:05:02.060> up<00:05:02.240> my

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
and that will pretty much finish up my

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.270 
and that will pretty much finish up my
routine<00:05:02.720> each<00:05:02.960> day<00:05:03.230> because<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:03.920> know<00:05:03.980> when<00:05:04.190> I'm

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
routine each day because I know when I'm

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.710 
routine each day because I know when I'm
comfortable<00:05:04.730> hitting<00:05:04.940> ball<00:05:05.180> when<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.540> balls

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
comfortable hitting ball when the balls

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.980 
comfortable hitting ball when the balls
are<00:05:05.900> right<00:05:06.020> at<00:05:06.230> me<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.920> my<00:05:07.040> left<00:05:07.450> or<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.960> my

right and then my left and then right at
me<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.390> know<00:05:11.690> that<00:05:11.930> pretty<00:05:12.140> much<00:05:12.320> all<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.590> bases

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
me I know that pretty much all the bases

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.500 
me I know that pretty much all the bases
are<00:05:13.040> covered<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:13.940> I'm<00:05:14.060> comfortable<00:05:14.270> going

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
are covered and I'm comfortable going

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.260 
are covered and I'm comfortable going
into<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.870> game<00:05:15.080> and<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.380> feel<00:05:15.650> like<00:05:16.270> wherever

into the game and I feel like wherever

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.430 
into the game and I feel like wherever
the<00:05:17.390> ball<00:05:17.540> is<00:05:17.660> hit<00:05:17.840> I'm<00:05:17.960> going<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.170> make<00:05:18.290> the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
the ball is hit I'm going to make the

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.060 
the ball is hit I'm going to make the
play<00:05:18.820> so<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:19.850> think<00:05:20.090> like<00:05:20.600> I<00:05:20.750> said<00:05:20.980> having<00:05:21.980> your

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
play so I think like I said having your

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.740 
play so I think like I said having your
routine<00:05:22.400> each<00:05:22.580> day<00:05:22.820> is<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.090> most<00:05:23.210> important

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
routine each day is the most important

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.080 
routine each day is the most important
because<00:05:24.230> it<00:05:24.350> just<00:05:24.440> creates<00:05:24.800> confidence<00:05:25.220> you

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
because it just creates confidence you

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.280 
because it just creates confidence you
believe<00:05:26.360> in<00:05:26.480> your<00:05:26.600> work<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:26.930> then<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.110> carries

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
believe in your work and then it carries

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.430 
believe in your work and then it carries
over<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.710> game<00:05:28.030> so<00:05:29.030> I<00:05:29.060> think<00:05:29.180> that's<00:05:29.480> as<00:05:30.050> an

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
over the game so I think that's as an

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.740 
over the game so I think that's as an
infielder<00:05:30.980> that's<00:05:31.160> today's<00:05:32.090> pro<00:05:32.330> tip<00:05:32.570> of<00:05:32.690> the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
infielder that's today's pro tip of the

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.900 
infielder that's today's pro tip of the
day
