 Sing this song If it's a day that everything makes you melancholic

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:49.017
 Lalalalalalalala Amigo you will be born again 

00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:52.059
 A life of servility does not strike you 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.236
 a life of servility 

00:00:55.236 --> 00:00:58.556

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.945
 in your pupils the blue sea 

00:01:48.945 --> 00:01:52.051

00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:55.375
 your heart sings this song 

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:58.330
 Goodbye goodbye goodbye 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.661

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:08.099
 Lalalalalalalala Tomorrow a new day will be born 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:20.829

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.207
 It does not matter what 

00:02:24.207 --> 00:02:27.158
 others think 

00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:30.423
 The cowardly look of the people 

00:02:30.423 --> 00:02:33.939
 without courage 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.887
 Lalalala Friend your heart is full of flowers that bloom 

00:02:39.887 --> 00:02:46.283
 Lalalalalalalala Tomorrow will shine with strength 

00:02:46.283 --> 00:02:52.610
 Lalalala Friend opens your heart 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.959
