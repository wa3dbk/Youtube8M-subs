00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
very often we ended up spending a lot of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939 
very often we ended up spending a lot of
time<00:01:03.420> taking<00:01:03.750> care<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.049> each<00:01:04.140> other<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.860> was

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
time taking care of each other there was

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
time taking care of each other there was
very<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.489> parental<00:01:06.000> guidance<00:01:06.450> very

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
very little parental guidance very

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.620 
very little parental guidance very
little<00:01:08.510> adult<00:01:10.700> surveillance<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> controlled

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
little adult surveillance and controlled

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.630 
little adult surveillance and controlled
and<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.460> with

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and I think that's got a lot to do with

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.630 
and I think that's got a lot to do with
why<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> grew<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.930> free<00:01:16.350> spirit<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.369> pleasure

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
why I grew up a free spirit the pleasure

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.300 
why I grew up a free spirit the pleasure
taboo<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.659> instilled<00:01:19.080> upon<00:01:19.140> me<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
taboo was not instilled upon me and the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.670 
taboo was not instilled upon me and the
body<00:01:20.460> type<00:01:20.820> Oh<00:01:20.909> taboo<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.869> think<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
body type Oh taboo and I think that that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.100 
body type Oh taboo and I think that that
allowed<00:01:23.369> me<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.540> brave<00:01:24.960> enough

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
allowed me to actually be brave enough

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.100 
allowed me to actually be brave enough
to<00:01:25.409> go<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:26.670> today<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.450> 2001<00:01:27.960> I

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
about a lot of things lately I've been

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.809 
about a lot of things lately I've been
going<00:04:58.479> through<00:04:58.509> the<00:04:58.719> process<00:04:58.749> of<00:04:59.199> a<00:04:59.289> divorce

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
going through the process of a divorce

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.489 
going through the process of a divorce
in<00:05:00.819> Italy's<00:05:01.419> as<00:05:01.719> an<00:05:01.839> American<00:05:02.349> raised<00:05:03.039> woman<00:05:03.999> I

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:04.499 
in Italy's as an American raised woman I

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.709 
in Italy's as an American raised woman I
had<00:05:05.499> a<00:05:05.529> lot<00:05:05.709> more<00:05:05.739> freedom<00:05:06.119> for<00:05:07.119> example<00:05:07.479> than

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
had a lot more freedom for example than

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.659 
had a lot more freedom for example than
Italian<00:05:08.349> women<00:05:08.469> do<00:05:08.709> today<00:05:08.949> for<00:05:09.459> the<00:05:09.549> first

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
Italian women do today for the first

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.359 
Italian women do today for the first
time<00:05:09.849> I<00:05:09.939> thought<00:05:10.089> I'm<00:05:10.329> not<00:05:10.479> free<00:05:10.919> I'm<00:05:11.919> not<00:05:12.129> free

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:12.369 
time I thought I'm not free I'm not free

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:14.579 
time I thought I'm not free I'm not free
and<00:05:12.639> I<00:05:12.969> actually<00:05:13.119> am<00:05:13.419> a<00:05:13.449> second<00:05:13.869> quest<00:05:14.079> is<00:05:14.259> I'm

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:14.589 
and I actually am a second quest is I'm

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:19.259 
and I actually am a second quest is I'm
still<00:05:14.889> today<00:05:15.329> so<00:05:16.329> there's<00:05:16.509> a<00:05:16.569> lot<00:05:16.779> of<00:05:17.459> a<00:05:18.459> lot<00:05:19.149> of

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:19.269 
still today so there's a lot of a lot of

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:21.329 
still today so there's a lot of a lot of
work<00:05:19.419> to<00:05:19.569> be<00:05:19.659> done<00:05:19.809> and<00:05:20.019> I<00:05:20.109> think<00:05:20.319> that<00:05:20.469> we<00:05:20.589> we

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:21.339 
work to be done and I think that we we

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:23.279 
work to be done and I think that we we
underestimate<00:05:22.119> sometimes<00:05:22.509> for<00:05:22.749> example<00:05:22.779> in

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
underestimate sometimes for example in

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.919 
underestimate sometimes for example in
America<00:05:23.409> women<00:05:24.069> do<00:05:24.489> have<00:05:24.639> more<00:05:24.789> rights<00:05:25.349> and

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:27.929 
America women do have more rights and

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:31.109 
America women do have more rights and
not<00:05:28.929> every<00:05:29.169> place<00:05:29.379> is<00:05:29.529> the<00:05:29.559> same<00:05:29.969> that<00:05:30.969> right

00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:31.119 
not every place is the same that right

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:32.459 
not every place is the same that right
now<00:05:31.269> I'm<00:05:31.419> working<00:05:31.569> on<00:05:31.779> empowering<00:05:32.169> people

now I'm working on empowering people

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.039 
now I'm working on empowering people

encourage people also to be their own

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.479 
encourage people also to be their own
mothers<00:05:58.989> it<00:05:59.110> is<00:05:59.199> really<00:05:59.439> one<00:05:59.649> if<00:06:00.249> you<00:06:00.369> don't

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:00.489 
mothers it is really one if you don't

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:01.919 
mothers it is really one if you don't
decide<00:06:00.849> to<00:06:00.999> be<00:06:01.119> your<00:06:01.149> own<00:06:01.360> mother<00:06:01.569> and<00:06:01.749> maybe

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:01.929 
decide to be your own mother and maybe

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:03.659 
decide to be your own mother and maybe
your<00:06:02.169> own<00:06:02.259> father<00:06:02.529> too

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
your own father too

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.179 
your own father too
you<00:06:04.119> can't<00:06:04.329> expect<00:06:04.719> somebody<00:06:05.649> else<00:06:05.889> to<00:06:05.979> do<00:06:06.159> it

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:06.189 
you can't expect somebody else to do it

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.179 
you can't expect somebody else to do it
for<00:06:06.429> you<00:06:06.519> and<00:06:06.789> I<00:06:06.849> think<00:06:06.909> it's<00:06:07.149> a<00:06:07.409> heuristic<00:06:08.409> and

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
for you and I think it's a heuristic and

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.269 
for you and I think it's a heuristic and
it<00:06:09.309> can<00:06:09.489> make<00:06:10.209> for<00:06:10.239> a<00:06:10.419> very<00:06:10.629> painful<00:06:10.869> path<00:06:11.279> so

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:12.279 
it can make for a very painful path so

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.259 
it can make for a very painful path so
