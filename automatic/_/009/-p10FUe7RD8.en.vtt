one<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.940> brawl<00:03:00.170> part<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.320> closest<00:03:01.680> why<00:03:01.830> I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
one in brawl part of the closest why I

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.890 
one in brawl part of the closest why I
could<00:03:02.100> put<00:03:02.670> clone<00:03:03.360> wise<00:03:03.660> was<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.290> link<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:06.690> will

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
could put clone wise was to link it will

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.340 
could put clone wise was to link it will
heal<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.140> lot<00:03:07.290> faster<00:03:07.670> weaker<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:09.510> still<00:03:09.750> I'll

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
heal a lot faster weaker but still I'll

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.750 
heal a lot faster weaker but still I'll
probably<00:03:10.620> put<00:03:10.890> him<00:03:11.100> as<00:03:11.250> closed<00:03:11.459> status

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
probably put him as closed status

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.310 
probably put him as closed status
because<00:03:12.510> everybody's<00:03:13.080> hanging<00:03:13.200> with<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.440> close

at this game I can't say to link as a
clone<00:03:18.300> even<00:03:18.989> though<00:03:19.050> he<00:03:19.080> plays<00:03:19.410> exactly<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
clone even though he plays exactly the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
clone even though he plays exactly the
same<00:03:20.340> way<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.640> he<00:03:20.730> did<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:21.030> brawl<00:03:21.269> but<00:03:22.170> leak

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150
