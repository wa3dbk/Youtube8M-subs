00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 types of elisa trials have been 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.310
 developed multiple variants of 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.080
 elisa trials that allow from the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.179
 quantification of an antigen in 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.550
 solution the detection of an antibody 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.349
 in a solution for example in courage 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.420
 of monoclonal antibodies or the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.789
 determination of the idiotype subclass of 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
 an antibody then 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.170
 describe the most common 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.720
 elisa direct essay elisa simple of two 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.340
 layers elisa plates are prepared 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 coating the wells with the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.599
 solutions where you suspect 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.090
 find the antigen are incubated with 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.010
 labeled antibodies indicate the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.739
 presence of antigen in the solution 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.750
 analyzed it is necessary to include controls 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.360
 negative that will be samples of it 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.100
 type of the analyzed blood urine but 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.890
 where you have the certainty of the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.450
 absence of the antigen sought 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.370
 positive controls are included 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.850
 solutions where the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.710
 antigen sought elisa indirectly the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.079
 plates elisa are prepared from the same 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.870
 way to the previous controls 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.210
 Positive and negative are the same the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.409
 detection system employees 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.690
 antibodies a primary against the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.060
 antigen and a secondary one marked against 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.830
 primary detection has greater 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.900
 sensitivity for presenting a 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.000
 signal amplification due to the union 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 of two or more secondary antibodies by 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.990
 each primary is the most popular essay 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.810
 as is immunofluorescence 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 indirectly the same secondary 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.070
 marked and the same enzymatic system 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.080
 allows to quantify a great variety of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.300
 antigens that's why it's one more method 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.160
 versatile and cheap even if you miss 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.680
 some precision for having a link 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.540
 more with respect to the direct method the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.610
 dilution of the solution containing the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.770
 primary antibody eg serum 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.480
 blood is a very important factor to 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.180
 keep in mind to avoid the appearance 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.370
 of false negatives since if the sample 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.590
 is very diluted will not be positive if 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.410
 the titration of antibodies is very low 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.210
 that is, although the antibodies are 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.610
 present the test does not test positive 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.740
 because the concentration of antibodies 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.630
 specific against the antigen that is 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.220
 stuck at the bottom of the well is not 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.130
 enough to give a signal 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.900
 detectable the indirect elisa is the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.060
 method of choice to detect the 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.010
 presence of serum antibodies against 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.050
 the human immunodeficiency virus 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.680
 be a causative agent of the syndrome 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.530
 immunodeficiency 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.540
 acquired AIDS according to this technique 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.700
 recombinant envelope proteins 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.829
 and the core of the be absorbed as 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.469
 solid phase antigens to the wells 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.599
 affected people of be produce 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.640
 serum antibodies against epitopes in 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.739
 these viral proteins 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.569
 in general the indirect elisa allows 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.400
 detect serum antibodies against 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.139
 vines of the first six weeks of 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.000
 an infection 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.010
 elisa sandwich capture test 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.650
 antigen and detection by immuno 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.510
 complexes this is a very trial 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.609
 employee in which the well is coated 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.650
 with a first anti-antigen antibody 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.299
 after washing the excess 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.859
 antibodies the sample is applied 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.959
 problem in which the 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.639
 antigen that will be retained in the well 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.519
 to be recognized by the first 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.560
 antibody after a second wash 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.389
 that removes the non-retained material 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.030
 Apply a solution with a second 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.099
 anti-antigen antibody labeled thus 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.200
 because each antigen molecule will be 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.480
 bound to an antibody in the base that what 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.419
 retains and a second antibody at least 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.609
 that marks this essay has a great 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.530
 specificity and sensitivity due to 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.979
 signal amplification that allows the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.979
 second
