from<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.650> very<00:00:01.740> beginning<00:00:02.419> the<00:00:03.419> ipad<00:00:04.140> was

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
from the very beginning the ipad was

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.530 
from the very beginning the ipad was

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
designed to be very powerful very

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.759 
designed to be very powerful very
capable<00:00:07.429> but<00:00:08.429> also<00:00:09.139> remarkably<00:00:10.139> simple<00:00:10.469> to

capable but also remarkably simple to

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.560 
capable but also remarkably simple to
use<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:13.740> our<00:00:13.920> goal<00:00:14.219> was<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.030> take<00:00:15.210> all<00:00:15.420> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.800 
went back to the very beginning and we
took<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.770> time<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.759> design<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.149> product<00:02:08.569> that

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
took the time to design a product that

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.860 
took the time to design a product that
was<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.369> concentration<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.519> not<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> reduction

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
was a concentration of not a reduction

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.520 
was a concentration of not a reduction
of<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.019> original<00:02:13.330> we<00:02:14.330> felt<00:02:14.630> strongly<00:02:15.050> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
of the original we felt strongly that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.580 
of the original we felt strongly that
seven<00:02:16.340> point<00:02:16.610> nine<00:02:16.670> inches<00:02:17.239> was<00:02:17.930> exactly<00:02:18.500> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
seven point nine inches was exactly the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.610 
seven point nine inches was exactly the
right<00:02:18.800> display<00:02:19.280> size<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.810> became<00:02:21.110> clear

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
right display size but it became clear

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.160 
right display size but it became clear
that<00:02:21.980> we<00:02:22.489> had<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.790> reduce<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.330> width<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
that we had to reduce the width of the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.710 
that we had to reduce the width of the
borders<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.459> can<00:02:25.700> still<00:02:26.000> pick<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.390> up<00:02:26.569> and

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
borders so you can still pick it up and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.000 
borders so you can still pick it up and
easily<00:02:27.140> use<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.530> with<00:02:27.650> one<00:02:27.830> hand<00:02:29.980> we<00:02:30.980> have

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
easily use it with one hand we have

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.470 
easily use it with one hand we have
continued<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.700> develop<00:02:31.940> our<00:02:32.600> unibody<00:02:33.410> process
