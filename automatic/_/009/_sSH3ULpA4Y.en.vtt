00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
to build a church that in large part

to build a church that in large part
just<00:01:05.710> really<00:01:06.159> focused<00:01:06.880> on<00:01:07.090> those<00:01:07.479> guys<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.229> so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
just really focused on those guys and so

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.469 
just really focused on those guys and so
from<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:10.200> mean<00:01:11.200> for<00:01:11.500> everything<00:01:11.979> we<00:01:12.100> do<00:01:12.310> we<00:01:12.759> tend

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
from I mean for everything we do we tend

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.080 
from I mean for everything we do we tend
to<00:01:13.540> train<00:01:13.900> higher<00:01:14.680> young<00:01:15.040> men<00:01:15.310> release<00:01:15.880> them

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090

from<00:01:16.270> ministry<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:17.020> reach<00:01:17.200> their<00:01:17.409> buddies<00:01:17.710> so

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
from ministry to reach their buddies so

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.859 
from ministry to reach their buddies so

the least Church city in America but

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.010 
the least Church city in America but

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
it's everything from the tone the style

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.260 
it's everything from the tone the style
the<00:01:29.500> topics<00:01:29.920> we<00:01:30.040> talked<00:01:30.280> about<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.880> way<00:01:31.060> we

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
the topics we talked about the way we

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.179 
the topics we talked about the way we
specifically<00:01:31.780> address<00:01:32.500> men<00:01:32.799> and<00:01:33.009> deal<00:01:33.159> with

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
specifically address men and deal with

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.580 
specifically address men and deal with
men<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:36.299> into<00:01:37.299> portraying<00:01:38.020> Jesus<00:01:38.409> in<00:01:38.530> a

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
men and into portraying Jesus in a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.649 
men and into portraying Jesus in a
masculine<00:01:38.920> way<00:01:39.159> I<00:01:39.189> think<00:01:39.430> is<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.549> big<00:01:39.790> deal<00:01:40.060> we

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
masculine way I think is a big deal we

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.740 
masculine way I think is a big deal we
like<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.960> Jesus<00:01:41.259> of<00:01:41.290> Revelation<00:01:41.860> 19<00:01:42.750> tattooed

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
like the Jesus of Revelation 19 tattooed

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.410 
like the Jesus of Revelation 19 tattooed
down<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.079> leg<00:01:44.259> coming<00:01:44.920> for<00:01:45.219> war<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:46.119> hip<00:01:46.270> hop

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
down the leg coming for war the hip hop

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.770 
down the leg coming for war the hip hop
guys<00:01:46.630> come<00:01:46.869> thug<00:01:47.140> Jesus<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:49.000> white<00:01:49.360> guys<00:01:49.539> tend

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
guys come thug Jesus the white guys tend

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.649 
guys come thug Jesus the white guys tend
to<00:01:49.810> call<00:01:50.020> them<00:01:50.170> Ultimate<00:01:50.649> Fighter<00:01:50.829> Jesus<00:01:51.659> but

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
to call them Ultimate Fighter Jesus but

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.810 
to call them Ultimate Fighter Jesus but
even<00:01:53.259> just<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.469> view<00:01:53.649> of<00:01:53.710> Jesus<00:01:53.950> as<00:01:54.280> masculine

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
even just a view of Jesus as masculine

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.580 
even just a view of Jesus as masculine
as<00:01:54.850> powerful<00:01:55.360> as<00:01:55.479> strong<00:01:55.780> as<00:01:56.020> saviors

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
as powerful as strong as saviors

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.670 
as powerful as strong as saviors
Redeemer<00:01:57.280> as<00:01:57.430> defender<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.229> think<00:01:59.560> it's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
Redeemer as defender so I think it's

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.560 
Redeemer as defender so I think it's
