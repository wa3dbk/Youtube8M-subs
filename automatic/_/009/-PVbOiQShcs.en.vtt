we're going to take a look at why so

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.560 
we're going to take a look at why so
many<00:05:47.530> people<00:05:47.650> are<00:05:48.100> distracted<00:05:48.610> it's<00:05:49.210> probably

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
many people are distracted it's probably

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.690
