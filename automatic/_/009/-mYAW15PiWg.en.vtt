00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.199
 against the expectations of some 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.059
 our barrels are still driving 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.500
 so go to the next item after 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.510
 it couldn't have been longer we are 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.769
 brook car racing in the hague they go on 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.720
 the rollerbank to get some cards 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.760
 see if we still have his assets 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.050
 Start with the BMW of Roland who stands 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.170
 completely ready 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.519
 100 12.8 the cheese is already a top addition 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.670
 yes very nice but have you seen 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.010
 what today is the date of Friday the 13th 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.350
 Friday the 13 and exactly today 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.989
 need to roll up my BMW but yes 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.089
 well we are immediately following it 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.589
 take your whining and feel confident there 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.019
 already a top question that I always ask 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.089
 how much do you expect to have 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.280
 well you know the beauty is about 518 me 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.110
 can't lose so much and 112 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.220
 with 8hp what your side so I just think 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.100
 what i am going to do very well i seemed 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.320
 one in a minimum of 106 hp 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.970
 at least 100 are yes or a BMW is none 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.970
 We are going to tell gisbert there 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.790
 these beautiful rear straps and yet 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.900
 a bit of a worry child of mine 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.580
 bmw i mean 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.670
 gift party even though it is from it 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.100
 crackling hard rubber, and is in any way 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.590
 Every two weeks the tire road 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.820
 that just evaporates 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.170
 so initially can not occur 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.780
 above 40 kilowatts on the dynamometer 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.049
 but in the end its looking hard again 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.049
 what the result 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.450
 this is your purest torture people yes 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.430
 what do I think not entertained with 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.069
 timing belt is I think those emails 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.940
 16,000 not to advertise and she goes 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.360
 whole 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.360
 spinning around 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.750
 oh oh there we are with the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.050
 results is the current job 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.370
 no it is very bad you come on 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.060
 109hp corner 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.650
 100 almost 55 mm almost all their power and 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.480
 what i had to say should be 62 minutes with 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.220
 ribs there he sits why do I have to 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.470
 don't mind either 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.880
 then completely new look as so 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.769
 but here 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.910
 German reliability line engine but 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.360
 they drop oh and well the other one 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.360
