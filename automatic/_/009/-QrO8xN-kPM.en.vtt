the honey and the frozen strawberries so

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.220 
the honey and the frozen strawberries so
this<00:01:55.850> time<00:01:56.060> we're<00:01:56.270> going<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.480> turn<00:01:56.960> on<00:01:57.110> the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
this time we're going to turn on the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:36.220 
this time we're going to turn on the
machine<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.830> give<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.400> whirl

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
so well together it's not like you're

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.130 
so well together it's not like you're
eating<00:02:42.680> ice<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.730> then<00:02:44.060> taste<00:02:44.360> of<00:02:44.569> this<00:02:44.750> agree

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140
