00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.960 
black hole bomb and you throw it and it
opens<00:02:23.790> up<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.180> small<00:02:25.430> singularity<00:02:26.430> event<00:02:26.549> right

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
opens up a small singularity event right

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.509 
opens up a small singularity event right
those<00:02:27.150> black<00:02:27.630> hole<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.260> it'll<00:02:28.709> suck<00:02:29.040> zombies

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
those black hole and it'll suck zombies

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.600 
those black hole and it'll suck zombies
into<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:31.650> essentially<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.489> these

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
into it in essentially we have these

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.170 
into it in essentially we have these
Landers<00:02:33.230> kinda<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:34.489> space<00:02:35.489> liners<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.120> you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
Landers kinda like space liners so you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.390 
Landers kinda like space liners so you
can<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.630> them<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.019> they'll<00:02:37.890> take<00:02:38.220> you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
can get on them and they'll take you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.970 
can get on them and they'll take you
from<00:02:38.670> various<00:02:39.000> points<00:02:39.239> around<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.170> map<00:02:40.380> it's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
from various points around the map it's

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.770 
from various points around the map it's
a<00:02:41.100> great<00:02:41.250> way<00:02:41.580> again<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.120> you're<00:02:42.269> if<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.630> need

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
a great way again if you're if you need

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.420 
a great way again if you're if you need
a<00:02:42.810> panic<00:02:43.200> do<00:02:43.319> a<00:02:43.350> panic<00:02:43.709> retreat<00:02:44.100> everybody

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
a panic do a panic retreat everybody

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.250 
a panic do a panic retreat everybody
loads<00:02:44.610> up<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:45.030> Lander<00:02:45.480> you'll<00:02:45.870> take<00:02:46.080> off

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
loads up on this Lander you'll take off

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.630 
loads up on this Lander you'll take off
you'll<00:02:46.560> fly<00:02:46.739> through<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:46.950> air<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.280> land<00:02:47.489> back

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
you'll fly through the air you land back

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.180 
you'll fly through the air you land back
down<00:02:47.880> inside<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.480> inside<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.950> other

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
down inside of inside of the other

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.449 
down inside of inside of the other
centrifuge<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:52.260> again<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.130> it's

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
centrifuge and it again it's just it's

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.220 
centrifuge and it again it's just it's
another<00:02:53.670> really<00:02:54.000> unique<00:02:54.359> way<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.600> move<00:02:55.019> around

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
another really unique way to move around

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.250 
another really unique way to move around
the<00:02:55.350> map<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.329> you<00:02:57.329> know<00:02:57.510> everything

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the map and and you know everything

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.620 
the map and and you know everything
about<00:02:58.500> zombies<00:02:59.280> there's<00:02:59.790> always<00:03:00.090> something

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
about zombies there's always something

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.120 
about zombies there's always something
else<00:03:00.810> there's<00:03:01.109> also<00:03:01.260> little<00:03:01.500> secret<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.010> be

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
else there's also little secret to be

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.890 
else there's also little secret to be
found<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.549> maybe<00:03:02.850> these<00:03:03.060> Landers<00:03:03.450> also<00:03:03.810> do

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
found so maybe these Landers also do

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.830 
found so maybe these Landers also do
something<00:03:04.230> else<00:03:07.850> hellhounds<00:03:08.850> have<00:03:09.720> been

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
something else hellhounds have been

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.140 
something else hellhounds have been
replaced<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.440> Ascension<00:03:10.980> with<00:03:11.280> space<00:03:11.700> monkeys

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
replaced in Ascension with space monkeys

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.000 
replaced in Ascension with space monkeys
and<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:13.019> know<00:03:13.079> how<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.350> silly<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.859> might

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
and I know how the silly that might

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.319 
and I know how the silly that might
sound<00:03:14.190> at<00:03:14.400> first<00:03:14.609> but<00:03:14.850> wait<00:03:15.060> until<00:03:15.090> you

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
sound at first but wait until you

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.030 
sound at first but wait until you
encounter<00:03:15.510> these<00:03:15.870> little<00:03:16.140> space<00:03:16.319> monkeys<00:03:16.739> cos

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
encounter these little space monkeys cos

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.830 
encounter these little space monkeys cos
there's<00:03:17.880> sort<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.090> those<00:03:18.209> those<00:03:18.480> those
