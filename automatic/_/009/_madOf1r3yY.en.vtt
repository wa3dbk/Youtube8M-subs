00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.300 
listening to that I think and you know
what<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.530> actually<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:07.890> good<00:01:08.130> are

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
what that's actually a really good are

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
what that's actually a really good are
there<00:01:08.460> maybe<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.020> I've<00:01:10.260> come

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
there maybe I can do that so I've come

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.929 
there maybe I can do that so I've come
up<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.590> some<00:01:10.950> new<00:01:10.979> rules<00:01:11.280> which<00:01:11.520> won't<00:01:11.760> come

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
up with some new rules which won't come

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.609 
up with some new rules which won't come
into<00:01:12.150> play<00:01:12.330> until<00:01:12.570> i'm<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.200> sure<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.560> will

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
into play until i'm not sure if it will

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
into play until i'm not sure if it will
be<00:01:13.770> next<00:01:13.979> episode<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.150> episode<00:01:15.450> after

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
be next episode or the episode after

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.899 
be next episode or the episode after
that<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.710> lot<00:01:17.009> better<00:01:17.159> than<00:01:17.610> just

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909

also some rules so at the moment is the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.179 
also some rules so at the moment is the
only<00:02:03.329> way<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.930> obviously<00:02:04.409> goal<00:02:04.799> scorer

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
only way I can get obviously goal scorer

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.550 
only way I can get obviously goal scorer
2<00:02:05.460> plus<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:06.750> score<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> goal<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
2 plus is to actually score a goal and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.559 
2 plus is to actually score a goal and
but<00:02:08.489> won't<00:02:08.729> thinking<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.300> obviously

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
but won't thinking of is obviously

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.780 
but won't thinking of is obviously
keeping<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:09.989> also<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.590> score<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.580> got

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
keeping that also for score go I get got

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.880 
keeping that also for score go I get got
I<00:02:11.940> get<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> goal<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.720> point<00:02:13.200> I'm<00:02:13.440> actually

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
changed the point system to form it's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.860 
changed the point system to form it's
going<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.190> called<00:02:17.430> form<00:02:17.760> okay<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.240> this

going to be called form okay so this

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.480 
going to be called form okay so this
will<00:02:19.020> make<00:02:19.140> sense<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.860> second<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.310> if<00:02:20.400> I

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
will make sense in just a second so if I

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.970

gonna just get an extra form point but

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.500 
gonna just get an extra form point but

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
decided how about i'll double deform

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.509 
decided how about i'll double deform
point<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:57.900> let's<00:03:58.110> say<00:03:58.290> usually<00:03:58.860> people<00:03:59.340> rage

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
point so let's say usually people rage

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.680 
point so let's say usually people rage
quit<00:03:59.760> against<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.060> when<00:04:00.209> you've<00:04:00.299> scored<00:04:00.540> like

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690

at<00:04:00.870> least<00:04:01.019> three<00:04:01.380> goals<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:01.890> i<00:04:01.950> think<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.250> would

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
at least three goals so i think it would

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.970 
at least three goals so i think it would
be<00:04:02.400> quite<00:04:02.700> good<00:04:03.000> rule<00:04:03.180> also<00:04:04.049> guys<00:04:04.410> there<00:04:04.860> is

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
be quite good rule also guys there is

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
going to be a minus form point so let's

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.310 
going to be a minus form point so let's
say<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.470> lose<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:07.860> match<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.489> get<00:04:08.670> minus<00:04:08.910> one

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320

box i think it was across the goal and

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.080 
box i think it was across the goal and
