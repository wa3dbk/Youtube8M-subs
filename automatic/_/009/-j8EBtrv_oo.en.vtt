their hit they hit based off of melee or

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.319 
their hit they hit based off of melee or
something<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.430> somewhere<00:01:00.180> along

something like that somewhere along

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.660 
something like that somewhere along
those<00:01:00.570> terms<00:01:00.949> but<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.070> probably<00:01:02.340> melee

they won't hit anything so that's how

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.710

task without banking if you kill them
fast<00:02:29.510> enough<00:02:30.970> but<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:33.350> far<00:02:33.470> I've<00:02:33.560> been<00:02:33.620> using

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
fast enough but so far I've been using

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.580 
fast enough but so far I've been using
like<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.340> food<00:02:34.670> per<00:02:35.060> kill<00:02:35.360> at<00:02:35.630> this<00:02:35.989> level<00:02:36.170> 60

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
like one food per kill at this level 60

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.020 
like one food per kill at this level 60
attack<00:02:37.070> 60<00:02:37.459> strength<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.700> then<00:02:40.819> we're<00:02:40.910> gonna

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
attack 60 strength and then we're gonna

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.540 
attack 60 strength and then we're gonna
pick<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.360> spot<00:02:41.600> not<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.190> not<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.340> Slayer

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
pick the spot not the not the Slayer

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.580 
pick the spot not the not the Slayer
tower<00:02:43.880> is<00:02:44.239> because<00:02:44.630> it's<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.930> lot<00:02:45.080> closer<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.560> a

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
tower is because it's a lot closer to a

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.559 
tower is because it's a lot closer to a
bank<00:02:45.830> right<00:02:46.040> there<00:02:46.250> as<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> bank<00:02:46.730> right<00:02:47.330> there

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
bank right there as a bank right there

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.949 
bank right there as a bank right there
and<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.190> lot<00:02:49.340> easy<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.610> bank<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.209> there's

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
and it's a lot easy to bank and there's

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.509 
and it's a lot easy to bank and there's
a<00:02:51.019> multiple<00:02:51.470> safe<00:02:51.650> spots<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.100> it's<00:02:52.190> really

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
a multiple safe spots and it's really

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.190 
a multiple safe spots and it's really
really<00:02:52.819> close<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.420> I'll<00:02:53.540> just<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.959> go<00:02:54.110> all

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
really close so I'll just have to go all

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.870 
really close so I'll just have to go all
the<00:02:54.290> way<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.560> Slayer<00:02:54.709> tower<00:02:54.980> climb<00:02:55.280> up<00:02:55.489> and

the way the Slayer tower climb up and

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.990 
the way the Slayer tower climb up and
then<00:02:56.540> navigate<00:02:57.019> through<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.819> first<00:02:58.819> things

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
then navigate through that first things

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.789 
then navigate through that first things
first<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.450> want<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.630> show<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.870> how<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.079> safe

concept<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.870> have<00:03:09.680> 150<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.459> these<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:10.940> we're

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
concept I have 150 of these so we're

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.319 
concept I have 150 of these so we're
going<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.600> go<00:03:11.780> from<00:03:11.959> here<00:03:12.200> blood<00:03:13.160> valve<00:03:13.400> okay

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
going to go from here blood valve okay

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.000 
going to go from here blood valve okay
there's<00:03:14.570> two<00:03:14.750> safe<00:03:14.959> spots<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.290> can<00:03:15.440> use<00:03:15.560> there

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
there's two safe spots you can use there

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.890 
there's two safe spots you can use there
is<00:03:16.100> this<00:03:16.220> one<00:03:16.400> when<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.880> do<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.420> one<00:03:17.540> step<00:03:17.720> left

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
is this one when you do it one step left

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.920 
is this one when you do it one step left
wait<00:03:18.890> for<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.160> get<00:03:19.250> Klingon<00:03:19.670> boom<00:03:20.180> there's

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
wait for it to get Klingon boom there's

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.500 
wait for it to get Klingon boom there's
that<00:03:21.230> other<00:03:22.190> safe<00:03:22.489> spot<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:22.970> if<00:03:23.329> they

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
that other safe spot is that if they

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.000 
that other safe spot is that if they
don't<00:03:23.660> get<00:03:23.780> stuck<00:03:24.019> here<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.470> they're<00:03:24.799> right

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
don't get stuck here and they're right

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.160 
don't get stuck here and they're right
here<00:03:25.400> you're<00:03:26.060> going<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.209> want<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.510> go<00:03:26.630> over

here you're going to want to go over
here<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.769> then<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.370> could<00:03:28.489> attack<00:03:28.700> them<00:03:28.850> here

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
here and then you could attack them here

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.410 
here and then you could attack them here
as<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:29.420> strata<00:03:29.780> straight<00:03:30.250> angle<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:32.060> right<00:03:32.269> now

as a strata straight angle but right now
is<00:03:32.600> what<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:32.840> do<00:03:32.989> there<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:34.340> can<00:03:34.519> see<00:03:34.670> iron
