inches<00:01:46.030> in<00:01:46.299> height<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.900> mean<00:01:47.080> sorry<00:01:47.439> 5<00:01:47.860> inches

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
inches in height I mean sorry 5 inches

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.190 
inches in height I mean sorry 5 inches
in<00:01:48.280> height<00:01:48.549> and<00:01:48.610> then<00:01:48.909> 2.5<00:01:49.479> inches<00:01:49.840> in<00:01:49.990> width

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
in height and then 2.5 inches in width

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.550 
in height and then 2.5 inches in width
so<00:01:50.830> it<00:01:51.009> is<00:01:51.189> it's<00:01:51.820> very<00:01:51.880> very<00:01:52.150> much<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.930> tiny<00:01:53.259> bag

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
so it is it's very very much a tiny bag

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.330 
so it is it's very very much a tiny bag
but<00:01:54.340> um<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.330> can<00:01:55.689> fit<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.500> much<00:01:56.799> more<00:01:57.040> than<00:01:57.220> you

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
but um it can fit so much more than you

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.359 
but um it can fit so much more than you
think<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:57.790> much<00:01:58.750> more<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.110> back<00:01:59.259> has<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.590> pocket

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
think so much more the back has a pocket

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.390 
think so much more the back has a pocket
on<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.790> back<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.680> signature<00:02:03.100> turn

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
on the back and then the signature turn

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.450 
on the back and then the signature turn
lock<00:02:03.579> on<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.880> front<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.479> this<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:05.259> in<00:02:05.950> caviar

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
lock on the front and this is in caviar

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.779 
lock on the front and this is in caviar
also<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:06.909> forgot<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.720> mention<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.459> as

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
also I forgot to mention that and so as

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.399 
also I forgot to mention that and so as
you<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.000> see<00:02:10.269> I<00:02:10.299> have<00:02:10.479> quite<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> bit<00:02:11.049> of<00:02:11.140> stuff

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
you can see I have quite a bit of stuff

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.650 
you can see I have quite a bit of stuff
in<00:02:11.560> here<00:02:11.829> and<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.340> could<00:02:12.519> probably<00:02:12.760> still<00:02:12.939> fit

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
in here and I could probably still fit

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690 
in here and I could probably still fit
a little<00:02:13.810> bit<00:02:13.900> more<00:02:14.140> like<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:15.100> always<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.670> a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
a little bit more like I always have a

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.300

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
snack with me I'm on the go so when I

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.650 
snack with me I'm on the go so when I
bring<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.820> work<00:02:18.940> every<00:02:19.240> day<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.390> would

bring this to work every day I would

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.540 
bring this to work every day I would
have<00:02:19.690> like<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:19.990> Clif<00:02:20.350> Bar<00:02:20.590> resting<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.280> top

have like a Clif Bar resting on the top
and<00:02:21.940> it<00:02:22.360> would<00:02:22.450> fit<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:22.840> nicely<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.460> just<00:02:24.730> if

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850

much and I know in my unboxing video I

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.040 
much and I know in my unboxing video I
was<00:02:57.820> worried<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.420> was<00:02:58.480> too<00:02:58.540> short<00:02:58.960> and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
little too short

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.090 
little too short

really<00:03:03.790> really<00:03:04.180> loved<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:05.050> know<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.650> a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
really really loved it I I know it is a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.920 
really really loved it I I know it is a
little<00:03:05.800> bit<00:03:06.010> shorter<00:03:06.400> than<00:03:06.670> most<00:03:07.360> crossbody

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
little bit shorter than most crossbody

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.990 
little bit shorter than most crossbody
bags<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.500> really<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.640> length<00:03:09.850> that

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
bags but I really like the length that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.150 
bags but I really like the length that
falls<00:03:10.300> out<00:03:10.510> because<00:03:10.660> it's<00:03:11.020> very<00:03:11.650> easy<00:03:12.010> to

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
falls out because it's very easy to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.040 
falls out because it's very easy to
access<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.790> get<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.180> out<00:03:13.270> of<00:03:13.390> your<00:03:13.510> bag<00:03:13.690> and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
access to get in and out of your bag and

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.220 
access to get in and out of your bag and
I<00:03:15.010> actually<00:03:15.670> like<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.450> shorter<00:03:16.780> crossbody

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
I actually like the shorter crossbody

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.560 
I actually like the shorter crossbody
look<00:03:17.500> which<00:03:17.770> I'm<00:03:18.070> really<00:03:18.400> really<00:03:18.550> happy<00:03:19.240> about

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
look which I'm really really happy about

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.699 
look which I'm really really happy about
because<00:03:20.020> there's<00:03:20.170> nothing<00:03:20.350> worse<00:03:20.530> than

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
because there's nothing worse than

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.260 
because there's nothing worse than
getting<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.220> bag<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.670> know<00:03:21.790> cuz<00:03:22.000> when<00:03:22.150> you're

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
beautiful and I would never turn it down

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.370

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
that would probably never happen and I

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.890 
that would probably never happen and I
feel<00:06:16.620> like<00:06:16.860> it<00:06:17.099> looks<00:06:17.130> too<00:06:17.639> closely<00:06:17.940> similar

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
feel like it looks too closely similar

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.120 
feel like it looks too closely similar
to<00:06:19.260> the<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:21.140> actual<00:06:22.140> like<00:06:22.530> medium<00:06:22.890> large

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130

flaps<00:06:23.580> and<00:06:23.789> the<00:06:23.849> Jumbo
