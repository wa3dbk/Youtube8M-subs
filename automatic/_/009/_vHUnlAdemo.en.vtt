against<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:19.580> adults<00:00:20.020> because<00:00:21.020> they<00:00:21.140> can<00:00:21.320> hit

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
against the adults because they can hit

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.800 
against the adults because they can hit
the<00:00:21.619> ball<00:00:21.650> quite<00:00:22.070> hard<00:00:22.310> it'd<00:00:22.520> be<00:00:22.730> good<00:00:23.540> game

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
the ball quite hard it'd be good game

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.780 
the ball quite hard it'd be good game
and<00:00:24.110> there<00:00:24.650> should<00:00:24.829> be<00:00:24.919> some<00:00:25.099> skill<00:00:25.400> i'm<00:00:25.550> on

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
and there should be some skill i'm on

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.179 
and there should be some skill i'm on
the<00:00:26.210> pitch<00:00:26.419> it's<00:00:26.960> a<00:00:27.110> bit<00:00:27.739> harder<00:00:28.099> because

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
the pitch it's a bit harder because

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.580 
the pitch it's a bit harder because
they're<00:00:28.489> bigger<00:00:28.880> people<00:00:29.329> a<00:00:29.540> lot<00:00:29.930> bigger<00:00:30.200> and

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
they're bigger people a lot bigger and

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.979 
they're bigger people a lot bigger and
stronger<00:00:30.919> and<00:00:31.279> should<00:00:31.970> walk<00:00:32.180> all<00:00:32.390> over<00:00:32.540> I

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
stronger and should walk all over I

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.950 
stronger and should walk all over I
think<00:00:33.530> we<00:00:33.710> might<00:00:34.100> be<00:00:34.399> able<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.940> because<00:00:35.510> we<00:00:35.780> got

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
think we might be able to because we got

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.500 
think we might be able to because we got
fast<00:00:36.320> unless<00:00:36.560> the<00:00:36.950> youth<00:00:37.250> gonna<00:00:37.910> betray<00:00:38.270> my
