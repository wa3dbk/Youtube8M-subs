00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.769 

okay<00:00:01.469> let's<00:00:01.860> use<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:03.510> GDC<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.380> calculate<00:00:05.779> some

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
okay let's use the GDC to calculate some

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.200 
okay let's use the GDC to calculate some
of<00:00:06.899> these<00:00:06.960> problems<00:00:07.230> here<00:00:07.529> let's<00:00:07.740> do<00:00:08.210> square

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
of these problems here let's do square

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.009 
of these problems here let's do square
root<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.540> 6<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.929> 5<00:00:10.910> it's<00:00:11.910> pretty<00:00:12.179> basic<00:00:12.420> first

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
root of 6 to 5 it's pretty basic first

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:24.939 
root of 6 to 5 it's pretty basic first
you<00:00:13.139> turn<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> calculator<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:17.300> 10<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:19.939> okay

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.250 

so<00:00:25.949> first<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.430> put<00:00:28.279> seconds<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:30.080> then<00:00:31.080> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
so first you put seconds and then you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.299 
so first you put seconds and then you
push<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.710> button<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.309> which<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:33.829> x<00:00:34.829> squared

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
push this button here which is x squared

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.370 
push this button here which is x squared
but<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.910> blue<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> has<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.660> square<00:00:36.840> root<00:00:37.110> above

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
but in blue it has the square root above

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.630 
but in blue it has the square root above
it<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:38.879> put<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> number<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
it and then you just put the number and

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.470 
it and then you just put the number and
then<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.760> hit<00:00:41.879> enter<00:00:42.410> down<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:45.360> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
then you hit enter down here and then it

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.369 
then you hit enter down here and then it
gives<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> answer<00:00:46.079> 25<00:00:46.800> okay<00:00:48.110> let's<00:00:49.110> do

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
gives you the answer 25 okay let's do

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.770 
gives you the answer 25 okay let's do
something<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:49.829> difficult<00:00:50.570> let's<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.660> this

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
something more difficult let's do this

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
something more difficult let's do this
one<00:00:51.989> two<00:00:52.260> times<00:00:52.559> square<00:00:52.770> root<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.100> eight<00:00:53.280> times

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
one two times square root of eight times

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.619 
one two times square root of eight times
five<00:00:54.270> times<00:00:54.780> square<00:00:54.989> root<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> 2

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
five times square root of 2

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:11.990 
five times square root of 2
okay<00:00:58.879> 2<00:01:01.730> square<00:01:02.730> root<00:01:04.970> 8<00:01:10.280> let<00:01:11.280> me<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.549> use<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
okay 2 square root 8 let me just use the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.730 
okay 2 square root 8 let me just use the
arrow<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> square<00:01:13.380> root<00:01:13.560> sign

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
arrow to get out of the square root sign

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.429 
arrow to get out of the square root sign
and<00:01:14.540> then<00:01:15.540> we're<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.810> multiply<00:01:15.930> times

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and then we're going to multiply times

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.700 
and then we're going to multiply times
five<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:18.200> then<00:01:19.200> we're<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> multiply

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
five and then we're going to multiply

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.530 
five and then we're going to multiply
times<00:01:20.390> square<00:01:21.390> root<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:22.369> 2<00:01:26.119> push<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> arrow<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
times square root of 2 push the arrow to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.480 
times square root of 2 push the arrow to
get<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> square<00:01:28.170> root<00:01:28.350> again<00:01:28.590> press

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
get out of the square root again press

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.660 
get out of the square root again press
Enter

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
Enter

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.380 
Enter
get<00:01:32.670> 40<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.350> right

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.220 

yes<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:40.020> right<00:01:40.260> okay<00:01:41.630> let's<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> cube

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
yes that's right okay let's do a cube

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.640 
yes that's right okay let's do a cube
root<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> cube<00:01:45.720> root<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:47.270> 1728<00:01:48.650> so

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
root here so the cube root of 1728 so

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:59.480 
root here so the cube root of 1728 so
we'll<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:54.590> second<00:01:56.420> then<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:58.340> oops

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
we'll do second then we do oops

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.920 
we'll do second then we do oops
I'm<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.270> second<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:01.200> math<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.970> then<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.720> go

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
I'm not second do math and then we go

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.150 
I'm not second do math and then we go
find<00:02:04.590> these<00:02:05.100> cube<00:02:05.850> root<00:02:06.410> just<00:02:07.410> here<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.979> then

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
find these cube root just here and then

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.020 
find these cube root just here and then
we<00:02:11.340> put<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:12.000> seven<00:02:12.480> two<00:02:12.690> eight<00:02:13.880> just<00:02:14.880> hit

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
we put one seven two eight just hit

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.520 
we put one seven two eight just hit
enter<00:02:16.940> 12<00:02:17.940> let's<00:02:18.840> check<00:02:19.050> up<00:02:19.170> that's<00:02:19.350> right

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
enter 12 let's check up that's right

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.199 
enter 12 let's check up that's right
twelve<00:02:19.980> times<00:02:20.640> twelve<00:02:20.820> times<00:02:21.300> twelve<00:02:23.209> 1007

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
twelve times twelve times twelve 1007

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.120 
twelve times twelve times twelve 1007
228<00:02:24.660> another<00:02:25.230> way<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.440> could<00:02:25.560> do<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.980> you

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
228 another way you could do it is you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.550 
228 another way you could do it is you
could<00:02:26.250> go<00:02:26.280> 12<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.870> want<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.140> raise<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
could go 12 we want to raise it to the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.860 
could go 12 we want to raise it to the
third<00:02:28.650> power<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.300> we<00:02:30.390> could<00:02:30.570> do<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.900> with

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
third power so we could do that with

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.340 
third power so we could do that with
this<00:02:33.870> key<00:02:34.170> here<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.890> little<00:02:35.540> caret<00:02:36.540> arrow

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
this key here this little caret arrow

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.650 
this key here this little caret arrow
points<00:02:37.890> up<00:02:38.420> put<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> 3<00:02:40.760> enter<00:02:42.650> okay
