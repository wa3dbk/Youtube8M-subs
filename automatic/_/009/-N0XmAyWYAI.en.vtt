00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.270
 although the threat store is friend and 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.490
 still 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.850

 bang sounds random hit by 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.989
 him which unfortunately is zero 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.230
 since developed not brought this book to 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.270
 crazy using cheats can be seen 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.600
 colorful scene of the explosion of three military

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.860
 closes the view this time already on the lees 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.329
 it came to itself to put all that 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.329
 players rolled ppt 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.510
 this is how this drawing looks like 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.310
 it is not clear where these depend trembling 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.149
 worth turning 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.940
 apparently the diodes were a box here 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.479
 good decided to remove them did the left 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.479

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.960
 went through the burner 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.670
 for unknown reasons, go to the stadium 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.080
 we will show a small movie after which 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.810
 we move the MES 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.409
 however left and right of the entrance to 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.930

 gun with increased shopping in the game 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.510
 very rarely meet such a car 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.909
 like gas 66 kung 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.400
 1 is in the southeast of the base 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.359
 freedoms the rest are on through and i 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.359
 will show next 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.900
 in the trunk can blow themselves 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.189
 the game does not explain how sugar all the holes 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:30.139
 borman don't recognize the labeled arrow but also 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:32.360
 design documents that remained 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.340
 from the developers of the game can be deducted 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.710
 what was originally supposed 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.349
 the swamp doctor bandaged the eternal face and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.120
 so no one will recognize him 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.400
 usually the first helicopter falls anomalies 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.770
 but we can tweak all I hear when 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.770
 This hold on the location save items 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:57.989
 and the face of the main character has the same though 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:00.479
 that month this other person and scar 

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:02.609
 it does not have most likely developed a 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.449
 forgot to replace the face of the main character 

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:08.759
 left over from early builds angle 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.379
 guns divided into three parts forming 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.039
 some kind of radiation sign 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.959
 danger 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.539
 strange but if you throw out the gauss 

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:17.339
 inventory 2 will look very different 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.319
 despite the fact that in diodes 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.389
 both model hit which we keep in 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.509
 hands it which rocket engine amber 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.669
 had these cut on the trunk when we 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.259
 take up the score on his right side 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.719
 texture suddenly appears 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.849
 It is also noteworthy that inside each 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:37.439
 weapons except the voice has a model 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:39.929
 patrons of barons immediately fell down and out of 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:42.869
 land and yes in this game they can not be killed 

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:45.029
 only in clear skies and parts although in 

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:48.830
 Diodes is an art opportunity even in 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:52.370
 and special icons selected breeds 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.950
 but that's all if you liked it 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.970
 can you say my other videos or 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.070
 go to my site 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.070
