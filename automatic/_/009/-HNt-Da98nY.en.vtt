00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
i'm pretty sure that this is going to be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
i'm pretty sure that this is going to be
yeah<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:49.140> even<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.680> correct

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
yeah so this is not even there correct

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.789 
yeah so this is not even there correct
and<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:51.960> even<00:01:52.079> Emanuel<00:01:52.619> it's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799

just<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.009> quick<00:01:53.189> start<00:01:53.490> guy<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> show<00:01:54.119> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
just a quick start guy so to show you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.620 
just a quick start guy so to show you
the<00:01:54.390> menus<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.360> wrong

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the menus and this is for the wrong

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.899 
the menus and this is for the wrong
tablet<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.799> also<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.280> Chinese<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.820> it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
tablet so and it's also in Chinese so it

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.459 
tablet so and it's also in Chinese so it
will<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.149> she<00:02:00.299> put<00:02:00.479> this

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.050 

here<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.860> tablet<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.759> looks<00:02:05.969> like

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
here the tablet is and I just looks like

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.850 
here the tablet is and I just looks like
it's<00:02:06.299> white<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.170> kind<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.380> odd<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
it's white so that's kind of odd that it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.979 
it's white so that's kind of odd that it
was<00:02:07.950> labeled<00:02:08.280> black<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.599> will<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.810> coming

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
was labeled black so it will be coming

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.080 
was labeled black so it will be coming
in<00:02:10.229> black<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.590> white<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:12.209> know<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:13.430> just<00:02:14.430> at

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
in black and white you know just just at

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.780 
in black and white you know just just at
the<00:02:15.269> else<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.750> see<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.170> has<00:02:16.470> dual<00:02:16.920> send<00:02:17.190> someone

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the else I see it has dual send someone

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.970 
the else I see it has dual send someone
send<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.099> that's<00:02:20.099> under<00:02:20.670> this

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
