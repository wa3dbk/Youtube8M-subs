00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.930
 hello your dear world come back on 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.090
 my channel starts as announced 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.160
 today the first part of my abiball prom 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.320
 series series and in today's video 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.509
 Let's start with a hairstyle video 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.910
 I will give you three possible hairstyles 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.250
 vision abiball introduce you once 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.769
 my sister to me and all of you 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.750
 diana from the channel the fashion so have 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.699
 Her short hair is very long 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.320
 and medium-long hair and I will be you 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.360
 Beautiful curls conjure up and just enter 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.199
 few tips and tricks show you what 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.199
 you can wear like that 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.970
 you get beautiful with the first praise 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.380
 volume in the hair with the curls here 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.600
 I use the last- and from nomi 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.489
 curling set with the thickest tower 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.290
 So the one with the largest diameter 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.880
 of course, I give up heat protection before that 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.890
 my hair and then i start with the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.640
 back hair and work like that 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.170
 slow forward 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.119
 Here it is important the curling iron 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.080
 to wake up to the approach so you too 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.080
 nice volume gets 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.440
 a gate 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.030
 more 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.030
 Sir 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.330
 and so you work your way to the last one 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.670
 strand on the face in front 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.960
 then the top coat is here and here 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.060
 you really try until the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.979
 approach the curls with the wrap 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.840
 Hair also gets nice for volume and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.010
 that you will loosen up everything a bit 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.010
 and have to build it 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.470
 jun 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.300
 achieve 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.460
 on the other side you do that 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.170
 same by having one 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.390
 I have a side vertex here 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.590
 Therefore , divide a little more hair under 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.590
 I put this in under and decker 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.260
 No 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.260
 where are 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.400
 and all are lured into the same here 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.920
 direction turned and the pony of course 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.920
 also and that is then the finished looks 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.099
 now before 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.780
 the next hairstyle does not even boho look 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.580
 I'll do that to my sister here 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.290
 I use a tower of the above one 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.330
 is a bit thicker and down 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.950
 so a bit thinner and I pull 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.840
 after that, the curls wrap like that 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.040
 just so it's not quite like that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 becomes curly 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.190
 all 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.220
 lead 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.319
 I do not care 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.330
 against 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.830
 and this look fits great, for example 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.660
 to a somewhat casual dress 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.880
 happened really good fit here 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.290
 such a flower wreath belongs to mine 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.360
 sister but you can actually 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.400
 find anywhere or even do it yourself 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.750
 because most currently has one 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.180
 bit dry I use here 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.500
 this argan oil from omi this oil 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.910
 donates the hair tips much 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.800
 Moisture making it all one 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.800
 looks a bit healthier and shiny 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.230
 problem 2 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.070
 shoemaker 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.900
 The next hairstyle is great for 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.239
 I found medium-length hair for this 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.410
 just dianas hair perfect and i have 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.940
 you just have such a deep 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.919
 pulled side vertex 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.930
 the difference was lure to my 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.560
 that I only point their bottom here 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.120
 Curls 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.010
 This will not cause corkscrews 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.030
 lure but only very light 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.030
 princess in waves 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.770
 so the curls are so beautifully separated 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.840
 stay and not become one 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.790
 I curl up the curls 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.860
 strands of the upper decker just in 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.910
 the other direction and stay that way 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.910
 the curls are nicely separated 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.450
 By the way, only me has 40 again 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.220
 percent on the whole page with the 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.110
 Circulatory crisis given 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.730
 or if you are styling for this 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.590
 set should interest then gets 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.780
 give her another $ 100 discount 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.340
 the kot minikrise blog all links and 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.820
 but you can also find infos in 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.820
 the infobox 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.540
 then I take one of our hair 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.860
 I tear it in three small ones again 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.860
 wisps subdivide 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.860
 this strand may be whole 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.930
 just up to the end and up 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.490
 clamp it on the other side like that 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.469
 that it looks like you have one 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.520
 hairband and thus the braided 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.759
 stink so a bit fuller 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.990
 It looks a bit different 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.699
 and the side parting I fix 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.860
 just with a bit of hairspray and 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.319
 So you already have a finished one 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.210
 look of super nice looks and so on 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.210
 there are a few processes feeling 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.330
 and that's it with this one 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.250
 look dianas hair remind me so 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.250
 little bit of princess waves 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.880

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.870
