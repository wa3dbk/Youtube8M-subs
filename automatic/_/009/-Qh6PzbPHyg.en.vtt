00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 however here is that the movement of the ruocco 5 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.000
 stars to you 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.730
 here we are gianluca yes there are several 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.130
 inputs to reporters are scattered 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.620
 but we do not have it from here at least 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.109
 having arrived carla ruocco movement 5 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.250
 stars we followed together 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.730
 the intervention of matteo renzi dal 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.949
 what it seemed and quirinale 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.170
 especially you who have not wanted 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.849
 meet the president of Naples 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.510
 you will still meet the premier 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.820
 in the meantime good morning everyone 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.820
 I want to emphasize that the third government 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.480
 even the Italians suffer without being able 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.020
 vote 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.320
 so this is very serious to say 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.500
 matteo renzi attacks is part of a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.260
 party that owes a billion euros of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850
 electoral reimbursements to Italians mi 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.280
 I expected that at least given the urgency 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.820
 of measures he had in his pocket 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.010
 check 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 just to start a dialogue 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 with us to return this 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.030
 immense mass of money that this is the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.559
 condition but let's say this 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.150
 could be a good start because 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.320
 among other things, they begin in these months 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.740
 voted on the measures 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.170
 scandalous that do not fit with the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.150
 rebirth of a country absolutely and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.670
 they did not vote on our proposals 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.299
 that instead went to meet the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.610
 citizens 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.290
 I'm talking about reducing the tax burden 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.560
 I speak for example of elimination 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.509
 of the irap that lies there 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.780
 action finances and that instead was 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:33.049
 outclassed by the decline that even Renzians 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.869
 voted to the banks by 7 billion e 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.829
 half of our citizens' money if 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.899
 an invitation will come you will participate in 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.100
 certainly a natural dialogue 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.439
 we will consider was 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.869
 however, I repeat that our dialogue is 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.360
 based on the agreements the restitution of the 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.920
 money to citizens the real reduction 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.990
 of salaries 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.569
 the abolition of the provinces have done 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.459
 pretend to make fun of citizens 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.679
 they say they abolish them and then to the 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.720
 room they don't abolish them I can 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.340
 confirm all this these are i 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.750
 dialogues this is the dialogue that takes place 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.939
 establish with us citizens otherwise 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.380
 what dialogue and if we must collaborate with 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.039
 teasing people we don't 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.040
 we are 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.049

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.049
