00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.269
 hello today i will tell you 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.929
 my hair history how to grow fast 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.089
 long hair really well if so 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.850
 look we are not very long 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.870
 hair now they are just below the shoulder blades course 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:24.560
 1 premiere but i think that 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:27.400
 during the time that passed 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.070
 fast enough from russia and when i 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.230
 visited his master went 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.660
 the hair salon it was in early march 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.600
 This year I did not go to this at all. 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.579
 to my master and when i came she 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.429
 very surprised that I have so 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.280
 quickly during this time the hair grew 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:52.760
 I have seen the screensaver was korea 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.890
 while this photo is actually 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.079
 I was a little shorter somewhere like this 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.760
 here is korea and during this time here is the end of 2011 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.829
 and so today I have now 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.180
 such is the length of the hair despite the fact that 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:11.270
 March I shortened my hair by 7 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.939
 centimeters somewhere so generally want 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.180
 tell you what i did and what 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.219
 I therefore used the means to whom 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.969
 interesting stay with me and everyone 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:25.729
 I wish you a pleasant viewing 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:27.920
 so the first thing I did I did not attend 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.890
 beauty salon that is, I did not go to 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.979
 to his master on the one hand it seems 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.340
 and not bad on the other hand all the same 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.429
 need some care 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.850
 yourself when you don't compare yours 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.350
 tips and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.569
 really this here it works when 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.049
 you do not attend the beauty itself because 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.420
 which I think is not necessary very often 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.640
 trim your tips you actually 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.990
 so never grow long hair 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.000
 but since you do not go to the salon example 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.890
 beauty me trim your tips 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.950
 then naturally need special care 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.289
 tip oh i used the first time 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.670
 here is such a syvortka for split ends 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.540
 hair tips estel professional 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.110
 i liked i mean i half 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.370
 used but she's good really 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 somehow glues your ends but I donâ€™t 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.709
 liked the effect in terms of what it is 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.920
 I dried my hair ends so I 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.200
 stopped and use it yet what I want 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.980
 notice that I have split ends 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.139
 the tips themselves have never been then 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.950
 I probably have no but my hair 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:48.430
 predisposition to split ends 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.799
 I do not know how all this is connected, but I 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.870
 very happy about this, I have the means 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.329
 I use mainly for prevention 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.510
 here this means you did not suit me but 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.670
 maybe someone to someone she 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.450
 I will like the second tool that I 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.450
 I use about two months already a little 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.200
 less is it regenerating 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.250
 serum for brittle and split ends 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.530
 from hipertin italian professional 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.640
 firm here from this serum I'm full 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.070
 delighted she looks like this 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.360
 a jar of 50 milliliters 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.030
 enough saturated aroma can 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.610
 someone doesn't like serum 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.910
 amazing she firstly does not dry out 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.920
 your tips she really somehow them 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.200
 moisturizes while the hair is so smooth 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.840
 shiny i really like i use 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.720
 it is on the ends of the hair that you literally need 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:51.900
 one one two drops and just rub in 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.170
 tip so here it is absolutely not 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.940
 fatten your hair well of course if you donâ€™t 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.890
 will be 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.020
 overdo it with the amount of it 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.750
 funds can also be applied to the entire 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.450
 length and this means by the way you can 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.700
 add to paint if you paint 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.560
 hair then you just unreal 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.250
 shiny hair they will 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.350
 smooth 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.680
 I guarantee you this because the video 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.419
 the result when we shot a master class 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.820
 ducks perks 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.970
 In general, the serum is super cute very 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.190
 like and also in that period when i 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.520
 I started to grow hair I used 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.200
 enough budget funds this 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.200
 shampoo and lotion hair growth activators 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.389
 these tools really helped me 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.849
 grow out quickly grow hair 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.560
 the result was not long in coming 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:50.220
 hair started really really fast 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.580
 grow and shampoo lotions I liked 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.340
 but you are like an entrance and there is no means that the whole 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.229
 I put them twos because 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.690
 silk because I have after shampoo 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.229
 the hair was not very dandelion 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.349
 quickly 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.900
 then they are severely extinguished no they are 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.620
 my hair is generally thin and they have 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.110
 propensity to fluffiness but the letter will come out 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.599
 lotion I liked the fact that he did not 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.090
 fatten your hair as it often happens 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.909
 with indelible and what consequences 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.490
 which you put on the roots rub in 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:26.000
 the roots of this lotion I liked and these 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.120
 the tools really work therefore 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.530
 Look who does not want to spend 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.810
 big amount of money and wants 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.789
 really get the result lotions 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.220
 and shampoo hair growth activators 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.280

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.210

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.969

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:02.219
 about this shampoo why do you have now 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:04.530

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:07.860
 you have a problem like falling out 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.870
 the use of hair shampoos are here 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.130
 precisely which prevents falling out 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.729
 hair while they accelerate the growth too 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.669
 hair they strengthen the bow 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:21.849
 your face and your hair begin faster 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.229

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:47.259
 the same video told me now 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:48.969
 I use as reinforcing effect 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.969
 there is to reinforce this result 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:53.740
 which I received once a week 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:56.169

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:34.330
