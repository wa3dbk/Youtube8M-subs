strategy but anyway let's begin so i

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.070 
strategy but anyway let's begin so i
thought<00:00:15.000> i<00:00:15.059> would<00:00:15.120> start<00:00:15.509> off<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.870> my

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
thought i would start off with my

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.290 
thought i would start off with my
favorite<00:00:16.160> strategy<00:00:17.160> on<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.670> map<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.180> it

favorite strategy on this map and it

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.330 
favorite strategy on this map and it
would<00:00:18.390> be<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.690> area<00:00:19.140> right<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.439> when<00:00:20.250> I'm

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
would be this area right here when I'm

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
this area right here I refer to it as

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.929 
this area right here I refer to it as
big<00:00:24.720> hole<00:00:25.050> that's<00:00:25.619> basically<00:00:26.070> because<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
big hole that's basically because of the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.150 
big hole that's basically because of the
big<00:00:27.119> hole<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.779> center<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.010> gotta

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
big hole in the center but all you gotta

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.700 
big hole in the center but all you gotta
do<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.400> basically<00:00:30.029> run<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.779> crescent<00:00:31.470> moon

do is basically run a crescent moon

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.459 
do is basically run a crescent moon
shape<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.489> train<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.059> between<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.050> area

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
shape of a train in between this area

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.010 
shape of a train in between this area
right<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.850> circle<00:00:36.420> over<00:00:36.809> there

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
right here in that circle over there

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.260 
right here in that circle over there
you'll<00:00:37.290> notice<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.829> jump<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.430> far<00:00:38.730> end<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you'll notice I jump to this far end and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.299 
you'll notice I jump to this far end and
then<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> run<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.290> other<00:00:40.530> side<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> map

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
then I run to the other side of the map

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.979 
then I run to the other side of the map
and<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:41.850> occasionally<00:00:42.270> I'll<00:00:42.750> come<00:00:42.960> down

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and then occasionally I'll come down

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.049 
and then occasionally I'll come down
here<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> things<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.940> can

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
here and then one of the things you can

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
here and then one of the things you can
do<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.510> actually<00:00:45.570> round<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.440> zombies<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:47.010> here

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
do is actually round the zombies up here

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.990 
do is actually round the zombies up here
go<00:00:47.969> down<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.960> shoot<00:00:49.200> them<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.500> your

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
go down there then shoot them with your

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.220 
go down there then shoot them with your
squiggly<00:00:51.000> fire<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.539> believe<00:00:51.750> that's<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
squiggly fire I believe that's what the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
squiggly fire I believe that's what the
guns<00:00:52.410> called<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.550> from<00:00:53.879> there<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.449> can

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
guns called and then from there you can

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240 
guns called and then from there you can
kill<00:00:54.989> them<00:00:55.289> without<00:00:55.469> having<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.039> worry<00:00:56.219> about

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
kill them without having to worry about

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.729 
kill them without having to worry about
getting<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.730> book<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.390> goo<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> area

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
getting this book the goo in the area

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.560 
getting this book the goo in the area
that<00:00:58.800> you're<00:00:58.980> training<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> one<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that you're training and one of the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.900 
that you're training and one of the
issues<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> spot<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.070> when<00:01:02.670> you're

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
issues with this spot is when you're

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
issues with this spot is when you're
shooting<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.449> zombies<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> squiggly

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
shooting the zombies with the squiggly

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.070 
shooting the zombies with the squiggly
fire<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:06.180> kill<00:01:06.510> them<00:01:06.659> what's<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
fire and you kill them what's going to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.630 
fire and you kill them what's going to
happen<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> get<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> ground

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
happen is your to get you on the ground

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580 
happen is your to get you on the ground
and<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.939> goop<00:01:09.180> cause<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> slip<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> fall

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and that goop cause you to slip and fall

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.460 
and that goop cause you to slip and fall
and<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.210> possibility<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.200> goo

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and there is the possibility of that goo

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
and there is the possibility of that goo
being<00:01:13.830> too<00:01:14.130> close<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.939> wall<00:01:15.180> right<00:01:15.450> there

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
being too close to that wall right there

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.020 
being too close to that wall right there
you'll<00:01:16.320> end<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.740> actually<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> wall<00:01:18.000> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you'll end up actually not the wall that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.149 
you'll end up actually not the wall that
hole<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> wall<00:01:19.110> right<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:20.009> could

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
hole in the wall right there you could

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.219 
hole in the wall right there you could
possibly<00:01:20.310> slip<00:01:20.820> right<00:01:21.090> through<00:01:21.150> fall<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> die

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
possibly slip right through fall and die

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.260 
possibly slip right through fall and die
although<00:01:22.650> I've<00:01:23.040> yet<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.759> happened

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
although I've yet to see that happened

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.690 
although I've yet to see that happened
to<00:01:24.360> me<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> were<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> very

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
to me and if it were it would be a very

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.850 
to me and if it were it would be a very
rare<00:01:27.090> occurrence<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
rare occurrence and I really like this

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.490 
rare occurrence and I really like this
area<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.210> how<00:01:30.420> open<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> but

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
area just because of how open it is but

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.560 
area just because of how open it is but
another<00:01:32.100> thing<00:01:32.369> that's<00:01:32.549> cool<00:01:32.759> about<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.180> if

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
another thing that's cool about it is if

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.300 
another thing that's cool about it is if
you<00:01:33.689> want<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.020> use<00:01:34.200> an<00:01:34.409> assault<00:01:34.710> rifle<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:35.070> an

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you want to use an assault rifle or an

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.940 
you want to use an assault rifle or an
lmg<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:36.270> any<00:01:36.479> machine<00:01:36.900> gun<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.770> hold

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
lmg really any machine gun you can hold

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590 
lmg really any machine gun you can hold
off<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.430> without<00:01:38.610> too<00:01:38.970> much<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> problem

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
off here without too much of a problem

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.179 
off here without too much of a problem
although<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> later<00:01:40.619> rounds<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.040> will

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
although in the later rounds that will

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.670 
although in the later rounds that will
get<00:01:41.400> harder<00:01:41.600> unless<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:43.409> good

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
get harder unless you have a very good

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.679 
get harder unless you have a very good
gun<00:01:43.950> although<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.060> zombies<00:01:45.420> can't

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
gun although because the zombies can't

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.359 
gun although because the zombies can't
spawn<00:01:45.990> behind<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.799> they<00:01:46.920> can't<00:01:47.189> get

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
spawn behind you and they can't get

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
spawn behind you and they can't get
around<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.329> will<00:01:48.450> only<00:01:48.600> come<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
around you they will only come at you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.139 
around you they will only come at you
from<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.500> direction<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.520> result<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
from one direction so as a result it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.240 
from one direction so as a result it
will<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.600> fairly<00:01:51.930> easy<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.560> shoot<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.890> zombies

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
will be fairly easy to shoot the zombies

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.039 
will be fairly easy to shoot the zombies
from<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.180> let's<00:01:54.360> move<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> next

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
from here but let's move on to the next

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.469 
from here but let's move on to the next
spot<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.770> want<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> show<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> guys<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.329> is

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
spot I want to show you guys so this is

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.600 
spot I want to show you guys so this is
a<00:01:57.509> temple<00:01:57.960> section<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> map<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.430> is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
a temple section of the map and this is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.760 
a temple section of the map and this is
a<00:01:59.640> pretty<00:02:00.000> good<00:02:00.210> spot<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> Train<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.350> fairly

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
a pretty good spot to Train it's fairly

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.910 
a pretty good spot to Train it's fairly
easy<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.560> you'll<00:02:04.560> notice

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
easy but I don't like it you'll notice

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
easy but I don't like it you'll notice
it's<00:02:05.130> very<00:02:05.460> open<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.149> plenty<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.540> spaces<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it's very open you plenty of spaces to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.749 
it's very open you plenty of spaces to
run<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.590> unfortunately<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> biggest

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
run but unfortunately one of the biggest

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.479 
run but unfortunately one of the biggest
problems<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.509> find<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.140> area<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.770> there

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
problems I find with this area is there

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.370 
problems I find with this area is there
are<00:02:11.730> too<00:02:11.970> many<00:02:12.180> things<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.690> get<00:02:12.810> clipped<00:02:13.110> on

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
are too many things to get clipped on

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.350 
are too many things to get clipped on
and<00:02:13.530> there's<00:02:13.740> not<00:02:14.100> enough<00:02:14.430> space<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.760> make<00:02:15.120> one

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and there's not enough space to make one

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.440 
and there's not enough space to make one
open<00:02:15.840> train<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.440> why<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.910> one<00:02:18.210> big

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
open train and why you can do one big

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.480 
open train and why you can do one big
train<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.260> sort<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.770> jumbled<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
train and it's sort of jumbled and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.820 
train and it's sort of jumbled and
there's<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.150> set<00:02:21.600> path<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.800> can

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
there's not really one set path you can

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.310 
there's not really one set path you can
train<00:02:23.460> here<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.180> very<00:02:24.210> possible<00:02:24.900> i

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
train here and it is very possible i

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.380 
train here and it is very possible i
mean<00:02:25.500> i<00:02:25.650> believe<00:02:26.010> yoteslaya<00:02:26.400> got<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.240> to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
mean i believe yoteslaya got up to

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.020 
mean i believe yoteslaya got up to
around<00:02:27.570> 80<00:02:27.900> training<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.710> here<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.190> i<00:02:29.850> don't

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
around 80 training in here and i don't

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.850 
around 80 training in here and i don't
think<00:02:30.060> he<00:02:30.270> had<00:02:30.390> too<00:02:30.540> many<00:02:30.690> problems<00:02:30.860> although

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
think he had too many problems although

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.610 
think he had too many problems although
it's<00:02:32.610> much<00:02:33.090> safer<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> other<00:02:34.170> room<00:02:34.470> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
it's much safer in the other room and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.410 
it's much safer in the other room and
this<00:02:34.980> really<00:02:35.160> isn't<00:02:35.400> too<00:02:35.640> bad<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:36.240> if

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
this really isn't too bad and then if

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.970 
this really isn't too bad and then if
you<00:02:36.570> wanted<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:36.990> could<00:02:37.110> take<00:02:37.560> an<00:02:37.680> assault

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you wanted you could take an assault

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.400 
you wanted you could take an assault
rifle<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.490> go<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.600> those<00:02:39.750> pillars<00:02:40.200> and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
rifle and go on one of those pillars and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.310 
rifle and go on one of those pillars and
shoot<00:02:40.800> from<00:02:41.010> there<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.360> have<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.870> options

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
shoot from there so you have the options

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.140 
shoot from there so you have the options
to<00:02:43.560> use<00:02:43.770> weapons<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:44.370> assault<00:02:44.640> rifles<00:02:44.970> you

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
to use weapons like assault rifles you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.810 
to use weapons like assault rifles you
can<00:02:45.390> train<00:02:45.750> with<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.350> school<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> fire<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.550> you

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
can train with the school of fire so you

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.430 
can train with the school of fire so you
do<00:02:47.970> have<00:02:48.090> some<00:02:48.150> options<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.810> here<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.320> you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
do have some options in here and if you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.840 
do have some options in here and if you
are<00:02:49.650> looking<00:02:49.800> for<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.160> little<00:02:50.280> bit<00:02:50.460> more<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.730> a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
are looking for a little bit more of a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.970 
are looking for a little bit more of a
challenge<00:02:51.060> then<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.720> train<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.470> big<00:02:52.710> hole

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
challenge then to train in the big hole

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.010 
challenge then to train in the big hole
area<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.000> actually<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.480> pretty<00:02:54.630> good<00:02:54.720> spot

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
area this is actually a pretty good spot

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.960 
area this is actually a pretty good spot
and<00:02:55.350> one<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.770> best<00:02:55.950> spots<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.550> map<00:02:56.580> and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and one of the best spots on the map and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.940 
and one of the best spots on the map and
die<00:02:57.630> rise<00:02:57.900> doesn't<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.470> too<00:02:58.650> many<00:02:58.800> options

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
die rise doesn't have too many options

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.370 
die rise doesn't have too many options
so<00:02:59.550> if<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.940> were<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.090> do<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.570> two-player<00:03:01.050> game

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
so if you were to do a two-player game

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.140 
so if you were to do a two-player game
and<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.310> your<00:03:02.430> friends<00:03:02.700> both<00:03:02.850> want<00:03:03.090> to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
pretty well although one of the biggest

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.580 
pretty well although one of the biggest
problems<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.880> if<00:03:18.210> you<00:03:18.390> are<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.660> fall<00:03:18.870> back<00:03:19.140> from

who's who / again this is actually a
pretty<00:03:32.400> good<00:03:32.490> perk<00:03:32.850> probably<00:03:33.540> one<00:03:34.080> of<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
pretty good perk probably one of the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.050 
pretty good perk probably one of the
best<00:03:34.410> ones<00:03:34.680> we've<00:03:34.770> seen<00:03:34.980> in<00:03:35.430> zombies<00:03:35.850> in<00:03:36.000> a

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
while although it does negate the fact

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.130 
while although it does negate the fact
of<00:03:38.550> quick<00:03:39.000> revive<00:03:39.270> so<00:03:39.510> keep<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:39.930> mind

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140
