so<00:01:05.970> when<00:01:06.810> typically<00:01:07.560> when<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.830> read<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
so when typically when you read the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.300 
so when typically when you read the
cards<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> spread<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.020> layout<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.830> each

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
cards you do a spread a layout and each

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.750 
cards you do a spread a layout and each
position<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> card<00:01:13.110> falls<00:01:13.409> into<00:01:13.619> holds<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
position that a card falls into holds a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
position that a card falls into holds a
specific<00:01:15.390> meaning<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.590> example<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
specific meaning so for example in the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340 
specific meaning so for example in the
Celtic<00:01:17.400> Cross<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.939> had<00:01:18.119> positions<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
Celtic Cross you had positions for the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.570 
Celtic Cross you had positions for the
future<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> past<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:21.060> outcome<00:01:22.340> hopes<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
future of the past the outcome hopes and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.670 
future of the past the outcome hopes and
fears<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.479> end<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.930> then<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> would<00:01:25.470> read

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
fears of the end and then you would read

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.920 
fears of the end and then you would read
that<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.340> card<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.060> position<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that the card in that position in the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.240 
that the card in that position in the
context<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.920> position<00:01:29.430> now<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.890> the

context of that position now the one the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
context of that position now the one the
way<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.700> were<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> free-form<00:01:34.020> method

way that I do were is a free-form method

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.910 
way that I do were is a free-form method
where<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.040> no<00:01:35.659> position<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.560> pull

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
where there is no position you just pull

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.580 
where there is no position you just pull

intuition or the intuitive a spec of
reading<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.989> when<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.200> pull<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.530> three<00:02:15.709> cards

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
reading so when you pull the three cards

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.490 
reading so when you pull the three cards
and<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.519> read<00:02:16.700> them<00:02:17.140> without<00:02:18.140> any

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and you have to read them without any

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.070 
and you have to read them without any
spread<00:02:19.340> positions<00:02:19.849> you<00:02:20.000> have<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.720> rely<00:02:21.019> on

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
spread positions you have to rely on

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.380 
spread positions you have to rely on
your<00:02:21.349> intuition<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:22.580> also<00:02:22.849> some<00:02:24.130> logical

the<00:02:50.840> certain<00:02:51.410> area<00:02:51.769> certain<00:02:52.190> things<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:53.000> know

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
the certain area certain things you know

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.809 
the certain area certain things you know
that<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:54.110> can<00:02:54.260> come<00:02:54.500> up<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.640> should

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
that that can come up that you should

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.240 
that that can come up that you should
pay<00:02:55.970> attention<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:56.810> what<00:02:56.920> those<00:02:57.920> things

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
pay attention to and what those things

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.930 
pay attention to and what those things
would<00:02:58.640> trigger<00:02:59.170> intuitively<00:03:00.610> that's<00:03:01.610> the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
would trigger intuitively that's the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.360 
would trigger intuitively that's the
thing<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.390> then<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:04.040> would<00:03:04.220> have

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
thing that then you that you would have

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.110 
thing that then you that you would have
to<00:03:04.640> figure<00:03:05.480> out<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.930> provide<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.590> logical

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
to figure out I provide you the logical

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.449 
to figure out I provide you the logical
framework<00:03:08.120> for<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.959> reading<00:03:09.260> which<00:03:10.040> then

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
framework for the reading which then

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.789 
framework for the reading which then
should<00:03:11.000> prompt<00:03:11.359> your<00:03:11.510> intuitive<00:03:12.109> responses

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
should prompt your intuitive responses

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.080 
should prompt your intuitive responses
so<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:15.980> way<00:03:16.069> I<00:03:16.100> like<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.670> read<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
so that is the way I like to read the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.199 
so that is the way I like to read the
cards<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.630> find<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.109> very<00:03:18.290> effective<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.760> works

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
cards I find it very effective it works

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.710 
cards I find it very effective it works
for<00:03:20.510> almost<00:03:21.109> any<00:03:21.290> situation<00:03:21.530> any<00:03:22.069> question<00:03:22.720> it

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
for almost any situation any question it

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.990 
for almost any situation any question it
you<00:03:24.319> know<00:03:24.440> I've<00:03:24.560> done<00:03:24.829> for<00:03:25.130> for<00:03:25.519> four<00:03:25.700> years

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
you know I've done for for four years

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.680 
you know I've done for for four years
now<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.239> think

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
now I think

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.289 
now I think
or<00:03:27.139> almost<00:03:27.380> five<00:03:27.769> years<00:03:27.910> reading<00:03:28.910> this<00:03:29.090> way

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
or almost five years reading this way

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.930 
or almost five years reading this way
and<00:03:29.630> I've<00:03:29.840> had<00:03:30.049> great<00:03:30.829> results<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.549> if<00:03:31.790> you

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
and I've had great results so if you

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.640 
and I've had great results so if you
want<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.180> learn<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.600> read<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.959> cards<00:03:33.380> like<00:03:33.500> I

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
want to learn to read the cards like I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.789 
want to learn to read the cards like I
