00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everyone and everyone welcome to a 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.270
 new road video with friend today os 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.610
 I'm going to make a tag is the tag of the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.500
 christmas christmas tag and joined several 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.970
 questions here and there because good 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.310
 I have put together the ones that seemed to me 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.680
 more interesting and we go there maybe 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.870
 I should have done this tag before 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.610
 of the holidays like most of the 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.100
 youtubers but hey I'm a little 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.050
 free you already know so I do it almost 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.150
 with the holidays is finished and only 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.390
 kings so nothing the first question 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.920
 you like Christmas, yes, the truth 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.410
 I really like Christmas 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.570
 I like to hang out with people I like me 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.220
 I like the gifts I like that they have 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.770
 little lights on the street I like the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.899
 Christmas trees and if in general I 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.420
 like Christmas the next question 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.090
 is that you are more of santa claus or of kings 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.860
 because when I was very very little I 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.230
 I liked it made me a lot more illusion 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.500
 the Kings 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.660
 later when I was older 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.370
 we did was overtake the gifts 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.680
 because many times they gave us things 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.750
 well that we could enjoy during the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.750
 Christmas as for a perfume or a 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.820
 dress for New Year's Eve and so on and now 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 we do it again in kings because no 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.600
 it gives us time 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.380
 the next question is the most 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.329
 asked for your childhood because it does not come 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.420
 many in the lead but I think that the 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.490
 more more more requested was a bicycle that 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.049
 finally the kings brought me so 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.689
 I think it was a bicycle 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.310
 rosa I wanted a bicycle plus the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.819
 Next question is what is your best 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.679
 I remember Christmas because I always 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.020
 tell this anecdote that seems to me 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.049
 super funny and very very funny and is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.520
 that a Christmas in which my father 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.409
 they gave away a huge turkey and at night 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.720
 when we are making dinner today 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.060
 liked to join the whole family in 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.830
 the kitchen to prepare dinner and my 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.780
 father took the turkey put it on top of the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.729
 table I prepare your surgical equipment 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.679
 because my father was a doctor and had 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.990
 there then the scalpel the tweezers and so on 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.959
 and it was great because when I know 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.030
 when I was going to debone the turkey, he took 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.190
 bug by the legs and said lady 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.690
 relax as if you were in the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.180
 gynecologist 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.860
 it's an anecdote that I always remember 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.800
 my father had a super personality 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.470
 fun was one of the most 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.930
 fun and with more charisma than I could 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.910
 know in my life so it's my 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.340
 favorite anecdote the following question 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.770
 is that decoration you like more silver and 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.350
 blue or gold and red I like it 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.750
 gold and red is a bit like the classic 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.850
 and I love red is one of the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.310
 colors that I like the most my tree is 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.560
 decorated in gold and red and I think 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.930
 it's good that it's the most classic thing, 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.880
 that most of all life 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.420
 next question is poinsettia or 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.730
 New Year's Eve, I think I like it better 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.760
 poinsettia I always put myself as very 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.010
 nervous on New Year's Eve even what 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.860
 I'm a little bit nervous with the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.510
 theme of grapes and all that so I 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.790
 I think that I like more poinsettias 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.420
 as more calm 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.540
 I do not know more about relaxation the next question 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.670
 It is take the grapes or chokes you as 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.609
 normally what usually happens is that I 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.950
 laughs in the middle of the chimes 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.290
 I always laugh and in the end 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.840
 it spreads to everybody and we finish 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.849
 all laughing and all full of grapes 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.640
 all over my face so that's how it is 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.860
 what usually happens 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.770
 the next question is better sweet 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.870
 Christmas because I'm not very sweet 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.500
 I do not usually like Christmas 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.470
 as I eat a lot of foods of all 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.900
 the other seafood everything at the end the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.760
 Christmas sweets like they do not fit me and 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.880
 I do not like too much the nougat and 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.980
 marzipan or the yolks there is nothing like that 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.340
 call me a lot so in principle 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.890
 I'm not very sweet but I do not know if there was 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.110
 sweet but not Christmas candy the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.720
 next question is typical food in 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.550
 your house at Christmas because almost all 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.830
 years if it's not on old nights in 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.709
 poinsettia and if not in kings i usually do 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.269
 turkey stuffed with chestnuts is a recipe 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.000
 of a book called Galician cuisine 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.280
 and the authors are álvaro cunqueiro and 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.350
 araceli filgueiras in case someone wants 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.350
 check that recipe or see that book and 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.840
 others and usually on Christmas Eve 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.760
 we have spider crab at home that I love 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.490
 It reminds me a lot of my land because I 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.310
 I am Galician and always at Christmas I try 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.560
 Well, good to do things that have to 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.430
 see with galicia a little bit because I 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.950
 gives morriña 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.460
 so let's go a little what he usually does 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.020
 the stuffed turkey and the central 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.060
 next question do you like giving that 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.830
 they give you a gift because I like both 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.330
 but if I have to choose to be given as a gift 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.250
 although I love seeing the face of the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.990
 others while the gifts go out 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.940
 I'm crazy about the gifts I love 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.310
 Give me gifts I'm like a girl 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.860
 small if I still had a lot 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.830
 illusion about what they will give me like this 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.630
 if I tickled me to the next 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.030
 question of this will leave a coal some 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.280
 Once in my family, it was not very 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.200
 traditional leave coal and in fact I 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.500
 I was very envious when others 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.390
 coleus children other cousins besides them 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.140
 They gave away coal because I wanted to try 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.100
 charcoal 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.960
 I wanted coal and never the truth that 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.790
 they did not give me coal and the last 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.120
 question is what is your movie 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.620
 preferred Christmas because every year 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.470
 I have the tradition with my husband of 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.570
 decorate the tree and see the factual and we 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.180
 love that movie to me it seems like a 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.920
 exciting movie and this year has seen 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.810
 for the first time his movie 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.090
 or the goblin that I think is how it 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.490
 Call in Spanish and we've had it 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.890
 super good is a very very funny movie 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.510
 so well those are my favorites and 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.520

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.030
