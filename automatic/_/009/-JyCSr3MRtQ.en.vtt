 the repetition of students - dez stimulates and costs the country the second 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.849
 experts, but it will be that approved without the certainty that they have learned is the 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.349
 way she thinks it's portraying the afternoon but I think it should 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.560
 to have another form said 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.140
 we will have approval 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.449
 3rd is he technique 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.079
 this monitoring 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.179
 and if the process really 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.710
 is to recognize which it would not be able to be approved, this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.609
 to the square in the woods 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.100
 the opponent in Brazil the failure rate is high reaches 40% 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:40.949
 in the international ranking with 65 countries evaluated 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.170
 we ranked 53rd behind countries like Colombia and Uruguay 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.870
 According to a study by the organization of cooperation, 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.010
 considers countries with high approval ratings have low 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.550
 when evaluated to try to reduce this reprobation rate to 15 years was 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.550
 adopted in sÃ£o paulo the system of continuous progression 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.550
 that is being done in other Brazilian states is to approve the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.650
 students as it was done in Great Britain which helped the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.310
 country to have high marks in international 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.150
 knowledge 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.060
 but here in Brazil the result is quite different we occupy the lacta jason octave 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.520
 between 128 nations evaluated by the unisc or even after the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.040
 implementation of continuous progression 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.180
 in some states, for example, the average Portuguese proficiency 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:46.360
 among students in the 3rd year of high school dropped from 290 points in 1995 to 257 in 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.659
 2005 is this teacher 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.090
 believes that the solution is now the largest in basic education 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.020
 of the country to value teachers 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.100
 is to make it possible for the parents of the student 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.020
 to accompany their children invest in the education with which they have while still 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.140
 in Germany education about investments in qualification was born 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.480
 In Germany, the investment drops from 5% to 10%. 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.060
 of education guarantees with a better education depends on the participation 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.230
 joint public power 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.980
 teachers who were humiliated we worked with 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.620
 with a script in which the family is in school to charge the school for 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.209
 know the processes 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.029
 to know the management 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:34.709
 he is 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.399
 is key to a student's success
