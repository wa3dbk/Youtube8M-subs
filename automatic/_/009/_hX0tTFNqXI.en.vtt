well<00:01:32.620> demonstrate<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.250> lighting<00:01:33.610> product

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
well demonstrate a lighting product

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.820 
well demonstrate a lighting product
without<00:01:34.210> actually<00:01:34.870> illuminating<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.620> so

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
without actually illuminating it so

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.960 
without actually illuminating it so
that's<00:01:36.100> what<00:01:36.250> we're<00:01:36.400> going<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.580> go<00:01:36.729> ahead<00:01:36.850> and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
that's what we're going to go ahead and

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.289 
that's what we're going to go ahead and
do<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:38.350> before<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:38.979> I<00:01:39.340> want<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.150> make<00:01:40.270> a

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
do but before that I want to make a

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.990 
do but before that I want to make a
quick<00:01:40.600> note<00:01:41.250> many<00:01:42.250> people<00:01:42.400> install<00:01:42.880> this

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
quick note many people install this

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.789 
quick note many people install this
product<00:01:44.070> notice<00:01:45.810> doesn't<00:01:46.810> work<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.350> reason

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
product notice doesn't work the reason

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.890 
product notice doesn't work the reason
is<00:01:48.240> they<00:01:49.240> are<00:01:49.409> unidirectional<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:52.210> if<00:01:52.780> it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
is they are unidirectional so if it

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.190 
is they are unidirectional so if it
doesn't<00:01:53.170> work<00:01:53.290> flip<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:53.979> 180<00:01:54.460> degrees<00:01:55.080> put<00:01:56.080> it

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
doesn't work flip it 180 degrees put it

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.120 
doesn't work flip it 180 degrees put it
in<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:57.030> it'll<00:01:58.030> work<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.409> again<00:01:59.710> they<00:01:59.950> only

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
in and it'll work so again they only

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.429 
in and it'll work so again they only
work<00:02:00.430> one<00:02:00.700> way<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:01.420> don't<00:02:01.659> have<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.900> defective

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
work one way you don't have a defective

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.640 
work one way you don't have a defective
bulb<00:02:02.740> just<00:02:03.250> take<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.460> out<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.700> flip<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.119> around

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
bulb just take it out and flip it around

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.490 
bulb just take it out and flip it around
now<00:02:05.650> as<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:05.890> can<00:02:05.979> see<00:02:06.040> they<00:02:06.640> are<00:02:06.670> extremely

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
now as you can see they are extremely

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.600 
now as you can see they are extremely
bright<00:02:10.680> just<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.799> give<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.040> an<00:02:12.129> idea<00:02:12.189> they

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
bright just to give you an idea they

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.540 
bright just to give you an idea they
have<00:02:12.730> 180<00:02:13.300> degree<00:02:13.690> light<00:02:13.900> output

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
have 180 degree light output

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.000 
have 180 degree light output
which<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.670> really<00:02:15.880> great<00:02:16.590> they<00:02:17.590> fully
