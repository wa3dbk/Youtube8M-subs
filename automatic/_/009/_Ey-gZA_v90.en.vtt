bit<00:02:45.180> long<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.480> expected<00:02:45.989> but<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.319> know<00:02:46.440> I

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
bit long and I expected but you know I

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.470 
bit long and I expected but you know I
had<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> little<00:02:46.980> bit<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.130> financial<00:02:47.580> situation

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
had a little bit of financial situation

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.120 
had a little bit of financial situation
but<00:02:49.140> that's<00:02:49.290> what<00:02:49.350> happens<00:02:49.680> when<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.920> grow<00:02:50.100> up

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
kids don't grow up too fast because when

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.110 
kids don't grow up too fast because when

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
this is from legendary treasures there

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.289 
this is from legendary treasures there
they're<00:03:22.829> nice<00:03:23.010> free<00:03:23.310> shock<00:03:23.609> right<00:03:23.790> there<00:03:24.000> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
then we have white kyurem PX now we got

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.479 
then we have white kyurem PX now we got
all<00:03:27.870> them<00:03:28.019> Karamy<00:03:28.380> X<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.620> right<00:03:28.769> there<00:03:28.950> then<00:03:29.400> we

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
all them Karamy X is right there then we

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.400 
all them Karamy X is right there then we
have<00:03:29.549> these<00:03:29.670> active<00:03:30.269> CX<00:03:30.690> reminds<00:03:31.140> me<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.350> my

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
have these active CX reminds me of my

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.650 
have these active CX reminds me of my
good<00:03:31.560> friends<00:03:31.709> at<00:03:31.980> those<00:03:32.160> TCG<00:03:32.940> shout<00:03:33.329> out<00:03:33.510> to

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
good friends at those TCG shout out to

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.380 
good friends at those TCG shout out to
him<00:03:33.810> because<00:03:33.840> why<00:03:34.170> not<00:03:34.489> that's<00:03:35.489> from<00:03:35.670> plasma

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
him because why not that's from plasma

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.440 
him because why not that's from plasma
free<00:03:36.989> storm<00:03:37.609> freeze<00:03:38.609> I<00:03:38.880> think<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.150> there's

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
free storm freeze I think that there's

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.479 
free storm freeze I think that there's
the<00:03:39.540> exit<00:03:39.750> ramp<00:03:39.870> plasma<00:03:40.290> freeze<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.280> you're

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the exit ramp plasma freeze so you're

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.740 
the exit ramp plasma freeze so you're
not<00:03:41.549> pretty<00:03:41.760> cool<00:03:41.940> pretty<00:03:42.120> cool<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:42.510> have<00:03:42.600> that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
not pretty cool pretty cool we have that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.630 
not pretty cool pretty cool we have that
original<00:03:43.140> can't<00:03:43.350> build<00:03:43.560> legendary<00:03:43.980> trio<00:03:44.280> and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
original can't build legendary trio and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.420 
original can't build legendary trio and
then<00:03:45.239> we<00:03:45.359> have<00:03:45.540> tornadoes<00:03:46.410> DX<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:46.950> his<00:03:47.100> theory

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
then we have tornadoes DX in his theory

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.060 
then we have tornadoes DX in his theory
inform<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.180> very<00:03:48.510> very<00:03:48.630> cool<00:03:48.989> card<00:03:49.320> windfall

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
inform so very very cool card windfall

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
inform so very very cool card windfall
is<00:03:50.280> actually<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.579> pretty<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.820> actually<00:03:51.060> a

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
is actually a pretty is actually a

pretty good card to play with you in

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.259 
pretty good card to play with you in
your<00:03:52.320> plasmid<00:03:52.769> XO<00:03:53.100> not<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.609> bad<00:03:53.820> quarter<00:03:54.090> all

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
your plasmid XO not a bad quarter all

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.220 
your plasmid XO not a bad quarter all
and<00:03:54.510> then<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.930> Rayquaza<00:03:55.859> e<00:03:56.220> ex<00:03:56.780> promo<00:03:57.780> as<00:03:57.959> well
