00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
we accomplished it do you feel or was it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.179 
we accomplished it do you feel or was it
difficult<00:01:23.990> your<00:01:24.990> career<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.740> mean<00:01:26.040> he'd

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
difficult your career here I mean he'd

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.789 
difficult your career here I mean he'd
really<00:01:26.579> seem<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.390> you'd<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:28.530> steps

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
really seem like you'd get two steps

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.389 
really seem like you'd get two steps
forward<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.369> three<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:30.110> yeah<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> mean<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
forward and three back yeah I mean it

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.670 
forward and three back yeah I mean it
was<00:01:32.520> difficult<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> point<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
was difficult to a point just because I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.730 
was difficult to a point just because I
had<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> few<00:01:35.369> injuries<00:01:36.000> here<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
had a few injuries here and there and it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770 
had a few injuries here and there and it
was<00:01:37.829> more<00:01:38.040> timing<00:01:38.520> than<00:01:38.670> anything<00:01:38.850> else<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
was more timing than anything else you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
was more timing than anything else you
know<00:01:39.899> like<00:01:40.170> during<00:01:40.740> fall<00:01:40.979> camp<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.850> when<00:01:42.090> I'm

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
