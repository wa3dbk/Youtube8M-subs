00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.299 
then you take the neck of the shirt
now<00:00:54.250> you<00:00:54.309> take<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.610> bowl<00:00:54.910> a<00:00:54.940> medium-sized<00:00:55.660> bowl

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.780 
around the neck so this is about half
way<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.040> take<00:01:10.320> your<00:01:11.320> pen<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:12.040> trace

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.010 

then<00:01:46.550> at<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.850> bottom<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.330> can<00:01:47.479> do<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.630> friend

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.090 
then at the bottom you can do a friend
and<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:50.060> took<00:01:50.150> my<00:01:51.940> measuring<00:01:52.940> tape<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.100> drew

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
and I took my measuring tape and drew

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.719 
and I took my measuring tape and drew
little<00:01:55.550> dashes<00:01:55.909> about<00:01:56.510> an<00:01:57.500> inch<00:01:57.830> apart<00:01:58.010> and

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
little dashes about an inch apart and

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.630

half<00:02:01.670> long<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.479> just<00:02:02.750> did<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:02.990> right<00:02:03.229> across

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
half long and just did it right across

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:35.869 
half long and just did it right across
and<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:05.210> I'll<00:02:05.420> cut<00:02:05.840> those<00:02:07.420> those<00:02:08.420> dash<00:02:08.780> lines

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.880
