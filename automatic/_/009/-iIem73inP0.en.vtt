00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.460
 we can consider the premium notebook if 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.860
 it has three performance items 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.139
 battery life and one 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.609
 Thin and elegant design these three 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.560
 features together are really 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.510
 difficult to find since models 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.580
 more expensive ones focus on a maybe two 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.500
 these questions and the three together make the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 model becomes extremely expensive 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.130
 today we will meet one of those who have 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.050
 these three characteristics and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.859
 windows and bring some extras 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.859
 interesting 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.170
 the asus in book 500 has a structure 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.540
 in a single aluminum body and even with 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 15.6 inches of screen it can 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.020
 easily be considered a blunderbuss 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.879
 for having approximately two thousand and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.100
 four centimeters thick 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.660
 even if the advantage is not so fine 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.969
 that it has connections from a notebook 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.699
 common do not need adapters 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.699
 hdmi ethernet and multiple usb ports 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.909
 performance we do not lack here. 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.040
 intel core i7 3632 qm processor with 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.479
 four nuclei and eight buildings running 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.869
 2.2 ghz 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.030
 the turbo boost it reaches 3.2 ghz has 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.619
 still 8 gb of RAM and graphics 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 nvidia gtx 650 m with 2 gb of memory 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.189
 gddr5 dedicated to the specifications 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.320
 enough to run virtually 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.780
 any gaming program a little more 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.100
 up to other video editing 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.159
 point we liked was the storage 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.470
 in network 0 with two s 10 which causes 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.270
 open apps start windows 8 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.270
 be fairly quick tasks 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.040
 the touch screen has 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.680
 comfortable resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.840
 with LED backlight a panel 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.970
 which decreases the light's reflectivity 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.649
 this is one of the best screens currently 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.170
 with color reproduction quality 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.969
 above average the keyboard does not let 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.100
 less and is the same found in tai chi 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.140
 31 which we have analyzed here for some time 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.299
 you can see this other review on the link 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.860
 on screen it is excellent it also brings 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.350
 own lighting and a touchpad 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.940
 fairly long precise this set does 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.940
 it's a great machine to work with. 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.090
 in our tests we were able to work 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.710
 for up to six and a half hours without 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.330
 load it a brand and so much 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.880
 considering the power of the components 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.530
 than the eight-cell battery 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.820
 this causes him to have all three items 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.730
 required for a model to be 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:34.070
 considered design performance crime and 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 battery life to let the 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.970
 blue smaller sizes preferred to leave 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.860
 the cd and dvd drive in an equipment 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.870
 which makes sense since 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.820
 rarely used presently 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.100
 so does the subwoofer that 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.510
 own and combined connection 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.489
 with the speakers on the sides 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:03:01.250
 considerably improve the experience 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:03:04.280
 Sound, look, it 's time to talk about the price. 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.500
 the zebu 500 can be found for eight 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.540
 thousand reais a very salty value for the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.040
 most people but it makes sense 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.140
 if we consider the audience for which 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.880
 it was designed is a super machine 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.739
 but this does not exclude the fact that it 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.239
 costs almost six times more than one 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.950
 conventional notebook 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.780
 if you have money in your pocket and enjoy 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.650
 A beautiful potent machine is a good 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.299
 option 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.650
