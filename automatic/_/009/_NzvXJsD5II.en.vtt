00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
even fit this one 3s so you're not gonna

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.700 
even fit this one 3s so you're not gonna
it's<00:00:56.670> lengthwise<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.660> got<00:00:57.809> room<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.500> in

3s<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> big<00:01:08.700> 3s<00:01:08.970> cuz<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
3s but now this is a big 3s cuz it's a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.490 
3s but now this is a big 3s cuz it's a
hard<00:01:09.750> case<00:01:10.369> 6560<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.600> there's<00:01:13.200> no<00:01:13.350> way

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
hard case 6560 see but there's no way

hard case 6560 see but there's no way
you're<00:01:13.680> gonna<00:01:13.770> fit<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.420> stack<00:01:15.990> them<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you're gonna fit you can stack them I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.910 
you're gonna fit you can stack them I
can<00:01:16.890> stack<00:01:17.130> both<00:01:17.369> 3s<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.770> strap<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

that<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> actually<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:22.890> now

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
that I actually don't have on right now

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.080 
that I actually don't have on right now
but<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.530> bump<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.250> part<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:26.640> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
but it will bump on this part here so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.630 
but it will bump on this part here so
you<00:01:27.600> can't<00:01:27.869> even<00:01:27.960> put<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> cover<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.680> so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you can't even put the cover on so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.899 
you can't even put the cover on so
you've<00:01:30.119> got<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.920> smaller<00:01:31.920> 3s<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.790> you're

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you've got to get smaller 3s if you're

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.929 
you've got to get smaller 3s if you're
gonna<00:01:33.000> run<00:01:33.180> two<00:01:33.360> 3s<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.799> know<00:01:34.939> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
gonna run two 3s just so you know the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.789 
gonna run two 3s just so you know the
sizing<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.670> battery<00:01:39.630> tray<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
sizing of it of this battery tray you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.069 
sizing of it of this battery tray you
can<00:01:40.979> fit<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> 159<00:01:42.150> millimeter<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.899> my

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
can fit a 159 millimeter this is my

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.490 
can fit a 159 millimeter this is my
digital<00:01:43.259> caliper<00:01:44.750> 159<00:01:45.750> millimeter<00:01:46.140> across

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
digital caliper 159 millimeter across

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
digital caliper 159 millimeter across
and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:48.750> width<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:50.130> 50<00:01:51.060> 1.5

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and then the width you can go 50 1.5

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.660 
and then the width you can go 50 1.5
millimeters<00:01:52.200> max<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.000> down

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
millimeters max and then up and down

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.679 
millimeters max and then up and down
this<00:01:56.670> battery<00:01:57.119> right<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:59.689> 139

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
this battery right here is 139

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.749 
this battery right here is 139
millimeter<00:02:01.259> by<00:02:01.439> forty<00:02:01.829> seven<00:02:02.189> millimeter<00:02:02.610> by

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
millimeter by forty seven millimeter by

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.540 
millimeter by forty seven millimeter by
37<00:02:03.390> millimeter<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:06.079> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.320> actually<00:02:07.619> fit

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
37 millimeter so you can actually fit

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.720 
37 millimeter so you can actually fit
I<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:09.509> safely<00:02:09.929> about<00:02:10.110> 50<00:02:10.470> millimeter<00:02:10.860> high

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
I think safely about 50 millimeter high

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.880 
I think safely about 50 millimeter high
battery<00:02:12.440> with<00:02:13.440> this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
battery with this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.560 
battery with this
you<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.700> might<00:02:14.850> be<00:02:14.910> able<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.060> do<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.240> little<00:02:15.390> bit

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
you can might be able to do a little bit

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.470 
you can might be able to do a little bit
more<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.900> I'm<00:02:16.170> not<00:02:16.200> exactly<00:02:16.470> sure<00:02:17.480> it's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
more I just I'm not exactly sure it's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.790 
more I just I'm not exactly sure it's
kind<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.660> hard<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.840> gauge<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.620> once

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
kind of hard to gauge that because once

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.380 
kind of hard to gauge that because once
a<00:02:19.890> show<00:02:20.070> goes<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.580> it's<00:02:20.730> hard<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.000> measure

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
a show goes on it it's hard to measure

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.940 
a show goes on it it's hard to measure
it<00:02:21.570> but<00:02:22.670> yeah<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.790> battery<00:02:24.120> tray<00:02:24.530> isn't<00:02:25.530> huge

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
it but yeah this battery tray isn't huge

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.820
