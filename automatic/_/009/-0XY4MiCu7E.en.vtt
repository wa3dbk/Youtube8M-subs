why because as i promised i got a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.270 
why because as i promised i got a
controller<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:21.200> and<00:00:22.200> it's<00:00:22.440> not<00:00:22.620> as<00:00:22.740> hard<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.100> I

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.280 
controller and and it's not as hard as I

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.430 
controller and and it's not as hard as I
thought<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.640> will<00:00:23.790> be<00:00:23.940> but<00:00:24.060> still<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:25.020> aiming

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
thought it will be but still the aiming

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.430 
thought it will be but still the aiming
is<00:00:25.620> awful<00:00:26.070> he's<00:00:27.030> very<00:00:27.180> hard<00:00:27.540> for<00:00:28.050> me<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.290> aim

that's<00:00:52.979> in<00:00:53.129> squid<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.609> there<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> lot

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
that's in squid but there is a lot

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.419 
that's in squid but there is a lot
easier<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.409> he's<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> first<00:00:56.249> person

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
easier because he's not the first person

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.860 
easier because he's not the first person
shooting<00:00:56.819> but<00:00:57.059> also<00:00:58.050> plays<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.679> Batman<00:00:59.069> and

shooting but also plays on Batman and

shooting but also plays on Batman and
those<00:01:00.870> aren't<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.440> hard<00:01:02.239> but<00:01:04.009> I<00:01:05.009> also<00:01:05.339> had<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
those aren't that hard but I also had to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.760 
those aren't that hard but I also had to
set<00:01:05.969> it<00:01:06.119> manually<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> program<00:01:07.110> because

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
set it manually with a program because

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.340 
set it manually with a program because
black<00:01:08.579> ops<00:01:08.729> won't<00:01:08.969> recognize<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.049> since

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
black ops won't recognize it as a since

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.620

mostly move my body to get the target in
my<00:02:41.680> crosshair<00:02:42.569> because<00:02:43.569> it's<00:02:43.750> hard<00:02:44.019> for<00:02:44.200> me<00:02:44.319> to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
my crosshair because it's hard for me to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.839 
my crosshair because it's hard for me to
move<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.739> up<00:02:44.860> down<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.400> don't<00:02:45.910> know<00:02:46.000> why<00:02:46.410> and

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
move it up down I don't know why and

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.550 
move it up down I don't know why and
also<00:02:48.849> some<00:02:49.360> bottom<00:02:49.660> combination<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.349> what<00:02:50.530> I

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
also some bottom combination is what I

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.070 
also some bottom combination is what I
don't<00:02:50.830> like<00:02:51.010> that's<00:02:52.000> what<00:02:52.209> Batman<00:02:52.599> I<00:02:52.810> don't

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
don't like that's what Batman I don't

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.720 
don't like that's what Batman I don't
like<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.470> can't<00:02:53.500> move<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.129> camera<00:02:54.370> while

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
like that I can't move the camera while

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.069 
like that I can't move the camera while
I<00:02:54.910> fight<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.829> that's<00:02:56.829> pretty<00:02:57.280> maybe<00:02:57.640> it's

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
I fight and that's pretty maybe it's

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.470 
I fight and that's pretty maybe it's
because<00:02:59.079> of<00:02:59.230> some<00:02:59.470> options<00:02:59.890> because<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.329> got<00:03:01.329> it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
because of some options because I got it

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.930 
because of some options because I got it
manually<00:03:01.959> sex<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> program<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:03.819> know

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
manually sex with a program you know

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.900 
manually sex with a program you know
I've<00:03:04.090> set<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.660> buttons<00:03:05.650> from<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.519> controller

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
I've set the buttons from the controller

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.030 
I've set the buttons from the controller
to<00:03:07.239> work<00:03:07.269> like<00:03:07.810> patterns<00:03:08.290> from<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.829> game

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
to work like patterns from the game

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.869 
to work like patterns from the game
that's<00:03:09.310> how<00:03:10.060> it's<00:03:10.239> done<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:12.430> an<00:03:12.579> assessee

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
that's how it's done but an assessee

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.580 
that's how it's done but an assessee
screen<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.329> pretty<00:03:13.690> easy<00:03:13.840> because<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.319> camera

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
screen is pretty easy because the camera

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.460 
screen is pretty easy because the camera
moves<00:03:14.860> automatically<00:03:15.519> when<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.090> move<00:03:16.470> not

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
moves automatically when you move not

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.940 
moves automatically when you move not
like<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.799> Batman<00:03:18.540> archiving<00:03:19.540> bullshit<00:03:20.200> I

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
like on Batman archiving bullshit I

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.780 
like on Batman archiving bullshit I
