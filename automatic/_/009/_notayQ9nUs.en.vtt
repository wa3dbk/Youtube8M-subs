00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
you know one funny thing about the God

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.630 
you know one funny thing about the God
works<00:01:31.320> items<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.490> actually

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
works items is that they are actually

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.359 
works items is that they are actually
going<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.570> price<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> reason

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
going up in price and I think the reason

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
going up in price and I think the reason
why<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:36.030> because<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.200> disconnects

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
why is because of all the disconnects

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.219 
why is because of all the disconnects
that<00:01:38.280> were<00:01:38.640> happening<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.390> past<00:01:39.720> three

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
that were happening in the past three

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.319 
that were happening in the past three
days<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.070> people<00:01:41.250> are<00:01:41.490> scared<00:01:41.820> now<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> go<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
days so people are scared now to go to
