00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.320
 I saw some training and was following 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.220

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.720

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.830
 the art 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.920
 It was nice, unfortunately, it did not go away. 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.900
 no special issue here for 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.640
 united states but i walked 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.459

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.150
 during the game the game is very long 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.220
 then you will have a lot of 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.980
 missions are huge so there are many 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.720
 hours of gaming like every bts game 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.930
 in these between mons 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.859

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.510
 but there is nothing else here 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.950

 down here she has a little something 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:32.770
 better as a table top or anything 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.610
 so it will brighten perfectly well 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.780
 but lightens it gives a certain body charm 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.600
 here on the side 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:47.570

 buying in the store you bought 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:05:03.169

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:10.550

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.979
 same as that of the game cover and is 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.410
 costing on average an auction from 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.169

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.440

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.390
