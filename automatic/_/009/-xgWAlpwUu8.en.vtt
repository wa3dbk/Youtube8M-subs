00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.200
 hello everyone because today we are here and 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.869
 let's make a fixative gel for the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.760
 Hair is completely natural not 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.309
 Take no preservatives it will cost us 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.650
 20% less than if we bought it in a 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.080
 store and it's very easy to do I 'm going to 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.740
 explain the ingredients we are going to 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.119
 need 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.249
 gelatin or the negligible neutral powder 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.560
 teaspoon if we do not have the measure as 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.660
 here then we are going to use one of this 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.140
 size I show you the little one so that 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.130
 you see that is not that would be this we are going to 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.420
 need a cup of water 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.130
 two teaspoons of lemon juice 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.240
 additionally and if we want a bit of 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.129
 our perfume and a little bottle for later 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.140
 throw it out and make the application easy 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.379
 logically football to be able to mix 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.519
 I'm going to start with the ingredients we're going 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.130
 to catch the cup of water and the water has 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.920
 to be boiling is worth this is the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.950
 case so that we dissolve well the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.040
 gelatin then we open the envelope 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.440
 of gelatin 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.440
 we take half a teaspoon 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.280
 what would be like that 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.800
 this is important 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.430
 and later 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.050
 the lemon juice 2 teaspoons 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.850
 to me how I like to give my touch 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.810
 staff, I'm going to take a little 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.390
 of perfumes like that is enough and 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.920
 the biggest trick is to remove remove that not 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.320
 there is no group because if it is not the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.750
 grumo is going to go to the hair to the hair 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.710
 and then it's going to be fatal then 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.710
 we started to remove 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.740
 once everything is already mixed and 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.920
 perfectly homogeneous we are going to go 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.220
 with it directly to the fridge and what 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.410
 we are going to have 24 hours for since I'm going 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.630
 good and here I come with the one I made 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.350
 yesterday that has been 24 hours in the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.310
 refrigerator and fundamentally because 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.020
 I'm going to show what the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.550
 consistency or how we have to stay 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.100
 as you can see, it's gelatinous and this is the 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.950
 consistency my more liquid or less so 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.310
 I would have also put it inside the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.010
 boat 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.420
 I already have it ready because if not 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.010
 application would be a bit complicated 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.340
 we had to go sticking our fingers 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.950
 no it would not be a bit the idea then the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.370
 texture so you can see how it looks 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.370
 the hand 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.590
 it is this that is the same as the one 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.629
 we found in a fixative that we're going to 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.390
 buy in a supermarket 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.310
 this holds us two weeks we can 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.040
 use it for two weeks and it has 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.810
 to be in the refrigerator always and 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.150
 Well with this I leave you so that you 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.610
 make all of them very handsome and very 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.319
 beautiful until next time 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.319
