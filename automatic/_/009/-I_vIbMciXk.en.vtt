00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello friends hello youtube friends that 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:12.140
 such today I am with a friend 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.690
 recording a new minecraft video 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.539
 that we want it would be a houseboat 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.390
 so it's in the air 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.660
 yeah 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 and death of what we find show him 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.320
 show him the house split in half 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.490
 what macabre and we put him in something of 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.780
 back so he would think we were 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:40.670
 inside is super cool 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.829
 very cool already 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.960
 seeing this natural phenomenon of 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.640
 minecraft let's start to show them 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.930
 how the houseboat is made 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:57.239
 first we need at least 64 blocks of 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.690
 walker and ok if you're in a mode that does not 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.890
 be creative you have to occupy land 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.409
 to make it easier to break it already 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.800
 first to be your as far as you can be 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.210
 where have to make the blocks 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.909
 Wherever you want to be and guidance approaches 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.700
 and you start 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.069
 with tablet chips or do as if outside 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.590
 a normal house as if it were in the 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:30.259
 soil but I do not know if more carefully and not 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.960
 I know if you know ski blog but that 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.950
 remember a little this does not yes 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.460
 you have to be careful not to fall 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.490
 or if not until your doll arrives you 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.330
 magic doll and breaks the feet to 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.810
 fall out 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.230
 It's awful how many people sound what I was doing 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.100
 there 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:56.290
 it is terrible and horrible very horrible how 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.430
 you start at home 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.580
 and all for living well floating 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.130
 but sometimes it's very dangerous because you 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.910
 can make monster up a click 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.100
 as it happened to me three people 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.120
 destroy the fucking house that you created and that 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.700
 it took up to the amount that is in frame 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.380
 what 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.920
 with which I can break faster the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.580
 brick blocks I would have tried with 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.580
 everything and I can not 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.829
 with the golden peak that the fastest 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.849
 itching even if you see this faster but 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.849
 the one that quickest itches 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.900
 he found out that I 'm not told quality 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.600
 break those issues and even though it costs 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.990
 much 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.730
 costs the fin and also costs caleta 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.000
 make them need clay 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.379
 I think that back and there you lacked a 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.260
 part except if you look at friends and now 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.310
 we are finishing as if I would call 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.310
 to the skeleton of the house 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.690
 and then we have to make a roof of 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.110
 here we are going to make the roof frame 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.390
 madrid- or wooden wood we are going to 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.960
 make a wooden roof 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.960
 m 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.540
 good 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.329
 butter ready but finish putting there 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.150
 the bricks 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.629
 the fucking bricks 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.310
 it is dawning must be if 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.230
 build very slow 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.860
 Steve spends hours flying 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.230
 December 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.630
 very well 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.590
 an under crime 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.590
 in scrutinize 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.750
 just in case my voice is in the snap top 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.560
 except you can download it from mojang 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.100
 puntocom you know that it is most likely 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.540
 that we put it in the description if 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.980
 you are very right I alone but 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.900
 you are going to have to download 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.510
 only because it follows it to mediafire 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.820
 mediafire 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.820
 they have to put sabin i replace 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.200
 and now we will do the elevator 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.860
 it can also work as a trap 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.620
 what was it 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.340
 grab bones spider fruits 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.520
 as it comes out I speak of sara straight nacho 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.850
 you have to do the well you managed to 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.720
 get me for the chick that has the whore 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:59.240
 house and racing 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.790
 you grab me water put are here another here 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.010
 another here and another here but you have to 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.540
 put lava like that so they fall 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.750
 burning and die from the blow but 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.760
 doing 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.760
 the elevator 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.550
 its frame that decreased something that I did not 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.070
 I did not understand at all 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.490
 and you just put it in the corners that 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.919
 finish 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.310
 good water until they fall through the 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.330
 ojito and ready but they would not fall next to 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.240
 Water 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.520
 it's not that you have to put a poster 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.590
 here so that the water is the good one falls 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.979
 and only what they do and good fort 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.020
 I already understood the blow and for the 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.180
 friends who did not understand what 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.590
 we explained twice and it no longer serves no longer 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.590
 do not fuck 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.770
 we are doing the elevator that the most 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.370
 easy to make 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.430
 is one of water those of water are the law 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.700
 they are the cock with onion hey you need 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:12.490
 a flashlight and not a flashlight but 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.490
 a good shot is that and more energy 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.620
 you are going to put a pumpkin squash 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.620
 luminous 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.860
 so they adapt while they are because 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.720
 they support it like this case and if not 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.880
 you are creative this thing so you 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.100
 it's going to cost to do I do not know why 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.560
 you can fall to break the leg and in two 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.560
 types suffers and suffers all 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.139
 first put the posters frame 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.490
 now look now look at the frame as 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.819
 puts up posters with nothing 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.530
 a block apart to put water 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:01.160
 obviously some should already know 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.160
 this trick 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:14.230
 I think that already there just outside 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.990
 I shit on everything I talk if everything 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.990
 it looks like it does if it was 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.300
 well it was not right I shit on everything myself 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.550
 I shit on everything 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.540
 What are you talking 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.540
 by the shit 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.020
 we already practice with the other 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.110
 power 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:45.930
 I challenge both so so so so so so and 

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:47.639
 friends, we are finishing the house 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:50.420
 pretty much later you would have to 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:55.090
 decorate things like that 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.090
 but that would be all 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:05.090
 I do not know about your site or we would see each other in the 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.090
 next up soon
