00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:04.479 
now there is a big difference between

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:06.940 
now there is a big difference between
females<00:00:05.479> in<00:00:05.930> there<00:00:06.109> so<00:00:06.380> they're<00:00:06.710> getting

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
bodybuilding so we've got two

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.360 
bodybuilding so we've got two
bodybuilders<00:00:08.900> the<00:00:09.200> guys<00:00:09.350> and<00:00:09.830> we've<00:00:10.190> gotta

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
bodybuilders the guys and we've gotta

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.430 
bodybuilders the guys and we've gotta
figure<00:00:10.550> competitor<00:00:11.650> so<00:00:12.650> she<00:00:12.710> will<00:00:13.040> do

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
figure competitor so she will do

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.400 
figure competitor so she will do
slightly<00:00:15.440> different<00:00:15.860> posing<00:00:16.369> to<00:00:17.029> the<00:00:17.150> males

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
slightly different posing to the males

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.679 
slightly different posing to the males
but<00:00:18.410> we'll<00:00:18.950> do<00:00:19.070> it<00:00:19.189> all<00:00:19.340> together<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.239> sad<00:00:20.540> like

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
but we'll do it all together so sad like

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.310 
but we'll do it all together so sad like
we<00:00:20.840> do<00:00:20.960> caller<00:00:21.349> tunes<00:00:21.939> so<00:00:22.939> call<00:00:23.869> it<00:00:23.989> turn<00:00:24.169> to

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
we do caller tunes so call it turn to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.120 
we do caller tunes so call it turn to
the<00:00:24.439> right

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.190 

okay<00:00:30.609> so<00:00:30.669> they<00:00:30.880> must<00:00:31.000> have<00:00:31.179> their<00:00:31.240> feet<00:00:31.599> facing

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
okay so they must have their feet facing

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.490 
okay so they must have their feet facing

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.650 

and<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:40.520> what<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.760> judges<00:00:40.970> are<00:00:41.120> looking<00:00:41.270> for

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
and so what the judges are looking for

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
and so what the judges are looking for
is<00:00:41.899> symmetry<00:00:42.800> balance<00:00:44.140> from<00:00:45.140> top<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.530> bottom

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
is symmetry balance from top to bottom

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.080 
is symmetry balance from top to bottom
but<00:00:46.040> we<00:00:46.190> should<00:00:46.400> be<00:00:46.430> able<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.790> look<00:00:46.910> at<00:00:47.059> a

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
but we should be able to look at a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.720 
but we should be able to look at a
competitor<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:47.989> turning<00:00:48.620> up<00:00:48.739> at<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.579> other

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
way and from top to bottom they will

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.829 
way and from top to bottom they will
have<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:53.059> very<00:00:54.050> similar<00:00:54.260> shape<00:00:55.239> nice<00:00:56.239> wide<00:00:56.540> wide
