00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
so I don't fish this one that much but

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.359 
so I don't fish this one that much but
it's<00:01:21.299> pretty<00:01:21.509> straightforward

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
it's pretty straightforward

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.580 
it's pretty straightforward

wet<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.070> little<00:01:26.100> bit<00:01:26.400> put<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:26.909> scent<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
wet it a little bit put some scent on it

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.850 
wet it a little bit put some scent on it
this<00:01:28.650> helps<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> slide<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.369> easier

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
this helps of slide in a little easier

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.090

slide<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:39.079> this<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.229> pretty

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
slide it in this is pretty

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.410 
slide it in this is pretty
straightforward

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420

two rattle insert again I'll spray that

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.620 
two rattle insert again I'll spray that
down<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:04.010> little<00:03:04.070> bit<00:03:07.150> again<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.570> the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
down a little bit again this is the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.630 
down a little bit again this is the
hollow<00:03:08.780> tube<00:03:09.050> I<00:03:09.170> do<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:12.400> push<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.520> all<00:03:13.610> the

hollow tube I do this on push it all the
way<00:03:13.730> up<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.060> head<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.670> get<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.820> feel

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
way up to the head and you get a feel

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.610 
way up to the head and you get a feel
for<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.330> hole<00:03:17.570> on<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.200> side

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.270 

okay<00:03:23.400> once<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.670> find<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.030> hole<00:03:25.129> take<00:03:26.129> your

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
okay once you find the hole take your

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.490 
okay once you find the hole take your
hook<00:03:27.800> go<00:03:28.800> in<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.040> top<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.400> wait<00:03:30.470> then<00:03:31.470> you

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
hook go in the top of the wait then you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.640 
hook go in the top of the wait then you
want<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.769> come<00:03:31.860> out<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.160> side<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.610> wait<00:03:32.760> a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
want to come out the side of the wait a

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.559 
want to come out the side of the wait a
little<00:03:34.650> tricky<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.980> do<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:36.239> work<00:03:36.450> it

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
little tricky to do but and work it

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.600 
little tricky to do but and work it
around<00:03:36.629> in<00:03:36.900> there<00:03:37.250> there<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.280> go

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
around in there there you go

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.270 
around in there there you go
see<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:38.879> in<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.060> top<00:03:39.239> out<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.720> side<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:41.160> you

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
see it's in the top out the side and you

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.920 
see it's in the top out the side and you
can<00:03:41.400> use<00:03:41.549> a<00:03:41.580> little<00:03:41.879> bigger<00:03:42.060> hook<00:03:42.330> when<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.840> do

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
can use a little bigger hook when you do

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.330 
can use a little bigger hook when you do
it<00:03:43.019> this<00:03:43.110> way<00:03:43.170> too<00:03:43.319> because<00:03:44.069> you<00:03:44.129> have<00:03:44.250> to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
it this way too because you have to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.890 
it this way too because you have to
worry<00:03:44.489> about<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.849> weight<00:03:45.060> hit<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.690> top<00:03:45.870> of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
worry about the weight hit the top of

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.860 
worry about the weight hit the top of
the<00:03:46.049> eye<00:03:46.080> if<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:46.440> get<00:03:46.560> it's<00:03:46.709> inside<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.069> tube

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.420 

and<00:03:51.870> once<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.170> do<00:03:52.349> that<00:03:52.379> against<00:03:53.099> this<00:03:53.280> your

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
and once you do that against this your

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.809 
and once you do that against this your
standard<00:03:53.790> Texas<00:03:54.060> rig<00:03:55.370> like<00:03:56.370> setting<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.700> eyes

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
standard Texas rig like setting the eyes

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.910 
standard Texas rig like setting the eyes
poking<00:03:57.239> at<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.420> top<00:03:57.630> but<00:03:57.959> that's<00:03:58.380> fine<00:03:58.680> just

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
poking at the top but that's fine just

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.210 
poking at the top but that's fine just
because<00:03:59.220> your<00:03:59.340> weight<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.970> inside<00:04:04.130> then<00:04:05.130> I'll

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
because your weight is inside then I'll

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.240 
because your weight is inside then I'll
still<00:04:05.930> this<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.079> bigger<00:04:07.319> tube<00:04:07.590> I'll<00:04:08.129> use

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
still this is a bigger tube I'll use

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.770 
still this is a bigger tube I'll use
like<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.430> five<00:04:08.670> i<00:04:08.700> hook<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.299> one<00:04:09.480> because

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
like a five i hook on this one because

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.259 
like a five i hook on this one because
it's<00:04:09.900> got<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.049> solid<00:04:10.230> head<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:12.150> your

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
it's got a solid head and just your

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.600 
it's got a solid head and just your
standard<00:04:12.599> Texas<00:04:12.870> rig<00:04:13.019> again<00:04:13.340> except<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.489> is

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
standard Texas rig again except this is

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.180 
standard Texas rig again except this is
good<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.819> flip<00:04:15.000> with<00:04:15.590> but<00:04:16.590> other<00:04:16.889> than<00:04:17.100> that

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
good to flip with but other than that

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.580 
good to flip with but other than that
that's<00:04:17.430> pretty<00:04:17.609> much<00:04:17.729> all<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:17.910> do<00:04:18.060> with<00:04:18.209> tubes

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
that's pretty much all I do with tubes

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.930 
that's pretty much all I do with tubes
so<00:04:19.590> hope<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.739> helped<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.039> guys<00:04:20.190> out<00:04:20.459> thanks
