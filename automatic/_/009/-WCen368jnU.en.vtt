00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.180 
so with this particular screen it's one
image<00:00:12.400> and<00:00:12.640> all<00:00:13.210> the<00:00:13.450> different

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
are in here so there's the outline of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
the image and then all these parts that

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.630 
the image and then all these parts that
are<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.439> talked<00:00:19.680> about<00:00:19.770> how<00:00:20.490> it's

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
are in here we talked about how it's

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.859 
are in here we talked about how it's
sort<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.849> like<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> coloring<00:00:21.390> book<00:00:21.420> effect

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
sort of like a coloring book effect

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.659 
sort of like a coloring book effect
where<00:00:22.020> I'm<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.289> filling<00:00:22.560> these<00:00:22.829> in<00:00:23.130> so

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
where I'm just filling these in so

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.339 
where I'm just filling these in so
printing<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.270> way<00:00:24.450> is<00:00:24.509> considered<00:00:24.990> spot

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
printing this way is considered spot

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.409 
printing this way is considered spot
color<00:00:25.650> I'm<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.130> putting<00:00:26.430> colors<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.939> all

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
color I'm just putting colors in all

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.630 
color I'm just putting colors in all
these<00:00:27.599> open<00:00:27.869> spots<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> way<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.430> this

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
these open spots so the way that this

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
these open spots so the way that this
particular<00:00:29.820> screen<00:00:30.509> is<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:30.960> printed

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
particular screen is going to be printed

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.990 
particular screen is going to be printed
is<00:00:31.469> first<00:00:32.070> I'm<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> print<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> outline

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
is first I'm going to print the outline

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
is first I'm going to print the outline
in<00:00:33.420> white<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:34.379> I<00:00:34.410> print<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> outline<00:00:35.100> in

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
in white so when I print the outline in

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
in white so when I print the outline in
white<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.670> gives<00:00:35.850> me<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> key<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.899> all<00:00:37.290> of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
white that gives me the key so all of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.229 
white that gives me the key so all of
these<00:00:37.559> other<00:00:37.829> voids<00:00:38.160> then<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.730> fill<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.059> in

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
these other voids then can fill that in

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.900 
these other voids then can fill that in
and<00:00:39.719> after<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> print<00:00:40.530> each<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.160> these<00:00:41.309> then

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and after I print each one of these then

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
and after I print each one of these then
I'll<00:00:42.030> print<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.510> again<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.320> black<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I'll print this again but as black and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
I'll print this again but as black and
that'll<00:00:44.370> tie<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> whole<00:00:44.940> thing<00:00:45.000> together<00:00:45.390> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
that'll tie the whole thing together so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.899 
that'll tie the whole thing together so
I'm<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.589> to<00:00:46.620> start<00:00:46.829> off<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.399> printing<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
I'm going to start off with printing the

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.290 
I'm going to start off with printing the
white<00:00:48.289> now<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.679> larger<00:00:50.100> screen<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
white now this is a larger screen so you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.630 
white now this is a larger screen so you
know<00:00:51.420> obviously<00:00:51.629> need<00:00:52.079> more<00:00:52.109> table<00:00:53.069> space<00:00:53.339> so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
know obviously need more table space so

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.220 
know obviously need more table space so
the<00:00:54.179> bigger<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> screen<00:00:54.899> you're<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the bigger the screen you're going to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.360 
the bigger the screen you're going to
need<00:00:55.379> more<00:00:55.620> area<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.280> work<00:00:56.879> with

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
need more area to work with

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.869 
need more area to work with
now<00:00:59.370> I'm<00:00:59.489> using<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.819> same<00:01:00.170> square<00:01:01.170> dowel<00:01:01.409> rods

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
now I'm using the same square dowel rods

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.119 
now I'm using the same square dowel rods
so<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.239> way<00:01:03.390> depending<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.559> my<00:01:04.769> screen

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
so that way depending on how my screen

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.160 
so that way depending on how my screen
is<00:01:05.309> aligned<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.120> has<00:01:06.330> something<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> rest<00:01:07.020> on

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.020 

and<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.440> rubbing<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and when I'm rubbing it just like the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.610 
and when I'm rubbing it just like the
other<00:01:15.060> ones<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.510> also<00:01:15.690> sort<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.170> feeling<00:01:16.530> what

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
other ones I'm also sort of feeling what

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.080 
other ones I'm also sort of feeling what
the<00:01:16.740> surface<00:01:16.920> feels<00:01:17.370> like<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.909> make<00:01:18.060> sure

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the surface feels like to make sure

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.640 
the surface feels like to make sure
there<00:01:18.390> aren't<00:01:18.510> any<00:01:18.630> sort<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> depressions<00:01:19.560> in

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
there aren't any sort of depressions in

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.050 
there aren't any sort of depressions in
the<00:01:19.710> area<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.550> be<00:01:20.640> printing

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the area that I'm going to be printing

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.990 
the area that I'm going to be printing
so<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.960> area<00:01:22.500> feels<00:01:22.890> nice<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.130> flat<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> this

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so this area feels nice and flat so this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.360 
so this area feels nice and flat so this
would<00:01:24.120> be<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> good<00:01:24.390> opportunity<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:26.220> build

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
would be a good opportunity to to build

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.020 
would be a good opportunity to to build
to<00:01:26.730> build<00:01:26.760> a<00:01:27.000> good<00:01:27.120> image<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.760> just<00:01:29.850> going

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
to build a good image so I'm just going

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.540 
to build a good image so I'm just going
to<00:01:30.060> use<00:01:30.240> white<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.870> this<00:01:33.870> white<00:01:34.080> will<00:01:34.260> be

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
to use white and this white will be

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.640 
to use white and this white will be
basically<00:01:35.550> completely<00:01:36.270> covered<00:01:37.080> over<00:01:37.350> so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
basically completely covered over so

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.110 
basically completely covered over so
again<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.760> act<00:01:38.910> as<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
again this is really just to act as a

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.249 
again this is really just to act as a
key<00:01:39.510> for<00:01:40.050> my<00:01:40.140> other<00:01:40.290> spot<00:01:40.680> spot<00:01:41.220> colors

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.160 

now<00:01:47.259> I'm<00:01:47.350> working<00:01:47.470> on<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.770> white<00:01:47.950> body<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.689> this

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
now I'm working on a white body so this

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.429 
now I'm working on a white body so this
white<00:01:51.000> isn't<00:01:52.000> going<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.299> have<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> super<00:01:53.110> high

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
white isn't going to have a super high

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.859 
white isn't going to have a super high
contrast<00:01:54.130> but<00:01:54.759> it's<00:01:54.909> going<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.090> be<00:01:55.240> enough<00:01:55.570> for

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
contrast but it's going to be enough for

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.260 
contrast but it's going to be enough for
me<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.110> see<00:01:56.490> where<00:01:57.490> I<00:01:57.520> need<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.729> put<00:01:57.820> my<00:01:58.060> first

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
me to see where I need to put my first

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.050 
me to see where I need to put my first
color<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.950> as<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.159> put<00:02:00.369> in<00:02:00.490> each<00:02:00.670> one<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:00.970> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
color now as I put in each one of the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.090 
color now as I put in each one of the
other<00:02:01.210> sections<00:02:01.720> then<00:02:02.229> I'm<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.560> playing<00:02:02.890> off

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
other sections then I'm just playing off

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.820 
other sections then I'm just playing off
of<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.549> previous<00:02:03.939> one<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:04.450> as<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.229> print<00:02:05.679> more

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
of the previous one so as I print more

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.499 
of the previous one so as I print more
of<00:02:05.890> these<00:02:06.039> colors<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.640> keys<00:02:07.060> up<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.329> little

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
of these colors it keys up a little

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.839 
of these colors it keys up a little
easier<00:02:07.869> so<00:02:08.769> this<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.039> really<00:02:09.310> just<00:02:09.489> sort<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.729> to

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
easier so this is really just sort of to

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.759 
easier so this is really just sort of to
get<00:02:10.030> me<00:02:10.179> started<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:10.780> then<00:02:11.319> give<00:02:11.500> me<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.680> guide

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
get me started and then give me a guide

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.720 
get me started and then give me a guide
and<00:02:14.769> then<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.069> like<00:02:15.160> with<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.430> smaller

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
and then just like with the smaller

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.699 
and then just like with the smaller
screens<00:02:16.180> I'm<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.660> know<00:02:16.780> choosing<00:02:17.140> an<00:02:17.350> angle

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
screens I'm you know choosing an angle

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.500 
screens I'm you know choosing an angle
that<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.370> sort<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.790> pull<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.060> away<00:02:19.239> so<00:02:19.299> I'm

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that I can sort of pull it away so I'm

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.830 
that I can sort of pull it away so I'm
not<00:02:19.660> pulling<00:02:20.019> straight<00:02:20.290> up<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.750> know

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
not pulling straight up and you know

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.280 
not pulling straight up and you know
kind<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.140> slow<00:02:27.690> okay<00:02:28.690> now<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.019> have<00:02:29.170> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
kind of slow okay now that I have the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.380 
kind of slow okay now that I have the
outline<00:02:29.319> on<00:02:29.860> here<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:30.580> taking<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.269> first

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
outline on here I'm taking the first

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.449 
outline on here I'm taking the first
color<00:02:31.810> which<00:02:32.019> is<00:02:32.140> going<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.410> be<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.830> shirt<00:02:33.190> and

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
color which is going to be the shirt and

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.479 
color which is going to be the shirt and
I'm<00:02:33.910> doing<00:02:34.269> that<00:02:34.480> color<00:02:34.750> first<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:35.950> used<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
I'm doing that color first so I used the

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.009 
I'm doing that color first so I used the
white<00:02:36.700> outline<00:02:37.120> as<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.360> way<00:02:37.599> to<00:02:37.660> basically

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
white outline as a way to basically

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.440 
white outline as a way to basically
register<00:02:38.950> where<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.580> shirts<00:02:39.880> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.299> be

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
register where that shirts going to be

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.690 
register where that shirts going to be
now<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.230> way<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.590> burn<00:02:41.860> these<00:02:42.069> images<00:02:42.519> in

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
now the way that I burn these images in

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.220 
now the way that I burn these images in
here<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.480> each<00:02:43.660> one<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.900> these<00:02:44.019> images

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
here is that each one of these images

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.410 
here is that each one of these images
are<00:02:44.590> actually<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> little<00:02:45.400> bit<00:02:45.670> larger<00:02:46.209> than

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
are actually a little bit larger than

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.750 
are actually a little bit larger than
the<00:02:46.870> section<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.410> supposed<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.830> fill<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.609> I'm

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
the section it's supposed to fill so I'm

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.190 
the section it's supposed to fill so I'm
relying<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.329> these<00:02:49.450> colors<00:02:49.810> actually

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
relying on these colors actually

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.310 
relying on these colors actually
overlapping<00:02:50.739> in<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.430> lot<00:02:51.609> of<00:02:51.730> different<00:02:52.000> parts

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
overlapping in a lot of different parts

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.500 
overlapping in a lot of different parts
now<00:02:53.320> when<00:02:53.739> I'm<00:02:53.859> completely<00:02:54.280> done<00:02:54.549> I<00:02:54.820> will<00:02:55.150> take

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
now when I'm completely done I will take

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.509 
now when I'm completely done I will take
the<00:02:55.630> outline<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.200> put<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.500> back<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.890> top<00:02:57.310> as

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
the outline and put it back on top as

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.490 
the outline and put it back on top as
black<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.630> will<00:02:58.780> sort<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.049> bring<00:02:59.350> this

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
black and that will sort of bring this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.340 
black and that will sort of bring this
whole<00:02:59.709> image<00:02:59.890> together<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.900> first<00:03:02.109> color

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
whole image together so the first color

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.880 
whole image together so the first color
that<00:03:02.950> I'm<00:03:03.040> going<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.220> use<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:04.290> yellow<00:03:05.290> color

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
that I'm going to use is a yellow color

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.640 
that I'm going to use is a yellow color
for<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.000> shirt

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.490 

now<00:03:13.220> again<00:03:13.519> with<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:13.790> light<00:03:14.060> color<00:03:14.360> on<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
now again with this light color on the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.170 
now again with this light color on the
white<00:03:15.680> clay<00:03:16.090> it's<00:03:17.090> not<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.360> real<00:03:17.750> dark<00:03:18.200> color<00:03:19.180> so

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
white clay it's not a real dark color so

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.940 
white clay it's not a real dark color so
to<00:03:20.299> be<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.450> little<00:03:20.690> bit<00:03:20.840> faint<00:03:21.140> at<00:03:21.349> first<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.890> I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
to be a little bit faint at first and I

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.830 
to be a little bit faint at first and I
am<00:03:21.980> relying<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.670> once<00:03:23.000> this<00:03:23.150> gets<00:03:23.330> fired<00:03:23.659> you

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
am relying on once this gets fired you

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.030 
am relying on once this gets fired you
know<00:03:23.900> these<00:03:24.110> colors<00:03:24.349> get<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> little<00:03:24.920> bit

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
know these colors get a little bit

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.360 
know these colors get a little bit
richer

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
richer

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:52.400 
richer
okay<00:03:26.299> then<00:03:26.450> I'll<00:03:26.569> slowly<00:03:26.840> peel<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.440> off

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.350 

now<00:03:53.410> I'm<00:03:53.709> going<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.069> do<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.640> vessel<00:03:55.000> now<00:03:55.030> but

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
now I'm going to do the vessel now but

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.089 
now I'm going to do the vessel now but
I'm<00:03:55.450> going<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.750> actually<00:03:55.930> use<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.349> rubber<00:03:56.800> rib

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
I'm going to actually use a rubber rib

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.229 
I'm going to actually use a rubber rib
and<00:03:57.310> squeegee<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.209> on<00:03:58.420> here<00:03:59.520> the<00:04:00.520> way<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:01.120> know

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
and squeegee it on here the way you know

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.080 
and squeegee it on here the way you know
is<00:04:01.569> really<00:04:02.260> thick<00:04:02.620> really<00:04:02.890> pasty<00:04:03.670> like<00:04:03.790> cake

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
is really thick really pasty like cake

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.760 
is really thick really pasty like cake
icing<00:04:04.300> and<00:04:04.630> it's<00:04:04.750> already<00:04:05.020> been<00:04:05.140> modified<00:04:05.620> as

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
icing and it's already been modified as

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.400 
icing and it's already been modified as
well<00:04:05.980> now<00:04:06.400> since<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.940> am<00:04:06.970> using<00:04:07.270> white<00:04:07.630> for<00:04:08.319> the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
well now since I am using white for the

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.949 
well now since I am using white for the
vessel<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:08.950> it's<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.160> small<00:04:09.580> area<00:04:10.209> it's<00:04:10.690> this

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
vessel and it's a small area it's this

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.350 
vessel and it's a small area it's this
lends<00:04:11.260> itself<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:12.040> using<00:04:12.459> it<00:04:12.580> I<00:04:12.700> could<00:04:12.940> use<00:04:13.180> it

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
lends itself to using it I could use it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.850 
lends itself to using it I could use it
I<00:04:13.480> do<00:04:13.540> have<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.840> thinner<00:04:14.110> white<00:04:14.319> as<00:04:14.470> well<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.800> I

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
I do have a thinner white as well that I

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.229 
I do have a thinner white as well that I
could<00:04:15.040> use<00:04:15.250> but<00:04:15.790> this<00:04:16.030> works<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:16.570> as<00:04:16.780> well

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
could use but this works just as well

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.990 
could use but this works just as well
and<00:04:19.350> again<00:04:20.350> when<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.680> do<00:04:21.160> use<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.370> squeegee<00:04:21.760> I

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
and again when I do use a squeegee I

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.129 
and again when I do use a squeegee I
don't<00:04:22.210> want<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.419> have<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.600> straight<00:04:22.870> up<00:04:22.900> and

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
don't want to have it straight up and

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.190 
don't want to have it straight up and
down<00:04:23.200> it<00:04:23.770> is<00:04:23.919> at<00:04:24.100> an<00:04:24.220> angle<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.960> I'm<00:04:26.050> not

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
down it is at an angle and I'm not

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.740 
down it is at an angle and I'm not
pressing<00:04:26.470> really<00:04:27.070> hard<00:04:27.250> either<00:04:27.850> just<00:04:28.510> enough

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
pressing really hard either just enough

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.840 
pressing really hard either just enough
pressure<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.590> keep<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.950> moving<00:04:30.340> if<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.610> press

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
pressure to keep it moving if you press

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.879 
pressure to keep it moving if you press
real<00:04:31.090> hard<00:04:31.120> then<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.229> edges<00:04:32.590> of<00:04:32.710> your

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
real hard then the edges of your

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.370 
real hard then the edges of your
squeegee<00:04:33.160> could<00:04:33.490> make<00:04:33.669> dents<00:04:33.970> in<00:04:34.870> your<00:04:35.080> slab

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
squeegee could make dents in your slab

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:43.690 
squeegee could make dents in your slab
so<00:04:35.710> just<00:04:35.919> enough<00:04:36.160> pressure<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.580> move<00:04:36.940> it

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.700 

so<00:04:44.270> this<00:04:44.450> is<00:04:44.600> something<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.050> can<00:04:45.320> drag

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
so this is something that I can drag

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:54.929 
so this is something that I can drag
across

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.149 

I'll<00:04:55.419> put<00:04:55.629> just<00:04:55.659> a<00:04:55.899> touch<00:04:56.110> more<00:04:56.169> on<00:04:56.679> just<00:04:57.069> to

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
I'll put just a touch more on just to

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:07.730 
I'll put just a touch more on just to
make<00:04:57.309> sure<00:04:57.459> I<00:04:57.490> have<00:04:57.699> a<00:04:57.729> good<00:04:57.789> fill

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:18.720 

see<00:05:08.370> what<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.610> have

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.560 

the<00:05:19.270> weight<00:05:19.570> comes<00:05:19.870> up<00:05:20.020> late<00:05:21.210> get<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.270> fire

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
the weight comes up late get a fire

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:58.510 
the weight comes up late get a fire
brighter<00:05:22.930> though

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.550 

now<00:05:59.520> that<00:05:59.669> I<00:05:59.729> have<00:05:59.880> all<00:06:00.030> the<00:06:00.560> individual

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
now that I have all the individual

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.740 
now that I have all the individual
sections<00:06:01.949> of<00:06:02.039> color<00:06:02.250> printed<00:06:02.819> now<00:06:03.360> I'm<00:06:03.479> going

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750

main thing I'm looking for with this
screen<00:06:19.229> is<00:06:19.440> when<00:06:19.979> I<00:06:20.009> put<00:06:20.370> this<00:06:20.490> down<00:06:20.729> and<00:06:21.030> I'm

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
screen is when I put this down and I'm

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.480 
screen is when I put this down and I'm
looking<00:06:21.569> at<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.900> open<00:06:22.199> areas<00:06:22.560> is<00:06:22.740> that<00:06:23.220> where

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
looking at the open areas is that where

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.070 
looking at the open areas is that where
some<00:06:23.699> of<00:06:23.729> these<00:06:23.910> colors<00:06:24.300> overlap<00:06:24.840> a<00:06:24.870> little

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
some of these colors overlap a little

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.990 
some of these colors overlap a little
bit<00:06:25.259> I'm<00:06:25.500> wanting<00:06:26.069> to<00:06:26.190> try<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:26.460> get<00:06:26.639> the<00:06:26.759> black

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
bit I'm wanting to try to get the black

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.629 
bit I'm wanting to try to get the black
to<00:06:27.240> cover<00:06:27.569> over<00:06:27.840> where<00:06:28.259> those<00:06:28.380> seams<00:06:28.740> are<00:06:29.039> now

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
to cover over where those seams are now

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.270 
to cover over where those seams are now
the<00:06:30.360> way<00:06:30.479> that<00:06:30.630> I<00:06:30.660> did<00:06:30.780> this<00:06:31.110> is<00:06:31.380> that<00:06:31.440> they

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
the way that I did this is that they

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.249 
the way that I did this is that they
won't<00:06:32.520> all<00:06:32.669> be<00:06:32.729> covered<00:06:33.270> up<00:06:33.509> I<00:06:33.720> do<00:06:33.780> want<00:06:34.139> a

won't all be covered up I do want a

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.629 
won't all be covered up I do want a
little<00:06:34.289> bit<00:06:34.620> of<00:06:34.680> that<00:06:34.800> shifting<00:06:35.310> just<00:06:35.490> cause

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
little bit of that shifting just cause

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:36.920 
little bit of that shifting just cause
aesthetically<00:06:36.210> that's<00:06:36.389> the<00:06:36.509> type<00:06:36.690> of<00:06:36.720> look

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
aesthetically that's the type of look

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.680 
aesthetically that's the type of look
that<00:06:36.990> I<00:06:37.169> enjoy<00:06:37.500> but<00:06:38.370> this<00:06:38.639> black<00:06:38.970> outline<00:06:39.449> is

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
that I enjoy but this black outline is
