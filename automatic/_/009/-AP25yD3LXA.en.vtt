00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
different classics for a while now but I

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.000 
different classics for a while now but I
just<00:04:36.580> always<00:04:37.030> choose<00:04:37.930> other<00:04:38.229> books<00:04:38.500> over<00:04:38.830> them

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
for some reason I think it's because I'm

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.140 
for some reason I think it's because I'm
very<00:04:40.780> intimidated<00:04:41.500> by<00:04:41.650> classics<00:04:42.190> but<00:04:42.940> for
