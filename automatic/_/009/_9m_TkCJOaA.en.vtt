to<00:01:34.650> heal<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.240> had<00:01:36.240> mine<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.479> around<00:01:37.790> around<00:01:38.790> six

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
to heal I had mine for around around six

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.590 
to heal I had mine for around around six
months<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.329> think

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
months I think

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
months I think
um<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:41.040> recently<00:01:41.220> started<00:01:41.460> stretching

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
um and I recently started stretching

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
um and I recently started stretching
them<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:45.479> stretching<00:01:45.840> process<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
them and the stretching process is the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.609 
them and the stretching process is the
same<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.600> earlobe<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> wait

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619

depending<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:40.110> um<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.170> chose<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.160> flat<00:02:42.460> back

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
depending and um I chose a flat back

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.520 
depending and um I chose a flat back
stud<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.390> he<00:02:43.510> he<00:02:43.840> was<00:02:43.960> going<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.170> give<00:02:44.290> me<00:02:44.410> that

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
stud and he he was going to give me that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.870 
stud and he he was going to give me that
anyway<00:02:44.890> but<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.130> know<00:02:45.250> some<00:02:45.400> people<00:02:45.520> get<00:02:45.700> them

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
anyway but I know some people get them

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.610 
anyway but I know some people get them
with<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.120> barbells<00:02:46.600> but<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.110> had<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.350> Pierce

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
with like barbells but I had it Pierce

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.810 
with like barbells but I had it Pierce
to<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.740> barbell<00:02:48.100> before<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.490> it<00:02:48.550> did<00:02:48.700> not

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
to the barbell before and it did not

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.180 
to the barbell before and it did not
heal<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.780> recommend<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.470> flat<00:02:50.650> back

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
heal so I recommend the flat back

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.820 
heal so I recommend the flat back
studs<00:02:51.780> that's<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:52.990> my<00:02:53.260> personal<00:02:53.620> preference

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
studs that's just my personal preference

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.330 
studs that's just my personal preference
um<00:02:54.780> yeah<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.080> got<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.350> Pierce<00:02:56.500> with<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.680> 14<00:02:57.040> and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
um yeah so I got a Pierce with a 14 and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.720 
um yeah so I got a Pierce with a 14 and
then<00:02:58.170> after<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.500> felt<00:03:00.130> they<00:03:00.220> were<00:03:00.280> healed

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
then after I felt they were healed

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.160 
then after I felt they were healed
um<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:02.490> put<00:03:03.490> in<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.850> 14<00:03:04.240> gauge<00:03:04.390> plug<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.020> it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
um I put in a 14 gauge plug and it

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.370 
um I put in a 14 gauge plug and it
slipped<00:03:06.130> right<00:03:06.310> through<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.610> back<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:08.260> was

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
slipped right through the back and I was

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.340 
slipped right through the back and I was
like<00:03:08.530> oh<00:03:09.000> that's<00:03:10.000> not<00:03:10.210> good<00:03:10.780> like<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.200> was<00:03:11.320> a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
like oh that's not good like it was a

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.530 
like oh that's not good like it was a
tunnel<00:03:11.740> like<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.130> flare<00:03:12.430> just<00:03:13.210> pulled<00:03:13.450> right

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
tunnel like the flare just pulled right

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.670 
tunnel like the flare just pulled right
through<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.900> back<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.320> like<00:03:14.470> okay

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
through the back and I was like okay

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.800 
through the back and I was like okay
well<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:14.920> guess<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.220> can't<00:03:15.400> wear<00:03:15.520> these<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.600> put

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
well I guess I can't wear these so I put

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.600 
well I guess I can't wear these so I put
a<00:03:16.840> 12<00:03:17.080> in<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.560> there<00:03:17.680> was<00:03:17.800> like<00:03:17.920> no<00:03:18.070> there<00:03:18.489> was

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
a 12 in and there was like no there was

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.400 
a 12 in and there was like no there was
room<00:03:19.060> for<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.390> 12<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.690> guess<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.080> just<00:03:20.290> put

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
room for the 12 I guess so I just put

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.220 
room for the 12 I guess so I just put
that<00:03:20.440> in<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.450> um<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:24.270> tapered<00:03:25.270> to<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.630> 10<00:03:25.959> so

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
that in and that um I tapered to a 10 so

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.270 
that in and that um I tapered to a 10 so
I<00:03:26.260> don't<00:03:26.500> know<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.709> said<00:03:26.860> that<00:03:27.100> these<00:03:27.220> were

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
I don't know if I said that these were

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.949 
I don't know if I said that these were
12<00:03:27.700> earlier<00:03:28.090> in<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.270> video<00:03:28.330> but<00:03:28.630> there<00:03:28.750> are<00:03:28.810> 10

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
12 earlier in the video but there are 10

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.160 
12 earlier in the video but there are 10
now<00:03:29.140> so<00:03:29.550> um<00:03:31.200> that's<00:03:32.200> what<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.470> looks<00:03:32.590> like<00:03:32.739> I

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
hard like this and it's just

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.430

like well I also probably cuz I wear
glasses<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:24.039> that's<00:04:24.190> definitely<00:04:24.520> something

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
glasses so that's definitely something

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.689 
glasses so that's definitely something
to<00:04:24.789> think<00:04:24.940> about<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.449> wear<00:04:26.259> glasses<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.979> um<00:04:27.370> I

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
to think about I wear glasses and um I

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.670 
to think about I wear glasses and um I
always<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.600> always<00:04:28.630> work<00:04:29.169> on<00:04:29.289> text<00:04:29.560> in<00:04:29.620> my

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
always I always work on text in my

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.279 
always I always work on text in my
videos<00:04:29.949> but<00:04:30.160> like<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.479> way<00:04:31.599> it<00:04:31.750> bends<00:04:31.930> over

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
videos but like the way it bends over

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.740 
videos but like the way it bends over
the<00:04:32.410> back<00:04:32.530> of<00:04:32.560> my<00:04:32.740> ear<00:04:32.949> it<00:04:33.460> like<00:04:33.940> hits<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.389> in<00:04:34.569> a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
the back of my ear it like hits it in a

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.059 
the back of my ear it like hits it in a
weird<00:04:34.960> position<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:35.770> something<00:04:35.919> you

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
weird position so that's something you

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:37.409 
weird position so that's something you
definitely<00:04:36.370> want<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.550> consider<00:04:36.849> maybe<00:04:37.180> when

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
definitely want to consider maybe when

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.580 
definitely want to consider maybe when
you<00:04:37.509> go<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.690> get<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.930> piercing<00:04:38.289> wear<00:04:38.470> your
