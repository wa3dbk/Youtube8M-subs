smooth<00:01:26.850> process<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.810> had<00:01:27.930> looked<00:01:28.080> at<00:01:28.259> a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
smooth process and I had looked at a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.770 
smooth process and I had looked at a
bunch<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.560> videos<00:01:28.860> online<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.659> of

bunch of videos online and a lot of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.170 
bunch of videos online and a lot of
people<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.650> would<00:01:32.130> Pierce<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.909> then

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
people that do it would Pierce and then

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.060 
people that do it would Pierce and then
they<00:01:33.450> would<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> jewelry<00:01:34.829> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
they would like go get the jewelry and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.490 
they would like go get the jewelry and
the<00:01:35.310> person<00:01:35.670> sitting<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.119> would<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.270> like

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
the person sitting there would be like

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.200 
the person sitting there would be like
but<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:37.950> much<00:01:38.070> anticipation<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
but just so much anticipation and I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.999 
but just so much anticipation and I
think<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.960> would<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.380> made<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
think that that would have made the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.030 
think that that would have made the
experience<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.549> lot<00:01:41.640> more<00:01:41.790> painful<00:01:42.329> um<00:01:42.979> but<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
experience a lot more painful um but I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.399 
experience a lot more painful um but I
would<00:01:44.399> say<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> piercing<00:01:46.049> wasn't<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
would say like the piercing wasn't that

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.889 
would say like the piercing wasn't that
bad<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.950> jewelry<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.820> sucked<00:01:48.119> kind<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
bad the jewelry really sucked kind of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.410 
bad the jewelry really sucked kind of

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
got it on monday and it actually is like

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.090 
got it on monday and it actually is like
not<00:02:32.940> sore<00:02:33.750> anymore<00:02:33.780> I'm<00:02:34.470> not<00:02:34.620> going<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.920> touch

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
not sore anymore I'm not going to touch

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.560 
not sore anymore I'm not going to touch
it<00:02:35.160> because<00:02:35.430> I'm<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:35.940> supposed<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.420> touch<00:02:36.510> it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
it because I'm not supposed to touch it

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.560 
it because I'm not supposed to touch it
but<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.310> area<00:02:38.580> around<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:41.180> doesn't<00:02:42.180> hurt

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
but like the area around it doesn't hurt

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.690 
but like the area around it doesn't hurt
and<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:44.330> hasn't<00:02:45.330> gotten<00:02:46.320> darker<00:02:47.040> or<00:02:47.250> anything

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and it hasn't gotten darker or anything

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.760 
and it hasn't gotten darker or anything
so<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.630> good<00:02:48.780> sign<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.320> not

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
so that's a good sign that it's not

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.820 
so that's a good sign that it's not
gonna<00:02:49.980> like<00:02:50.250> scar<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:52.290> was<00:02:52.410> one<00:02:52.560> thing<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.800> was

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
gonna like scar that was one thing I was

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.560 
gonna like scar that was one thing I was
kind<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.160> worried<00:02:53.400> about<00:02:53.550> was<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.850> if<00:02:54.210> it<00:02:54.390> had

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
kind of worried about was that if it had

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.390 
kind of worried about was that if it had
like<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.810> little<00:02:54.990> dark<00:02:55.350> ring<00:02:55.650> around<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:56.220> it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
like a little dark ring around it it

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.230 
like a little dark ring around it it
might<00:02:56.580> look<00:02:56.850> kind<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.180> ugly<00:02:57.740> but<00:02:58.740> it<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.240> think

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
might look kind of ugly but it I think

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.420 
might look kind of ugly but it I think
it<00:03:00.330> looks<00:03:00.510> pretty<00:03:00.630> good<00:03:00.990> um<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.070> think

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it looks pretty good um I just think

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
it looks pretty good um I just think
it's<00:03:02.580> cool<00:03:02.880> because<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:04.080> small<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:05.450> so

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
it's cool because it's so small that so

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.690 
it's cool because it's so small that so
far<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:07.230> most<00:03:07.860> people<00:03:08.220> haven't<00:03:08.580> even
