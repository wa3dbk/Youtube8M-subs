00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
will eventually start bulldozing and see

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.309 
will eventually start bulldozing and see

to about three and like I said I use

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.600 
to about three and like I said I use
about<00:04:22.990> two<00:04:23.229> how<00:04:23.500> many<00:04:23.710> go<00:04:23.860> close<00:04:24.100> I'll<00:04:24.430> go<00:04:24.580> a

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
about two how many go close I'll go a

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.820 
about two how many go close I'll go a
little<00:04:24.699> bit<00:04:24.940> longer<00:04:25.180> just<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.630> show<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.870> the

difference of having the what I call the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.080 
difference of having the what I call the
recipe<00:04:29.110> for<00:04:29.289> good<00:04:29.470> strips<00:04:29.889> but<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:30.729> too<00:04:30.910> long

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
of a stitch length and sewing too fast

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.270 
of a stitch length and sewing too fast
and<00:04:33.310> that's<00:04:33.820> one<00:04:34.000> of<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.150> things<00:04:34.449> that<00:04:34.660> will

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
and that's one of the things that will

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.670 
and that's one of the things that will
never<00:04:36.280> work<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:36.940> what<00:04:37.599> I'm<00:04:37.720> gonna<00:04:37.810> do<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.320> I'm

traveled see that it will actually have
bacon<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:07.070> edge<00:05:07.250> of<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.520> fabric<00:05:07.990> you'll<00:05:08.990> see

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
bacon the edge of the fabric you'll see

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.970 
bacon the edge of the fabric you'll see
you<00:05:09.500> get<00:05:09.680> Wiggles<00:05:10.660> that's<00:05:11.660> what's<00:05:12.590> happening

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
you get Wiggles that's what's happening

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.890 
you get Wiggles that's what's happening
is<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.250> altered<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:13.880> length<00:05:14.240> of<00:05:14.390> your<00:05:14.540> strip

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.290 
is it altered the length of your strip
so<00:05:15.410> this<00:05:15.680> side<00:05:15.950> of<00:05:16.100> your<00:05:16.250> strip<00:05:16.610> because<00:05:17.150> it's

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
so this side of your strip because it's

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.790 
so this side of your strip because it's
thinking<00:05:17.660> that<00:05:17.780> eased<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:18.230> in<00:05:18.350> those<00:05:18.530> feed

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
thinking that eased and in those feed

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.790 
thinking that eased and in those feed
dogs<00:05:19.010> went<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:19.550> fast<00:05:19.880> it<00:05:20.480> actually<00:05:20.960> eased<00:05:21.530> in

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
dogs went so fast it actually eased in

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.460 
dogs went so fast it actually eased in
the<00:05:22.010> fabric<00:05:22.430> on<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.670> bottom<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.960> you<00:05:24.140> ended

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
the fabric on the bottom and you ended

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.400 
the fabric on the bottom and you ended
up<00:05:24.590> with<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.130> wavy<00:05:25.460> strip<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.240> you<00:05:26.360> can<00:05:26.510> see<00:05:26.720> how

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
up with a wavy strip and you can see how

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.170 
up with a wavy strip and you can see how
to<00:05:27.470> even<00:05:27.650> curled<00:05:27.980> it<00:05:28.160> up<00:05:28.280> on<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.580> end<00:05:28.730> and<00:05:29.030> then

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
to even curled it up on the end and then

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.210 
to even curled it up on the end and then
you<00:05:29.240> see<00:05:29.450> it<00:05:29.540> waves<00:05:29.780> here<00:05:30.200> and<00:05:30.380> then<00:05:30.980> it<00:05:31.100> gives

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
you see it waves here and then it gives

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.840 
you see it waves here and then it gives
a<00:05:31.400> little<00:05:31.640> wave<00:05:31.820> up<00:05:32.030> here<00:05:32.300> notice<00:05:33.260> there<00:05:34.220> is<00:05:34.550> a

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
a little wave up here notice there is a

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:41.020 
a little wave up here notice there is a
gap<00:05:35.210> I<00:05:36.670> can't<00:05:37.670> break<00:05:37.880> it<00:05:38.140> my<00:05:39.490> my<00:05:40.490> rules<00:05:40.790> that<00:05:41.000> I

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
gap I can't break it my my rules that I

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.910 
gap I can't break it my my rules that I
sell<00:05:41.390> it<00:05:41.540> so<00:05:41.780> much<00:05:41.960> that<00:05:42.200> I<00:05:42.230> can<00:05:42.470> let<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.740> get

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
sell it so much that I can let it get

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.670 
sell it so much that I can let it get
really<00:05:43.220> bad<00:05:43.430> but<00:05:43.790> I<00:05:44.030> mean<00:05:44.780> even<00:05:45.350> with<00:05:45.470> me<00:05:45.650> being

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
notice it like I said how flat it is and

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.520 
notice it like I said how flat it is and
you<00:05:59.960> can<00:06:00.140> even<00:06:00.260> tell<00:06:00.560> when<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:00.860> lay<00:06:01.040> them<00:06:01.310> down

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
you can even tell when you lay them down

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.740 
you can even tell when you lay them down
that<00:06:03.530> one<00:06:03.860> of<00:06:03.980> them<00:06:04.100> is<00:06:04.610> coming<00:06:05.000> clear<00:06:05.360> off<00:06:05.540> the

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
that one of them is coming clear off the

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.320 
that one of them is coming clear off the
table<00:06:05.930> right<00:06:06.470> here<00:06:06.800> right<00:06:07.370> here<00:06:07.400> and<00:06:08.060> you<00:06:08.210> can

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
table right here right here and you can

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.320 
table right here right here and you can
see<00:06:08.540> that<00:06:08.780> it<00:06:08.900> kind<00:06:09.140> of<00:06:09.230> wobbles<00:06:09.680> a<00:06:09.800> little<00:06:10.040> bit

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
see that it kind of wobbles a little bit

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.850 
see that it kind of wobbles a little bit
so<00:06:11.330> there<00:06:11.600> is<00:06:11.750> a<00:06:11.780> major<00:06:12.140> difference<00:06:12.440> when

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
so there is a major difference when

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.860 
so there is a major difference when
using<00:06:13.010> technique<00:06:13.670> especially<00:06:14.060> when<00:06:14.660> you<00:06:14.720> have

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
using technique especially when you have

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.720 
using technique especially when you have
too<00:06:15.080> long<00:06:15.260> of<00:06:15.440> a<00:06:15.530> stitch<00:06:15.800> length<00:06:16.040> and<00:06:16.340> like<00:06:16.550> I

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
too long of a stitch length and like I

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.250 
too long of a stitch length and like I
said<00:06:16.790> make<00:06:17.180> sure<00:06:17.210> you<00:06:17.540> check<00:06:17.780> those<00:06:17.960> tensions

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
said make sure you check those tensions

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260 
said make sure you check those tensions
before<00:06:18.800> you<00:06:18.890> start<00:06:19.190> make<00:06:19.730> sure<00:06:19.760> you<00:06:19.970> have<00:06:20.150> an

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
before you start make sure you have an

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.060 
before you start make sure you have an
appropriate<00:06:20.840> size<00:06:21.080> needle<00:06:21.470> for<00:06:21.650> your<00:06:21.680> thread

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
appropriate size needle for your thread

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
stitch length and hopefully that helps I

stitch length and hopefully that helps I
