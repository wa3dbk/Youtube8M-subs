chases<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:45.090> crazy<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.590> remember<00:01:47.250> back<00:01:47.399> when<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240 
chases get crazy I remember back when I
played<00:01:47.670> through<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.180> game<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.570> ps2<00:01:49.250> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.340 
played through this game on the ps2 and
there<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.820> chase<00:01:51.149> where<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> literally

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
there was one chase where I literally

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.300 
there was one chase where I literally
went<00:01:52.740> through<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.299> heat<00:01:54.540> levels<00:01:55.020> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
believe one of the earlier races in my

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.580 
believe one of the earlier races in my
career<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:02.750> my<00:03:02.780> career<00:03:03.080> mode<00:03:03.440> and

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
career and in my career mode and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
career and in my career mode and
Counting<00:03:06.590> where<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.739> am<00:03:06.920> now<00:03:07.100> in<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.340> game

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
Counting where I am now in the game

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.690 
Counting where I am now in the game
we're<00:03:08.570> actually<00:03:08.780> quite<00:03:09.200> close<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.980> racing<00:03:10.489> I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
we're actually quite close to racing I

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.479

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
think his name is Kenji in his rx-7 and

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.920 
think his name is Kenji in his rx-7 and
that's<00:03:14.060> gonna<00:03:14.180> be<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.360> pretty<00:03:14.570> good<00:03:14.660> race

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
that's gonna be a pretty good race

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.580 
that's gonna be a pretty good race
because<00:03:15.350> what<00:03:15.920> Allah<00:03:16.160> yeah<00:03:16.579> yeah<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:18.049> didn't

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
because what Allah yeah yeah I didn't

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.960 
because what Allah yeah yeah I didn't
finish<00:03:18.769> sound<00:03:19.070> right<00:03:19.250> what<00:03:19.400> I'll<00:03:19.519> be<00:03:19.610> able<00:03:19.730> to

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
finish sound right what I'll be able to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.000 
finish sound right what I'll be able to
do<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:20.329> I'll<00:03:20.810> be<00:03:20.930> able<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.170> get<00:03:21.290> his<00:03:21.500> car<00:03:21.769> and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
do is I'll be able to get his car and

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.759 
do is I'll be able to get his car and
win<00:03:22.519> his<00:03:22.670> car<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.720> believe<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.140> rx-7<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.709> a

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
win his car and I believe the rx-7 is a

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.530 
win his car and I believe the rx-7 is a
tier<00:03:25.010> 2<00:03:25.160> car<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:25.579> it'll<00:03:25.700> automatically<00:03:26.239> give

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
tier 2 car so it'll automatically give

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.380 
tier 2 car so it'll automatically give
me<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:27.019> really<00:03:27.920> really<00:03:28.220> really<00:03:28.579> good<00:03:28.940> tier<00:03:29.180> 2

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
me a really really really good tier 2

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.380 
me a really really really good tier 2
car<00:03:29.630> if<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:29.840> beat<00:03:30.049> him<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:30.380> I'll<00:03:30.769> definitely

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
car if I beat him and I'll definitely

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
there we just go right past and we'd

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.039

corner<00:04:03.350> is<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.500> little<00:04:03.560> tricky<00:04:04.160> because<00:04:04.280> it

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
corner is a little tricky because it

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.729 
corner is a little tricky because it
seems<00:04:04.910> like<00:04:05.180> it's<00:04:05.329> gonna<00:04:05.480> be<00:04:05.690> tight<00:04:05.989> but<00:04:06.590> then

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
seems like it's gonna be tight but then

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.259 
seems like it's gonna be tight but then
it<00:04:06.859> opens<00:04:07.160> up<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:07.549> actually<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.910> lot

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
it opens up and it's actually a lot

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.060 
it opens up and it's actually a lot
wider<00:04:08.690> than<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.140> think<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.470> is<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.859> then<00:04:09.950> you

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
wider than you think it is and then you

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.710 
wider than you think it is and then you
can<00:04:10.100> actually<00:04:10.489> boost<00:04:10.670> right<00:04:11.180> out<00:04:11.359> of<00:04:11.480> it<00:04:11.570> and

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
can actually boost right out of it and

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.020 
can actually boost right out of it and
