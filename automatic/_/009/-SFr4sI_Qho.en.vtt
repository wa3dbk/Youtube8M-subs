00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
like in the first round is like a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620 
like in the first round is like a

or<00:00:21.960> defense<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.410> then<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.920> need<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.160> move<00:00:23.279> on

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
or defense and then you need to move on

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.310 
or defense and then you need to move on
to<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> third<00:00:23.910> round<00:00:24.210> then<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> play<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.019> other

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
to a third round then you play the other

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.750 
to a third round then you play the other
side<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.859> search-and-destroy<00:00:26.220> like<00:00:26.580> if<00:00:26.670> you

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
side of search-and-destroy like if you

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.980 
side of search-and-destroy like if you
play<00:00:26.880> defense<00:00:26.939> first<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.660> play<00:00:27.840> defense

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
play defense first you play defense

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.660 
play defense first you play defense

like things like that if you guys go
back<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.310> look<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.970> quality<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.720> those

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
back and look at the quality of those

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.160 
back and look at the quality of those
games<00:01:31.579> they<00:01:32.579> were<00:01:32.640> awful<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:33.810> look<00:01:34.049> at

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
games they were awful and then look at

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.679 
games they were awful and then look at
what<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:35.100> Crysis<00:01:35.759> 3<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.570> know

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
what we have now like Crysis 3 you know

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.420 
what we have now like Crysis 3 you know
battlefield<00:01:37.229> 4<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:37.829> kinds<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> stuff

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
battlefield 4 and all kinds of stuff

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
battlefield 4 and all kinds of stuff
it's<00:01:38.610> absolutely<00:01:39.090> beautiful<00:01:39.509> even<00:01:39.659> on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it's absolutely beautiful even on

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.499 
it's absolutely beautiful even on
current<00:01:40.320> gen<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:41.340> about<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:41.970> applies

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
current gen think about how that applies

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
current gen think about how that applies
to<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.899> next-gen<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.710> think<00:01:43.860> about<00:01:44.040> how

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
to this next-gen like think about how

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
to this next-gen like think about how
this<00:01:44.430> technically<00:01:44.970> what<00:01:45.210> you're<00:01:45.360> watching<00:01:45.540> on

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
this technically what you're watching on

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.510 
this technically what you're watching on
screen<00:01:46.049> right<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.320> even<00:01:46.560> though<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.189> leaps

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
screen right now even though it's leaps

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
screen right now even though it's leaps
and<00:01:47.759> bounds<00:01:48.149> above<00:01:48.270> any<00:01:48.869> console<00:01:49.470> game<00:01:49.619> we've

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and bounds above any console game we've

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.630 
and bounds above any console game we've
ever<00:01:49.979> seen<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.579> far<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.869> bad<00:01:52.290> quality<00:01:52.680> for

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
ever seen so far this is bad quality for

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
ever seen so far this is bad quality for
what<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> ps4<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:55.020> once<00:01:55.320> developers

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
what the ps4 can do like once developers

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.530 
what the ps4 can do like once developers
start<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> figure<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.610> how<00:01:57.090> they<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.390> take

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
start to figure out how they can take

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600 
start to figure out how they can take
better<00:01:57.750> advantage<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.920> know<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.490> of

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
better advantage of you know the kind of

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.609 
better advantage of you know the kind of
equipment<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.689> technology<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
equipment and the technology in this

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.990 
equipment and the technology in this
system<00:02:01.860> they're<00:02:02.490> gonna<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.700> able<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> make

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
system they're gonna be able to make

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.550 
system they're gonna be able to make
games<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.360> look<00:02:03.420> way<00:02:03.899> better<00:02:04.170> than<00:02:04.380> this

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
games that look way better than this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.410 
games that look way better than this
even<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.030> pretty<00:02:06.270> crazy

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
even so that's just that's pretty crazy

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.819 
even so that's just that's pretty crazy
because<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.869> think<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.140> looks<00:02:07.380> pretty<00:02:07.530> good

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
because I think this looks pretty good

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.850 
because I think this looks pretty good
it<00:02:08.009> plays<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> little<00:02:09.090> bit<00:02:09.450> slow<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:10.020> times<00:02:10.259> but

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
it plays a little bit slow at times but

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.510 
it plays a little bit slow at times but
overall<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.819> really

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
overall I just I really

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.250 
overall I just I really
like<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.820> like<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.030> think<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.540> could<00:02:13.990> see<00:02:14.110> myself

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
like to like I think I could see myself

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.450 
like to like I think I could see myself
playing<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.800> game<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.010> lot<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.220> wouldn't<00:02:15.400> be

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
playing this game a lot I wouldn't be

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.910 
playing this game a lot I wouldn't be
doing<00:02:15.670> let's<00:02:16.270> play<00:02:16.480> on<00:02:16.630> T<00:02:16.780> Martin<00:02:17.050> -<00:02:17.230> but<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.650> can

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
doing let's play on T Martin - but I can

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.080

from this every once in a while just

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.510 
from this every once in a while just
because<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.800> don't<00:02:21.010> know<00:02:21.070> like<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.310> said

because it's I don't know like I said

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.040 
because it's I don't know like I said
it's<00:02:21.670> really<00:02:21.850> deep<00:02:22.210> there's<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.540> lot<00:02:22.930> of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
it's really deep there's a lot of
