00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.320
 greet them now we are going in a 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.749
 tutorial on how the virus in your 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.380
 computer or if they feel very slow 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.470
 his computer 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.420
 I 'm going to show you the first symptoms and 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.770
 what solutions can you have for your 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.770
 computer is very slow 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.199
 the first thing when they say they have viruses 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.700
 you do not find friends download programs or 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.850
 Applications 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.210
 that always comes with something and 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.030
 they will always accept for example here 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.520
 we have this 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.300
 and the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.300
 enjoy 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.880
 and this driver also has this 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.420
 another and if the performer 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.820
 then there are two and all is missing and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.220
 has more gets applications that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.990
 they do not use 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.990
 do not use on your computer 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.979
 eliminate all that junk programs that 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.200
 We are greeting antivirus that are not 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.689
 that you came up 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.610
 apart from being your computer and so for 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.010
 go eliminating 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.860
 the parties are clogging was bought 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.640
 all the quick crap 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.440
 another thing that also 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.070
 and they will realize when they learn 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.050
 his computer 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.560
 this is from another computer but let's make 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.560
 An example 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.130
 the fan to turn on the computer 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.200
 this is not for 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.759
 is that your computer warms up and is 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.939
 talented your computer becomes slow 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.939
 as well 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.090
 you can hear it until now 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.119
 learn the fan of the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.610
 camera put its new thermal paste already 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.890
 it went out 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.330
 that is normal to turn on and off 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.159
 because it is in the process of cooling 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.939
 and go back to 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.280
 to pay when fixed fixed of gijÃ³n 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.410
 fixed fixed one is removed is that its 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.160
 compute up we have an overload of 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.160
 temperature 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.940
 then it is a thermal paste that 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.940
 puts in the processor 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.379
 I have a lot of lighting in this room 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.140
 a thermal paste and also know 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.420
 another that is like modest 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.440
 and taken sometimes carrying more once 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.550
 alone can be three 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.550
 this is a give me 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.950
 You can get them in stores like 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.740
 director 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.810
 no relation can load the internet 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.850
 and it is also followed that your computer 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.030
 is the part that does not break down because 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.540
 it gets too hot it can damage what 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.640
 which is the processor that by extending the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.040
 video card you will have to change 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.040
 the whole card more 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.860
 then he also eliminated the programs 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.990
 not 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.620
 and they are not serving you they can not go down 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.550
 What Brazil is part of your computer 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.550
 but they can also do 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.300
 winston 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.990
 until the date before it happened to them 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.990
 that problem of 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.180
 the virus that they had that eliminate the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.180
 virus application 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.440
 It is almost the same doing the knits xxi 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.600
 vista and windows 7 is the same no 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.150
 procedure remove the programs what 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.340
 more change 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.340
 change the design of the folders and everything 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.760
 and how very well 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.210
 - explained very well there is 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.200
 find him where he says the option to create 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.200
 visitor 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.830
 it tells me properties is the rest of the 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.830
 system 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.139
 what do you want to see all 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.560
 all of masks cause 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:52.050
 normal apply 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.050
 well next I'm sorry 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.059
 programs 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:00.080
 is with this computer with that has no 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:03.360
 really has a problem of degree 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.100
 then not that they brought it in time 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.230
 the situation will be aggravated 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.900
 I hope this helps you for your 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.850
 comments and want another if they need 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.360
 help for something I can help you with 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.360
 pleasure 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.360
