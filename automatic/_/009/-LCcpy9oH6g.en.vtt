00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.420
 very good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.190
 video in this case I'm going to show you the 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.290
 schedules of the main with today's I'm going to 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.960
 be very attentive especially to everything 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.520
 what happened because I realized that in 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.279
 all the programming that there is for today 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.470
 What is this that we have here? 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.830
 there is nothing that puts minecraft 1.9 or 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.930
 that if they did not do anything today what 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.910
 they will leave for tomorrow because the schedule 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.150
 tomorrow we still do not have it but 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.890
 seems to be seems to continue for now who 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.290
 is going in clear future in not going to appear 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.399
 today is worth in this case 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.079
 a series of things are going to appear very 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.200
 interesting, especially in 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.380
 minecraft story mode but otherwise 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.790
 there's nothing else that we can 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.800
 see so in principle that we call the 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.440
 attention is worth what I will explain 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.510
 a moment and especially something that a lot 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.780
 People are asking me at what time 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.309
 are lectures and so on that are going to 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.220
 leave in this case because I can not give a 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.350
 exact work because I am from different 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.910
 countries it is clear that some are from Spain 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.220
 another from argentina another from maicon de 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.770
 colombianos from venezuela etcetera in 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.450
 this case then I will give you a utility 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.020
 it's worth a tool that's going to be 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.009
 so that you can say 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.630
 transform the schedule that there is of 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.670
 london that this case this we have 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.280
 over here is several of london to schedule 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.929
 of your own country is worth so 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.850
 let's go to the page now mount 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.350
 global dotcom here for example this 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.020
 World time if we give customize 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.689
 To customize watches we can choose the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.060
 place of origin of ours to be able to 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.189
 choose the schedule we want to watch 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.039
 For example, let's say what we will do 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.560
 the seven or so in london in 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.509
 Spain because in this case it now 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.789
 madrid would be 8 is going to be another hour 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.130
 in this case in Mexico it would be 12 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.079
 good one o'clock in the morning in good 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.929
 air three o'clock in the morning and so on 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.030
 ballistic then said this can you 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.860
 transform the schedule that you are going to see in 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.229
 yourselves 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.819
 ok I'm going to do the transformation of 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.440
 Spain is more the way then also the 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.179
 description for all the people who come 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.760
 of Spain because I'm from Spain mind 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.640
 There is better, but what good 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.930
 I will not be able to set the schedule either 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.989
 of all countries because it is impossible 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.790
 it is worth then what new authors of 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.870
 new here and explain a little bit what 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.060
 is what we are going to see 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.159
 and more interesting in this case we have 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.349
 three cameras to have three cameras in 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.150
 the whole event we will also have two 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.650
 totally different streaming one that 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.120
 it's going to be by tweets and another pass by 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.340
 youtube in this case the two are going to give 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.890
 the same but different 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.019
 let's say time because you already know that the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.510
 Youtube streaming goes with two minutes 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.799
 of delay approximately then it is 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.360
 well I also find it more comfortable 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.030
 youtube that tweets but likewise I'm going to 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.220
 give also the good in the description 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.900
 the link so that you go both 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.519
 streaming youtube which is this that 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.160
 I'm seeing and here right now as the 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.870
 streaming of tweets then guys the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.430
 schedule we have eleven thirty and twelve 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.859
 half an hour and espanyol opening ceremony 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.540
 the opening ceremony in the 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.310
 welcome to the main with twelve and a half 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.810
 a girlfriend is imaginary here she is here 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.739
 you have it simply add one hour what 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.720
 that I am seeing what I am 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.129
 saying for Spain and add the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.620
 hours that you need for your country 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.150
 Friends are fine in this case, so I 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.470
 I think it's something animation or if not what 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.239
 I know very well I think they are youtubers 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.959
 but I can not speak very well of 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.609
 they 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.049
 mike the study with elements animation 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.430
 in this case if a element animation 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.580
 well you know for good for those who do not 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.040
 know it is worth of bng animation 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.810
 is a group that is dedicated to making 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.700
 Minecraft animations surely 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.530
 babies or animations of the egg this 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.270
 goes by minecraft we also have the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.730
 bayer news animation that to me 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.920
 love everything and well, well, some 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.170
 it's better to keating custom apps in this 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.150
 case then this is going to be a bit of 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.730
 matchmaking this also came out in the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.710
 previous maicon two years ago but hey 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.020
 equally for the people who are 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.490
 like the matchmaking as you can see 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.560
 this part that can be very 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.720
 interesting not studio master whi's 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.100
 picture is just this but here 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.680
 sorry for pointing out that I think that at 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.150
 point it looks a little worse than you have 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.000
 turtle with you without moving this case 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.530
 you pay will teach you how to play with mod is 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.090
 something very strange 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.860
 in the main com but good as well 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.890
 I'll be careful to see what they teach 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.100
 ok and I'll tell you mike the studio whi 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.200
 says mk the words these do not want the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.489
 truth I have no idea 2011 story 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.320
 mother in this case because this is very 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.700
 interesting is going to be an hour and a half 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.650
 because here we have four and a half 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.380
 five and a half and good five and a half 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.760
 follow me in Spain and after six and 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.470
 half ago seven 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.820
 in estelÃ­ games that is just what 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.520
 same that they will continue talking about the same thing 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.590
 I think so, well, here you have 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.870
 all this is going to be a very 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.850
 important and good, well, I'm going to 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.920
 be also very attentive about all this 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.930
 this is similar I do not know what it is but 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.460
 I will also look at it and if there is anything that 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.890
 It's worth it, also in the video 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.870
 and I'll show and then a cas Regrowth 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.780
 which is just in case you have lost 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.310
 something therefore just the repetition of 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.840
 everything they have taught on day one 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.800
 for another we also have here in this 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.840
 part of the main stage that would be another 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.580
 different camera that is also day 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.810
 1 and this case, we also have the 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.640
 opening ceremony just like here 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.360
 we have is also friends just like 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.940
 here we have a costume contest 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.470
 it's going to be up to now if what he says 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.960
 so you go to this camera and you can 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.150
 see and then also this that is that 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.590
 has starter using bots that I think 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.600
 it's the same because it also enters the 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.640
 same in the same schedule is valid and then 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.790
 we have the panel room that would be another 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.170
 different camera that would be one to two 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.370
 in the afternoon in the life of youtuber 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.940
 I suppose different youtube rooms 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.070
 Anglophone talking about what is 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.140
 youtube and especially about 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.550
 minecraft in create in custom maps that 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.460
 I guess it will be the same as we have 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.810
 over here we have craft in line something 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.030
 they will make it live surely so 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.620
 I'll be careful if I'll put it in 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.810
 twitter is also worth hey look 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.430
 address in this ip are live to 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.200
 the people of main com in case to the best 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.820
 we were something we take whatever or 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.290
 at least the pleasure of playing with people 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.760
 that is in the main com or at best 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.250
 even with moyano developers 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.920
 who knows not and then again micra 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.570
 seen nor way so assign me hunter and 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.160
 little more this is what we're going to see in 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.330
 today is not very striking all 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.820
 what we are going to see this is very clear 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.810
 but above all else increase 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.670
 rhythm from there we call attention 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.310
 we will have to see it I will make videos 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.250
 teaching everything by summarizing everything you do not go 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.420
 to lose nothing is worth so equally if 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.690
 you want to see it live you see it in 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.160
 direct later I will upload 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.350
 explaining soldiers details of what 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.600
 they will teach from maker of story mode and 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.670
 especially of what I see interesting 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.800
 all this because I dedicate myself today 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.590
 whole day to see her maicon I will be also 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.120
 tweeting on twitter I'll be also if 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.160
 I see that I can make some quick video 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.030
 of something very interesting that also what 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.740
 I will do 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.780
 and well, I will not lose anything and 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.760

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.890

 all the summaries of everything 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.200
 important that it comes out today 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.120
 in case one loses it and equally 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.400
 I invite you to see it because it will be very 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.170
 interesting is it worth it so nothing now yes 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.660
 One more thing that I want to tell you is 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.760
 that I started a couple of hours ago 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.230
