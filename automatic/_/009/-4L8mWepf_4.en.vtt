00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
a lot of people especially the raw

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.810 
a lot of people especially the raw
powerlifting<00:01:01.680> community<00:01:02.309> they<00:01:02.430> don't<00:01:02.640> do

powerlifting community they don't do

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.280 
powerlifting community they don't do
extensions<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.539> some<00:01:03.690> reason<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.080> think

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
extensions for some reason they think

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.630 
extensions for some reason they think
that<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.470> could<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.949> away<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.400> doing

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that they could just get away with doing

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.460 
that they could just get away with doing
flat<00:01:06.150> barbell<00:01:06.420> bench<00:01:06.750> press<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
flat barbell bench press you know and

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.649 
flat barbell bench press you know and
this<00:01:08.159> might<00:01:08.369> work<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:08.790> guys<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.540> know

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
this might work for some guys you know

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.630 
this might work for some guys you know
but<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> certainly<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> were

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
but I certainly think that if you were

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
but I certainly think that if you were
to<00:01:11.820> incorporate<00:01:12.030> extensions<00:01:12.720> you'd<00:01:12.900> benefit

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
to incorporate extensions you'd benefit

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.899 
to incorporate extensions you'd benefit
a<00:01:13.380> lot<00:01:13.590> you're<00:01:13.860> benching<00:01:14.189> strength<00:01:14.520> would<00:01:14.760> go

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
a lot you're benching strength would go

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600 
a lot you're benching strength would go
up<00:01:15.060> tremendously<00:01:15.180> now<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.830> Erik's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
variations okay and even that that I

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.730 
variations okay and even that that I
think<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> did<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> straight<00:01:34.470> skull

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
think if you did the straight skull

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.499 
think if you did the straight skull
Crusher's<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.790> maybe<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> elbows<00:01:36.420> out

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
Crusher's and maybe the elbows out

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.700 
Crusher's and maybe the elbows out
extensions<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.350> other<00:01:37.530> I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
extensions and all that other I

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.260 
extensions and all that other I
think<00:01:37.950> has<00:01:38.040> been<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.430> even<00:01:38.670> better<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.150> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
think has been to be even better and I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.520 
think has been to be even better and I
know<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.630> strong<00:01:39.869> statement<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.320> make

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
know that's a strong statement to make

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.899 
know that's a strong statement to make
but<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.040> believe<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.540> guys<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.020> mean<00:01:43.200> I

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
but I believe in that so guys I mean I

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.100 
but I believe in that so guys I mean I
recommend<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.299> extensions<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.869> don't

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
recommend that you do extensions I don't

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.899 
recommend that you do extensions I don't
think<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.740> smart<00:01:46.860> idea<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.610> omit

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
think that's a smart idea to just omit

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.490 
think that's a smart idea to just omit
them<00:01:48.060> from<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.299> program<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> you

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
them from your program like that you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.569 
them from your program like that you
know<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.740> replace<00:01:50.009> them<00:01:50.189> with<00:01:50.220> some<00:01:50.430> other

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
know and replace them with some other

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.520 
know and replace them with some other
 exercise<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.720> tricep<00:01:52.110> kickback

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
 exercise like a tricep kickback

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.830 
 exercise like a tricep kickback
or<00:01:52.560> something<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.850> more<00:01:54.210> tricep

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
or something like that or more tricep

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.389 
or something like that or more tricep
pushdowns<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.409> mean<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.280> these

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
