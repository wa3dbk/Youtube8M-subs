suggest<00:03:54.769> hitting<00:03:55.400> again<00:03:55.730> with<00:03:55.939> the<00:03:56.269> heat<00:03:56.840> gun

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
suggest hitting again with the heat gun

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.080 
suggest hitting again with the heat gun
or<00:03:57.170> hair<00:03:57.290> dryer<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:58.430> will<00:03:58.609> soften<00:03:58.849> up<00:03:59.060> that

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
or hair dryer this will soften up that

or hair dryer this will soften up that
heats<00:03:59.450> up<00:03:59.569> again<00:03:59.629> making<00:04:00.469> it<00:04:00.620> much<00:04:00.950> easier<00:04:01.189> to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
heats up again making it much easier to

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.670 
heats up again making it much easier to
separate<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.819> screens<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:03.290> as<00:04:03.349> you<00:04:03.439> can<00:04:03.500> see

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
separate the screens so as you can see

separate the screens so as you can see
we<00:04:03.769> almost<00:04:04.010> got<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.489> LCD<00:04:04.819> screen<00:04:04.879> fully<00:04:05.480> off

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
we almost got the LCD screen fully off

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.479 
we almost got the LCD screen fully off
the<00:04:05.870> touch<00:04:06.049> screen<00:04:06.349> here<00:04:06.530> we're<00:04:07.280> just<00:04:07.310> going

to<00:04:07.579> apply<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:08.090> little<00:04:08.329> bit<00:04:08.419> more<00:04:08.510> heat<00:04:08.870> in<00:04:08.959> this

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
to apply a little bit more heat in this

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:16.509 
to apply a little bit more heat in this
corner<00:04:09.349> here<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:14.829> now<00:04:15.829> we<00:04:15.889> should<00:04:16.190> be<00:04:16.310> able<00:04:16.370> to

plastic housing here and wood to do that

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.740 
plastic housing here and wood to do that
we're<00:05:05.970> just<00:05:06.000> going<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.240> use<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.390> heat<00:05:06.540> gun<00:05:06.690> or

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
we're just going to use a heat gun or

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.300 
we're just going to use a heat gun or
hair<00:05:06.900> dryer<00:05:07.020> again<00:05:07.410> and<00:05:07.620> just<00:05:07.980> warm<00:05:08.190> the

adhesive holding the touchscreen now to
this<00:05:10.350> front<00:05:10.620> housing<00:05:10.770> I'll<00:05:11.670> be<00:05:11.790> very<00:05:12.030> careful

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
this front housing I'll be very careful

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.360 
this front housing I'll be very careful
here<00:05:12.540> as<00:05:12.690> that<00:05:12.900> housing<00:05:13.440> is<00:05:13.560> very<00:05:13.650> thin

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
here as that housing is very thin

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.980 
here as that housing is very thin
plastic<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.390> don't<00:05:15.570> want<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.750> overheat

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
plastic so you don't want to overheat

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.540 
plastic so you don't want to overheat
because<00:05:16.200> you<00:05:16.500> have<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:16.620> chance<00:05:16.800> of<00:05:16.950> melting<00:05:17.400> it

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
because you have a chance of melting it

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.420 
because you have a chance of melting it
or<00:05:18.080> making<00:05:19.080> it<00:05:19.290> very<00:05:19.470> malleable<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.220> point

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
or making it very malleable to the point

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.790 
or making it very malleable to the point
where<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.640> can<00:05:20.730> break<00:05:21.350> just<00:05:22.350> want<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:22.650> use

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
where it can break just want to use

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.560 
where it can break just want to use
small<00:05:23.460> amounts<00:05:23.730> of<00:05:23.790> heat<00:05:24.000> and<00:05:24.390> continue

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
small amounts of heat and continue

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.370 
small amounts of heat and continue
reheating<00:05:25.320> as<00:05:25.470> necessary<00:05:27.020> now<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.080> toughest

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
reheating as necessary now the toughest

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.900 
reheating as necessary now the toughest
part<00:05:28.560> about<00:05:28.710> getting<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.370> touch<00:05:29.550> screen<00:05:29.760> away

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
part about getting the touch screen away

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.820 
part about getting the touch screen away
from<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.150> frame<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.630> just<00:05:30.900> an<00:05:31.260> initial<00:05:31.410> entry

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
from the frame is just an initial entry

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.770 
from the frame is just an initial entry
point<00:05:32.100> which<00:05:32.910> can<00:05:33.180> be<00:05:33.330> a<00:05:33.360> little<00:05:33.510> bit<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:33.720> a

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
point which can be a little bit of a

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.840 
point which can be a little bit of a
pain<00:05:33.960> so<00:05:34.170> you<00:05:34.410> just<00:05:34.560> going<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.740> need<00:05:34.890> to<00:05:34.920> find<00:05:35.730> a

pain so you just going to need to find a

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.640 
pain so you just going to need to find a
way<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.000> leverage<00:05:36.360> your<00:05:36.690> pry<00:05:37.080> tool<00:05:37.110> underneath

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
way to leverage your pry tool underneath

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.710 
way to leverage your pry tool underneath
that<00:05:38.490> adhesive<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.750> touch<00:05:39.930> screen

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.110 

there's<00:05:45.720> also<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:46.260> few<00:05:46.860> areas<00:05:47.100> on<00:05:47.460> this<00:05:47.670> bezel<00:05:47.910> a

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
there's also a few areas on this bezel a

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.970 
there's also a few areas on this bezel a
very<00:05:48.570> very<00:05:48.870> thin<00:05:49.140> and<00:05:49.380> you<00:05:49.530> want<00:05:49.680> to<00:05:49.740> make<00:05:49.830> sure

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
very very thin and you want to make sure

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.310 
very very thin and you want to make sure
you<00:05:50.160> take<00:05:50.370> special<00:05:50.670> care<00:05:50.820> when<00:05:51.320> releasing

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
you take special care when releasing

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.600 
you take special care when releasing
those<00:05:52.410> areas<00:05:52.770> before<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.310> crack<00:05:53.580> that

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
those areas before you crack that

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:02.150 
those areas before you crack that
housing<00:05:58.460> so<00:05:59.460> we<00:05:59.550> go<00:05:59.730> releasing<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:01.070> some<00:06:02.070> of

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
housing so we go releasing the some of

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.240 
housing so we go releasing the some of
that<00:06:02.250> adhesive<00:06:02.400> I<00:06:03.590> can't<00:06:04.590> fully<00:06:04.770> remove<00:06:05.130> the

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
that adhesive I can't fully remove the

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:12.040 
that adhesive I can't fully remove the
top<00:06:05.430> yet<00:06:05.700> but<00:06:06.030> it's<00:06:06.120> getting<00:06:06.360> there

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.200 

on<00:06:12.590> both<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.919> sizes<00:06:13.129> where's<00:06:13.669> a<00:06:13.729> lot<00:06:14.000> of<00:06:14.090> that

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
on both the sizes where's a lot of that

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.140 
on both the sizes where's a lot of that
thin<00:06:14.949> frame<00:06:15.949> so<00:06:16.280> just<00:06:16.400> be<00:06:16.699> very<00:06:16.910> cautious

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
thin frame so just be very cautious

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.110 
thin frame so just be very cautious
around<00:06:17.539> those<00:06:17.660> sides<00:06:18.400> like<00:06:19.400> I<00:06:19.430> said<00:06:19.669> we<00:06:19.879> heat

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
around those sides like I said we heat

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.589 
around those sides like I said we heat
more<00:06:20.810> often<00:06:21.259> in<00:06:21.409> this<00:06:21.530> location<00:06:21.860> because<00:06:22.599> you

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
more often in this location because you

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.570 
more often in this location because you
don't<00:06:23.810> want<00:06:23.930> to<00:06:23.990> overheat<00:06:24.229> that<00:06:24.500> bezel<00:06:24.919> so

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
don't want to overheat that bezel so

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.830 
don't want to overheat that bezel so
let's<00:06:25.699> take<00:06:25.819> your<00:06:25.909> time<00:06:26.120> when<00:06:26.270> doing<00:06:26.479> this<00:06:26.599> as

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
let's take your time when doing this as

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.999 
let's take your time when doing this as
you<00:06:26.960> can<00:06:27.050> see<00:06:27.169> just<00:06:27.289> makes<00:06:27.500> it<00:06:27.590> so<00:06:27.800> much<00:06:27.949> easier

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
you can see just makes it so much easier
