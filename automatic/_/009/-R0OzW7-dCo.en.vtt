that they're being dumped into a tank at

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.190 
that they're being dumped into a tank at
Petco<00:02:31.430> or<00:02:31.760> Pet<00:02:31.970> Smart<00:02:32.150> that's<00:02:32.960> on<00:02:33.170> a

Petco or Pet Smart that's on a
centralized<00:02:33.830> watering<00:02:34.370> system<00:02:34.820> that's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
centralized watering system that's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.360 
centralized watering system that's
sending<00:02:35.570> all<00:02:35.870> these<00:02:36.200> different<00:02:36.710> bacterias

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
sending all these different bacterias

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.720 
sending all these different bacterias
and<00:02:37.610> stuff<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.770> it's<00:02:39.890> exposing<00:02:40.340> them<00:02:40.580> to

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and stuff that and it's exposing them to

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.210 
and stuff that and it's exposing them to
this<00:02:40.850> fish<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.840> buy<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.110> fish<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.800> take<00:02:43.070> them

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
this fish you buy the fish you take them

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.310 
this fish you buy the fish you take them
home<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.730> expose<00:02:44.150> them<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.360> more<00:02:44.630> bacterias

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
home you expose them to more bacterias

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.490 
home you expose them to more bacterias
you<00:02:45.470> expose<00:02:45.890> them<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.880> know<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:48.320> more

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
you expose them to you know a to more

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.170 
you expose them to you know a to more
bacterias<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.220> are<00:02:49.520> inside<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:49.880> your<00:02:50.150> own

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
bacterias that are inside of your own

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.020 
bacterias that are inside of your own
tank<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.650> what<00:02:51.920> happens<00:02:52.340> shortly<00:02:52.730> after

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
tank and so what happens shortly after

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.960 
tank and so what happens shortly after
that<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.680> fish's<00:02:54.680> immune<00:02:55.100> system<00:02:55.610> starts

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
that is the fish's immune system starts

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.430 
that is the fish's immune system starts
to<00:02:56.150> take<00:02:56.960> a<00:02:56.990> dump

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
to take a dump

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.880 
to take a dump
and<00:02:57.950> once<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.460> immune<00:02:58.700> system<00:02:59.060> takes<00:02:59.330> dump

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
and once the immune system takes dump

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.690 
and once the immune system takes dump
normally<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.400> protozoa<00:03:02.090> bacteria<00:03:03.700> becomes

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
normally the protozoa bacteria becomes

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.900 
normally the protozoa bacteria becomes
flageolets<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:06.110> gets<00:03:06.410> into<00:03:06.740> the<00:03:06.860> gut<00:03:07.160> it's<00:03:07.730> a

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
flageolets it gets into the gut it's a

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.330 
flageolets it gets into the gut it's a
protozoa<00:03:08.450> bacteria<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:09.260> irritates<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:10.070> gut

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
protozoa bacteria that irritates the gut

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.940 
protozoa bacteria that irritates the gut
and<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:11.690> know<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.960> starts<00:03:12.290> poop<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.740> white

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
and you know it starts poop and white

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.970 
and you know it starts poop and white
I've<00:03:13.670> been<00:03:14.000> at<00:03:14.150> Petco<00:03:14.360> I've<00:03:14.690> seen<00:03:15.080> you<00:03:15.860> know

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
I've been at Petco I've seen you know

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.940 
I've been at Petco I've seen you know
the<00:03:16.570> flageolets<00:03:17.570> already<00:03:18.140> irritating<00:03:18.860> the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
the flageolets already irritating the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.449 
the flageolets already irritating the
gut<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.340> where<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.670> fish<00:03:19.910> were<00:03:19.940> were<00:03:21.459> pooping

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
gut to where the fish were were pooping

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.699 
gut to where the fish were were pooping
white<00:03:22.640> feces<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.900> basically<00:03:24.290> what<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:24.560> is

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
white feces and basically what that is

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.949 
white feces and basically what that is
that's<00:03:25.100> mucus<00:03:25.700> inside<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.390> gut<00:03:26.600> because

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
that's mucus inside of the gut because

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.710 
that's mucus inside of the gut because
the<00:03:27.080> guts<00:03:27.320> irritated<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.910> so<00:03:29.270> that's<00:03:29.510> the

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
the guts irritated and so that's the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.199 
the guts irritated and so that's the
cause<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.260> white<00:03:30.440> feces<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.160> fish<00:03:32.000> is

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
cause of the white feces that fish is

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.390 
cause of the white feces that fish is
doomed<00:03:32.480> shortly<00:03:33.320> thereafter<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.980> fish<00:03:34.220> is

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
doomed shortly thereafter that fish is

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.920 
doomed shortly thereafter that fish is
dead<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.239> I<00:03:36.250> bought<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.459> one<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.239> this

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
dead so I bought this one the this

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.390 
dead so I bought this one the this
little<00:03:39.230> girl<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.620> have<00:03:39.770> right<00:03:39.920> here<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.160> got

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
little girl that I have right here I got

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400 
little girl that I have right here I got
that<00:03:40.640> from<00:03:40.760> my<00:03:40.850> local<00:03:41.270> fish<00:03:41.480> store<00:03:41.510> who

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
that from my local fish store who

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.080 
that from my local fish store who
assured<00:03:42.800> me<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.010> he<00:03:43.310> picked<00:03:43.520> them<00:03:43.640> up<00:03:43.790> from<00:03:44.000> a

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
assured me that he picked them up from a

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.000 
assured me that he picked them up from a
local<00:03:44.420> breeder<00:03:44.570> that's<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.440> only<00:03:45.620> reason<00:03:45.890> why

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
local breeder that's the only reason why

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.580 
local breeder that's the only reason why
I<00:03:46.040> have<00:03:46.310> them<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:47.020> you<00:03:48.020> know<00:03:48.140> it's<00:03:48.320> just<00:03:48.440> like

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
the earlier video that I made on the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.500 
the earlier video that I made on the
biggest<00:03:51.770> mistake<00:03:52.190> in<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.459> discus<00:03:52.820> hobby<00:03:53.060> guys

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
biggest mistake in the discus hobby guys

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.390 
biggest mistake in the discus hobby guys
if<00:03:53.660> you<00:03:53.750> haven't<00:03:54.020> seen<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:54.320> one<00:03:54.350> go<00:03:55.160> check
