00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.370 
engineering more driver involvement so
me<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.369> Jason<00:01:56.729> thought<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.539> better<00:01:57.750> go<00:01:57.929> drive

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
me and Jason thought we better go drive

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.080

well<00:02:01.450> hopefully<00:02:01.650> especially<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:02.710> fun<00:02:03.070> to

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
well hopefully especially is fun to

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.279 
well hopefully especially is fun to
drivers<00:02:04.150> you<00:02:04.270> know<00:02:04.390> BMWs<00:02:05.260> up<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.130> Howdy's

rows first thing that Jason I

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.520 
rows first thing that Jason I
immediately<00:02:14.579> notice<00:02:15.120> was<00:02:15.299> this<00:02:15.530> CVT

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
immediately notice was this CVT

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.890 
immediately notice was this CVT
transmission<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.579> constant<00:02:18.269> varying<00:02:18.810> as

they call it so instead of you picking a

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.789 
they call it so instead of you picking a
gear<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> revs<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.689> up<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.959> down<00:02:22.139> it

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
gear and the revs going up and down it

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.160 
gear and the revs going up and down it
picks<00:02:23.189> a<00:02:23.340> rev<00:02:23.579> band<00:02:23.939> than<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.569> gearing<00:02:24.870> goes

up<00:02:25.439> and<00:02:25.650> down<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:27.090> get<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.299> very<00:02:27.510> strange

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
up and down you get this very strange

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.959 
up and down you get this very strange
feeling<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.859> there<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.400> engine<00:02:29.730> makes

feeling in there the engine makes

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.629 
feeling in there the engine makes
exactly<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.719> same<00:02:30.930> noise<00:02:31.230> all<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.069> way<00:02:32.219> from

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
exactly the same noise all the way from

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:37.569 
exactly the same noise all the way from
say<00:02:32.909> thirty<00:02:33.840> miles<00:02:34.139> can<00:02:35.180> always<00:02:36.180> wandering<00:02:36.569> 20

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.850 

two<00:05:07.400> ends<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.879> wheel<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.300> goodness<00:05:08.659> nao

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
two ends of the wheel the goodness nao

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.619 
two ends of the wheel the goodness nao
I<00:05:10.310> think<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.669> other<00:05:10.789> sort<00:05:11.120> my<00:05:11.240> driving<00:05:11.509> was

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:11.629 
I think the other sort my driving was

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:13.839 
I think the other sort my driving was
lukewarm<00:05:11.930> which<00:05:12.500> is<00:05:12.620> kind<00:05:12.860> of<00:05:12.949> what<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.400> was<00:05:13.610> I

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
lukewarm which is kind of what it was I

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:23.970 
lukewarm which is kind of what it was I
guess

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.060 

oh<00:05:24.420> we<00:05:25.420> have<00:05:25.570> a<00:05:25.600> saddle

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
oh we have a saddle

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.460 
oh we have a saddle
my<00:05:27.700> only<00:05:27.940> chance<00:05:28.300> of<00:05:28.570> victory<00:05:28.750> would<00:05:29.170> be<00:05:29.230> to

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
my only chance of victory would be to

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.240 
my only chance of victory would be to
block<00:05:29.770> him<00:05:29.980> in<00:05:30.100> one<00:05:30.310> of<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.550> bends

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
block him in one of the bends

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.960 
block him in one of the bends
it's<00:05:32.370> a<00:05:32.460> very<00:05:32.820> impressive

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.000 

Oh
