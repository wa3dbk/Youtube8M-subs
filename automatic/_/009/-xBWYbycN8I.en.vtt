00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
definitely not but but I felt this video

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.740 
definitely not but but I felt this video
you<00:00:40.950> know<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.190> video<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.730> longer<00:00:42.120> than<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you know this video was longer than the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.290 
you know this video was longer than the
of<00:00:43.200> course<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.620> three<00:00:43.829> minutes<00:00:44.160> TLC<00:00:44.820> tag-team

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
of course at three minutes TLC tag-team

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.200 
of course at three minutes TLC tag-team
matchup<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.770> also<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.070> wasn't<00:00:47.219> too<00:00:47.579> long<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
matchup but also it wasn't too long and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.290 
matchup but also it wasn't too long and
it<00:00:48.390> was<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> pretty<00:00:48.750> good<00:00:48.930> matchup<00:00:49.140> by<00:00:49.500> field

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
it was a pretty good matchup by field

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.490 
it was a pretty good matchup by field
and<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.360> thought<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.930> was<00:00:51.960> fitting

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and I thought this one was fitting

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.369 
and I thought this one was fitting
because<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.760> happened<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.180> Smackdown<00:00:54.809> on

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379

up what Randy Orton versus Sheamus and
CM<00:01:13.380> Punk<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.340> pretty<00:01:14.670> much<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.060> TV<00:01:15.420> they're<00:01:15.659> all

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080 
my partner is playing as Randy now I
don't<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.100> these<00:01:26.189> two<00:01:26.250> guys<00:01:26.460> were<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> same

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
don't think these two guys were the same

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.600 
don't think these two guys were the same
two<00:01:27.270> guys<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.479> were<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.500> previous<00:01:28.890> TLC

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
these are two different guys although I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.359 
these are two different guys although I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
might be wrong but I'm Bob are you sure
they're<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> same<00:01:36.150> guys<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:37.110> really

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
they're not the same guys I don't really

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
tornado taxi matchup the first way is

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.890 
tornado taxi matchup the first way is
you<00:03:22.830> just<00:03:22.860> focus<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.430> your<00:03:23.489> guy<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.209> your

partner focuses on the other guy and

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.750 
partner focuses on the other guy and
maybe<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.360> separate<00:03:27.810> yourself<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:29.640> know

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760

help them out and of course option

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.620 
help them out and of course option
number<00:04:10.590> three<00:04:11.040> would<00:04:11.220> be<00:04:11.430> just<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.330> makes<00:04:12.510> it

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
number three would be just that makes it

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.170 
number three would be just that makes it
both<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.110> I'd<00:04:13.260> say<00:04:13.470> probably<00:04:14.100> option<00:04:14.880> three

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
both and I'd say probably option three

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.320 
both and I'd say probably option three
or<00:04:15.919> if<00:04:16.919> it<00:04:17.310> was<00:04:17.459> an<00:04:17.609> option<00:04:17.730> three<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.239> I'm

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
or if it was an option three that I'm

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.300 
or if it was an option three that I'm
good<00:04:18.540> with<00:04:18.660> maybe<00:04:18.870> option<00:04:19.290> one<00:04:19.560> cuz<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.250> do

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
good with maybe option one cuz I do

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.550 
good with maybe option one cuz I do
concentrate<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.239> lot<00:04:21.450> on<00:04:21.630> one<00:04:21.900> person<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.410> didn't
