00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.440
 tine for the school and we start with 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.000
 the skin on and what I have to say because 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.760
 it is skin Golletz so much worse 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.290
 a video about my current skincare 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.190
 want to see a routine then write me 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.539
 in the comments 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.119
 In any case, I use right now 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.520
 I always like this cream very much 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.980
 happy to enter very quickly and is perfect 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.480
 for my skin will be second 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.160
 then concealer and there I have all the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.560
 have already bought several times and 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.450
 what is this here from the p2 a fortune 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.860
 not I like him very much what I 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.500
 Also very happy to the market is that 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.360
 who has such an orange and undertone and 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.190
 the laminated quite well he meant bluish 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.809
 a dark circles because that's how it is 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 I can also neutralize very much 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.989
 recommend if you have the same problem 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.820
 have your eyes ring and that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.530
 works wonderfully I give that too 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.719
 my eyes down because that too 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.940
 are pretty blue-eyed by mine 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.800
 whole blood corpse with it all 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.049
 We also devote ourselves to the whole day 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.149
 now the powder in the third step and 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.709
 so I fix the whole of 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.929
 recommends a step then it goes on 

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.490
 I take the eyeliner , too 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.319
 I can still reflect such a thing 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.149
 somehow better team and me 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.219
 while I was shooting this video 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.249
 noticed that all the straight away 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.929
 that was mega stupid but yes 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.889
 it was a bit complicated log 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.170
 draw the line 

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:29.630
 with an eyeliner as good as 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.759
 is empty but okay old care use 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.439
 i like this one from labello which i like 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.539
 really love that has me a subscribers 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.520
 and I'm currently using it 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.399
 every day because the super nice course 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.349
 but also gives off some color when 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.420
 browser i like to use mold 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.770
 opus the like so many do not I 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.139
 very much because I think that looks 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.299
 great, of course, at one 

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:52.999
 brand this is somehow why one 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.520
 Free highlighter with in it as quiet 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.529
 I'm currently using this from albert 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.509
 this is so reddish and leaves the 

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:02.060
 dare seem so wonderfully fresh 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.759
 I can only recommend you since then 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.229
 have is I use is really a day 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.489
 and with eyelashes I always have to 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.920
 First , because of my eyelashes 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.180
 really extremely extremely straight are there 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.820
 I always use some 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.440
 eyelash curler and the new sap is ok 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.350
 then shower around eyelashes 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.660
 currently this one is from maybelline 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.200
 i think i really really like her 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.000
 with pleasure 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.010
 and with me it is always important 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.470
 waterproof mascara to use because 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.150
 otherwise my mascara smeared if 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.770
 but the skirt with mascara too 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.900
 is expensive I can tell you also the 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.670
 in essens recommends itself at the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.100
 eyebrows I use such a 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.260
 eyebrows fall from patrice and there 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.120
 then always half the color find that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.950
 I also really great that I feel 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.680
 always like my eyebrows and the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.030
 color fits really wonderful very very 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.710
 great and now I have mine 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.840
 Eyebrows made my eyes mine 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.910
 still leave my lips and then cheer 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.800
 we would be with the make-up now too 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.530
 already finished and there it could be on the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.600
 dedicate hard and I always start with mine 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.190
 To analyze hair first so 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.230
 that means I look somehow 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.610
 finished how good they are if I am 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.810
 she can wear it open or if I prefer 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.090
 should wear 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.860
 and if i like the ones on this day 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.990
 then I would just have to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.610
 through with a wild boar boston 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.290
 brush or whatever they brush 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.350
 In any case, they are the one 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.700
 bit was already there and that's it 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.250
 I sometimes do it 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.350
 somehow dry shampoo or pure 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.970
 any flowers brother to the day 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.680
 I have however on all products 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.319
 waived for my hair because I 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.670
 Formerly the 8 when I'm everyday 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.620
 for the school make-up and I feel 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.970
 me as well both i find that 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.040
 me the straight hair and the 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.690
 middle parting is best and 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.130
 are the most natural and that 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.260
 is also the fastest for me 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.930
 achieve because my hair just already 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.180
 love so by itself so because I 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.650
 she also every day and what for me 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.840
 then on the street should see 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.550
 I want to be just like that then 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.530
 we finish with the hair and then 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.630
 we dedicate ourselves to the last part and that 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.550
 the outfit as it is super important that 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.530
 I feel good in my outfit and 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.300
 that it is comfortable and I carry it in 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.400
 moment as a winter coat always totally 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.290
 I like to have this free market here 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.600
 even from the daily wear always one 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.040

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.230
