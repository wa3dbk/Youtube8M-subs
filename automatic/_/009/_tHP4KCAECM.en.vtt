00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it goes live and I think they're settled

it goes live and I think they're settled
on<00:00:25.800> anything<00:00:25.920> yet<00:00:26.310> anyway<00:00:27.300> they're<00:00:27.869> coming

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
on anything yet anyway they're coming

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.429 
on anything yet anyway they're coming
out<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.410> new<00:00:28.470> console<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:30.390> know<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
out with a new console the you know the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.229 
out with a new console the you know the
smart<00:00:32.040> bet<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.090> available

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
smart bet I think is that it's available

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.020 
smart bet I think is that it's available
for<00:00:33.930> next<00:00:34.770> Christmas<00:00:35.309> which<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> say<00:00:35.850> not

steam box was going to be a spec that
Valve<00:03:43.890> created<00:03:44.520> and<00:03:44.700> then<00:03:45.270> people<00:03:45.690> like<00:03:45.870> Dell

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
actually you know cell manufacturing

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.630 
actually you know cell manufacturing
sell<00:03:51.570> now<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.320> looks<00:03:52.440> like<00:03:52.560> valve<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.160> actually

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
Microsoft make the hardware right they

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.550 
Microsoft make the hardware right they
don't<00:04:02.670> just<00:04:02.940> make<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.390> spec<00:04:03.780> they're<00:04:04.230> actually

you<00:04:04.739> know<00:04:04.830> involved<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.580> of<00:04:05.970> course<00:04:06.209> they

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
you know involved and of course they

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.790 
you know involved and of course they
outsource<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:07.050> they're<00:04:07.560> actually
