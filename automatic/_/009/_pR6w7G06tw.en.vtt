over<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> last<00:00:21.630> few<00:00:21.779> years<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.140> demo<00:00:22.350> has

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
over the last few years this demo has

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.320 
over the last few years this demo has
become<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.039> bit<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> favorite<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.150> it's

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
become a bit of a favorite and it's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.820 
become a bit of a favorite and it's
anyone<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.050> can't<00:00:25.260> help<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:25.529> love<00:00:25.650> as

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
anyone that I can't help but love as

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.670 
anyone that I can't help but love as
well<00:00:26.269> all<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> really<00:00:27.570> involves<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:28.289> some

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
well all it really involves is some

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.080 
well all it really involves is some
ethanol<00:00:29.660> which<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.689> dissolving<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.439> alcohol

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
ethanol which is dissolving and alcohol

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.950 
ethanol which is dissolving and alcohol
which<00:00:33.090> I've<00:00:33.210> got<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.899> see

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
which I've got here and as you can see

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.770 
which I've got here and as you can see
it<00:00:34.350> burns<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.010> nice<00:00:35.190> blueish<00:00:36.180> yellow

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
it burns with this nice blueish yellow

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.170 
it burns with this nice blueish yellow
flame<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.680> quite<00:00:37.890> gently<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.910> reason<00:00:39.090> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
flame but quite gently and the reason it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.369 
flame but quite gently and the reason it
burns<00:00:39.300> daily<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> actually<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
burns daily is if it actually has to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
burns daily is if it actually has to
turn<00:00:40.559> into<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> gas<00:00:41.700> before<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.239> burn<00:00:42.390> it's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
turn into a gas before it or burn it's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450 
turn into a gas before it or burn it's
not<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> liquid<00:00:42.960> that's<00:00:43.320> burning<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.340> can

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
not the liquid that's burning so it can

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
not the liquid that's burning so it can
only<00:00:44.550> burn<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:45.360> fast<00:00:45.750> as<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> liquid

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
only burn as fast as the liquid

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.540 
only burn as fast as the liquid
evaporates<00:00:48.770> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> case<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> bottle

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
evaporates in the case of the bottle

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.549 
evaporates in the case of the bottle
I've<00:00:51.059> swapped<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.510> ethanol<00:00:51.690> around<00:00:52.079> coating

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
I've swapped the ethanol around coating

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
I've swapped the ethanol around coating
all<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> inside<00:00:53.010> surfaces<00:00:53.520> allowing<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
all the inside surfaces allowing it to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.510 
all the inside surfaces allowing it to
evaporate<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.350> created<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.800> highly

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
evaporate and created this highly

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.119 
evaporate and created this highly
combustible<00:00:56.670> mixture<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.600> ethanol<00:00:58.410> vapor<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
combustible mixture of ethanol vapor and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.790 
combustible mixture of ethanol vapor and
air<00:00:59.579> which<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.940> ready<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.300> burn<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.530> ignite

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
air which is ready to burn if we ignite

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
air which is ready to burn if we ignite
it<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:01.980> slow<00:01:02.280> down<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> footage<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.449> see

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it and slow down the footage you can see

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.390 
it and slow down the footage you can see
that<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.930> first<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.559> burns<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.070> its<00:01:05.189> really

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that at first it burns with its really

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.730 
that at first it burns with its really
lovely<00:01:05.489> clean<00:01:05.939> blue<00:01:06.270> flames<00:01:06.689> which<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> sign

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
lovely clean blue flames which is a sign

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.130 
lovely clean blue flames which is a sign
of<00:01:07.770> what's<00:01:07.979> called<00:01:08.189> complete<00:01:08.640> combustion

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
of what's called complete combustion

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.570 
of what's called complete combustion
this<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.260> where<00:01:10.409> there's<00:01:10.560> abundant<00:01:11.040> oxygen<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
this is where there's abundant oxygen to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.399 
this is where there's abundant oxygen to
react<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> fuel<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
react with the fuel so you just get the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
react with the fuel so you just get the
classic<00:01:13.830> combustion<00:01:14.460> products<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.939> carbon

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
classic combustion products of carbon

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
classic combustion products of carbon
dioxide<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.780> water<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> reaction

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
dioxide and water as the reaction

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.070 
dioxide and water as the reaction
progresses<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.240> oxygen<00:01:18.600> starts<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> get

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
progresses the oxygen starts to get

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.649 
progresses the oxygen starts to get
consumed<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.430> well<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> carbon

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
consumed and so as well as the carbon

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
consumed and so as well as the carbon
dioxide<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.049> water<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.830> start<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> produce

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
dioxide and water we start to produce

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.550 
dioxide and water we start to produce
lots<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.880> tiny<00:01:24.119> carbon<00:01:24.450> particles<00:01:25.080> which<00:01:25.350> glow

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
lots of tiny carbon particles which glow

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.370 
lots of tiny carbon particles which glow
yellow<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.040> heat<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> flame

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
yellow with the heat of the flame

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.210 
yellow with the heat of the flame
there's<00:01:28.380> an<00:01:28.470> interesting<00:01:28.680> thing<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.040> you

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there's an interesting thing that you

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
there's an interesting thing that you
can<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> end<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> reaction<00:01:30.600> which

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
can see at the end of the reaction which

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
can see at the end of the reaction which
is<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.170> sort<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.470> yellow<00:01:31.799> billowing<00:01:32.400> flame

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
is this sort of yellow billowing flame

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.819 
is this sort of yellow billowing flame
and<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.600> probably<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.439> fresh

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
and that's probably because of fresh

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.380 
and that's probably because of fresh
oxygen<00:01:35.310> being<00:01:35.490> drawn<00:01:35.759> into<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> bottle

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
oxygen being drawn into the bottle

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.060 
oxygen being drawn into the bottle
through<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> nozzle<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.710> mixing

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
through the nozzle and kind of mixing

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.319 
through the nozzle and kind of mixing
around<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.549> what's<00:01:38.729> left<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> fuel

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
around with what's left of the fuel

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.520 
around with what's left of the fuel
inside<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> anyway<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.759> far<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.540> fun<00:01:42.810> but

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
inside so anyway so far so fun but

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
inside so anyway so far so fun but
besides<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> fact<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.310> looks<00:01:45.060> really

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
besides the fact that this looks really

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
besides the fact that this looks really
cool<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.710> interesting<00:01:46.829> about

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
cool what I think is interesting about

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.980 
cool what I think is interesting about
it<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.790> basically<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.630> rocket

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it is that it's basically just a rocket

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.800 
it is that it's basically just a rocket
a<00:01:49.140> rocket<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.220> device<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.670> burning<00:01:51.509> fuel

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
a rocket is a device for burning fuel

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.560 
a rocket is a device for burning fuel
and<00:01:52.100> creating<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> force<00:01:53.430> by<00:01:53.759> projecting<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and creating a force by projecting the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.480 
and creating a force by projecting the
combustion<00:01:54.869> products<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.710> back<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
combustion products on the back and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.880 
combustion products on the back and
that's<00:01:56.640> exactly<00:01:56.820> what's<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.890> so

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that's exactly what's going on here so

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.649 
that's exactly what's going on here so
if<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> generating<00:01:59.909> some<00:02:00.090> sort<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.390> force

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
if this is generating some sort of force

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.429 
if this is generating some sort of force
maybe<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> propel<00:02:02.399> something

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
maybe we can get it to propel something

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.109 
maybe we can get it to propel something
such<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.619> me

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.670 

hmm<00:02:09.180> that<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:09.869> underwhelming

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.660 

so<00:02:13.680> clearly<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.070> rocket<00:02:14.310> isn't<00:02:14.430> strong

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
so clearly the rocket isn't strong

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.070 
so clearly the rocket isn't strong
enough<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.330> much<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.600> an<00:02:15.660> effect<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:16.020> a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
enough to have much of an effect on a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.380 
enough to have much of an effect on a
mass<00:02:16.290> such<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:16.770> mine<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.790> let's<00:02:17.970> back<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.360> bit

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
mass such as mine so let's back up a bit

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.850 
mass such as mine so let's back up a bit
and<00:02:18.690> see<00:02:18.960> if<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.260> determine<00:02:19.530> how<00:02:19.800> much

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
and see if we can determine how much

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.890 
and see if we can determine how much
thrust<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.460> is<00:02:20.610> generating<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.300> we<00:02:21.630> can<00:02:21.750> do

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
thrust it is generating and we can do

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.170 
thrust it is generating and we can do
that<00:02:22.050> crudely<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.630> balance<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that crudely on a balance like this so

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.850 
that crudely on a balance like this so
that<00:02:27.300> looked<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.780> produced<00:02:28.140> around<00:02:28.320> 600

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that looked like it produced around 600

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.650 
that looked like it produced around 600
grams<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.190> thrust<00:02:29.430> that's<00:02:29.760> about<00:02:29.970> 6<00:02:30.300> Newton's

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
grams of thrust that's about 6 Newton's

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.050 
grams of thrust that's about 6 Newton's
which<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.200> not<00:02:31.350> bad<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.730> kind<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:32.940> see

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
which is not bad but you can kind of see

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.910 
which is not bad but you can kind of see
why<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.870> bottle<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> bit<00:02:34.380> out<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.530> its<00:02:34.740> depth

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
why the bottle is a bit out of its depth

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.040 
why the bottle is a bit out of its depth
in<00:02:35.070> trying<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.400> push<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.730> me<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.810> bottle

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
in trying to push on me but the bottle

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.870 
in trying to push on me but the bottle
on<00:02:37.140> its<00:02:37.260> own<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.830> around<00:02:38.070> 100<00:02:38.460> times<00:02:38.640> lighter

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
on its own is around 100 times lighter

00:02:38.880 --> 00:03:01.670 
on its own is around 100 times lighter
than<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.150> am<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.840> let's<00:02:40.020> see<00:02:40.110> how<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.380> gets<00:02:40.500> on

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.080 

you<00:03:02.680> can<00:03:02.830> really<00:03:03.069> see<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.459> acceleration<00:03:03.970> as

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
you can really see the acceleration as

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.420 
you can really see the acceleration as
the<00:03:04.180> fuel<00:03:04.390> burns<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:05.530> burning<00:03:05.830> gas<00:03:06.010> creates<00:03:06.340> a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
the fuel burns the burning gas creates a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.010 
the fuel burns the burning gas creates a
buildup<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.819> pressure<00:03:07.030> inside<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> bottle

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
buildup of pressure inside the bottle

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.170 
buildup of pressure inside the bottle
that<00:03:08.650> simultaneously<00:03:09.069> forces<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.880> exhaust

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
that simultaneously forces the exhaust

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.720 
that simultaneously forces the exhaust
out<00:03:10.330> back<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.019> propels<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.560> bottle<00:03:11.830> forward

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.830 

what<00:03:15.730> we're<00:03:15.849> seeing<00:03:16.030> here<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.630> really

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
what we're seeing here is a really

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.390 
what we're seeing here is a really
beautiful<00:03:17.050> demonstration<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:18.099> one<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.340> the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
beautiful demonstration of one of the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.949 
beautiful demonstration of one of the
most<00:03:18.519> fundamental<00:03:19.060> laws<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.360> physics<00:03:19.630> the

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
most fundamental laws in physics the

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.850 
most fundamental laws in physics the
conservation<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.680> momentum<00:03:22.739> where<00:03:23.739> one

conservation of momentum where one

conservation of momentum where one
objects<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.519> this<00:03:24.610> case<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.940> exhaust<00:03:25.209> gas

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
objects but in this case the exhaust gas

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.120 
objects but in this case the exhaust gas
moves<00:03:26.080> in<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.260> opposite<00:03:26.590> direction<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:27.040> the

other object the bottle balancing out

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.580 

we<00:03:36.700> can<00:03:36.790> also<00:03:36.940> try<00:03:37.150> some<00:03:37.209> more<00:03:37.450> fuels<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:38.410> is

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
we can also try some more fuels this is

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.410 
we can also try some more fuels this is
methanol<00:03:38.980> which<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.250> similar<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.580> ethanol<00:03:39.970> but

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
methanol which is similar to ethanol but

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.210 
methanol which is similar to ethanol but
has<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.569> smaller<00:03:40.870> molecule<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.769> seems<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.099> pack

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
has a smaller molecule it seems to pack

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.699 
has a smaller molecule it seems to pack
a<00:03:42.250> bit<00:03:42.430> more<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.670> puppet<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:50.590> is

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
a bit more of a puppet and this is

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.479 
a bit more of a puppet and this is
propanol<00:03:52.530> which<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.680> larger<00:03:53.980> molecule<00:03:54.160> with

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
propanol which is a larger molecule with

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.220 
propanol which is a larger molecule with
more<00:03:54.670> carbon<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.750> can<00:03:55.870> see<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.019> it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
more carbon in it you can see that it

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.449 
more carbon in it you can see that it
burns<00:03:56.410> with<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> lot<00:03:56.769> more<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.190> yellow

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
burns with a lot more of the yellow

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.920 
burns with a lot more of the yellow
flame<00:03:57.700> which<00:03:58.060> you'll<00:03:58.209> remember<00:03:58.420> was<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.690> sign

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
flame which you'll remember was a sign

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:12.050 
flame which you'll remember was a sign
of<00:03:59.049> unburned<00:03:59.440> carbon<00:03:59.650> particles

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.850 

now<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.209> all<00:04:13.330> looks<00:04:13.540> very<00:04:13.599> rudimentary<00:04:14.020> but

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
now this all looks very rudimentary but

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.379 
now this all looks very rudimentary but
