attach to a car that comes from
calculators<00:06:11.569> this<00:06:12.319> one<00:06:12.530> is<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:12.830> same<00:06:13.039> exact

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
calculators this one is the same exact

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.670 
calculators this one is the same exact
way

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
way

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.360 
way
right<00:06:15.680> here<00:06:16.180> this<00:06:17.180> pulls<00:06:17.509> out<00:06:17.750> and<00:06:18.280> there's<00:06:19.280> a

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
right here this pulls out and there's a

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.439 
right here this pulls out and there's a
magnet<00:06:19.819> on<00:06:19.909> it<00:06:19.970> and<00:06:20.270> it<00:06:20.360> moves<00:06:20.539> back<00:06:20.900> and<00:06:21.110> forth

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
magnet on it and it moves back and forth

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.510 
magnet on it and it moves back and forth
then<00:06:23.449> you<00:06:23.569> take<00:06:23.840> the<00:06:24.020> car<00:06:24.259> and<00:06:24.469> on<00:06:25.159> the<00:06:25.190> back

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.180 
then you take the car and on the back
has<00:06:26.210> magnetic<00:06:26.780> strips<00:06:27.169> that<00:06:27.319> go<00:06:27.469> across<00:06:27.590> this

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
has magnetic strips that go across this

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.209 
has magnetic strips that go across this
and<00:06:28.780> you<00:06:29.780> just<00:06:29.810> do<00:06:30.139> that<00:06:30.319> and<00:06:30.620> then<00:06:30.830> it's<00:06:30.979> able

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219 
and you just do that and then it's able

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:35.260 
and you just do that and then it's able
to<00:06:31.759> move<00:06:32.000> around<00:06:32.800> so<00:06:33.800> there<00:06:34.069> is<00:06:34.250> the<00:06:34.580> final

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
to move around so there is the final

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.779 
to move around so there is the final
