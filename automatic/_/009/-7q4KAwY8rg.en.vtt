00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.779
 good so here I am doing you a little 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:11.509
 video of a derby in 70 seconds these 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:19.140
 so fights to on euro 3 engine base 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:25.490
 here is the said with these I have a carburetor 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:28.410
 24 mo soap WGA that have one world 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.060
 I adapted a wood bellow 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.630
 finally blow ouattara under the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.730
 forks that I connected to my box r that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.930
 is not clear but I reread 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.140
 a mambo earth of origin that I have 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.140
 prepare 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.280
 what else is there the same I could 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.450
 will show you my 8.5 casing to both 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.860
 I know but it's because I had 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.899
 no euros 3 clean so that's but 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.899
 behind that a premium mvt ignition 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:09.600
 then small pot metrakit price two 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:13.439
 lanes la roja and it works pretty well 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.240
 with me there I am not very very good 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.060
 settled so it works but it does not work 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.689
 like how should we go we're going 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.979
 say before when I was in admissions 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.130
 book it worked a lot a lot 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.250
 better not much better but 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.060
 it worked a lot better anyway 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.060
 here I am just going to see that it gives 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.430
 because the bike is hot and 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.430
 made 28 years that you do not focus like that 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.430
 3 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.200
 but see that because it's good in this 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.200
 fight 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.750
 think first earth is not at the top the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.050
 setting and must be at the top too and 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.050
