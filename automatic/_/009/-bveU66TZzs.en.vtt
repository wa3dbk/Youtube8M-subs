 [Music] 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.769
 hi welcome to a new video from 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.570
 nice recipes.nl 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.610
 and this video i'm going to show you how 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.389
 very easy and fresh tomato sauce itself 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.939
 makes 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.710
 is ideal for this sauce in the pasta k 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.749
 to make with cream 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.749
 I so first skinning moment 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.369
 start by making a cross 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.100
 behind and tomatoes 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.960
 then i'm going to immerse them in with 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.790
 not boiling hot water and afterwards 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.080
 rinse under the cold tap 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.080
 then release the sheet like this 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.100
 as you can see, the sheet leaves whole 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.810
 Easily loose then we go tomatoes 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.810
 for a moment in my little cups no 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.299
 when the tomato is cut into pieces 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.439
 we continue to fry the onion 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.090
 and garlic 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:31.500
 I have a little bit for this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 olive oil and then add the onion and the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.700
 garlic and toe 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.490
 I used 2 shallots then I would 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:47.520
 fine with this fruit we just two years 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.560
 three minutes on this sauce is whole 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.750
 a lot of variation is possible , for example 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.149
 some bacon to bake or a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.479
 red pepper with spicy taste but me 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.970
 leave the basic variance today 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.970
 we continue with some tomato puree 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:17.099
 the suits we briefly note 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.950
 and then the tomato cubes also go 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.950
 or he 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.080
 then we add some dried oregano 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.470
 and a dash of broth 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.030
 how to live well together and then let 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.950
 we put the sauce for about 20 to 25 minutes 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.470
 simmer gently 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.090
 then you will see the tomatoes 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.660
 be fine and that it is more a smooth one 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.660
 sauce becomes 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.830
 Well see about 25 minutes 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.160
 tomato sauce looks like this I already have 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.260
 added some extra broth for weeks 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.520
 do you want the sauce to be less coarse 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.830
 then have fine 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.510
 allow to cook for an extra long time or you can 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.630
 let cool a little and then completely fine 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.470
 grind in the blender last we go 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.790
 add some basil leaves and 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.790
 then your sauce is ready 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.959
 and so you make yourself very easily 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.250
 own fresh tomato sauce 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.860

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.660
 free spaghetti with meatballs 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.819
 An extra tip is to make a very large one 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.830
 quantity of these and to make 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.080
 you always let the freezer freeze 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.760
