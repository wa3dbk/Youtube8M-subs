00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
very different from how I look in in

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.820 
very different from how I look in in
normal<00:01:05.189> life<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.590> he

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
normal life I know that you know he

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.170 
normal life I know that you know he
wanted<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.460> create<00:01:08.640> something<00:01:09.030> very

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
wanted to create something very

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.789 
wanted to create something very
different<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:10.080> he's<00:01:10.229> done<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.680> it

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
different and I think he's done that it

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
different and I think he's done that it
has<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.549> has<00:01:11.729> more<00:01:11.939> humor<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.600> it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
has a it has more humor and it's it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.770 
has a it has more humor and it's it's
lighter<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:14.100> its<00:01:14.340> um<00:01:14.700> its<00:01:15.060> approach<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.750> think

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
lighter in its um its approach I think

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.399 
lighter in its um its approach I think
it's<00:01:16.229> more<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> comic<00:01:17.070> book<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.729> really

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
it's more like a comic book not really

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that I'd love to do another movie there

that I'd love to do another movie there
I<00:01:54.930> haven't<00:01:55.350> been<00:01:55.530> offered<00:01:55.950> anything<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
I haven't been offered anything and the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.179 
I haven't been offered anything and the
film<00:01:57.689> industry<00:01:58.049> there<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.259> thriving<00:01:58.979> at<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
film industry there is thriving at the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.219 
film industry there is thriving at the
moment<00:01:59.659> there's<00:02:00.659> something<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> I'm

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
moment there's something that I'm

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.950 
moment there's something that I'm
developing<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:03.270> probably<00:02:03.540> wouldn't<00:02:03.840> be

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
developing but that probably wouldn't be

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.010 
developing but that probably wouldn't be
until<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> end<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.530> next<00:02:04.710> year<00:02:04.890> um<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:06.020> think

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
until the end of next year um I think

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.580 
until the end of next year um I think
you<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.190> work<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:09.000> things<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.360> mean

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
you have to work on things I mean

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
you have to work on things I mean
obviously<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.220> keep<00:02:11.310> your<00:02:11.430> ear<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
obviously you have to keep your ear to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.760 
obviously you have to keep your ear to
the<00:02:11.819> ground<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.390> don't<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the ground I don't have the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.560 
the ground I don't have the
time<00:02:13.980> at<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> moment<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:14.880> anything<00:02:15.390> like<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
time at the moment to do anything like a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.460 
time at the moment to do anything like a
production<00:02:16.320> company<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.840> certainly<00:02:19.290> you

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
production company but certainly you

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.890 
production company but certainly you
have<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.980> take<00:02:20.190> some<00:02:20.700> stuff<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.360> develop

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
have to take some stuff and and develop

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.670 
have to take some stuff and and develop
it<00:02:22.020> yourself<00:02:22.400> but<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:24.540> at<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> my<00:02:24.870> think<00:02:25.470> now

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
it yourself but but at the my think now

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.150 
it yourself but but at the my think now
because<00:02:26.220> there's<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.520> many<00:02:26.610> strong<00:02:26.940> women<00:02:27.000> in

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
because there's so many strong women in

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.010 
because there's so many strong women in
Hollywood<00:02:29.160> who<00:02:29.340> are<00:02:29.490> really<00:02:30.090> wanting<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.870> make

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
Hollywood who are really wanting to make

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.830 
Hollywood who are really wanting to make
that<00:02:31.230> change<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:33.300> that's<00:02:33.480> what's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that change that that that's what's

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.660 
that change that that that's what's
occurring<00:02:34.230> there<00:02:34.680> seems<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.160> more<00:02:35.370> roles

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
occurring there seems to be more roles

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.950 
occurring there seems to be more roles
available<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.420> think<00:02:36.870> they're<00:02:37.200> both<00:02:38.960> brilliant

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
available I think they're both brilliant

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.070 
available I think they're both brilliant
in<00:02:40.170> their<00:02:40.320> own<00:02:40.530> way<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:42.390> mean<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> really

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
in their own way and I mean you really

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.750 
in their own way and I mean you really
have<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.650> see<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> movie<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.490> because

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
have to see the movie for that because

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.030 
have to see the movie for that because
it's<00:02:45.120> hard<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.600> describe<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.380> words<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
it's hard to describe it in words the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.820 
it's hard to describe it in words the
way<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.310> movie<00:02:47.580> looks

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.920
