an<00:01:13.690> awful<00:01:14.229> lot<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.649> I<00:01:15.399> really<00:01:15.430> don't<00:01:15.880> have<00:01:16.030> a

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
an awful lot and I really don't have a

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.960 
an awful lot and I really don't have a
better<00:01:16.660> answer<00:01:16.810> for<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:17.710> in<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.520> past<00:01:18.670> I

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
better answer for you in the past I

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.609 
better answer for you in the past I
thought<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.360> might<00:01:19.390> be<00:01:19.690> some<00:01:19.930> kind<00:01:20.229> of<00:01:20.320> species

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
thought it might be some kind of species

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.999 
thought it might be some kind of species
of<00:01:21.160> birch<00:01:21.460> or<00:01:21.820> something<00:01:22.509> but<00:01:23.440> I<00:01:23.470> really<00:01:23.830> don't

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
of birch or something but I really don't

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.279 
of birch or something but I really don't
have<00:01:24.220> any<00:01:24.399> idea<00:01:24.910> it<00:01:25.180> was<00:01:25.210> just<00:01:25.570> off<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:26.020> case

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
have any idea it was just off the case

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.560 
have any idea it was just off the case
that<00:01:26.680> when<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.160> local<00:01:27.369> church<00:01:27.789> was<00:01:28.149> chopping

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
that when a local church was chopping

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.870 
that when a local church was chopping
down<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.780> bunch<00:01:29.050> of<00:01:29.200> trees<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.830> went<00:01:30.369> and<00:01:30.580> headed

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
down a bunch of trees I went and headed

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.820 
down a bunch of trees I went and headed
over<00:01:31.000> there<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.660> just<00:01:31.960> grabbed<00:01:32.440> what<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.710> could

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
over there and just grabbed what I could

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.999 
over there and just grabbed what I could
and<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:34.119> really<00:01:34.420> don't<00:01:34.660> know<00:01:34.720> what<00:01:35.080> species<00:01:35.500> it

quite<00:03:46.170> easy<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.980> make<00:03:47.549> they<00:03:47.760> didn't<00:03:48.090> take<00:03:48.269> all

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
quite easy to make they didn't take all

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.960 
quite easy to make they didn't take all
that<00:03:48.810> long<00:03:48.870> either<00:03:49.519> admittedly<00:03:50.519> there<00:03:50.760> not

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
that long either admittedly there not

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.939 
that long either admittedly there not
entirely<00:03:51.359> would<00:03:51.720> phone<00:03:51.959> cases<00:03:52.349> i<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:52.709> take<00:03:52.889> a

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
to the back but i thought that would be

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.520 
to the back but i thought that would be
a<00:03:57.000> protracted<00:03:57.660> project<00:03:58.169> which<00:03:58.319> is

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
a protracted project which is

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.720 
a protracted project which is
approachable<00:03:59.040> for<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.940> lot<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.690> people<00:04:01.049> so

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
approachable for a lot of people so

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.099 
approachable for a lot of people so

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
hopefully you'll take the time to watch

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.500 
hopefully you'll take the time to watch
that<00:04:04.440> when<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.769> goes<00:04:04.949> live<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:06.030> few<00:04:06.329> weeks

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
that when it goes live in a few weeks

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.259

although<00:05:29.710> I'm<00:05:30.670> sure<00:05:30.730> we<00:05:31.090> would<00:05:31.180> get<00:05:31.390> in<00:05:31.540> a<00:05:31.600> bit

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
although I'm sure we would get in a bit

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.170 
although I'm sure we would get in a bit
trouble<00:05:32.080> for<00:05:32.200> that<00:05:32.320> so<00:05:33.040> head<00:05:33.340> into<00:05:33.730> the

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
trouble for that so head into the

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.910 
trouble for that so head into the
