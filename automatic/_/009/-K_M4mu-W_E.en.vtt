00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.840
 and clear 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.930
 high of equal welcome to a video of 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.860
 plants vs zombies madryn grand fed no 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.300
 eat garden world first and the game does not 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.730
 I have bought it for the first time 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.830
 very cheap in origin it cost me like 20 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.180
 dollars is ridiculously cheap for 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.660
 those who want to buy are super 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.699
 discount and the game is fun what 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.960
 buy what I buy for pc but what game 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.840
 with a command like you already know that 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.460
 always and this game is special to 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.710
 everyone should someday make some video 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.970
 about playing with command versus keyboard and 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.070
 mouse because all the people criticize me 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.230
 but in the end I have my 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.280
 very strict thinking about this but 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.620
 it does not matter because we're going to talk 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.149
 exactly the game that came out does 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.120
 a lot of time on xbox and it came out a long time ago 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.890
 time on other platforms the truth is not 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.570
 I know if playstation because I had not put 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.059
 a lot of attention to the game but right now 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.020
 I saw it so cheap in steam I said at the time 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.520
 to buy and I'll do a test 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.320
 see how 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.680
 and in the middle of the world that I project 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.610
 I apologize for the videos that I have not done 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.840
 the business ones are missing, I think that 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.080
 start from tomorrow if God 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.150
 wants 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.530
 also correspondence Monday and everything 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.520
 the rest that traveled it voted but it 's 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.960
 that the problem is that the world cup has 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.400
 been very exciting and costa rica has 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.100
 played very well and even chewing a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.960
 little bit without a voice - I had not felt before 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.720
 but my throat hurts a little 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.980
 to celebrate so much in my country but 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.950
 I'm also going to make some video of 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.870
 that's because it's special but we're good 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
 to talk about the game because it 's absolute 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.830
 and funny mind funny plants vs 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.440
 zombies and you remember in a game 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.270
 of how it's called iphone and ipad that 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.479
 it was a game really only of the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.450
 crazy little platforms is called 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.920
 of mobiles and I could not play a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.420
 little game that was pretty fun in 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.190
 which there was a guy that had to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.840
 defend your machines to cut the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.090
 grass 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.830
 of the attacking zombies and to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.470
 doing it had different plants that 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.700
 they planted in the garden to be able 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.869
 defend the zombies that was what 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.070
 it was the game and the truth is that I play 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.690
 had made it very fun and it was also 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.430
 free I think I did not have electronic arts 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.840
 so it was very good, including me 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.600
 I had uploaded a video about that one or 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.650
 two videos about that I am I had iphone 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.000
 and the truth is that it had been very 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.979
 fun I had fun riding in 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.489
 game now it turns out that they did the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.489
 gang 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.370
 as any being that I have known 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.130
 It seems a lot with the idea of ​​team 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.740
 fortress seems to me in which one plays 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.140
 from third person and in each of 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.000
 the shots do very little damage and the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.440
 enemies and one comes out with a lot of power 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.480
 some come out with even more than 100 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.300
 of life and tells you and left on 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.030
 that little heart and it makes killing the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.980
 enemies requires many years 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.140
 lots of bullets for example here in the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.990
 zombie machine gun I do not know what it's called 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.670
 this tour turns treacherous 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.580
 the shrapnel of now that they are weapons 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.410
 specials and one sees that one shoots and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.290
 It does very little damage just 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.300
 as 67% of years need to shoot a 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.670
 a million times there is the cactus is like the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.700
 slider of the zombies I say of the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.380
 plants and can be zombie or plant and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.000
 each of the rounds you change to 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.160
 next team or the team is different 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.290
 if it was zombie before, it will now be a plant 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.239
 and vice versa I suppose you have already 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.280
 seen the videos and have not seen them 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.440
 because he understands what the game is like but 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.940
 I do not know I played a couple of hours yesterday and 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.500
 He has really played very little and I 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.360
 that as the printing currency that the 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.330
 Plants are better than zombies 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.650
 carlos and I feel when I go when I use 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.180
 the plants did me better take out 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.310
 they always had better games with the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.680
 plants that with men but in 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.720
 different things the sunflowers and the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.840
 different bugs do different 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.260
 damage for example I have been using the 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.569
 launches as it is called this the good then 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.080
 What is the name of this little bug? 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.090
 he is not the one to be called to be called 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.620
 he dedicates it expressing the vanilla rambo 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.030
 that shoots like one has a weapon with a 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.250
 little different and the other normal 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.720
 they shoot some stronger ones as they can 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.519
 see there and some others fire some 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.170
 things like green paint that is 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.090
 you can do a lot of updates of the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.980
 weapons that change a lot the way 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.780
 play and if they do not shoot you for X 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.030
 amount of time your health starts to 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.800
 regenerate then you have weapons 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.180
 specials that go unlocking and 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.040
 you have to be like movements 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.600
 specials and the truth is that a shooter 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.560
 as I had never played the being in my 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.160
 lifetime 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.389
 fun I can not deny it good this 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.799
 It's one of the things he's saying 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.389
 the machine gun is what makes you 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.000
 in a turret because you can not move 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.100
 from there unless you come back to 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.360
 press the button that takes you out of the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.680
 turret but then they lose the 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.560
 ability until it recharges 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.760
 and so each of the different 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.290
 bugs has different things 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.880
 this is the mad scientist of the 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.400
 zombies and the scientist what has the 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.220
 ability to put like hydrants in 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.010
 the floor that causes health to be charged 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.419
 of others is like the doctor of 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.520
 the zombies but it's not as effective as 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.560
 the sunflower that is the doctor of the 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.600
 the little plants can also throw some 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.250
 mines that are I do not know how the bombs that 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.380
 They are actually not as mines 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.689
 they explode but until some zombies in 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.389
 some wall plants on him 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.500
 other zombies have those helmets like 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.449
 I had taught them at the beginning they are 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.129
 engineer has like a like a drone 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.530
 like a helmet that you can use to throw 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.659
 for to fly and nonsense from heaven and 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.759
 the plants these of the cactus have 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.050
 like an onion a garlic that also 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.020
 can do the same thing as it is like a mini 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.210
 helicopter that can go up and see these 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.270
 are the weapons improvements these zombies 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.039
 that is shooting me those thorns that 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.330
 they have fire and that while when I 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.129
 they hit me starts to burn then I 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.479
 start doing more damage and the thing is 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.219
 that the game is fun has a 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.479
 lots of mini trap doors like this from the 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:36.830
 fire cactus and one when the rookie 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.449
 It seems to me that until you have 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.909
 unlocked the new generations of 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.699
 weapons and the two types of bugs you can 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:46.430
 play this kind of game modes 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.810
 like the gnome and the games 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.250
 objectives is a little more complicated 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.199
 because enemies as a whole are already 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.150
 coming out with a lot of improvements 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.349
 weapons a lot of things and then not 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.000
 it makes it more complicated is 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.430
 definitely in my favorite plant 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.009
 has a different strategy than 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.020
 play you have to grab you do not have 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.150
 Real attacks that can kill anyone 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.030
 long distance 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.830
 that abode which makes the zombie 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.570
 it was a little bit slower and you got it 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.670
 what to eat or get from behind are done 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.350
 like a murder that is like eating it 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.270
 from behind with your tongue and you swallow it 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.100
 or you can do what you are about to do 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.010
 this guy who is getting under 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:26.360
 the earth arrive sneakily and matías 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:28.580
 and it 's very good 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.430
 this is the one of the gnomes and when it ends 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.260
 you can see when the dome explodes look 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.700
 It's very funny, good guys, you know 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.200
 If you liked the video where they are equivalent to 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.880
 like where you want and there 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.870
 I'll put more videos of plants of their 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.870
 friends practically
