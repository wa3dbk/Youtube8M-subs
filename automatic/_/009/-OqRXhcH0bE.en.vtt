00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.030
 yeah everybody this christ 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.660
 today we find ourselves in Libouli 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.880
 news about and well of the new dlc that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.520
 should appear ben I hope 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.240
 soon on the game gta 5 dlc 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 robbery with rumors that launches 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 it is not more particularly for 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.470
 actually talk to you about the date 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.230
 of exit since she should I think 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.490
 go out earlier at the end of the year finally the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.960
 release of a new generation of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.600
 console there are many who grumble there 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.600
 above I know no via the dlc robberies 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
 had to go out early in the year 2014 is going 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.920
 finally it was pushed and then we 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.370
 think all that necessarily will join 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.020
 a little this famous exit of gta 5 on 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 the imagination of consoles so basically 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.230
 the playstation 4 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.079
 the pc platform also it does not take 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.750
 denigrate and also the platform of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 microsoft so the xbox one here with a 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.010
 website that you already have a good one 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.960
 little by hamas tarn executives who has everything 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.280
 we're just going to say give some 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.250
 training its limits in fact finally 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.159
 if I put the link in fact of the page 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 web that really relates to the subject in 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.920
 the description and so it's true that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.799
 it's quite special since here ben 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.100
 does the press finally anyway this site 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.930
 internet limit confirms that we will say 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.660
 the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.860
 this famous dlc robbery will be available 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.570
 that on the new generations of 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.460
 consoles it's clear it will be available 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.870
 than on playstation 4 the xbox one and the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.730
 platform pc it will be a kind 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.680
 exclusivity and that's why we 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.360
 is stupidly waiting for nothing because 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.450
 it will not be available on 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.620
 older generations of consoles 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.729
 excuse me and I do not know what you 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.770
 do you think about it but I am 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.590
 completely aberrant and I do not think of 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.880
 everything is going to be done but we can 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.470
 take into consideration if it's true 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.670
 that it is a possibility 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.030
 commercially it will not be a good 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.160
 thing 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.479
 finally both here because maybe 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.250
 that he sells you we will say a little more 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.810
 of play because somewhere 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.340
 here are the people they are going to be so very 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.350
 interested in this steering system 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.850
 all this but at the same time I find it 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.680
 pretty bad for example if rockstar 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.450
 fresh this stuff is for that 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.540
 besides that this video will be sent to 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.610
 rockstar telling them that not really 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.470
 not to do dlc that over a generation 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.090
 of consoles the same if it's that about 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.440
 the older generation of consoles we have 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.900
 seen also on the new generation of 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.180
 consoles or the reverse is not wants 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.750
 kind of exclusivity from sony or from 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.250
 stuff like that 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.980
 why not what we will say most 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.049
 of the audience who adhere to this series 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.700
 there risk of bitching risk of not 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.180
 appreciate we'll say this new 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.040
 method 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.739
 in any case it remains my personal opinion 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.660
 but I find that I'd be here 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.100
 really something of enough seed 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.060
 to do that so 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.860
 after I do not know what you think 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.360
 you but in any case this site there if you 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.500
 read all this is good 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.530
 unfortunately he's in English but in 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.630
 anyway he imitates i he by train 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.010
 to incite though that eventually it will be 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.920
 available that his new generation of 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.020
 consoles and I really 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.099
 how you say it really can the 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.160
 take into consideration ie we 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.239
 can say well it's possible but he 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.069
 makes it more likely that he is not 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.319
 possible because rockstar do not have me 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.390
 these marketing steps 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.160
 and then it might not really 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.370
 beach take not greet the public 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.470
 knowing also that this dlc robbery is 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.480
 not a big revolution it will be fair 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.770
 the fact of a hobby what will it be 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.989
 for that people and then that can 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.060
 have fun in co-op mode with his friends 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.290
 but there is no more stuff so this 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.590
 would be really a pity somewhere 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.040
 as well 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.269
 if cool rockstar that kind of things me 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.640
 I find that I would find that 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.900
 completely aberrant and it can become 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.150
 also a big criticism towards 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.650
 rockstar but I do not think at all I 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.600
 think this site right here they wanted a 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.400
 little too much added and then dramatize a 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.959
 little things I think you in 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.610
 think you can tell me have some 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.890
 comments 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.660
 but now must I think we need 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.340
 still consider it and see 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.830
 near what it can do 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.769
 after that's what kind of thing of her these 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.569
 robberies will not have an optimization at 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.970
 level of screen quality at the level 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.769
 of modeling there will not be a big one 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.440
 big big novelty kwassa members 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.519
 were on the same graphical engine 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.859
 so maybe not his imagination of 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.720
 consoles or it will be different because 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.380
 rockstar put a development time 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.910
 a little longer but there will be no 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.190
 not a big change also to 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.420
 inside here that's there especially the people there 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.039
 to put myself a little I hurt them 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.359
 it's great fun was also held 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.709
 on my fishing and staff but 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.400
 especially I tell you next time 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.400
 church of peace high
