00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.000
 for goalkeepers the best technique that 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.709
 one can have to pay a penalty is 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.470
 endure to the end that many times 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.880
 it's the most complicated thing we earn the craving and 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.460
 sometimes we move a little bit before 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.140
 you try to find some reason that they give 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.060
 some intuition of where he is going to throw 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.060
 that sometimes you can see the stopped that 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.740
 has sometimes where the gaze directs 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.379
 note because sometimes many are 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.180
 nervous then seeks to do some 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.640
 point where weakness they have 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 rival to be able to attack and power this one 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.420
 To be victorious 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.070
 with pity, this should be thrown closing the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.790
 eyes and pray that nothing between reservation 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.680
 nothing simply I think it is a criminal 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.900
 it is difficult it is complicated first the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.330
 security without security nor do you think 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.000
 and well I think it's best to choose 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.350
 the side always think on one side already 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.730
 defined from before since you go 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.680
 to walk is that I defined where you are going to 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.800
 pull because if the minor to that is 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.350
 decide if failures come 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.660
 Alejandro has not only received his 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.550

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.800

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.870
 that then invite you to know my 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.230
 college 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.090
 In 2010, UNAM celebrated 100 years of 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.030
 existence is between 100 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.760
 most well-known universities in the world and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.010
 of her the three winners have left 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.010
 with the nobel prize of mexico 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.080

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.960
 students as you come we are going here right now 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.960
 to an exam and well let's hope everything 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.990
 get it right we have a little bit of fear but 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.869
 I am doing a diploma of 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.150
 titulaciÃ³n that is to be able already to be 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.150
 graduated in November we hope to finish 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.540
 ah 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.120
 there are 124 buildings right here where 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.080
 all my classes but good and what is 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.370
 The diploma is usually given to me in 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.530
 the audiences in the different 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.530
 audiences that are here nothing 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.870
 changes 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.170
 the unam is such a solid structure and 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.020
 such strong foundations for mexico 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.440
 that from there have arisen the men who 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.810
 they have set the tone for mexico 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.580
 work 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.130
 universities beyond that a team of 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.080
 football because sometimes if it is part of 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.569
 18 teams is very important in the world 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.940
 football and everything yes but one more is 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.470
 beyond the football team there 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.300
 many other races that we have 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.160
 had a chance to go big 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.319
 figures to the world and we are very 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.269
 proud all all what it represents 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.849
 the university as a house of studies what 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.220
 true is that it has as values 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.190
 transferred to football 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.530
 after his examination Alejandro joins the rest 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.210
 of your classmates for a workout 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.210
 on the track of the Olympic stadium 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.930
 ah 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.670
 when a new season begins 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.600
 we are thinking about the championship that is 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.600
 one of our illusions 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.560
 basically it 's a job of 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.480
 readaptation resistance work 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.280
 aerobic looking for improvements in 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.350
 sports performance every start of 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.650
 tournament is another possibility to be 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.650
 champion 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.310
 It works well and there is good vibes of everything 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.020
 that and because we sometimes difficult 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.830
 against this vibration of all of all the 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.900
 that cleans the court there is a philosophy 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.560
 very very very pretty that you do not see is not 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.560
 see many sides 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.460
 while his classmates train in 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.139
 the track how healthy he practices free throws 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.729
 on the court 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.800
 Well, I'm going to explain how 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.719
 charges a free spin whenever I go to 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.639
 charge a fault tried to locate the area 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.560
 where I want to hit the ball I put it 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.479
 where gives me the distance of the referee and 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.400
 then I put my support foot pointing 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.289
 where I want my shot to go 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.969
 in this case now I put it pointing to the 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.830
 bolt pole to see the goalkeeper is 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.389
 important to see the goalkeeper know if he is going 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.189
 to move if it's a goalie who holds on 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.870
 if he's very in the center he tried to 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.819
 hit your post normally if not 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.099
 well I would seek to pass over the 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.870
 barrier and that my ball goes up and down the 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.449
 I hit for a free kick not like in 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.520
 tennis the topspin when the ball passes the 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.650
 barrier has to go down I take my 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.930
 distance that are normally four 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.500
 steps I concentrate a lot on ridding the 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.430
 barrier 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.779
 I'm fine the ball but in my mind 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.659
 is at the height where I have to 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:54.849
 pass in a direct free kick well 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.900
 executed the ball carries a rotation 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.810
 ascending to release it 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.540
 defense once this the 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.910
 spherical drops suddenly changing 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.910
 the speed and the steering angle 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.700
 we are also our 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.700
 we have 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.030
 Thank you 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.220
 good 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.900
 the feeling is unmatched when it goes 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.510
 going up the tunnel you see in a stadium 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.380
 full 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.580
 ah 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.680
 a unique magic 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.270
 we are always 11 that we kill ourselves for the 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.070
 cougars shirt 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.610
 football is soccer and one is going to 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.169
 always enjoy 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.169
 but always with a fighting spirit
