00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.579 

and<00:00:00.570> I<00:00:00.750> thought<00:00:00.870> it<00:00:01.020> was<00:00:01.079> interesting<00:00:01.560> because

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
and I thought it was interesting because

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.849 
and I thought it was interesting because
right<00:00:02.040> at<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.220> very<00:00:02.429> beginning<00:00:02.580> it<00:00:03.240> was<00:00:03.419> like

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:03.859 
right at the very beginning it was like

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.200 
right at the very beginning it was like
we<00:00:04.859> thought<00:00:05.130> we<00:00:05.670> had<00:00:05.879> it<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:07.519> he<00:00:08.519> or<00:00:08.700> she<00:00:08.730> came

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
we thought we had it and he or she came

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.720 
we thought we had it and he or she came
right<00:00:09.450> up<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.960> then<00:00:10.139> stopped<00:00:10.440> right<00:00:13.400> it<00:00:14.400> was<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
right up and then stopped right it was I

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.640 
right up and then stopped right it was I
mean<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:15.179> exactly<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.289> know<00:00:16.379> that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
mean that was exactly you know that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.140 
mean that was exactly you know that
you'll<00:00:16.770> come<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.190> far<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.789> don't<00:00:17.970> want<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
you'll come so far but you don't want to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.929 
you'll come so far but you don't want to
go<00:00:18.240> all<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.480> way<00:00:19.400> and<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> same<00:00:20.670> type<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
go all the way and the same type of

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.650 
go all the way and the same type of
thing<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.390> know<00:00:21.510> she<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.619> well<00:00:22.859> no<00:00:23.130> it's

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
thing you know she was like well no it's

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.970 
thing you know she was like well no it's
some<00:00:24.660> assertiveness<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.470> all<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.830> just

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
some assertiveness we all can just

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.529 
some assertiveness we all can just
gather<00:00:26.519> around<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.119> thought<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.420> would

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
gather around I thought it would

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.750 
gather around I thought it would
probably<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.380> very<00:00:28.529> efficient<00:00:29.220> move<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
probably be a very efficient move and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.970 
probably be a very efficient move and
then<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:29.880> kind<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.480> mentioned<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
then we kind of mentioned that and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:55.580 
then we kind of mentioned that and
everyone<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.730> can't<00:00:32.969> bully<00:00:54.590> again

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
everyone was like we can't bully again

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.229 
everyone was like we can't bully again
if<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.890> were<00:00:56.039> working<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> over<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.090> do

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
if we were working with you over to do

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.939 
if we were working with you over to do
is<00:00:57.420> take<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.840> information<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.500> say<00:00:58.649> okay

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
is take that information and say okay

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.590 
is take that information and say okay
you're<00:00:59.100> wondering<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.300> would<00:01:00.449> be

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you're wondering if it would be

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.880 
you're wondering if it would be
different<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> tried<00:01:01.440> something<00:01:01.680> we

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
different if you tried something we

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.349 
different if you tried something we
would<00:01:02.039> send<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.520> back<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.820> explore

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
would send you right back to explore

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
would send you right back to explore
experience<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.290> I'll<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.769> talk<00:01:05.010> about<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
experience that I'll just talk about it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.640 
experience that I'll just talk about it
and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.299> probably<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.810> stronger

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and I think it's probably a stronger

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.990 
and I think it's probably a stronger
sense<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> accomplishment<00:01:08.250> though<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
sense of accomplishment though it to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.030 
sense of accomplishment though it to
have<00:01:09.150> them<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.659> their<00:01:09.750> own

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
have them do it on their own

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.790 
have them do it on their own
rather<00:01:10.190> than<00:01:10.430> push<00:01:10.820> them<00:01:10.850> in<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:12.560> again

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
rather than push them in and again

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.680 
rather than push them in and again
there's<00:01:13.580> such<00:01:13.760> rich<00:01:13.970> metaphor

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
there's such rich metaphor

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.510 
there's such rich metaphor
coming<00:01:14.960> up<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.290> again<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:16.130> is<00:01:16.280> only<00:01:16.400> a

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
coming up so again this is only a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.830 
coming up so again this is only a
demonstration<00:01:16.670> of<00:01:17.240> not<00:01:17.390> looking<00:01:17.510> for

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
demonstration of not looking for

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.210 
demonstration of not looking for
response<00:01:18.170> but<00:01:18.410> we<00:01:18.440> would<00:01:18.620> follow<00:01:18.800> up<00:01:18.980> and<00:01:19.070> say

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
response but we would follow up and say

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.950 
response but we would follow up and say
you<00:01:19.760> know<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:19.910> wonder<00:01:20.270> where<00:01:20.450> else<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:20.900> you

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
you know I wonder where else and you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.780 
you know I wonder where else and you
like<00:01:21.170> you've<00:01:21.380> experienced<00:01:22.010> only<00:01:22.280> coming<00:01:22.520> so

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
like you've experienced only coming so

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.290 
like you've experienced only coming so
far<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:24.650> what<00:01:24.830> you've<00:01:25.010> done<00:01:25.160> with<00:01:25.370> that<00:01:25.550> can

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
far and what you've done with that can

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.970 
far and what you've done with that can
even<00:01:26.570> say<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.020> my<00:01:27.170> hunch<00:01:27.410> is<00:01:27.500> everybody's

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
even say that my hunch is everybody's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.969 
even say that my hunch is everybody's
thinking<00:01:28.280> about<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.700> in<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.880> metaphor<00:01:29.979> so

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
thinking about that in the metaphor so

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.130 
thinking about that in the metaphor so
you<00:01:31.100> see<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.430> how<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.030> metaphor<00:01:32.630> works<00:01:32.840> in

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
you see that how the metaphor works in

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.570 
you see that how the metaphor works in
the<00:01:33.229> power

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:02:13.210 

I'm<00:02:11.410> kind<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.500> going<00:02:12.680> back<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.160> original

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
I'm kind of going back to the original

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.430 
I'm kind of going back to the original
statement<00:02:13.760> not<00:02:14.270> knowing<00:02:14.510> how<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.750> be<00:02:14.990> in

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
statement not knowing how to be in

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.870 
statement not knowing how to be in
relationships<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.340> we<00:02:16.459> would<00:02:16.580> have<00:02:16.730> you

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
relationships so we would have you

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.250 
relationships so we would have you
reflect<00:02:17.300> on<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.650> answer<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:21.020> you're

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
reflect on that answer and you're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.750 
reflect on that answer and you're
laughing<00:02:21.440> when<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:21.890> ask<00:02:22.190> what<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.550> heard

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
laughing when I ask what you heard

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.370 
laughing when I ask what you heard
because<00:02:23.120> think<00:02:23.510> about<00:02:23.570> what<00:02:23.840> you're<00:02:24.020> doing

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
because think about what you're doing

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.890 
because think about what you're doing
mm-hmm<00:02:25.100> again<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.640> again<00:02:25.910> you're<00:02:26.300> looking<00:02:26.480> to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
mm-hmm again and again you're looking to

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.199 
mm-hmm again and again you're looking to
us<00:02:27.050> as<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.410> treatment<00:02:27.650> team<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.880> give<00:02:29.060> you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
guidance versus trusting yourself what

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.800 
guidance versus trusting yourself what
did<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.280> hear<00:02:31.490> what<00:02:31.760> did<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:31.910> do<00:02:32.240> what<00:02:32.660> was

did you hear what did you do what was

earlier about you from your own

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.720 
earlier about you from your own
