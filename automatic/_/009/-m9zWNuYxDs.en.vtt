00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.279
 but not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.539
 let's fight already feel the heat 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.070
 intense 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:24.840
 which is a door to wait for you that 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.300
 light of your soul is a divine force what 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.300
 that all your being free 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.240
 so 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.130
 hello everyone today I'm going to make this video 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.070
 because I'm tired of seeing what 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.900
 cause the fanboys to some series all 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.910
 started a day that I decided to remember 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.970
 old times and I started to see digimon 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.070
 adventure 2 while waiting for it to load 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.770
 well I decided to read the comments and that 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.870
 was that I found comments assholes 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.170
 how this season is bullshit 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.960
 endure naruto I played 90 and others more 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.240
 assholes like that serial shit when 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.400
 I was a kid, but since I saw 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.580
 the naruto video I played the 90 change of 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.580
 opinion 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.940
 aa that these assholes can not think 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.370
 by themselves I do not have anything of 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.440
 bad with naruto hugh to 90 is more was a 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.970
 loquero but there were good things 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.610
 some videos he did that did not 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.520
 they liked top 10 the worst animes I've ever 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.130
 seen here I speak very badly of you hyo gx and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.979
 the worst without critical sense of bakugan 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.590
 here was not only bad but it was very 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.869
 contradictory and the last one is critical 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.240
 we said in which he threw crap out of 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.909
 digimon 2 but the worst is that many 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.250
 fanboys gave the truth the truth I 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.770
 I saw digimon adventure 2 several times and I 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.570
 loved the second part when it arrives 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.210
 something that neither money numbers is bad but 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.920
 I'll talk about that later before I'll say yes 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.350
 they're going to throw me shit, you better 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.940
 make sense not like what are you 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.070
 saying asshole 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.350
 Naruto played 90 is a god go to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.810
 fuck your grandma asshole fucking 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.780
 They know that I am open to all classes 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.000
 of comments but with logic 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.239
 Let's start, I'll help, since Naruto 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.400
 play 90 said bad things about me digimon 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.830
 adventure 2 is the sequel to that simón 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.020
 adventure located three years later 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.690
 from his first delivery a new enemy 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.460
 appeared this is the emperor of the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.400
 We said who wants to capture the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.620
 digimon with malignant eyes due to 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.910
 your diva and if the control needles do 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.360
 money the others can not say 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.250
 evolve by turning the useless but 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.870
 davis along with jolie and cody are 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.590
 chosen to face this new 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.040
 threat 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.870
 pique and cary also join this team 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.510
 that was the initial description of the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.520
 Digimon series 2 started very well on 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.760
 emperor of the digimon was fuck 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.350
 until that famous fight with ticket and x 's 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.420
 the reasons that the others are there 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.390
 they will not fight they were also justified 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.250
 due to the pinches needles those bad 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.860
 of the series arrives after beating the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.920
 emperor of the said to begin with 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.230
 with the negative I say this series has 50 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.810
 chapters and roughly 16 there are new 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.340
 I said evolutions something else that I do not 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.130
 liked it was that they put the vice 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.140
 normal evolutions I say if they had the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.360
 I asked what I had to say 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.030
 evolution is normal is the truth 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.100
 lost chapters to fart another thing that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.800
 I did not like it was the couples of the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.590
 the evolution I read cavities too 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.620
 because they are the only girls but because 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.540
 davis and ken because code and cody 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.400
 had problems with that in because of what 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.890
 of the emperor of we said so 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.260
 it would be a good combination besides that 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.600
 so they would not pay the ham with that teapot 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.550
 they called smoke out the other 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.950
 davis couple and ticket and not only 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.650
 because davis is jealous for the reasons 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.050
 already known but because ticket and has 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.320
 mass idea as a protagonist something like that 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.390
 like time and marcus and tomás besides 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.640
 it would be a good excuse to solve 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.100
 that rivalry indirectly caused by 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.050
 the brown- haired girl from the group the 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.150
 I really do not know how slight of bad Naruto 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.460
 yoga the music of this series because the 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.580
 truth is good old age and 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.880
 we evolved from n evolution even of 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.320
 opening all are very good music 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.480
 going to the dubbing of the series the 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.180
 dubbing is mostly very good but 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.790
 not perfect Cali's voice left a lot 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.400
 to wish was better than the simón a bear 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.190
 there is no doubt now I will say some things with 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.070
 yes I agree with naruto giga 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.660
 contradictions with the first season 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.840
 they are many and anyone would notice 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.790
 the return of myotis mont the truth 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.980
 miotti c'mon was always the enemy more 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.500
 He is the founder of all the series but not 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.770
 it made sense that the battle would return 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.050
 very fancy final now I will say what 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.790
 I do not agree with the music he 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.430
 He said it was bad but the truth is 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.920
 excellent also said that a is and the 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.410
 others the bastard and sharon nothing to see 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.870
 since they were children before, so it's 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.850
 normal that they change and mature not maybe 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.490
 the one that did have a very big change in the 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.290
 attitude was matt since in digimon one 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.300
 he acted like a lone wolf and in 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.220
 digimon 2 was more expressive without 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.800
 mention when davis's sister gets 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.510
 I brought him something else that I did not like about 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.970
 naruto giga was that ticket and was the 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.640
 conflictive group I say that series 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.650
 I was seeing pique and had fights but 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.260
 he did not start them point further what does he have 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.240
 as bad as you can and it would be worse 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.970
 that is a fearful child as in the 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.130
 first series in summary digimon 2 is 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.410
 a good series obviously the first 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.670
 season is better but it 's worth seeing 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.710
 this series 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.990
 and start thinking for yourself 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.330
 since naruto giga 90 is not more than 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.450
 you or I just a youtube user 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.180
 who says his opinion like I did today 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.400
 this is all thanks comment, tap and 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.350
 subscribe if and if they are going to do 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.240
 negative comment please make it 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.240
 with logic not with pure insults
