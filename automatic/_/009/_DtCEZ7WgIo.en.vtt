00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 you 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.219
 in today's tutorial we're going to 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.290
 show how to do the laps of 2002 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.000
 the first one is with a round clamp and 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.000
 without cantes here are two things 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.769
 with a comb back to the party you 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.009
 it is already fixed who is half or 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.750
 one side applies a straight thermos 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.759
 protector to protect hair from 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.920
 the high temperatures and also for 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.659
 help fix once the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.309
 waves in order to have a greater 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:42.110
 duration lets dry the protective thermos and 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.120
 to be real hair to then avoid 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.450
 pulls or knots when they are doing 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 clouds 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.860
 part of the hair in two sections and collects 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.170
 in the upper back with a 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.360
 pinch a little bit this is in order that 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.190
 Once the waves are ready, it is created 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.770
 the effect that there is more volume and more 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.780
 hair now let's start doing the 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.610
 waves you must first take the glove and 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.970
 put it in your hand on the side that you 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.400
 are you going to do the waves 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.350
 start to take thin millions 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.810
 approximately two or three centimeters 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.700
 wide because the more you stay wide 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.950
 more loose the wave but also more 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.110
 fast if everything is here depends on what 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.330
 you want to achieve once you have your hair 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 tangled in the clamp tightens it and collects 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.560
 before releasing it is in order to 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.440
 people you fall with the natural fall and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 the tourÃ© wave plus an important type 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.590
 that we like to tell when we are 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.870
 doing the waves is that if you want that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 you have a loose wave as you are 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.220
 we recommend rolling it up as if it were 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.410
 a kind of little worms separating a 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.850
 another stretch so you have a wave 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.850
 loose and much more natural 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.610
 keep it up with all the hair each of 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.680
 the millions just keep in mind 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.930
 that when you go to change sides you 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.440
 you must change the side of the glove and catch 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.140
 the clamp with the other hand 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.880
 once finished with both sides loose 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.510
 the upper section that you have tied 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.030
 on the top of the head 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.860
 once you finish with all the hair combs 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.860
 the strands and mix them with your fingers 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.640
 the last step and perhaps the most 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.160
 important to the whole process of 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.780
 waves is to apply a fixative lacquer to 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.030
 that the waves last much longer 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.070
 applied by all the hair made the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.240
 stress and you keep moving it so that 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.800
 it is natural this is the first method 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.330
 of waves and the preferred us 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.460
 We hope you like it and that you can 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.360
 to do at home as easy and simple as 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.360
 it is for us
