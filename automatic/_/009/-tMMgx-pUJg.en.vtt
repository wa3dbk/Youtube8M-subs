00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.089
 hello to you Artem and on the air 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
 transfer art position today according to your 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:22.140
 numerous requests and transfer to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.730
 map ensk we will consider positions 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.689
 only for standard combat 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.759
 let's go so the top card itself 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.589
 very small only 600 meters so 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.930
 stay on spawn 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.030
 any crazy estel lt can light 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.770
 you at the very beginning of the battle so immediately 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.630
 let's go take a position here with us 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.790
 several options the first option is 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.070
 drove square 4 from here it opens 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.140
 cross on green rice Prague also 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.660
 the beginning of the battle can be reduced to squares with 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.640
 co2 until 4 hope that will be lit 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.070
 enemy artillery or anyone 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.990
 take the hospital and still have one tricky 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.700
 backache, I think not everyone knows about him 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:04.649
 This chamber in one of the courtyards in 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:06.960
 squared g2 from the same side of the rep 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.909
 you can take square 1 from where we have 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.039
 prokidyvaet again a potion but not all 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.499
 only the upper part and partially st 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.210
 hangars and the first line for which of course 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:21.479
 first of all it is worth borrowing 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.100
 position also we can go and in 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.409
 the green side to take the most standard 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.509
 position for art calmly shoot through 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.509
 narrowed down the Jedi a small part of the city 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.479
 if the enemy has burst greens and is heading 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.369
 to you then before you die from 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.829
 projectile enemy can become baking 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.630
 which is probably known at 7 and punish 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.630
 at the end of the one who will come to you 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.150
 if the outcome of the green boil is 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.709
 in favor of your team then immediately 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.660
 we start moving after our 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.239
 allies hiding behind this bush 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.920
 of some here in abundance and from here we 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.920
 we can well throw in the city 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.189
 so from square 1 we have 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.640
 shooting in the first line on the zero 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.510
 the lines 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.069
 spawn the enemy and partly railway. from the square 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.599
 a4g yard cn is the same jedem potion 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.290
 from the zero line we can prokidykat 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.120
 most of the card 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.700
 go on the bottom time here all 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.319
 similarly as from the top we go to the first 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.540
 line only here neatly to not 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.150
 to get behind the light you have to overcome the dangerous 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.069
 Plot a football field K1 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.700
 from where shooting on the first line will be 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.700
 and green 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.340
 You can also stay on the football 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.439
 the field is only to hide behind the standing 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.090
 home but from here we will be the least 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:37.889
 shooting down and respectively targets and how 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.680
 always the best but the most dangerous 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.540
 position the so -called potion for 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.939
 the initial arrow does not need to go 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.939
 the corner you can take square to 8 a 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.129
 Further already look to understand whether 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.650
 rely on allies that they hold back 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.689
 flank or get out of here in 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.430
 successful result is a square k0 and 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.769
 shoot in front of everything 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.480
 us as well as part of the city and beyond 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.480
 follow the allies ahead 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.340
 the trains 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.219
 that is, the square k1 move falls 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.759
 first line of Prague time and partly green 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:46.159
 gd from the zero line again almost 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:52.279
 the whole map and some narrow cities again 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:54.199
 do not be an exception not the Ensk 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:56.240
 good maps for artillery but find 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.949
 a place for yourself here though 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.289
 In some cases, you will need to do this. 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.509
 most likely to move a lot with you 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.069
 Artem I hope this video was useful for you
