Lee and there's actually some some of
what<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:14.350> would<00:02:14.620> consider<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:15.130> be<00:02:15.250> iconic

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
what I would consider to be iconic

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.780 
what I would consider to be iconic
moments<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.510> x-men<00:02:16.990> history<00:02:17.560> on<00:02:17.800> here<00:02:18.459> just<00:02:18.640> a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
moments in x-men history on here just a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
moments in x-men history on here just a
few<00:02:18.819> but<00:02:19.360> nothing<00:02:19.630> major<00:02:20.520> there's<00:02:21.520> actually

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
few but nothing major there's actually

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.070 
few but nothing major there's actually
right<00:02:24.010> here<00:02:24.040> we<00:02:24.910> have<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.300> birth<00:02:25.900> of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
right here we have the birth of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.070 
right here we have the birth of
Archangel<00:02:27.120> which<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.480> pretty<00:02:28.630> cool<00:02:28.840> and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
Archangel which is pretty cool and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.420 
Archangel which is pretty cool and
apocalypse<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.860> there<00:02:30.069> in<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.250> background

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
apocalypse is there in the background

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.590 
apocalypse is there in the background
and<00:02:31.410> then<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.890> have<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.489> birth<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:34.060> Phoenix

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
and then we have the birth of Phoenix

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.750 
and then we have the birth of Phoenix
which<00:02:35.319> is<00:02:35.470> pretty<00:02:35.650> neat<00:02:35.920> considering<00:02:36.459> you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
which is pretty neat considering you

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.449 
which is pretty neat considering you
know<00:02:36.819> how<00:02:36.970> major<00:02:37.180> character<00:02:37.780> she<00:02:37.989> is<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.920> we

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
know how major character she is and we

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.940 
know how major character she is and we
have<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.819> death<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.270> Madeline<00:02:40.810> Pryor<00:02:41.110> who<00:02:41.770> is

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
have the death of Madeline Pryor who is

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.890 
have the death of Madeline Pryor who is
Jean<00:02:42.310> Barry's<00:02:42.580> klom<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:44.230> very<00:02:44.739> scantily<00:02:45.250> clad

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
Jean Barry's klom so very scantily clad

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.040 
Jean Barry's klom so very scantily clad
and<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:48.010> guess<00:02:48.610> it's<00:02:48.910> about<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.480> goes<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:49.870> like

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
and I guess it's about it goes for like

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.140 
and I guess it's about it goes for like
you<00:02:50.350> know<00:02:50.380> fairly<00:02:50.920> large<00:02:51.310> memorable<00:02:52.030> images

though we also had include some ms

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.040 
though we also had include some ms
marvel<00:02:54.280> here<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.500> rogue<00:02:56.580> because<00:02:57.580> i<00:02:57.880> love<00:02:58.840> ms

when<00:03:05.170> she<00:03:05.380> was<00:03:05.530> Betsy<00:03:05.739> Braddock<00:03:06.310> in<00:03:06.519> her<00:03:06.730> old

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
when she was Betsy Braddock in her old

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.930 
when she was Betsy Braddock in her old
costume<00:03:07.510> which<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.019> think<00:03:08.230> pretty<00:03:08.440> neat<00:03:08.940> so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
costume which I think pretty neat so

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.670 
costume which I think pretty neat so
yeah<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.569> a<00:03:10.600> lot<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:10.900> different<00:03:10.989> images<00:03:11.530> on

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
yeah so a lot of different images on

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.490 
yeah so a lot of different images on
here<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.220> now<00:03:12.580> they<00:03:12.730> are<00:03:12.760> all<00:03:13.000> protected<00:03:13.780> for

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
here and now they are all protected for

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.750 
here and now they are all protected for
hopefully<00:03:14.799> forever<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.860> was<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.549> first

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
hopefully forever and this was the first

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.039 
hopefully forever and this was the first
but<00:03:19.030> definitely<00:03:19.360> not<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.600> last<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.959> these

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
but definitely not the last of these

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.630 
but definitely not the last of these
projects<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:20.769> I'm<00:03:20.829> very<00:03:20.890> happy<00:03:21.310> with<00:03:21.340> how<00:03:21.549> it

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
projects so I'm very happy with how it

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.490 
projects so I'm very happy with how it
turned<00:03:21.700> out<00:03:22.030> i'm<00:03:22.299> glad<00:03:22.480> i<00:03:22.510> picked<00:03:22.780> resin<00:03:23.260> to

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
turned out i'm glad i picked resin to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.229 
turned out i'm glad i picked resin to
cover<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.920> instead<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.489> buying<00:03:24.670> an<00:03:24.850> acrylic

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
cover it instead of buying an acrylic

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.330 
cover it instead of buying an acrylic
sheet<00:03:25.510> because<00:03:25.840> i<00:03:26.350> just<00:03:26.950> think<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.220> this

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
sheet because i just think that this

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.190 
sheet because i just think that this
lasts<00:03:27.820> better<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.510> it's<00:03:28.630> easier<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.079> move

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
lasts better and it's easier to move

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.449 
lasts better and it's easier to move
around<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.010> don't<00:03:30.160> know<00:03:30.280> where<00:03:30.430> that

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
around and you don't know where that

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.490 
around and you don't know where that
it's<00:03:30.700> slipping<00:03:31.000> off<00:03:31.180> or<00:03:31.660> something<00:03:32.380> getting

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
it's slipping off or something getting

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.020 
it's slipping off or something getting
under<00:03:32.860> it<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.340> image<00:03:33.489> is<00:03:33.700> getting

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
under it and the image is getting

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.190 
under it and the image is getting
destroyed<00:03:34.269> or<00:03:34.870> ruined<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:36.690> i'm<00:03:37.690> happy<00:03:37.989> about

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
destroyed or ruined so i'm happy about

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.009 
destroyed or ruined so i'm happy about
that<00:03:38.470> anyway<00:03:39.370> i<00:03:39.609> guess<00:03:40.090> that's<00:03:40.329> pretty<00:03:40.840> much

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
that anyway i guess that's pretty much

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.440 
that anyway i guess that's pretty much
all<00:03:41.230> there<00:03:41.380> is<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.769> explain<00:03:42.250> about<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.730> if
