really<00:00:51.010> fast<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:51.610> dries<00:00:51.820> really<00:00:52.030> fast

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
really fast and dries really fast

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.390 
really fast and dries really fast
and<00:00:52.630> it's<00:00:52.780> really<00:00:52.989> strong<00:00:53.260> but<00:00:54.010> if<00:00:54.160> you<00:00:54.250> have<00:00:54.370> a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400

vertical<00:00:54.880> or<00:00:55.239> different<00:00:55.600> one<00:00:55.720> that<00:00:55.870> works

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
vertical or different one that works

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:14.080 
vertical or different one that works
better<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.650> can<00:00:56.770> use<00:00:56.800> that

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.569
