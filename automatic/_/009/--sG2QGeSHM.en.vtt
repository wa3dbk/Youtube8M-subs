my<00:00:34.230> theory<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:35.850> game<00:00:36.180> takes<00:00:36.480> place<00:00:36.570> in

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
my theory this game takes place in

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.229 
my theory this game takes place in
terminia<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.559> lorule<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.460> an<00:00:38.610> early<00:00:38.910> Twilight

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
terminia and lorule is an early Twilight

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.780 
terminia and lorule is an early Twilight
Kingdom<00:00:39.930> alright<00:00:40.830> to<00:00:41.190> understand<00:00:41.610> where<00:00:41.760> I

think this belongs let's dissect where

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.990 
think this belongs let's dissect where
Nintendo<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.760> claiming<00:00:45.150> this<00:00:45.330> goes<00:00:47.000> nintendo

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
Nintendo is claiming this goes nintendo

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.610 
Nintendo is claiming this goes nintendo
claims<00:00:48.330> this<00:00:48.479> is<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.690> sequel<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.199> a<00:00:49.229> Link<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
claims this is a sequel to a Link to the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040 
claims this is a sequel to a Link to the
Past<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.519> direct<00:00:50.970> sequel<00:00:51.180> though<00:00:51.479> as<00:00:51.720> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
Past not a direct sequel though as it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.750 
Past not a direct sequel though as it
takes<00:00:52.229> place<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> few<00:00:52.589> hundred<00:00:53.100> years<00:00:53.250> after

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
takes place a few hundred years after

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.850 
takes place a few hundred years after
the<00:00:53.879> Link<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.180> Past<00:00:54.239> now<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.500> will<00:00:55.680> place

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the Link to the Past now this will place

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
the Link to the Past now this will place
the<00:00:55.890> game<00:00:56.220> into<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.670> actual<00:00:57.030> defeated

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the game into the actual defeated

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
the game into the actual defeated
timeline<00:00:58.110> this<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:59.040> timeline<00:00:59.280> where<00:00:59.670> link

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
timeline this is the timeline where link

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.140 
timeline this is the timeline where link
was<00:01:00.089> defeated<00:01:00.420> by<00:01:00.600> Ganon<00:01:01.019> in<00:01:01.199> Ocarina<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.739> Time

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
was defeated by Ganon in Ocarina of Time

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.700 
was defeated by Ganon in Ocarina of Time
now<00:01:03.150> what<00:01:03.360> I<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:03.900> is<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.470> game

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
now what I think is that this game

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.530 
now what I think is that this game
actually<00:01:05.010> goes<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> child<00:01:06.120> timeline

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
actually goes into the child timeline

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.380 
actually goes into the child timeline
after<00:01:06.990> Majora's<00:01:07.890> Mask<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.670> before<00:01:09.060> Twilight

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
after Majora's Mask but before Twilight

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.380 
after Majora's Mask but before Twilight
Princess<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.620> plays<00:01:10.830> into<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.130> timeline

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
Princess and it plays into that timeline

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.020 
Princess and it plays into that timeline
I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:13.290> Nintendo<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:13.830> claimed<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
I think Nintendo just claimed that this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
I think Nintendo just claimed that this
takes<00:01:15.330> place<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> defeated<00:01:16.290> timeline<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
takes place in the defeated timeline to

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
takes place in the defeated timeline to
make<00:01:17.340> us<00:01:17.490> buy<00:01:17.729> nostalgia<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.840> more<00:01:19.050> on<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
make us buy nostalgia but more on that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.140 
make us buy nostalgia but more on that
point<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> last<00:01:19.980> video<00:01:20.370> as<00:01:20.550> it<00:01:20.880> will<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.120> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
point in the last video as it will get a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.000 
point in the last video as it will get a
bit<00:01:21.360> ranted<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.900> I'll<00:01:22.200> question<00:01:22.410> Nintendo's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
bit ranted and I'll question Nintendo's

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.520 
bit ranted and I'll question Nintendo's
marketing<00:01:23.430> practices<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.330> people<00:01:25.230> might<00:01:25.410> not

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
marketing practices so people might not

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.820 
marketing practices so people might not
want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.770> listen<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:27.530> let's<00:01:28.530> begin

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
want to listen to that let's begin

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.560 
want to listen to that let's begin
looking<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.280> why<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> think<00:01:29.730> this<00:01:30.090> goes<00:01:30.300> after

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
looking at why I think this goes after

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.550 
looking at why I think this goes after
Majora's<00:01:31.110> Mask

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
Majora's Mask

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.590 
Majora's Mask
first<00:01:32.100> off<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.640> game<00:01:32.670> opens<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.270> by<00:01:33.390> telling

first off the game opens up by telling

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.480 
first off the game opens up by telling
this<00:01:33.840> historic<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.410> legend<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.010> you<00:01:35.100> will

Sacred Realm the demon can gain and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.060 
Sacred Realm the demon can gain and
broke<00:01:50.580> in<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.940> stole<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.420> Triforce<00:01:52.040> then<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
broke in and stole the Triforce then a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.190 
broke in and stole the Triforce then a
hero<00:01:53.370> stepped<00:01:53.730> in<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.060> had<00:01:54.420> Ganon<00:01:54.930> sealed

hero stepped in and had Ganon sealed
away<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.770> then<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.250> Triforce<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.790> split<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
away and then the Triforce was split so

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.149 
away and then the Triforce was split so
here's<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> first<00:01:58.500> problem

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
here's the first problem

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.190 
here's the first problem
at<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.610> end<00:01:59.760> of<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.940> Link<00:02:00.120> to<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.270> Past<00:02:00.330> Ganon

at the end of a Link to the Past Ganon

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080 
at the end of a Link to the Past Ganon
was<00:02:01.320> defeated<00:02:01.710> who<00:02:02.190> wasn't<00:02:02.550> sealed<00:02:02.730> the

Triforce<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.870> also<00:02:04.260> in<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.590> piece<00:02:04.980> Link

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
Triforce was also in one piece Link

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.520 
Triforce was also in one piece Link
actually<00:02:06.180> wished<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.630> peace<00:02:06.840> at<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.230> end<00:02:07.260> of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
actually wished for peace at the end of

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.469 
actually wished for peace at the end of
a<00:02:07.560> Link<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> Past<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> Triforce

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
a Link to the Past and then the Triforce

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.520 
a Link to the Past and then the Triforce
was<00:02:09.690> sealed<00:02:09.929> away<00:02:10.050> also

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
was sealed away also

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.170 
was sealed away also
it<00:02:10.739> wasn't<00:02:11.069> split<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.610> wasn't<00:02:11.819> put<00:02:12.060> into

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
it wasn't split up it wasn't put into

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.240 
it wasn't split up it wasn't put into
multiple<00:02:12.540> pieces<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:13.440> what<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.680> sounds<00:02:14.099> like

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
multiple pieces so what it sounds like

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.770 
multiple pieces so what it sounds like
is<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.519> have<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> ending<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.060> ocarina<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.720> time

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
is we have the ending of ocarina of time

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.350 
is we have the ending of ocarina of time

but if Ganon was defeated the now would

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.699 
but if Ganon was defeated the now would
have<00:02:18.450> put<00:02:18.629> us<00:02:18.720> into<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.019> child<00:02:19.349> Link

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
the moment you start the game you can go

the moment you start the game you can go
look<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.519> right<00:02:54.730> wall<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.120> your<00:02:55.209> house

hanging<00:02:55.959> there<00:02:56.349> is<00:02:56.440> Majora's<00:02:56.950> Mask<00:02:57.250> now<00:02:57.849> this

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
hanging there is Majora's Mask now this

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.640 
hanging there is Majora's Mask now this
gives<00:02:58.209> us<00:02:58.390> three<00:02:58.750> possibilities

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
gives us three possibilities

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.710 
gives us three possibilities
the<00:03:00.130> auto'<00:03:00.370> assumed<00:03:00.880> purpose<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.540> the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
the auto' assumed purpose is that the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.059 
the auto' assumed purpose is that the
mask<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.230> there<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> little<00:03:02.860> nod<00:03:03.040> to

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
mask is there is a little nod to

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.220 
mask is there is a little nod to
Majora's<00:03:03.610> Mask<00:03:03.940> it's<00:03:04.510> therefore<00:03:04.780> nothing

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
Majora's Mask it's therefore nothing

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.440 
Majora's Mask it's therefore nothing
more<00:03:05.560> than<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:05.890> go<00:03:06.069> hey<00:03:06.489> we<00:03:07.030> know<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.239> like

more than to go hey we know you like
this<00:03:07.600> game<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.140> we<00:03:08.260> put<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.500> mask<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.130> you

this game so we put the mask in so you

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.740 
this game so we put the mask in so you
can<00:03:09.400> tell<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.610> we<00:03:09.850> know<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.090> like<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.540> game

can tell that we know you like this game

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.630 
can tell that we know you like this game
but<00:03:11.440> we'd<00:03:11.650> still<00:03:11.920> be<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.220> defeated

timeline now for my theory we can go in

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.190 
timeline now for my theory we can go in
two<00:03:15.250> different<00:03:15.400> directions<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:16.690> never<00:03:16.930> find

two different directions we never find

two different directions we never find
out<00:03:17.380> what<00:03:17.470> happened<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.010> hero<00:03:18.220> at<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.400> end

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
out what happened to the hero at the end

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.220 
out what happened to the hero at the end
of<00:03:18.670> Majora's<00:03:19.030> Mask<00:03:19.299> so<00:03:19.840> he<00:03:19.959> could<00:03:20.140> have

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
of Majora's Mask so he could have

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.199 
of Majora's Mask so he could have
returned<00:03:20.590> home<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:21.099> passed<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.670> masks<00:03:21.880> on<00:03:22.090> to

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
version of Hyrule meaning that it would

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.069

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
have the same locations as Hyrule while

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.199 
have the same locations as Hyrule while
we<00:03:47.260> have<00:03:47.440> three<00:03:47.769> timelines<00:03:48.220> defeated<00:03:48.910> child

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
we have three timelines defeated child

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.120 
we have three timelines defeated child
and<00:03:49.450> adult<00:03:49.510> timelines<00:03:50.140> they<00:03:50.530> all<00:03:50.739> take<00:03:50.980> place

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
and adult timelines they all take place

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.430

in<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.459> same<00:03:51.700> world<00:03:52.030> even<00:03:52.600> if<00:03:52.690> one<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:52.900> flooded

in the same world even if one is flooded
the<00:03:53.829> locations<00:03:54.400> would<00:03:54.579> all<00:03:54.760> be<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.120> same<00:03:55.420> so

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
the locations would all be the same so

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.170 
the locations would all be the same so
this<00:03:56.560> means<00:03:56.859> that<00:03:57.280> while<00:03:57.459> we'll<00:03:57.670> never<00:03:57.880> go<00:03:58.120> to

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
this means that while we'll never go to

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.479 
this means that while we'll never go to
the<00:03:58.299> Hyrule<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.079> Link<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.410> Past<00:03:59.500> the
