snapdragon chipset clocked at one
gigahertz<00:00:07.830> so<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:09.000> can<00:00:09.210> see<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.480> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
gigahertz so you can see that the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.039 
gigahertz so you can see that the
scrolling<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.740> pretty<00:00:11.130> smooth<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:12.300> works<00:00:12.809> with

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
scrolling is pretty smooth it works with

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.350 
scrolling is pretty smooth it works with
all<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> hitch<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.400> only<00:00:14.639> place<00:00:14.910> where<00:00:15.179> we

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
all the hitch the only place where we

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.140 
all the hitch the only place where we
saw<00:00:15.570> some<00:00:15.929> lag<00:00:16.260> was<00:00:16.680> when<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.430> use<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.850> pinch

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
saw some lag was when we use the pinch

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.420 
saw some lag was when we use the pinch
to<00:00:18.390> zoom<00:00:18.449> gesture<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.650> home<00:00:19.859> screen<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
to zoom gesture in the home screen and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.550 
to zoom gesture in the home screen and
you<00:00:20.580> see<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.359> overview<00:00:22.550> view<00:00:23.550> comes<00:00:23.970> up<00:00:24.560> but

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
you see the overview view comes up but

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.650 
you see the overview view comes up but
with<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> slight<00:00:26.340> lag<00:00:26.699> hopefully<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.510> will

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
with a slight lag hopefully this will

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
with a slight lag hopefully this will
get<00:00:27.840> fixed<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.650> final<00:00:29.039> version<00:00:29.220> because

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
get fixed in the final version because

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460 
get fixed in the final version because
we're<00:00:30.060> only<00:00:30.359> looking<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> prototype

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
we're only looking at the prototype

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.750 
we're only looking at the prototype
right<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.180> but<00:00:33.180> except<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:35.399> home

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
right now but except for that the home

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.869 
right now but except for that the home
screen<00:00:36.270> animations<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.469> our<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.399> moving

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
screen animations and our are moving

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.000 
screen animations and our are moving
pretty<00:00:39.149> fast<00:00:39.300> pretty<00:00:40.050> smoothly<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.829> we're

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
pretty fast pretty smoothly so we're

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.340 
pretty fast pretty smoothly so we're
happy<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.719> you<00:00:42.719> also<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.170> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
now so as you can see we have initially

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.330 
now so as you can see we have initially
we<00:01:29.670> only<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.180> two<00:01:30.659> pages<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.409> preinstalled

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
we only have two pages with preinstalled

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.999 
we only have two pages with preinstalled
applications<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.290> installed<00:01:34.680> some

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
applications and we have installed some

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
applications and we have installed some
additional<00:01:35.939> applications<00:01:36.540> that's<00:01:36.750> why<00:01:36.900> we

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
additional applications that's why we

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.069 
additional applications that's why we
got<00:01:37.229> an<00:01:37.770> additional<00:01:38.310> page<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.119> what's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
got an additional page here and what's

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.670 
got an additional page here and what's
good<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.189> easily<00:01:41.780> sort<00:01:42.780> all

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
good here is you can easily sort all

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.819 
good here is you can easily sort all
your<00:01:44.009> applications<00:01:44.220> by<00:01:45.210> different<00:01:46.200> criteria

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
your applications by different criteria

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.370 
your applications by different criteria
let's<00:01:47.399> try<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> sort<00:01:48.149> them<00:01:48.360> by<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.600> most<00:01:49.079> use

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
let's try to sort them by the most use

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.120 
let's try to sort them by the most use
applications<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.460> see<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.540> nice<00:01:52.130> smooth

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
applications you can see a nice smooth

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.179 
applications you can see a nice smooth
animation<00:01:53.939> running<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.710> that's<00:01:56.040> the
