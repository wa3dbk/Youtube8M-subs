00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.700
 well done in step we fully done 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.770
 have our blue cross 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.599
 we continue to make ours 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.420
 first layer 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.570
 note not our first plane the full 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.900
 low as you can see it is already finished 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.539
 not only blue but also the side of this one 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.730
 low is finished 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.740
 we start again with our blue cross 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.949
 from above and then we go into our 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.410
 bottom layer looking for corner blocks 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.969
 with a blue color here for example 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 I have a blog how to block with one 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.530
 orange and a white color 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.660
 Now then we are going to watch our thumb give up 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
 this block high and look at our cube 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.149
 where this block they should go and that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.489
 here is this blue orange 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.059
 with a block here between us 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.149
 blue orange and white plane as you then 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.940
 does one rotate the bottom layer so 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.550
 this block directly under the place 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 where it should be 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.159
 this block is our place with that block 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.299
 in our lower right corner 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.070
 then we do our algorithm to be fair 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:18.210
 how to accent 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.549
 there and full and as you see this comes 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.490
 block are beautiful in the right places 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.200
 we will continue to look for others 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.530
 blocks for this example I have one 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.570
 red white blue block I am home in the dune 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.060
 when I look at my cube were 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.450
 it should be here so I turn 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.369
 in the bottom plate just below the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.439
 place where it should be and with the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.170
 block in the lower right corner I do it 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:49.079
 algorithm and accent what are there 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.320
 and now feel like you see the boxer 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.899
 right place white red blue between it 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.030
 white but the blue and the red flag 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.860
 it's wrong you're running is whole 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.920
 easy to solve we just do it 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.049
 our algorithm a few more times 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.180
 You may have this up to five 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.000
 times must do the block right here 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.240
 turned 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.830
 so very accent what are there and how bad 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.560
 cent what finds a hole and like you 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.010
 is a nice block on the right 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.260
 place and you shoot driving now you think 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.910
 flat itself is nice in your neighborhood 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.280
 unfortunately there are give or two 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.340
 blocks that are not correct 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.650
 rotated now it's very simple 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.030
 a green block of any kind 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.790
 you need under the thumb of your 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.000
 and you have it again your algorithm 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.430
 very penny what are there 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.040
 and oh and as you can see a block is now 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.410
 in our bottom layer and I think again 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.170
 where she should be it is a blue yellow 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.890
 red block here it must be in between 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.650
 blue with red and yellow plane and turn it 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.080
 under the place where it should be and 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.260
 with the block in the lower right corner 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:09.340
 it is recognized there are oh 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.560
 again brand fendt what is also very 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.560
 sandwich there are poo 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.130
 sucked on for a while until finally 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.440
 Stop 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.500
 block in the right place and even beautiful 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.700
 turned and then our last corner 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.799
 that's here 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.980
 we turn below where we must 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:33.100
 there are accent accent 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.709
 there is a role if you do it well 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.480
 not only first ready but also 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.610
 your entire first layer we are a third 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.930
 we have all discarded 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.930
 you can safely go to the following yes
