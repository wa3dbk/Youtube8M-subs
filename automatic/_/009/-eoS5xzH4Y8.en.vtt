00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.779
 moments come together between a meeting with 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.400
 people are manifesting here in 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.430
 the city council leaves work is 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.550
 met a meeting of aldermen and 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.529
 basically the concern was to see that 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.940
 within these dynamics that are being 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.010
 giving processes and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.460
 and of situations that are at what the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.809
 municipal president see that the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.700
 administration continues to take 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.680
 responsibility then 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.910
 I have not started any procedure because 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.890
 what are you watching for start too 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.050
 there must be absence and the audience 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.570
 it requires days because they have not arrived 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.240
 these deadlines there is nothing legally 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.310
 dictate our concern is in what 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.210
 administrative 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.540
 that the town council is in charge now 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.420
 to have more proximity so that 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.060
 accounts in these troubled times' be 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 very clear then what there is is a 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 Regidores concern to see what 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.210
 suppliers that are already mere suppliers 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.210
 in general 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.310
 so that there is no detour that does not 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.740
 there is no weird account because right now 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.210
 that is explained is going to fall the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.549
 responsibility on the councilors who 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.350
 have the few keys kingfisher already 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.539
 have met with the protesters who are 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.829
 they find here in the town hall a 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.170
 meeting with the council and they have 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.140
 accusations 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.600
 but they do not depend on capital or they are 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.430
 completely alien to us the only 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.979
 way we can enter or replace 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.229
 someone is when he fulfills days or months of 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.180
 absence this concept that is being 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.250
 is organizing a council that will do 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.820
 for citizenship and citizenship will be 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.780
 these citizens choose 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.610
 the community community who decides 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.100
 according to regulations that I do not know 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.240
 frankly who is guilty and who is not 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.100
 but nothing competes with roads 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.190
 20,000 is unemployed 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.060
 when activities will resume no 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.060
 as well 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.850
 if you are asking everyone 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.760
 employees of the city council who 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.100
 present to work all absolutely 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.530
 all if there are problems in the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.260
 City Hall but who has problems 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.480
 You will have to solve them if someone is from 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.640
 clean and he has to come and give him that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.390
 service to the citizenship because no 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.760
 we can close the town hall there are 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.840
 problems then all employee that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.480
 have a responsibility of 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.880
 City Hall must come and work or 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.160
 it will be understood that it starts in these days 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.980
 absence where a process is started 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.800
 that's the meeting that's about that 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.480
 people understand that despite the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.400
 crisis that there is to use all these things 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.170
 we continue to extend and to give 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.840
 a service the call to citizenship 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.340
 of the workers of the town hall the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.250
 called to the citizenship is that they have 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.200
 patience and the workers of 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.200
 municipality that are responsible 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.350
 it's true that there's going to be some chaos 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.910
 situation is not for less but each 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.560
 who he has to do their jobs no 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.280
 we can separate ourselves from our 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.280
 responsibility
