definitely<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:17.930> think<00:03:18.019> indicate<00:03:18.920> spawn<00:03:19.760> times

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
definitely I think indicate spawn times

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.479 
definitely I think indicate spawn times
like<00:03:21.140> or<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:21.680> know<00:03:21.769> if<00:03:21.859> you<00:03:21.980> hear<00:03:22.129> a<00:03:22.159> lightning

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
like or you know if you hear a lightning

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.710 
like or you know if you hear a lightning
strike<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.849> means<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.329> have<00:03:23.359> at<00:03:23.540> least

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
strike that means that you have at least

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.979 
strike that means that you have at least
one<00:03:23.989> more<00:03:24.200> wave<00:03:24.889> of<00:03:25.069> zombies<00:03:25.659> so<00:03:26.659> if<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.870> can

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
one more wave of zombies so if you can

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.209 
one more wave of zombies so if you can
keep<00:03:27.109> track<00:03:27.319> of<00:03:27.470> those<00:03:27.709> when<00:03:27.889> you<00:03:27.980> hear<00:03:28.129> the

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:28.219 
keep track of those when you hear the

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.250 
keep track of those when you hear the
lightning<00:03:28.579> strike<00:03:28.849> you'll<00:03:29.569> know<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:29.810> you're

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
lightning strike you'll know that you're

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.280 
lightning strike you'll know that you're
not<00:03:30.439> all<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.069> way<00:03:31.370> through<00:03:31.639> the<00:03:31.730> round<00:03:31.939> or<00:03:32.299> you

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
not all the way through the round or you

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.420 
not all the way through the round or you
know<00:03:33.409> if<00:03:33.470> you're<00:03:33.590> seeing<00:03:33.829> zombies<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.340> you're

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
know if you're seeing zombies and you're

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.649 
know if you're seeing zombies and you're
not<00:03:34.519> hearing<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.849> lightning<00:03:35.329> and<00:03:35.510> you're

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
not hearing a lightning and you're

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:36.789 
not hearing a lightning and you're
killing<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:36.019> bunch<00:03:36.170> of<00:03:36.319> them<00:03:36.439> then<00:03:36.590> it's

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
killing a bunch of them then it's

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.589 
killing a bunch of them then it's
letting<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.400> know<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:37.549> you<00:03:38.150> might<00:03:38.299> be<00:03:38.419> near

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
letting you know that you might be near

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.479 
letting you know that you might be near
the<00:03:38.720> end<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.019> round<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:39.590> that's<00:03:40.280> something

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
the end of the round so that's something

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.190 
the end of the round so that's something
to<00:03:40.609> keep<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:40.909> mind<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.480> especially<00:03:41.900> as<00:03:42.109> the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
to keep in mind and especially as the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.240 
to keep in mind and especially as the
newer<00:03:42.379> games<00:03:42.500> come<00:03:42.769> out<00:03:42.859> I<00:03:42.889> think<00:03:43.129> they

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
newer games come out I think they

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.099 
newer games come out I think they
definitely<00:03:43.400> have<00:03:43.790> ways<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.180> letting<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.930> know

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109
