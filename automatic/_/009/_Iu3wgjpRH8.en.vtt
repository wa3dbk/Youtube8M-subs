00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:24.090
 provola we will need a roll of pasta 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:36.390
 puff pastry flowers clean salami e 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:40.530
 see you I want to turn the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:49.500
 Cooking head then we see 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:52.190
 Zucchi and reopen matter if you compare 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.590
 the many were enclosed in ours 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:00.289
 puff pastry so you do n't have constancy 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.739
 here you see here raised everything 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.739
 protests now 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.300
 let's make another one of you had it 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.470
 all 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:24.090
 no one opens the stand, so here it is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:28.110
 I finish getting to it case but there is a 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.430
 little of earth and then if it should be 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.060
 a lot of it must be a passage 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.100
 in the area however they tend to get sick later 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.660
 when you put them in the water 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.250
 let's take our puff pastry 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.250
 we begin to cut it 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:55.180
 here we take it now 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:58.360
 pumpkin flower our little rectangle 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.370
 square we like to put moves 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.250
 of puff pastry we put ourselves in the center 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:11.130
 the salami and the proof we are a little more 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.130
 of people we close 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:27.780
 we close our own package in 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.780
 this sense is so you see very well 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.410
 then we'll do it with our fork 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:43.250
 of the little ones to become one day 20 August 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:46.140
 all our salami our e 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:55.349
 rolled up so that the network 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:58.080
 maximum we crush rita slabs and so 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.510
 away we can do it in 50 thousand doctors but 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.280
 we can also do it as a corrector 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.280
 we stop 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.410
 take our project our 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:18.230
 salami our rule 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.230
 we ask for the cornet 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.370
 let's do our designs as mentioned 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.550
 supply 50 degrees for 12 15 minutes 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.890
 here you see it is very simple nothing 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.730
 starting another alternative then for the 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.250
 shows his story in this case was 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.480
 that we make the difference in 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:50.140
 angola we put our children on 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.140
 moved you live 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.590
 Yup 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.299
 so as to make it into a kind of understanding 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.849
 here now we put the 3rd limit that 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.420
 let's get smaller and smaller 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.420
 With the hands 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:26.889
 we put our salami into small pieces 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:29.219
 increasingly smaller is we fill it 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.219
 we see 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.240
 here it is 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.240
 currently the cutter 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 we cut our own into slices 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:55.490
 roll with zucchini you remember more than 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:59.750
 of zucchini provola and salami and not 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:05.000
 so we place an exhibition in rounds 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:09.310
 mullet which we will then inform 180 degrees 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.410
 for twenty minutes 15 20 networks 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:17.980
 here are our pasta stuffed products 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.980
