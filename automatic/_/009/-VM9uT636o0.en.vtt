characters<00:01:49.590> were<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> big<00:01:50.130> part<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.520> our

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
characters were a big part of our

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.399 
characters were a big part of our
childhood<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.810> first<00:01:51.990> glance<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
childhood and so on first glance you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
childhood and so on first glance you
might<00:01:52.560> look<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.460> might<00:01:53.759> think

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
might look at this and you might think

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.480 
might look at this and you might think
this<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.720> over<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> top<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.680> gone<00:01:55.860> too<00:01:56.130> far

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
this is over the top it's gone too far

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
this is over the top it's gone too far
I<00:01:56.790> don't<00:01:56.939> want<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> look<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.170> not

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
I don't want to look at this this is not

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.380 
I don't want to look at this this is not
the<00:01:58.710> way<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.040> should<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.310> tackling<00:01:59.820> domestic

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the way we should be tackling domestic

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.359 
the way we should be tackling domestic
violence<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.079> too<00:02:01.320> often<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> media<00:02:02.040> we

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369

see<00:02:02.579> images<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.090> violence<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.869> just

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
see images of violence and not just

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.630 
see images of violence and not just
domestic<00:02:04.530> violence<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:04.979> all<00:02:05.219> sorts<00:02:05.579> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
domestic violence but all sorts of

censored and we see the mass public

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.380 
censored and we see the mass public
really<00:02:10.470> being<00:02:10.679> sheltered<00:02:11.099> from<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> true

actually going on and in the biggest

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.920 
actually going on and in the biggest

game of things that actually does people
a<00:02:17.170> disservice<00:02:17.490> rather<00:02:18.490> than<00:02:18.760> protecting<00:02:19.660> them

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
a disservice rather than protecting them

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.110 
a disservice rather than protecting them
from<00:02:20.170> what's<00:02:20.650> going<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.430> censoring<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:21.970> so

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
from what's going on and censoring it so

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.490 
from what's going on and censoring it so
that<00:02:22.270> we<00:02:22.360> don't<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:23.050> such<00:02:23.290> horrific

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
that we don't have to see such horrific

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.860 
that we don't have to see such horrific
things<00:02:24.010> what<00:02:24.670> it's<00:02:24.820> actually<00:02:25.000> doing<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.660> it's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
things what it's actually doing is it's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.500 
things what it's actually doing is it's
giving<00:02:26.260> us<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.590> false<00:02:26.920> picture<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.240> truth

giving us a false picture of the truth

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.480 
giving us a false picture of the truth
and<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.410> what<00:02:29.590> domestic<00:02:30.100> violence

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
and this is what domestic violence

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.880 
and this is what domestic violence
really<00:02:31.120> looks<00:02:31.390> like<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:31.930> not<00:02:32.200> pretty<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.860> is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
really looks like it's not pretty it is

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.100 
really looks like it's not pretty it is
disturbing<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.180> st.<00:02:34.510> hoaxes<00:02:34.900> whole

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
disturbing and that st. hoaxes whole

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.070 
disturbing and that st. hoaxes whole
point<00:02:35.440> with<00:02:35.800> this<00:02:36.070> artistic<00:02:36.490> campaign<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.480> to

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
point with this artistic campaign is to

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.930 
point with this artistic campaign is to
make<00:02:38.230> us<00:02:38.410> realize<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.730> isn't

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
make us realize that this isn't

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.550 
make us realize that this isn't
something<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.390> we<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.750> keep<00:02:40.930> behind<00:02:41.290> closed

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
something that we can keep behind closed

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.080 
something that we can keep behind closed
doors<00:02:41.860> any<00:02:42.160> longer<00:02:42.490> this<00:02:42.640> isn't<00:02:42.910> something

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
doors any longer this isn't something

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.420 
doors any longer this isn't something
that<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.780> can<00:02:43.810> censor<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.530> brush<00:02:44.770> aside<00:02:45.130> and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
that we can censor and brush aside and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.280 
that we can censor and brush aside and
pretend<00:02:45.760> like<00:02:45.880> it's<00:02:46.090> not<00:02:46.300> as<00:02:46.750> big<00:02:47.050> of<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.260> deal

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
pretend like it's not as big of a deal

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.590 
pretend like it's not as big of a deal
as<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.340> disturbing<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.090> shocking<00:02:49.120> is

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
as it is so disturbing and shocking is

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.420 
as it is so disturbing and shocking is
this<00:02:49.780> campaign<00:02:50.260> maybe<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.710> think<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.250> does

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
this campaign maybe I think it does

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.340 
this campaign maybe I think it does
spark<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:52.030> really<00:02:52.450> important<00:02:52.870> discussion

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
spark a really important discussion

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.200 
spark a really important discussion
about<00:02:53.500> how<00:02:53.800> serious<00:02:54.370> domestic<00:02:54.820> violence

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
about how serious domestic violence

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.330 
about how serious domestic violence
really<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.500> certainly<00:02:56.860> creating<00:02:57.280> a

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
really is and it is certainly creating a

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.520 
really is and it is certainly creating a
lot<00:02:57.490> of<00:02:57.610> attention<00:02:57.850> so<00:02:58.630> if<00:02:59.020> this<00:02:59.290> campaign

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
lot of attention so if this campaign

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.670 
lot of attention so if this campaign
even<00:03:00.160> goes<00:03:00.340> on<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.880> encourage<00:03:01.360> one<00:03:01.600> person<00:03:02.140> to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
even goes on to encourage one person to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.890 
even goes on to encourage one person to
report<00:03:03.190> their<00:03:03.400> attacker<00:03:03.730> one<00:03:04.330> victim<00:03:04.750> of

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
report their attacker one victim of

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.930 
report their attacker one victim of
domestic<00:03:05.050> violence<00:03:05.710> to<00:03:05.830> report<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.670> person

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
domestic violence to report the person

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.130 
domestic violence to report the person
who<00:03:07.000> attacked<00:03:07.270> them<00:03:07.480> then<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.720> think<00:03:07.870> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
who attacked them then I think the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.960 
who attacked them then I think the
campaign<00:03:08.530> has<00:03:09.040> done<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.220> great<00:03:09.370> job<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:09.880> I'm

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
campaign has done a great job so I'm

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.250 
campaign has done a great job so I'm
