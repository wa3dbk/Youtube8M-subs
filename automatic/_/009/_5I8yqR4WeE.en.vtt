Lucario<00:01:52.830> but<00:01:53.039> then<00:01:53.160> again<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.520> guy<00:01:53.729> didn't

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
have any items so I'm guessing he

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.669 
have any items so I'm guessing he
doesn't<00:01:55.740> EV<00:01:56.220> train<00:01:56.550> either<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.660> or<00:01:57.690> my<00:01:58.200> sizer

just say it could get a bit hairy so I
have<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.110> take<00:02:22.260> down<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.440> Lucario<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.510> I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
have to take down that Lucario and I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.660 
have to take down that Lucario and I
know<00:02:24.930> sizer<00:02:25.319> can<00:02:25.740> probably<00:02:26.280> take<00:02:26.430> at<00:02:26.580> least

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
know sizer can probably take at least

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.390 
know sizer can probably take at least
one<00:02:26.910> hit<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.930> was<00:02:28.410> guessing<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:29.010> Pinter

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
one hit and I was guessing that Pinter

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.850 
one hit and I was guessing that Pinter
would<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.849> go<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.120> size<00:02:30.329> or<00:02:30.540> anyway<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.709> um

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
would just go for size or anyway so um

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.070 
would just go for size or anyway so um
yeah<00:02:33.070> sizers<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.240> kind<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.450> fodder<00:02:34.690> at<00:02:34.930> this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
yeah sizers just kind of fodder at this

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.920 
yeah sizers just kind of fodder at this
point<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.310> anyway<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.820> go<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.330> swagger<00:02:37.750> to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
point so anyway I go for the swagger to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.400 
point so anyway I go for the swagger to
get<00:02:38.140> my<00:02:38.850> four<00:02:39.850> times<00:02:40.210> attack<00:02:40.810> boost<00:02:41.020> but<00:02:41.320> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
get my four times attack boost but the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.770 
get my four times attack boost but the
simple<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:42.040> now<00:02:42.190> Nomo<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.120> most<00:02:43.300> beastly

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
simple so now Nomo is the most beastly

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.910 
simple so now Nomo is the most beastly
thing<00:02:43.930> ever<00:02:44.880> he's<00:02:45.880> like<00:02:46.120> Garchomp<00:02:46.870> x<00:02:47.260> 2<00:02:47.650> at<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
thing ever he's like Garchomp x 2 at the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.610 
thing ever he's like Garchomp x 2 at the
moment<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.520> he's<00:02:49.240> about<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.540> own<00:02:49.750> boom

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
moment so he's about to own boom

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.720 
moment so he's about to own boom
earthquake<00:02:51.520> ah<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:53.290> would<00:02:54.040> how<00:02:54.130> much<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.430> do<00:02:54.490> to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
earthquake ah I would how much I do to

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.480 
earthquake ah I would how much I do to
my<00:02:54.850> own<00:02:55.000> size<00:02:55.390> or<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:56.200> like<00:02:56.380> crazy<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.980> one

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
my own size or just like crazy I one

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.910 
my own size or just like crazy I one
shot<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.790> lucario<00:02:58.680> completely<00:02:59.680> useless

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
shot the lucario completely useless

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.980 
shot the lucario completely useless
critical<00:03:00.640> hit<00:03:00.820> there<00:03:01.000> did<00:03:01.240> not<00:03:01.270> need<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.750> at

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
critical hit there did not need that at

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.660 
critical hit there did not need that at
all<00:03:02.170> i<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:02.560> guarantee<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.160> 100<00:03:03.820> percent<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.920> he

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
all i can guarantee it 100 percent so he

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.630 
all i can guarantee it 100 percent so he
his<00:03:07.420> pincer<00:03:07.959> goes<00:03:08.620> for<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.890> superpower<00:03:09.340> and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
his pincer goes for a superpower and

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.970 
his pincer goes for a superpower and
knocks<00:03:10.240> out<00:03:10.420> size<00:03:10.630> or<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.350> was<00:03:11.770> kind<00:03:11.890> of

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
knocks out size or but I was kind of

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.860 
knocks out size or but I was kind of
expecting<00:03:12.190> that<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.970> then<00:03:13.270> again<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.690> really

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
expecting that and then again it really

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.890 
expecting that and then again it really
doesn't<00:03:14.260> matter<00:03:14.380> because<00:03:14.770> sighs<00:03:15.310> or<00:03:15.550> is<00:03:15.900> he's

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
doesn't matter because sighs or is he's

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.800 
doesn't matter because sighs or is he's
done<00:03:17.110> his<00:03:17.230> job<00:03:17.260> he's<00:03:17.530> set<00:03:18.010> up<00:03:18.040> for<00:03:18.430> me<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:18.850> it's

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
done his job he's set up for me so it's

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.270 
done his job he's set up for me so it's
nice<00:03:20.080> if<00:03:20.260> he<00:03:20.350> stays<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:20.980> he<00:03:21.040> can<00:03:21.130> get<00:03:21.220> a

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
nice if he stays in and he can get a

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.490 
nice if he stays in and he can get a
couple<00:03:21.400> Xizor's<00:03:22.030> off<00:03:22.209> or<00:03:22.600> set<00:03:22.930> up<00:03:23.050> tailwind

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
couple Xizor's off or set up tailwind

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.300 
couple Xizor's off or set up tailwind
again<00:03:23.739> but<00:03:24.520> you<00:03:24.670> know<00:03:24.820> it's<00:03:25.180> no<00:03:25.540> big<00:03:25.750> deal<00:03:26.310> so

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
again but you know it's no big deal so

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.880 
again but you know it's no big deal so
go<00:03:28.090> ahead<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.330> send<00:03:28.720> out<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.020> Joseon<00:03:29.530> because

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
go ahead and send out the Joseon because

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.470 
go ahead and send out the Joseon because
I<00:03:29.920> didn't<00:03:30.160> know<00:03:30.250> what<00:03:30.370> he<00:03:30.580> was<00:03:30.970> gonna<00:03:31.090> send<00:03:31.360> out

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
I didn't know what he was gonna send out

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.590 
I didn't know what he was gonna send out
next<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.620> thought<00:03:33.070> Jody<00:03:33.459> on<00:03:33.580> cuz<00:03:34.120> it's<00:03:34.300> fast

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
next so I thought Jody on cuz it's fast

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.860 
next so I thought Jody on cuz it's fast
it<00:03:34.870> would<00:03:34.959> probably<00:03:35.110> be<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.350> good<00:03:35.410> idea<00:03:35.590> even

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
it would probably be a good idea even

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.210 
it would probably be a good idea even
though<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:37.989> have<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.290> tail<00:03:38.470> wind<00:03:38.680> up<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.070> no

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
though I do have a tail wind up and no

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.860 
though I do have a tail wind up and no
more<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.610> out<00:03:39.820> speeds<00:03:40.180> everything<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.780> it's

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
more like out speeds everything and it's

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.350 
more like out speeds everything and it's
a<00:03:40.989> wind<00:03:41.290> yeah<00:03:41.680> that's<00:03:41.890> just<00:03:41.980> it's<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:43.180> is

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
a wind yeah that's just it's that is

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.539 
a wind yeah that's just it's that is
