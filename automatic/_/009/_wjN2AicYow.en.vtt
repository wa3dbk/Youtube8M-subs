00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.570
 Have you all been playing music 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.440
 The score is this time 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.620
 In music it is with more numbers 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.290
 Frets eg 57 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.320

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.080
 Referred to as written when I it anymore as 5 fret that touch the middle'S 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.330

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.330
 I think so can be done soon 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.010
 For example Toshimashite this point 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:01.190
 Because there is a lot of movement from the side 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.190
 Especially in the second half 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.970

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.470

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.660
 It is to check the next fret well 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.650

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:44.819
