 fantasy or kingdom hearts square enix ha 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.600
 entrusted to the small studio 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.610
 independent is read with study back 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 to the roots of the rpg with a game 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.989
 modest but of quality in braille 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 default with a very basic plot 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.530
 known by fans of the genre 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.120
 breivik default presents a world 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.339
 supported by four crystals 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.079
 elementary the problem comes when the 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.610
 darkness takes over them and the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.530
 seas and other elements of the earth 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.510
 they start to get out of control 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.339
 in this way we know agnes the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.440
 view of the wind that should investigate 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.630
 what happened on a trip around luccín 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.670
 dark with her will be the only one 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.830
 survivor after a catastrophe in his 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 city ​​that looks for answers also ring 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 abel a mysterious womanizer who does not 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.310
 he remembers nothing of his past but carries a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.080
 newspaper that tells the future and finally 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.789
 they will be accompanied by a warrior who 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.600
 betray his army to join 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.600
 the cause of aggression 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.330
 the plot will revolve around 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.610
 confrontation between the religion of 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.710
 ism crystal that love crystals and 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.780
 the anti-crystal ism that seeks a world 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.460
 more based on science and actions 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.710
 that can be achieved by some 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.420
 beliefs or others the story is 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.860
 interesting and catches more and more 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.020
 having several plot twists 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.640
 although it will sustain itself in the charisma of its 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.800
 protagonists and the variety of 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.870
 characters mostly villains but 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.670
 has a very important drawback and is that 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.560
 at a certain moment so much the game 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.560
 how the plot hits a quality slump 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.580
 and considerable pace is undoubtedly the worst 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.580
 Title aspect 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.160
 the game system introduces a 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.229
 Very interesting novelty in the fighting 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.420
 by turns inspired by the name of the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.610
 game in each turn we can perform 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.560
 the basic actions like attacking using 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.020
 a skill or an object but also 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.120
 use break or default report allows the 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.550
 character save turn and not perform 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.990
 nothing getting less damage and proof 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.330
 acts on the contrary allowing use 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.670
 our reservation shifts to perform 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.350
 several actions in a single shift if not 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.180
 We have previously booked shifts with 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.830
 default we can stay in negative and 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.680
 those next turns we will be 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.360
 totally defenseless so we are 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.580
 poses a system where you think very well 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.040
 each action and play quietly or 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.430
 risky using shifts that are not yet 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.430
 we have 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.900
 to this we must add the points of 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.760
 wait similar to the break function but 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.340
 pressing start at any time 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.900
 combat and paralyzing the time for 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.790
 get a waiting point we will have 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.969
 leave the game on hold for 8 hours 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.560
 followed as it is with brave default 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.689
 we can also borrow those 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.359
 points but then we can not use 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.250
 of them until we reset them as 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.709
 curiosity those points can also 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.980
 bought with real money but does not deserve 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.840
 the sorrow 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.790
 the skills and progress of the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.250
 characters have been developed under a 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.650
 system of works having 24 in total 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.629
 remember classic games as final 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.970
 fantasy 5 but mostly at the end 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.610
 fantasy by twists of light by nintendo 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.650
 ds with which they keep more similar the 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.390
 system is very rich and addictive going up 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.220
 level each job to earn your 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.620
 skills and being able to use them 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.420
 even if we change to another, not everything 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.829
 consists of magical or physical attack 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.720
 we can base our game on 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.760
 counterattacks exploit weaknesses 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.920
 enemies sacrifice our points of 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.049
 life and even attack based on money 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.390
 achieved by adapting to all 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.859
 In addition, many of the jobs 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.959
 they get through secondary missions 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.280
 that appear progressively 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.260
 they interweave very well with the story 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.840
 principal and encourages all 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.030
 get 100% of this game is 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.269
 about and can even exceed 100 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.269
 hours 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.080
 to 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.819
 default rule is a classic rpg but with 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.680
 many options that bring it all 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.750
 the players and those who think it is 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.310
 of gender is tedious and boring we can 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.229
 increase the speed of the fighting 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.940
 by two or four to accelerate the 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.100
 animations in addition to activate the option 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.169
 auto that will always repeat the last 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.060
 shift without having to choose the actions 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.860
 additionally there are three levels of 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.930
 difficulty that can be changed at all 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.940
 moment and very useful will define 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.419
 the frequency of encounters with enemies 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.590
 we can increase it to 50% or 100% 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.630
 when we want to level up 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.120
 quickly but also decrease a 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.560
 50% or deactivate them completely if not 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.710
 we want them to bother us in certain 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.710
 moments 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.690
 Highlight the use of functions 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.789
 wireless in the title but also 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.380
 other features are exploited promptly 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.690
 as augmented reality and the 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.370
 gyroscope if we have friends with 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.139
 the game we can link to our 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.060
 characters with the corresponding in the 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.160
 departure of our friends and that 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.050
 way to use skills that we have not 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.389
 reached yet if they have a 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.460
 further progress we can also invoke 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.199
 those in combat with the action of a turn 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.120
 they want to send and we 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.400
 we can do the same too 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.169
 we will receive four players daily 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.479
 random from around the world to invoke 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.860
 the these invited players and the people 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.870
 that we cross with street pass 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.810
 will serve for another additional purpose 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.280
 be new inhabitants of norén de la 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.889
 destroyed city of our protagonist 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.750
 we can reconstruct roads and 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.970
 stores of different levels to be able 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.560
 access to better objects and prices in 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.539
 the general store of the game 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.820
 the peculiarity is that each construction 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.990
 it takes a while to complete and it's in 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.940
 real time 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.919
 The more inhabitants we have the less 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.660
 will take time to build if the 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.820
 waiting points were an incentive to 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.650
 leave the console on standby too what 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.610
 will be the reconstruction since some 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.250
 tasks can 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.349
 the tens of hours moreover we were 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.479
 they will send by spotpass final bosses 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.990
 specials of the title of the force news 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.990
 of luck 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.670
 the game looks very nice thanks to its 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.710
 artistic section and is that many of 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.530
 the funds that we found are great 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.480
 quality hand-drawn in addition there is a 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.400
 great care in the design of characters and 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.770
 in the different suits according to work 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.110
 who are using the dungeons without 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.910
 However, they are not equally worked and 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.280
 many seem the same but with the background 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.320
 of the walls changed the 3d effect it 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.910
 takes advantage of almost the entire game and 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.460
 helps us to enjoy the depth 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.410
 and the beauty of the scenarios in 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.270
 the music is magnificent and has been 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.980
 created by the Japanese artist network 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.660
 becoming important even in the 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.430
 combats since melodies will sound 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.990
 special while the attacks last 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.300
 specials that can be executed 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.640
 characters besides the game is bent 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.830
 for more than 90% of the dialogs thing 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.990
 that is appreciated and we can choose it in 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.110
 English or Japanese always with texts in 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.110
 Spanish 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.880
 ridley default proves that ni square 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.920
 enix nor the japanese rpg are finished 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.390
 whenever you feel like doing the 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.580
 good things 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.470
 all the fans of this genre that lived 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.240
 great golden times can not 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.700
 miss this title that overflows quality 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.980
 in all its aspects elevates the genre of 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.450
 new to the top and introduce many 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.460
 improvements to adapt it to times 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.590
 current 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.389
 however the game is not perfect the 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.310
 history does not end up exploding nor 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:35.740
 we can forgive that after having us 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.600
 hooked there is a point where the game 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.490
 we get bored several hours 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.380
 the second delivery is already underway and 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.780
 let's hope Square Enix takes note of 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.410
 your failures because the truth is that already 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.410
 we look forward to it
