attract most of them sometimes it

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.310 
attract most of them sometimes it
doesn't<00:00:27.300> work<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:27.900> bit<00:00:27.990> buggy

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
doesn't work so it's a little bit buggy

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.769

but you can attract most the animals
with<00:00:31.590> wheat<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.969> could<00:00:33.210> easily<00:00:33.840> just

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
with wheat and you could easily just

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.180 
with wheat and you could easily just
lure<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.770> into<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:36.030> own<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.600> private

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
lure them into your own little private

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.190 
lure them into your own little private
fenced<00:00:38.190> area<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.600> start<00:00:39.870> breeding

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
fenced area and you can start breeding

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.369 
fenced area and you can start breeding
them<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.890> particular<00:00:41.360> way<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.930> as<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.170> say

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
them in this particular way but as I say

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.799 
them in this particular way but as I say
sometimes<00:00:43.980> some<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> them<00:00:45.149> don't<00:00:45.360> actually

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
sometimes some of them don't actually

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
sometimes some of them don't actually
follow<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> wheat<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> think<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
follow you with the wheat I think it's a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.250 
follow you with the wheat I think it's a
little<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> bug<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> good<00:00:49.079> way

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.600 
little bit of a bug this is a good way
to<00:00:49.289> attract<00:00:50.190> animals<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.750> such<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.610> pigs

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to attract animals to you such as pigs

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.819

the ones you pretty much are going to be
breeding<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.690> then<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.440> lock<00:00:58.620> them<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
breeding and then you can lock them in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520 
breeding and then you can lock them in
there<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.399> pretty<00:00:59.760> much<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> whole<00:01:01.289> how

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to breed ratio you pretty much give

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.289 
to breed ratio you pretty much give
wheat<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.650> any<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> animals<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.970> peer

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
heart serve their heads give them the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.980 
heart serve their heads give them the
two<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> them<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.790> collide<00:01:09.210> together<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
two of them they collide together and
