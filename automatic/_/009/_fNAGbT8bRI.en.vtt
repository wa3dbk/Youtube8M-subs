00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.660 
overload or flow overload sit where now
when<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.500> first<00:00:13.710> launch<00:00:13.920> flow<00:00:14.219> overload

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
when you first launch flow overload

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.240 
when you first launch flow overload
there's<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.940> fairly<00:00:15.420> lengthy<00:00:16.250> tutorial

it's really quite simple we'll go ahead
and<00:00:25.740> start<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.130> new<00:00:26.310> game<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:27.119> over<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> left

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and start a new game so over on the left

and start a new game so over on the left
hand<00:00:28.109> side<00:00:28.260> you've<00:00:28.560> got<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.949> pipe<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.730> is

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
hand side you've got a pipe that is

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.820 
hand side you've got a pipe that is
slowly<00:00:30.179> filling<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.779> water<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.769> tap

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
slowly filling with water and as I tap

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
slowly filling with water and as I tap
on<00:00:32.040> these<00:00:32.340> question<00:00:32.790> marks<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.719> see

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
on these question marks I'm going to see

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.160 
on these question marks I'm going to see
various<00:00:34.309> other<00:00:35.309> pieces<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:36.000> pipe<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.600> you

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
various other pieces of pipe and you

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.080 
various other pieces of pipe and you
want<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.410> tap<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.920> switch<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.520> like<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
want to tap and switch just like that to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.790 
want to tap and switch just like that to
keep<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> water<00:00:39.600> flowing<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.559> want<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
keep the water flowing and you want to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.560 
keep the water flowing and you want to
get<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> water<00:00:41.190> from<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.610> top<00:00:41.850> left<00:00:42.149> corner

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
get the water from this top left corner

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.510 
get the water from this top left corner
down<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.530> case<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> bottom<00:00:44.340> right

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
down in this case to the bottom right

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.490 
down in this case to the bottom right
and<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.149> only<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.809> much<00:00:45.960> time<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.320> make

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and you only have so much time to make

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
and you only have so much time to make
that<00:00:46.800> happen<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.329> at<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.570> top

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that happen as you can see up at the top

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.790 
that happen as you can see up at the top
here<00:00:48.870> we're<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.260> 41<00:00:49.800> seconds<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> let's<00:00:52.500> just

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
here we're at 41 seconds so let's just

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.279 
here we're at 41 seconds so let's just
see<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.059> while<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> talk<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
see if I can do this while I talk to you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.470 
see if I can do this while I talk to you
and<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.250> points<00:00:56.489> based<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.149> many

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and you get points based on how many

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.869 
and you get points based on how many
pipes<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.199> use<00:00:58.410> also<00:00:58.890> how<00:00:59.039> many<00:00:59.190> points<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
pipes you use also how many points you

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.260 
pipes you use also how many points you
don't<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.079> use<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.469> don't<00:01:01.649> uncover<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:03.090> my

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
don't have to use or don't uncover in my

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509 
don't have to use or don't uncover in my
case<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.690> usually<00:01:04.049> end<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.890> covering<00:01:05.250> most

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
case I usually end up on covering most

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.730 
case I usually end up on covering most
of<00:01:05.700> them<00:01:05.880> you'll<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.330> these<00:01:06.540> spots<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
of them you'll see these spots here that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
of them you'll see these spots here that
are<00:01:07.860> marked<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:09.140> almost<00:01:10.140> like

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
are marked with this almost like

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
are marked with this almost like
starbursts<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.250> spot<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:12.510> cannot

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
starbursts that's a spot that you cannot

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.350 
starbursts that's a spot that you cannot
remove<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.430> live<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.850> with

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
remove so you have to live with with

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.660 
remove so you have to live with with
that<00:01:15.570> being<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.049> as<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.470> play<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.549> this

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that being there as you play so in this

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.630 
that being there as you play so in this
case<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.090> need<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.330> find<00:01:18.659> let's<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.950> piece<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
case I need to find let's see a piece to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.530 
case I need to find let's see a piece to
go<00:01:20.820> down<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:24.090> vertical

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
go down here like that and a vertical

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.070 
go down here like that and a vertical
piece<00:01:26.090> hopefully<00:01:27.090> they'll<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.720> here

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
piece hopefully they'll be one here

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.179 
piece hopefully they'll be one here
there<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:29.450> put<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> there<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> ran<00:01:32.009> out

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
there we go put that there now I ran out

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
there we go put that there now I ran out
of<00:01:32.220> time<00:01:32.490> however<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.900> play<00:01:34.079> this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
game either trying to go as quickly as

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.600 
game either trying to go as quickly as
possible<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:37.380> run<00:01:37.619> out<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.799> time<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.400> did

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
possible to not run out of time as I did

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.420 
possible to not run out of time as I did
or<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.479> play<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.750> strategically<00:01:40.430> trying

or you can play it strategically trying
to<00:01:41.670> make<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> pipe<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:42.869> long<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.409> possible<00:01:43.890> now

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
to make the pipe as long as possible now

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.190 
to make the pipe as long as possible now
it's<00:01:45.090> very<00:01:45.420> simple<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:45.899> very
