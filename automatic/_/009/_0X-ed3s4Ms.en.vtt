00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello again how could I just 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.359
 stand without my vidosikov on the whole 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.880
 week this would be like a pig 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.590
 my side no matter 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.470
 I 'm sick or not here you do not swear if 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.330
 there will be some kind of circumcision in these videos i 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:26.340
 cough I will try these fragments 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.269
 slaughtered well begin today we will 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.570
 pass a card with the name seen one 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.579
 this is an amateur card 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.420
 let 's begin 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.570
 I'm immediately confused by the flashing light from 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.910
 if it should be so than 1 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:50.820
 Find the wedge here used LED for 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.219
 for the light to burn indoors 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:01.410
 need to 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:10.830
 original so little chest lever wedge 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:16.470
 polytechnic so the second room became 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:20.780
 flashing light and again on the led what 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:25.009
 here the form of thrashing 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.409
 I think smack there 14 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.920
 I think he's out of two levers 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.030
 because what a lover will not 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:43.220
 make a normal combination lock for 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:52.640
 this card is not 23 '24 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:52.640
 So let's go further. Level is written here. 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:04.079
 as a lognyir block hey you can go out well 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.409
 don't know what's like a footman where are these doors 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.409
 lead 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:21.420
 as a tactician room 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:24.540
 pumpkin and stand and probably do not open 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:32.360
 what is it all for and dick knows 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.360
 text go further level you can enter 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.090
 primitive maze and evil fight now 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.090
 we will quickly go 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:57.470
 I silently thought that the main thing here 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:59.800
 concentrations so the escape route is two 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.800
 leverage 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:10.150
 what is it i think that one of them do 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:19.130
 some kind of nastiness 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:23.360
 this one will open the door and this one I thought so 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:31.430
 I knew and he opens this door which 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:39.319
 leads back there so it looks like 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 trap and what is he pumpkin 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:50.959
 we want to go up the stairs 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:58.730
 a continuation 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:04:05.780
 peaks in comments yoxley liked 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:12.230
 the painter in the group everything seems to be the end 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.880
 maps and probably on this all evaluate 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.729

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.739
 unsubscribe from me 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:26.030
 what is important for me subscribers but every 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.820
 the LED can be jumped perfectly as 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.120
 always bathing cow 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.120
