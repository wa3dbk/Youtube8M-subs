another<00:01:38.670> thing<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.689> smart

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
another thing we like about the smart

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
another thing we like about the smart
case<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.009> fact<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.700> does<00:01:41.939> not

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
case is the fact that it does not

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.590 
case is the fact that it does not
intrude<00:01:42.780> into<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.470> ipad<00:01:44.250> force<00:01:44.670> touchscreen

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
intrude into the ipad force touchscreen

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.260 
intrude into the ipad force touchscreen
interface<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.560> even<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.520> bezel<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
interface or even the bezel for that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.999 
interface or even the bezel for that
matter<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.049> lot<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.320> cases<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
matter and a lot of cases have a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.420 
matter and a lot of cases have a
tendency<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> overlap<00:01:51.600> onto<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.290> bezel<00:01:52.619> now

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
tendency to overlap onto the bezel now

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.969 
tendency to overlap onto the bezel now
one<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> features<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.200> smart<00:01:55.530> case

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
one of the features about the smart case

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.120 
one of the features about the smart case
is<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.000> fact<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.840> wake<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.439> iPad<00:01:58.860> up

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
is the fact that it can wake the iPad up

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.480 
is the fact that it can wake the iPad up
as<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.060> open<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.500> automatically<00:02:02.100> puts

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
as you open it and it automatically puts

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.719 
as you open it and it automatically puts
it<00:02:02.640> back<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.090> sleep<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.110> close<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.860> the
