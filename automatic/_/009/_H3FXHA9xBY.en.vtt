00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.160
 it seems that microsoft did not want to stay 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.320
 back on the topic of tec for health and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.900
 They launched their own measuring bracelet 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.180
 physical activity but it manages to highlight 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.250
 among the others as they are I am vanessa 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 hand orellana for cinema in Spanish and les 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.199
 I have the first look at the microsoft 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.210
 band in principles earns points because it is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.119
 of the few bracelets that is compatible 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.279
 with windows phones ios android and second 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.079
 because it has integrated gps and you 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.180
 you can take to running without the phone 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.520
 in between on the screen shows you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.649
 the distance the calories you burned and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.239
 your heart rate and when 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.520
 synchronized with the app shows you the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.500
 Complete travel on a map other 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.719
 Strength of the bracelet is the ease 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.640
 with which the pulse measures the monitor 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.860
 in itself it is not new but it is one of the few 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.020
 that brings it to the bottom of the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.239
 bracelet here the skin is thinner in 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.219
 the wrist and detect your pulse much more 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.109
 fast than other bracelets like the wiifit 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.629
 from samsung and the last feature 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.970
 what distinguishes it is the plans of 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.600
 exercise you can download a routine 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.700
 exercises 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.070
 of the mobile application on sites like 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.720
 monthly or safe you select the plan 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.729
 exercise that you want and then the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 active from the same bracelet the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.930
 screen tells you what movements to make and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 then vibrate when it's your turn to go to the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.399
 next repetition is an alternative 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.500
 practice not to walk with so much bulk 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.659
 in the gym in the rest is a 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.549
 pretty average bracelet is little 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.320
 attractive in appearance and not only because I 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.780
 it is huge in fact others are coming 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.610
 sizes but for the rigid and uncomfortable 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.710
 which is just like the fit has a 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.259
 full color and touch screen but the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.270
 difference is that this is not curved and not 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.850
 It adapts to the silhouette of your doll the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.399
 Via is easy to hold but it is rubber 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.990
 heavy and not very flexible on the screen 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.210
 the bracelet you can see the steps that you have 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.460
 given your dream your heart rate and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.409
 exercise sessions but also has 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.750
 certain functions of smart watch 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.600
 how to show you the time obviously and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.190
 receive notifications from your cell phone 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.140
 can read your text messages or see 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.390
 who is calling you but you can not 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.069
 answer and also synchronize with your 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.649
 calendar to remind you of your appointments 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.420
 The mobile application is simple but not 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.319
 intuitive and it takes time to synchronize with 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.269
 Bracelet 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.159
 shows you your activity history with 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.840
 the same windows phones interface without 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.999
 import the operating system in which 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.650
 you use another disadvantage is that the 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.109
 battery you hold just under two 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.510
 days and has a unique charger for this 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.790
 bracelet you can buy the band from the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.500
 Microsoft store for $ 200 and 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.510
 although it is not water resistant 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.609
 I endure a run during a flood 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.650
 so I do not think you have problems with 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.689
 sweat remember that you can see more about 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.969
