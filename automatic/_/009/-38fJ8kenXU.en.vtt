00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.550 
basic size is ten and a half by twelve
and<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> half<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.720> what<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.750> did<00:02:31.990> was<00:02:32.140> measured

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
and a half and what I did was measured

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.960 
and a half and what I did was measured
out<00:02:32.710> how<00:02:32.890> many<00:02:33.070> holes<00:02:33.310> they<00:02:33.490> needed<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.790> cut

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
out how many holes they needed to cut

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.860 
out how many holes they needed to cut
and<00:02:34.240> when<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.080> complete<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:37.420> pattern

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
and when this is complete the pattern

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.410 
and when this is complete the pattern
will<00:02:38.290> match<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.950> bottom<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.120> gets

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
will match the bottom and this gets

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.320 
will match the bottom and this gets
attached<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.590> bottom<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.880> makes<00:02:43.210> a

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
attached to the bottom of that makes a

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.590 
attached to the bottom of that makes a
cover<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.710> this<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.280> shoebox<00:02:45.730> itself<00:02:46.240> and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
cover and this is the shoebox itself and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.890 
cover and this is the shoebox itself and
as<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.620> see<00:02:47.860> on<00:02:48.070> this<00:02:48.280> corner<00:02:49.270> I've<00:02:49.480> already

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
as you see on this corner I've already

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.450 
as you see on this corner I've already
started<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.530> attach<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:52.450> side<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.220> rest

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
started to attach this side to the rest

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.480 
started to attach this side to the rest
and<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.030> made<00:02:55.240> different<00:02:55.690> patterns<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.590> each

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
and I made different patterns on each

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.140 
and I made different patterns on each
side<00:02:57.880> this<00:02:58.540> one<00:02:59.010> doesn't<00:03:00.010> take<00:03:00.190> as<00:03:00.370> long<00:03:00.400> some

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
side this one doesn't take as long some

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.700 
side this one doesn't take as long some
of<00:03:01.270> these<00:03:01.360> patterns<00:03:01.930> are<00:03:02.140> pretty

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
of these patterns are pretty

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.390 
of these patterns are pretty
time-consuming<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
time-consuming and but the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.030 
time-consuming and but the
time-consuming<00:03:07.030> part<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.720> very<00:03:08.350> rewarding

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
time-consuming part is very rewarding

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.260 
time-consuming part is very rewarding
it's<00:03:09.190> very<00:03:09.870> put<00:03:10.870> some<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.739> time<00:03:12.310> our

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
it's very put some of this time our

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.710 
it's very put some of this time our
personal<00:03:13.810> time<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:14.050> our<00:03:15.150> creative<00:03:16.150> touch<00:03:16.420> in

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
personal time and our creative touch in

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.790 
personal time and our creative touch in
the<00:03:16.900> making<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.320> shoebox<00:03:17.739> is<00:03:18.700> really

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
the making the shoebox is really

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.880 
the making the shoebox is really
beneficial<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.250> kids<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:22.120> gives<00:03:22.390> us

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
beneficial to the kids and it gives us

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.780 
beneficial to the kids and it gives us
something<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:23.980> do<00:03:24.160> in<00:03:24.250> our<00:03:24.340> free<00:03:24.489> time<00:03:24.580> like

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
something to do in our free time like

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.760 
something to do in our free time like
winners<00:03:25.270> that<00:03:25.570> are<00:03:25.720> watching<00:03:25.900> television<00:03:26.260> or

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
winners that are watching television or

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.720 
winners that are watching television or
something<00:03:28.050> so<00:03:29.050> basically<00:03:30.010> we've<00:03:30.280> gone<00:03:30.430> over

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
something so basically we've gone over

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.270 
something so basically we've gone over
the<00:03:30.820> steps<00:03:31.150> of<00:03:32.850> gathering<00:03:33.850> our<00:03:34.000> materials<00:03:34.600> and

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
the steps of gathering our materials and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.740 
the steps of gathering our materials and
choosing<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.370> stitch<00:03:36.610> pattern<00:03:37.090> make

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
choosing the stitch pattern make

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.230 
choosing the stitch pattern make
we<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.230> right<00:03:38.380> resources<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:42.120> doing<00:03:43.120> it

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
we have the right resources and doing it

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.480 
we have the right resources and doing it
for<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.480> right<00:03:43.600> reason<00:03:44.110> we<00:03:44.890> want<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.160> make<00:03:45.310> a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
for the right reason we want to make a

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.320 
for the right reason we want to make a
shoebox<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.720> benefit<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.200> child<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:48.670> doesn't

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
shoebox to benefit a child that doesn't

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.360 
shoebox to benefit a child that doesn't
have<00:03:49.600> an<00:03:49.840> assessment<00:03:50.200> doesn't<00:03:50.740> have<00:03:50.980> basic

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
have an assessment doesn't have basic

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.350 
have an assessment doesn't have basic
basic<00:03:52.360> needs<00:03:52.570> met<00:03:52.750> every<00:03:53.170> day<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:54.150> plus<00:03:55.150> it

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
basic needs met every day and plus it

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.310 
basic needs met every day and plus it
would<00:03:55.510> be<00:03:55.800> good<00:03:56.800> for<00:03:56.830> them<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:58.090> keep<00:03:58.300> for<00:03:59.290> a

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
would be good for them to keep for a

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.810 
would be good for them to keep for a
long<00:03:59.470> time<00:03:59.770> and<00:03:59.980> be<00:04:00.070> able<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.340> store<00:04:00.580> their

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
long time and be able to store their

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.820 
long time and be able to store their
things<00:04:01.120> in<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.770> I<00:04:04.170> think<00:04:05.170> this<00:04:05.500> would<00:04:05.650> be<00:04:05.680> a

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
things in and so I think this would be a

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.760 
things in and so I think this would be a
really<00:04:06.130> tangible<00:04:06.520> way<00:04:07.000> for<00:04:07.360> us<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.740> bless<00:04:08.740> a

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
really tangible way for us to bless a

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.640 
really tangible way for us to bless a
child<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:10.709> hopefully

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.440 

join<00:04:15.280> me<00:04:15.459> in<00:04:15.489> making<00:04:16.440> thanks
