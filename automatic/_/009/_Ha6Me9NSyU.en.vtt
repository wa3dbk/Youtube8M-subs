let's take a closer look and pump some

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.790 
let's take a closer look and pump some
signal<00:00:33.540> through<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.290> here's<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> phase

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
signal through it so here's the phase

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.590 
signal through it so here's the phase
plate<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> most<00:00:35.640> important<00:00:36.180> place<00:00:36.570> to

about<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.460> device<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.270> has<00:00:42.390> two

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
about this device is that it has two

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.619 
about this device is that it has two
routing<00:00:43.200> options<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.789> serial<00:00:44.789> routing<00:00:45.239> option

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
routing options a serial routing option

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.600 
routing options a serial routing option
which<00:00:46.140> means<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> left<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> right

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
which means that the left and right

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.150 
which means that the left and right
input<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.840> device<00:00:49.170> are<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> feed

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
input of this device are going to feed

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
input of this device are going to feed
both<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> effects<00:00:51.390> engines<00:00:51.960> inside<00:00:52.440> of

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
both of the effects engines inside of

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.119 
both of the effects engines inside of
this<00:00:52.710> guy

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
this guy

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
this guy
so<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.879> are<00:00:53.910> delay<00:00:54.390> effects<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.020> reverb

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
so there are delay effects and reverb

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.200 
so there are delay effects and reverb
effects<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.219> function<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.670> two<00:00:56.910> different

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
effects that function on two different

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.689 
effects that function on two different
engines<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.829> si<00:00:59.070> rail<00:00:59.250> routing

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
engines if you have si rail routing

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.340 
engines if you have si rail routing
whatever<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> plug<00:01:00.600> into<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> left<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
whatever you plug into the left and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.039 
whatever you plug into the left and
right<00:01:01.469> inputs<00:01:01.890> will<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.340> sent<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.000> both<00:01:03.629> delay

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
right inputs will be sent to both delay

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.109 
right inputs will be sent to both delay
engines<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.100> reverb<00:01:05.460> engine<00:01:05.790> they're

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.700 
engines and the reverb engine they're
both<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.659> delay<00:01:06.900> engine<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.439> reverb

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
both the delay engine and the reverb

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.000 
both the delay engine and the reverb
engine<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:09.240> select<00:01:09.930> dual<00:01:10.290> input<00:01:10.799> mode

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
send the left input to the delay effects

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.160 
send the left input to the delay effects
while<00:01:20.820> sending<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> right<00:01:21.509> input<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> the

while sending the right input to the
reverb<00:01:22.560> effects<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.280> those<00:01:24.090> two<00:01:24.390> will<00:01:24.720> share

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
reverb effects and those two will share

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.740 
reverb effects and those two will share
a<00:01:25.049> common<00:01:25.560> output<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.729> by<00:01:26.880> routing<00:01:27.240> these<00:01:27.540> two

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
a common output so by routing these two

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.210 
a common output so by routing these two
different<00:01:28.049> signals<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> two<00:01:28.890> effects

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
different signals to the two effects

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.330 
different signals to the two effects
engines<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.299> utilize<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.140> em<00:01:31.259> 350<00:01:31.920> as

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
engines you can utilize the em 350 as

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.580 
engines you can utilize the em 350 as
two<00:01:32.670> separate<00:01:33.119> effects<00:01:33.450> units<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> common

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
two separate effects units with a common

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.450 
two separate effects units with a common
output<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.240> let's<00:01:37.020> assume<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.070> were<00:01:38.280> in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
output so let's assume what we were in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.510 
output so let's assume what we were in
analog<00:01:39.000> mode<00:01:39.619> we<00:01:40.619> would<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> digital

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
analog mode we would not see a digital

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.840 
analog mode we would not see a digital
input<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:43.020> input<00:01:43.350> gain<00:01:43.829> simply<00:01:44.340> allows<00:01:44.610> us

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
input this input gain simply allows us

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.889 
input this input gain simply allows us
to<00:01:45.000> trim<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.689> analog<00:01:46.409> input<00:01:47.720> there's<00:01:48.720> an

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to trim the analog input there's an

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.310 
to trim the analog input there's an
SPDIF<00:01:49.439> input<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.490> selected<00:01:50.970> by<00:01:51.320> by

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
delay and the feedback of your preset or

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.040 
delay and the feedback of your preset or
they<00:02:56.610> could<00:02:56.760> also<00:02:56.790> control<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.600> threshold

they could also control the threshold
and<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.230> ratio<00:02:58.709> if<00:02:59.010> your<00:02:59.280> preset<00:02:59.700> happens<00:03:00.000> to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
and the ratio if your preset happens to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.750 
and the ratio if your preset happens to
be<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.330> compressor<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.890> what<00:03:02.250> I'm<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.520> do

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
be a compressor so what I'm going to do

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.000 
be a compressor so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:03.090> I'm<00:03:03.330> going<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.510> play<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.990> piano<00:03:04.650> track

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
is I'm going to play a piano track

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:22.849 
is I'm going to play a piano track
through<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.430> guy<00:03:05.670> dry

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.699 

okay<00:03:23.859> now<00:03:24.010> let's<00:03:24.250> check<00:03:24.519> out<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:25.709> same

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
okay now let's check out that same

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.880 
okay now let's check out that same
performance<00:03:27.599> with<00:03:28.599> a<00:03:28.629> bit<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:28.989> chorusing<00:03:29.709> so

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
performance with a bit of chorusing so

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.440 
performance with a bit of chorusing so
I'm<00:03:29.980> going<00:03:30.129> to<00:03:30.159> select<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.670> chorus<00:03:31.060> from<00:03:31.299> my

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
I'm going to select the chorus from my

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.899 
I'm going to select the chorus from my
first<00:03:31.689> delay<00:03:32.019> engine<00:03:32.439> and<00:03:32.730> I'm<00:03:33.730> going<00:03:33.879> to

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
first delay engine and I'm going to

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.550 
first delay engine and I'm going to
leave<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.269> delay<00:03:34.599> and<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.870> feedback<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.379> the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
leave the delay and the feedback of the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:55.500 
leave the delay and the feedback of the
chorus<00:03:35.889> normal<00:03:36.370> for<00:03:36.549> now<00:03:54.180> now<00:03:55.180> we<00:03:55.239> can

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
chorus normal for now now we can

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:14.839 
chorus normal for now now we can
increase<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.230> delay<00:03:56.500> time<00:04:06.120> now<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.359> phaser

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.770 

now<00:04:15.849> increase<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:17.910> time<00:04:18.910> parameter<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.690> the

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
now increase the time parameter of the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:45.670 
now increase the time parameter of the
phaser<00:04:30.060> any<00:04:31.060> benefit

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.479 

now<00:04:46.680> let's<00:04:46.949> try<00:04:47.160> out<00:04:47.250> their<00:04:47.789> slapback<00:04:48.419> delay
