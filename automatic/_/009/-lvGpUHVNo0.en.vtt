00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.590
 something that happened in the news magazine 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.660
 they talked about the best and the worst 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.210
 journalist and designated as worse 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.490
 journalist orlando barone place as 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.039
 the worst journalist because he disagrees 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.230
 with the position that he has, it seems to me 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.180
 a shameful punishment procedure 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.460
 that anyone can be a victim of 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.170
 actually I think I'm scared so 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.599
 that one day I can do the 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.150
 day they disagree and they do not like the 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.619
 position that one can get to sustain 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.800
 in the hard life attack that he received 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.379
 víctor hugo morals the news stage

 Victor hugo morals all because 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.309
 think differently a book written by 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.170
 two Uruguayan journalists who show 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.049
 clearly what could be called the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.960
 happy coexistence of víctor hugo with the 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.670
 Uruguayan dictatorship linking inside 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.220

 weeks in a barracks that had 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.310
 become a concentration camp 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.070
 disproportionate 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.470
 a means machinery to denounce 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.030
 a fact that a priori is not that 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.530
 they reported that there are witnesses 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.329
 face-to-face that víctor hugo saw 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.820
 tortures in a clandestine center

 old military all they have are 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.450
 those two soccer games two Saturdays 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.429

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.439

 are those two football matches 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.869
 normally those who report this type 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.360
 of things are those who suffered it here 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.899

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.709

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.630

 wanted in some way is to leave you 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.260
 thinking if in the depths of your heart 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.450
 there is a suspicion the grandmothers who are 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.519
 waiting for some of the stories can 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.600
 have to do with one 's own as was the 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.480
 yours pray in the middle of last year 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.580
 for a talk that my mom had

 raising with my girlfriend I dropped the tab 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.510
 let's say of the doubt that I had during 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.360
 all adolescence and afterwards it was 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.030
 one thing that we had grandma TV 25 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.460
 years giving voice to stella in the past 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.100
 let's say the program what it did was 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.910
 animal but nothing says that all 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.350
 appropriate kids intuit that they are 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.690

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.060
 the connection of víctor hugo morals 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.860
 without the Uruguayan military dictatorship that 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.400
 know all fears 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.300
 after knowing the identity all 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.040

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.219
 Victor Hugo is worth only what he 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.859
 counted horacio that someone has 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:49.439
 mobilized to such a point that 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.060
 convinced a young man to seek his 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.280
 Identity I think that already with that you are 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.170
 made in the case of cream is rare that 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.959

 claimed by cecilia pando 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.939
 Very good background the cream program 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.290

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:30.840
 the 76 faces of the 76 jorge rafael videla 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.520
 an example is just kind are next 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.590
 of the wing so far and something more Greek 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.660
 that was nothing víctor hugo those angles were 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.310
 imagine the same boat 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.169
 now it turns out that there was one that got off 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.759
 of the ship let's first listen to a 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.440
 notice and then we greet you to courts 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.430
 with an approval of the new law of 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.070
 media k 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.690
 several channels can disappear tn is 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.530
 one of them 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:56.730
 All of us will have news 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.190
 a hug good day listen really me 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.960
 It seemed incredible because looking for 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.360
 missing word in argentina is 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.710
 neutral menéndez is heavy experience and 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.180
 there is a time when Greece was 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.180
 during the dictatorship or that a 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.700
 incredible cynicism of fair advertising 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.290
 they speak of missing persons when they signed a 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.780
 newspaper that was dedicated not to mention 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.970
 missing for ten years foosball 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.580
 and the people why do you think that of all 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.120
 ways in a good percentage because 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.280
 will be so on the side of declaring 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.290
 avoided there is something that is technically 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.270
 it would be called dominant speech that 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.580
 exists and one can not refuse in various 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.300
 dominant discourse that exists and one does not 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:40.260
 can that perspective have to say 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.240
 that there are changes you will ask 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.740
 why he never talked about the cream that both 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.470
 it takes care of me and the truth is that what 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.710
 I admire and it's hard for me to fight with them 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.050
 know what is today the cream 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.120
 world the magnet falls apart and this 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.460
 they say that Argentina is a fire and 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.590
 she does not know how many minutes 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.180
 as if it was something important has 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.250
 manitos close every day forever 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.740
 ask him to maniató how it was that he 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.810
 I gave the general hen letter to the chief of 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.760
 the torturers before the torture of 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.500
 the papaleo has it there served in 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.600
 tray because he does not ask him little hand 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.820
 the truth that in him he sends you of these 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.310
 last three years each one chose his 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.710
 way with the madness of the media law 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.660
 from now on we all have taken the 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.690
 I was touched by the role assigned to me 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.540
 better than any role compared to the 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.580
 wonder of choosing a magnetto is like that 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.530
 which is an interesting twist 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.510
 that nobody expected you are giving the 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.120
 life by hand and you what you ask 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.310
 many press workers 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.340
 what happens if you come víctor hugo to your 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.600
 writing to your assembly the answer of 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.700
 the majority is going to be that it's going to be 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.860
 received with a hug and with applause 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.169
 and if I'm going to ask the same thing about 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.330
 you will receive the answer that 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.000
 he's going to be crazy and he's going to be disowned and 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.760
 that is the difference in our 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.010
 about víctor hugo and about this effort 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.010
 called the cream when 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.139
 It was an empty space 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.620
 and can not fill it 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:19.319
 arturo friends 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.319
 when a friend leaves 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.540
 for you 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.210
 faith illuminates the place
