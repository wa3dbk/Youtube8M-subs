from<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.640> know<00:02:07.730> I<00:02:07.940> did<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:10.040> says<00:02:10.640> just

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
from that I know I did so it says just

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.020 
from that I know I did so it says just
drop<00:02:11.180> one<00:02:11.540> tablet<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:12.290> eight<00:02:13.010> ounces<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.760> water

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
drop one tablet in eight ounces of water

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.330

servings<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.850> day

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
servings a day

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.840 
servings a day
I<00:02:17.240> only<00:02:17.930> take<00:02:18.200> one<00:02:18.470> serving<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.100> day<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.610> I

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
I only take one serving the day and I

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.330 
I only take one serving the day and I
actually<00:02:20.060> put<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.510> in<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.930> 16-ounce<00:02:21.650> bottle<00:02:22.130> of

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
actually put it in a 16-ounce bottle of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.430 
actually put it in a 16-ounce bottle of
water<00:02:22.550> because<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.570> actually<00:02:24.080> pretty

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
water because it's actually pretty

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.270 
water because it's actually pretty
strong<00:02:24.740> taste

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
strong taste

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.450 
strong taste
I<00:02:25.310> don't<00:02:25.550> like<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.850> really<00:02:26.360> strong<00:02:26.870> taste<00:02:27.830> I

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
I don't like a really strong taste I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.070 
I don't like a really strong taste I
started<00:02:29.180> drinking<00:02:29.300> this<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> morning

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
started drinking this in the morning

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.740 
started drinking this in the morning
instead<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.440> coffee<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.850> drink<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.330> pretty

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
instead of coffee and I drink it pretty

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.080 
instead of coffee and I drink it pretty
much<00:02:32.960> throughout<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.530> day<00:02:33.860> until<00:02:34.640> like<00:02:34.880> 2:00

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
much throughout the day until like 2:00

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.080 
much throughout the day until like 2:00
2:00<00:02:35.780> o'clock<00:02:35.900> because<00:02:36.580> like<00:02:37.580> once<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.910> gets

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
2:00 o'clock because like once it gets

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.110 
2:00 o'clock because like once it gets
down<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.959> put<00:02:39.860> more<00:02:40.010> water<00:02:40.190> in<00:02:40.400> here<00:02:40.700> so

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
down to here I put more water in here so

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.930 
down to here I put more water in here so
I'm<00:02:41.480> still<00:02:41.990> it's<00:02:42.860> still<00:02:43.220> yellow<00:02:43.459> like<00:02:43.910> a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
I'm still it's still yellow like a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.040 
I'm still it's still yellow like a
lighter<00:02:44.209> yellow<00:02:44.600> around<00:02:45.470> lunchtime<00:02:45.800> and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
lighter yellow around lunchtime and

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.770 
lighter yellow around lunchtime and
sometimes<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.200> drink<00:02:48.440> water<00:02:48.650> at<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.160> same<00:02:49.370> time

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
sometimes I drink water at the same time

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.390 
sometimes I drink water at the same time
so<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.810> guess<00:02:51.290> I'm<00:02:51.470> kind<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.800> constantly

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
so I guess I'm kind of constantly

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.970 
so I guess I'm kind of constantly
putting<00:02:53.240> some<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.840> lift-off<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.590> my<00:02:54.740> body

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980

it and I don't drink any more of it

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.060
