00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hi peeps just another little video to

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.800 
hi peeps just another little video to
show<00:00:02.460> you<00:00:02.490> how<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.879> connect<00:00:03.389> up<00:00:03.600> you've

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
show you how to connect up you've

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.309 
show you how to connect up you've
dropped<00:00:04.020> feeder<00:00:04.319> wires<00:00:05.240> to<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.480> bus<00:00:06.990> lines

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
dropped feeder wires to the bus lines

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.190 
dropped feeder wires to the bus lines
just<00:00:07.799> here<00:00:08.420> you<00:00:09.420> need<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.750> connect<00:00:10.019> them<00:00:10.080> all

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
just here you need to connect them all

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.839 
just here you need to connect them all
up<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.469> course<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.860> get<00:00:10.980> signal<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.610> track

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
up of course to get signal to the track

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.030 
up of course to get signal to the track
the<00:00:12.840> reason<00:00:13.139> we've<00:00:13.259> got<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.590> many<00:00:13.650> feet<00:00:13.920> of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the reason we've got so many feet of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.350 
the reason we've got so many feet of
wires<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.639> fact<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:14.910> we're<00:00:15.089> running<00:00:15.179> a

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
wires is the fact that we're running a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.859 
wires is the fact that we're running a
DCC<00:00:16.070> circuit<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.449> understand

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
DCC circuit and that we we understand

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.029 
DCC circuit and that we we understand
that<00:00:18.990> there's<00:00:19.170> going<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.350> be<00:00:19.439> issues<00:00:19.619> with

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
that there's going to be issues with

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.120 
that there's going to be issues with
your<00:00:20.699> fish<00:00:20.910> plates<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.710> resistance<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.949> them

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
your fish plates and resistance to them

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.980 
your fish plates and resistance to them
and<00:00:23.400> rather<00:00:23.880> than<00:00:24.029> us<00:00:24.180> having<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.570> drill<00:00:24.779> holes

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
and rather than us having to drill holes

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.109 
and rather than us having to drill holes
once<00:00:25.230> we've<00:00:25.439> got<00:00:25.680> sort<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.430> everything<00:00:26.820> in

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
once we've got sort of everything in

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.910 
once we've got sort of everything in
place<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.840> only<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.289> bottom<00:00:28.529> siding

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
place this is only the bottom siding

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.019 
place this is only the bottom siding
sort<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.250> things<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> be

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
sort of things this is going to be

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.609 
sort of things this is going to be
hidden<00:00:30.240> out<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.199> gonna<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.410> hard

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
hidden out of you so it's gonna be hard

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.750 
hidden out of you so it's gonna be hard
to<00:00:31.679> us<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.980> get<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.340> would<00:00:33.090> much<00:00:33.270> rather<00:00:34.760> feed

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
to us to get to would much rather feed

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.200 
to us to get to would much rather feed
and<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.989> every<00:00:37.469> single<00:00:37.920> piece<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.850> track

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and and have every single piece of track

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.260 
and and have every single piece of track
every<00:00:40.200> port<00:00:40.469> every<00:00:40.980> point<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.700> everything

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
every port every point and everything

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.869 
every port every point and everything
like<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.450> connected<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.920> bus<00:00:44.579> lines

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
like that connected to the the bus lines

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
like that connected to the the bus lines
to<00:00:45.210> make<00:00:45.329> sure<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> quality<00:00:46.170> signal<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to make sure we get a quality signal and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.319 
to make sure we get a quality signal and
we<00:00:46.950> don't<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.309> any<00:00:47.489> tracks<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.059> could<00:00:48.210> become

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
we don't have any tracks it could become

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.869 
we don't have any tracks it could become
stranded<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> line<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.039> make<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> very

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
stranded on the line and make it very

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
stranded on the line and make it very
hard<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.239> us<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.840> we're<00:00:52.530> connecting

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
hard for us to get to we're connecting

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.549 
hard for us to get to we're connecting
up<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.730> feeders<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.270> which<00:00:54.629> run<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
up these feeders here which run to the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.529 
up these feeders here which run to the
piece<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.920> track<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> yellow<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.969> them

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
piece of track with the yellow on them

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.760 
piece of track with the yellow on them
there<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.870> course<00:01:01.020> they're<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.530> fed

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
there so that of course they're all fed

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.579 
there so that of course they're all fed
and<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:03.210> will<00:01:03.359> work<00:01:03.510> ok<00:01:03.930> it's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and that they all they will work ok it's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.830 
and that they all they will work ok it's
pretty<00:01:04.830> easy<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:05.610> using<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.270> few<00:01:06.689> little

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
pretty easy to do I'm using a few little

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200 
pretty easy to do I'm using a few little
tools<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:07.950> using<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.939> course

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
tools just to do it I'm using of course

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.960 
tools just to do it I'm using of course
the<00:01:09.330> soldering<00:01:09.659> oil<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.170> need<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:11.640> flux

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the soldering oil which I need that flux

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.820 
the soldering oil which I need that flux
which<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.900> white<00:01:13.080> metal<00:01:13.380> flux<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.740> we

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
which is it's white metal flux that we

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.109 
which is it's white metal flux that we
use<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.850> we've<00:01:14.970> got

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
use in here but it's what we've got

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.120 
use in here but it's what we've got
available<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> us<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.200> works<00:01:16.409> perfectly

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
available to us and it works perfectly

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
available to us and it works perfectly
the<00:01:17.610> main<00:01:17.850> reason<00:01:18.090> we've<00:01:18.240> got<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the main reason we've got this is the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.469 
the main reason we've got this is the
fact<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.140> we're<00:01:19.860> working<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.400> some<00:01:20.880> locos<00:01:21.270> as

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
fact that we're working on some locos as

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.690 
fact that we're working on some locos as
well<00:01:21.630> which<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.020> white<00:01:22.200> metal<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.430> it's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
well which are in white metal so if it's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.920 
well which are in white metal so if it's
just<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.000> best<00:01:24.150> thing<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.390> us<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> use<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
just the best thing for us to use of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.620 
just the best thing for us to use of
course<00:01:24.960> yeah<00:01:25.560> solder<00:01:26.549> they're<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.299> standard

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
course yeah solder they're just standard

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870 
course yeah solder they're just standard
solder<00:01:27.990> some<00:01:28.439> cutters<00:01:29.009> there<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.610> are<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
solder some cutters there which are just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.090 
solder some cutters there which are just
really<00:01:30.689> good<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.439> we've<00:01:31.710> got<00:01:31.920> on

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
really good to use because we've got on

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.490 
really good to use because we've got on
the<00:01:32.220> bus<00:01:32.340> y<00:01:32.579> 1.5<00:01:33.270> mil<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.200> makes<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the bus y 1.5 mil it just makes it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.380 
the bus y 1.5 mil it just makes it
really<00:01:34.650> simple<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> easy<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.460> use<00:01:35.490> some

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
really simple and easy to use some

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.520 
really simple and easy to use some
cutters<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.850> 0.2<00:01:38.850> mil<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:40.259> just

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
cutters just for the 0.2 mil to just

and as simple as possible we're gonna

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.300 
and as simple as possible we're gonna
try<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.010> use<00:02:36.070> red<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.550> black<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:37.570> all<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:38.080> our

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
try and use red and black for all of our

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.980 
try and use red and black for all of our
powering<00:02:39.310> for<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.670> track<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.180> know<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:40.900> not

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
powering for the track I know it's not

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.090 
powering for the track I know it's not
going<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.200> be<00:02:41.260> achievable<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.980> way

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
going to be achievable all the way

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.380 
going to be achievable all the way
around<00:02:42.310> because<00:02:42.640> we<00:02:42.760> are<00:02:42.880> running<00:02:43.090> out<00:02:43.360> of

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
around because we are running out of

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.360 
around because we are running out of
wire<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.740> we<00:02:44.740> are<00:02:44.860> gonna<00:02:44.950> have<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.190> go<00:02:45.310> to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
wire and we are gonna have to go to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.860 
wire and we are gonna have to go to
brown<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.730> blue<00:02:45.850> because<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.360> can't<00:02:46.720> find

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
brown and blue because I can't find

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.780 
brown and blue because I can't find
anywhere<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.710> do<00:02:48.330> black<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.540> red<00:02:49.720> cable<00:02:50.790> in

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
anywhere and do black and red cable in

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.400 
anywhere and do black and red cable in
pointy<00:02:52.210> mill<00:02:52.450> at<00:02:52.810> least<00:02:53.050> because<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.010> EU<00:02:54.370> law

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
pointy mill at least because of EU law

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.810 
pointy mill at least because of EU law
so<00:02:56.410> as<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.040> see<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.340> we've<00:02:57.430> got<00:02:57.550> four

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
so as you see that we've got four

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.360 
so as you see that we've got four
connectors<00:02:58.510> there<00:02:58.930> before<00:02:59.709> dropper<00:02:59.980> feet

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
connectors there before dropper feet

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.760 
connectors there before dropper feet
which<00:03:01.000> need<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.300> go<00:03:01.420> into<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.500> what<00:03:02.709> I'm

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
cutters there for the the bus cable it

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.360 
cutters there for the the bus cable it
doesn't<00:03:12.910> need<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.120> be<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.239> big<00:03:14.160> I've<00:03:15.160> seen

I<00:03:39.730> want<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:39.970> trim<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.420> can<00:03:40.690> actually<00:03:40.810> curl

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
I want to trim so I can actually curl

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.060 
I want to trim so I can actually curl
the<00:03:42.459> cut<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:42.940> cable<00:03:43.480> round<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.860> wire

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
the cut of the cable round the the wire

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.360 
the cut of the cable round the the wire
to<00:03:45.430> make<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.850> little<00:03:46.120> bit<00:03:46.300> easier<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:47.370> cut

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
to make it a little bit easier so cut

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.120 
to make it a little bit easier so cut
the<00:03:48.459> more<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.700> same<00:03:48.880> length<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.860> just<00:03:50.860> need<00:03:51.010> to

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
the more the same length I just need to

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.750 
the more the same length I just need to
trim<00:03:51.370> up<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:52.830> make<00:03:53.830> them<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:54.519> can

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
trim up and make them so that I can

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.190 
trim up and make them so that I can
actually<00:03:55.090> see<00:03:55.600> why<00:03:55.810> now<00:03:56.080> so<00:03:56.140> just<00:03:56.830> strip<00:03:57.519> them

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
actually see why now so just strip them

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.170 
actually see why now so just strip them
quickly

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:20.819 

three<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.920> four

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.190 

then<00:04:21.829> just<00:04:22.070> twist<00:04:22.310> them<00:04:22.580> round<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:23.180> copper<00:04:23.540> so

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
then just twist them round the copper so

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.750 
then just twist them round the copper so
that<00:04:24.320> they<00:04:24.440> stay<00:04:24.830> on<00:04:25.070> there<00:04:25.340> without<00:04:25.490> you

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
that they stay on there without you

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.220 
that they stay on there without you
having<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.090> touch<00:04:26.419> them<00:04:26.660> I'll<00:04:26.780> keep<00:04:26.930> hold<00:04:27.139> of

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
having to touch them I'll keep hold of

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.170 
having to touch them I'll keep hold of
them<00:04:27.490> because<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.669> fact<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:29.000> that

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
them because of the fact that that

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.150 
them because of the fact that that
course<00:04:29.630> soldering<00:04:30.050> them<00:04:30.200> as<00:04:30.560> much<00:04:30.740> they<00:04:30.950> think

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
course soldering them as much they think

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.090 
course soldering them as much they think
rather<00:04:31.430> than<00:04:31.639> using<00:04:32.620> connector<00:04:33.620> blocks<00:04:33.830> which

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
rather than using connector blocks which

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.280 
rather than using connector blocks which
if<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.790> don't<00:04:35.000> like<00:04:35.210> solder<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.600> you<00:04:35.660> can<00:04:35.840> use

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.540 

just<00:04:39.290> twist<00:04:39.620> them<00:04:39.740> around<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:40.160> they<00:04:40.190> stay<00:04:40.490> in

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
just twist them around so they stay in

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.250 
just twist them around so they stay in
place<00:04:40.639> and<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.450> just<00:04:41.480> makes<00:04:41.810> them<00:04:41.930> slightly

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
place and it just makes them slightly

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.430 
place and it just makes them slightly
easier<00:04:43.389> probably<00:04:44.389> cut<00:04:44.570> that<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.750> bit<00:04:44.990> too<00:04:45.200> big

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
easier probably cut that a bit too big

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.900 
easier probably cut that a bit too big
to<00:04:45.710> be<00:04:45.740> truthful<00:04:46.100> but<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.370> doesn't<00:04:46.700> make<00:04:46.790> any

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
to be truthful but it doesn't make any

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.129 
to be truthful but it doesn't make any
difference<00:04:47.000> it's<00:04:47.510> not<00:04:47.570> going<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.840> be<00:04:47.900> anything

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
difference it's not going to be anything

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.420 
difference it's not going to be anything
that's<00:04:48.410> going<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.560> go<00:04:48.710> in<00:04:48.800> contact<00:04:49.190> with<00:04:49.310> it

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
that's going to go in contact with it

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.120 
that's going to go in contact with it
and<00:04:49.580> if<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.389> if<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:51.200> are<00:04:51.229> an<00:04:51.500> authority<00:04:51.590> could

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
and if you if you are an authority could

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.469 
and if you if you are an authority could
use<00:04:52.340> some<00:04:54.639> electrical<00:04:55.639> tape<00:04:55.669> just<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.120> wrap<00:04:56.300> it

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
use some electrical tape just to wrap it

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.770 
use some electrical tape just to wrap it
up<00:04:57.760> what<00:04:58.760> I'm<00:04:58.880> using<00:04:59.060> this<00:04:59.240> just<00:04:59.389> putting<00:04:59.630> some
