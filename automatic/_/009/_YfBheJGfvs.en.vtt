00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.330
 Hello everyone and welcome to the special 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.010
 10,000 subscribers right you are 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.629
 the first one was a special and not 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.459
 are very clear about what to do or that 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.199
 say but in the end it occurs to me to do 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.760
 a small video in which I counted more or 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.680
 less how I started with all this from 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.450
 youtube so you can know me a little bit 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.430
 more the first thing I wanted to say is that 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.080
 I am very surprised by the large amount 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.240
 of people who follow me in such a short time 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.300
 because although it is true that this channel 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.070
 is about 34 years old, only six are missing 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.289
 months when I took it back when it did not arrive 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.550
 nor to the thousand subscribers I also have 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.350
 to say that this has not been my first 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.659
 channel let alone my first channel I 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.760
 I did it with about 11 years old when I started 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.440
 use the computer and what was in 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.659
 youtube basically back then 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.429
 they were videos of kittens people falling 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.249
 I do not know anything compared to what there is 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.719
 now that I was going to my channel because 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.879
 truth is that today we still do not 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.469
 I have very clear were videos too 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.049
 random as to pigeonhole the 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.809
 some thematic to made with the shabby 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.699
 maker with two huge stripes at both 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.920
 sides that reduce the video size of 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.630
 bestial way bad cartoon videos 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.909
 Facial events master of history games 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.369
 directly from the removed the TV 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.710
 like ruby ​​pokemon and mariola not super 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.680
 smash bros plays with 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 puppets or even then painted 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.090
 counting your fucking life I'm going to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.179
 tell you my stupid life as you can 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.590
 see if I'm here doing the grace 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:33.550
 good 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.030
 here I'm going to launch in this valley 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.030
 Y 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.830
 without comments the fact is that I would 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.750
 I had a great time doing the idiot and 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.570
 thousands of people could come to my channel 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.290
 to give me dislike to comment that to me 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.270
 it did not matter 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.220
 after that I also made a forum to 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.750
 that I called because Estean and a channel 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.910
 youtube with the same name for 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.100
 forum news the truth is that that 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.710
 was the function that this channel had was 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.480
 one more supplement of the forum but little to 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.480
 little was letting people enter the 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.640
 forum and fell into oblivion opened a new 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.350
 channel that many of you may know and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.390
 others not with the same name that I have 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.400
 on twitter mica cookies in order to 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.100
 start doing a blog or something like that 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.930
 but I was not too good at it and 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.890
 I ended up changing a bit of the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.890
 main theme 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.180
 I also wanted to tell you a little about 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.920
 process that I follow for the creation of a 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.959
 video and the effort that brings me to 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.910
 do it because it's not as easy as 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.770
 many people believe I have received comments 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.600
 that have led me to think that there 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.090
 people who believe that videos are made 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.950
 alone or something like that is to come snap 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.260
 the fingers and automatically appears in 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.989
 the channel as if by magic and not 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.970
 I wish personally at the time of 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.069
 make a video the first thing I do is 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.840
 a guide I'm a person that I do not know 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.489
 It's very good to improvise and I need 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.140
 have a script more or less what 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.300
 I mean for the videos in which 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.310
 I tell curiosities about pokemon or explain 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.320
 things that not many people know first 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.390
 I need to inform myself I 'm looking for different 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.640
 websites to contrast what I find in 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.709
 each other and then I make my own 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.600
 report in a word introducing what 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.280
 developing it and concluding what 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.840
 I reread again and again to see if he has 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.030
 committed some mistake or to avoid 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.980
 repeat the same words once 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.050
 done that happened to read it something that also 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.209
 it costs me I repeat many times the 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.310
 same phrases and I got confused I did not 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.290
 like the intonation of position and after 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.480
 eliminated the parts that serve us in addition 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.870
 like my microphone is pretty bad and the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.549
 listen out 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.560
 loud and clear enough that I 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.989
 I would like to put filters 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.549
 amplify put some effects and 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.379
 remove the background noise something that 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.480
 it does not take too much time either 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.849
 that there is after comes the edition 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.709
 of the video I use qantas and I study for 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.720
 those who want to know that although not 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.310
 be as professional as sony vegas a 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.409
 I like it and I find it very comfortable 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.450
 I charge the necessary files as 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.670
 can be the intro the other or the image 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.769
 that I use background etcetera and started to 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.209
 listen to the audio again looking for and 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.099
 adding the images that I think 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.690
 necessary is to put this is the part that 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.239
 longer it takes me and that sometimes 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.890
 does it 's a bit heavy finally placed 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.390
 some background song reducing the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.760
 volume so it does not interfere with my 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.139
 voice and they achieve derivation I finally get 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.150
 make the miniature that is my part 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.620
 favorite and upload it to youtube and good 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.940
 now that you know the process that takes 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.979
 make a video I hope you have a 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.570
 little bit of patience and consideration with 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.490
 the people that we employ our 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.930
 time in this that is fun for 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.850
 course if I was not doing it 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.630
 but sometimes it becomes a bit 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.370
 exhausting 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.840
 to tell the truth, making videos is something that 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.639
 I've always liked doing it 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.650
 from very young even before having 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.930
 computer 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.759
 videos with my neighbor riding our 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.759
 own movies with some dolls 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.140
 that's why it's no coincidence that now 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.030
 past time be here doing this 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.950
 I think if you really like to do 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.900
 something you should not stop doing it for 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.000
 very ridiculous absurd to see it the 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.710
 others after all, what are the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.930
 opinions of others and because they should 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.220
 matter and well I do not have much more 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.290
 what to say I hope to be here for 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.060
 much more time doing a while 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.070
 fun as long as I have fun 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.450
 I also clear many thanks to 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.310
 all of you who are here supporting the 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.290
 channel and good nothing else I do not want 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.290
 put girl until the next video
