00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
I've been running at 82 for a year now

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.620 
I've been running at 82 for a year now
and<00:01:18.460> no<00:01:19.360> problems<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.110> it's<00:01:20.350> brushed<00:01:20.799> only

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and no problems and it's brushed only

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.300 
and no problems and it's brushed only
but<00:01:22.630> still<00:01:22.930> on<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.350> reef<00:01:23.560> I<00:01:23.770> don't<00:01:24.009> see<00:01:24.159> myself

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
but still on the reef I don't see myself

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.850 
but still on the reef I don't see myself
putting<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:25.000> Mambo<00:01:25.360> number<00:01:25.930> max<00:01:26.350> or<00:01:26.590> something

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
putting a Mambo number max or something

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.989 
putting a Mambo number max or something
like<00:01:27.900> 5700<00:01:28.900> kV<00:01:29.380> that<00:01:29.649> would<00:01:29.770> be<00:01:29.890> sick<00:01:30.189> doesn't

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
like 5700 kV that would be sick doesn't

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.810 
like 5700 kV that would be sick doesn't
doesn't<00:01:31.840> even<00:01:32.079> work<00:01:32.409> because<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.670> rate

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
doesn't even work because the the rate

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.239 
doesn't even work because the the rate
that's<00:01:33.999> like<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> grasshopper

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
that's like a grasshopper

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:38.099 
that's like a grasshopper
boom-boom-boom-boom<00:01:36.399> so<00:01:36.969> I<00:01:36.999> need<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.659> figure

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
boom-boom-boom-boom so I need to figure

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.550 
boom-boom-boom-boom so I need to figure
out<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.380> way<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.799> counter<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.789> thing<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.560> even

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
out a way to counter that thing and even

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.200 
out a way to counter that thing and even
though<00:01:41.679> it's<00:01:41.829> a<00:01:41.950> rock<00:01:42.130> racer<00:01:42.670> I<00:01:42.700> don't<00:01:43.030> see

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
though it's a rock racer I don't see

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.499 
though it's a rock racer I don't see
myself<00:01:43.359> using<00:01:43.869> another<00:01:44.289> system<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:46.119> brushed

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
myself using another system then brushed

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.289 
myself using another system then brushed
because<00:01:47.289> it<00:01:47.409> needs<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.740> be<00:01:47.920> slow<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.759> be<00:01:49.119> able

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
because it needs to be slow to be able

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.219 
because it needs to be slow to be able
