00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.480
 hello friends welcome to the channel 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.049
 mechanical review the channel where we 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:15.609
 like to show them Asian cars and in 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:19.020
 this case is an asian umissa armed 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:21.670
 in Mexico, so I want to show you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.610
 some component parts 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.970
 and let's start with the train 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.680
 butt the butt is very similar very 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.879
 similar in most of those who have 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:39.370
 rigid shaft with high shock absorber that 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:42.399
 let's go telescopic player and spiral one 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.059
 for the right side and the left side 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.350
 the same story after entity has 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.350
 drum brakes 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:57.000
 It comes with alloy wheels 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.250
 I will also tell you that your tank 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.290
 of fuel is plastic 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.290
 like many other brands 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.530
 and good in the plastic tank some 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.690
 manufacturers say it's better than the one in 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.330
 steel because in case of accident not 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.770
 sparks and then minimize the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.210
 rivers 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.210
 The exhaust pipe 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.280
 next to me 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.850
 that does not heat the fuels 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.920
 the same as 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.049
 this isolated with respect to the floor of the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.049
 car have a grandmother protection 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.200
 the exhaust pipe travel 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.510
 from both sides this that we are 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.840
 seeing here is the second catalyst and 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.159
 the first catalyst we see there that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.430
 it is well close to the multiple 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.250
 of escape that you can see here 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.370
 so we are here I will comment 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:02.660
 the engine is entirely the aluminum 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.490
 blog and the crankcase and its lid deciding on 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.410
 this case here what we are seeing is 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.110
 my automatic sanctity 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.500
 and the automatic box 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.160
 and the front train 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.620
 comes with mac person like most of 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.150
 the cars 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.090
 today 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.160
 and good at the bottom has its 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.800
 frame with the kneecap 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.800
 it has two bushings the good bushings 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.400
 false source that links it to the body 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.400
 this comes with a stringer 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.470
 with so much it's a bit short compared to 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.799
 our cars that we have seen comes with 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.150
 good protection against gravel and with 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.760
 some missing because here by 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.519
 example against him the bass opal here not 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.210
 has nothing here comes unprotected to 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.090
 same as 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.520
 this other part although you can think 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.750
 that here is not necessary but good is 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.200
 painted to the edge 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.099
 Y 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.150
 and the other to show is that neither 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.769
 it brings motor protection comes in a 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.920
 plastic that more than anything has been for 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.400
 that did not get dirty we made the least 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.400
 possible
