00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.419 
going to continue my level and so I will
create<00:00:24.449> an<00:00:24.929> elevator<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:26.070> will<00:00:26.189> come<00:00:26.400> down

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
pretty much the same setup as with the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.290 
pretty much the same setup as with the
door<00:00:34.730> but<00:00:35.780> instead<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.840> having<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.590> trigger

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
sending it down and a trigger sending it

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.410 
sending it down and a trigger sending it
up<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.400> will<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.390> create

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.500 

an<00:00:45.480> animation<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.670> goes<00:00:47.670> down<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.059> waits

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
an animation that goes down and waits

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.210 
an animation that goes down and waits
for<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.050> little<00:00:49.350> bit<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:49.829> goes<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.280> again

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
for a little bit and then goes up again

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.440 
for a little bit and then goes up again
just<00:00:53.220> to<00:00:53.309> give<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.610> an<00:00:53.699> idea<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.360> know

this way I have a really good overview
of<00:02:59.330> the<00:03:00.330> path

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
of the path

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:11.070

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:35.040 

say<00:04:28.020> ball<00:04:28.289> yes<00:04:29.090> close<00:04:30.090> it

you know

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.870 
you know
then<00:04:45.689> it's<00:04:45.870> time<00:04:46.050> for<00:04:46.110> blueprints

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
then it's time for blueprints

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.500 
then it's time for blueprints
set<00:04:48.510> it<00:04:48.630> up

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.760 

that<00:04:55.410> will<00:04:55.560> start<00:04:55.800> with<00:04:56.100> taking<00:04:56.640> the<00:04:56.820> box

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
that will start with taking the box

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.240 
that will start with taking the box
trigger<00:04:58.970> if<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.150> can<00:05:00.420> get<00:05:00.870> it

trigger if I can get it

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.430 
trigger if I can get it
there<00:05:02.760> we<00:05:02.880> go<00:05:03.240> right-click<00:05:03.720> in<00:05:03.930> blueprints

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
there we go right-click in blueprints

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.890 
there we go right-click in blueprints
and<00:05:05.420> event<00:05:06.420> for<00:05:06.660> trigger<00:05:06.900> box<00:05:07.250> collision<00:05:08.250> and

on actor begin overlap like that and

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.360 
on actor begin overlap like that and
then<00:05:16.140> find<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:17.720> matinee<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.040> when<00:05:20.040> you<00:05:20.190> have

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
then find the matinee and when you have

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.100 
then find the matinee and when you have
a<00:05:20.430> really<00:05:20.850> large<00:05:21.030> list<00:05:21.390> like<00:05:21.540> this<00:05:21.720> one<00:05:21.960> just

a really large list like this one just

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.770 
a really large list like this one just
search

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780

reference there we go

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.070 
reference there we go
and<00:05:35.140> we<00:05:35.680> want<00:05:35.860> to<00:05:35.980> play<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:36.690> when<00:05:37.690> it<00:05:37.840> gets

and<00:05:56.410> we<00:05:56.590> will<00:05:56.740> see

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
and we will see

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.680 

play<00:06:02.220> from<00:06:02.490> here

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.090 

now<00:06:07.170> it<00:06:07.350> should<00:06:07.500> be<00:06:07.530> on<00:06:07.740> its<00:06:07.890> way<00:06:08.040> down<00:06:08.250> it<00:06:08.880> is

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.430 

and<00:06:13.580> it<00:06:13.700> will<00:06:13.850> wait<00:06:14.360> for<00:06:14.660> a<00:06:14.720> few<00:06:14.900> seconds<00:06:15.230> and

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
and it will wait for a few seconds and

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.429 
and it will wait for a few seconds and
then<00:06:15.560> go<00:06:15.590> back<00:06:15.980> up

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:22.439 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:27.010 

and<00:06:22.769> here<00:06:23.009> we<00:06:23.159> are

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.860 

and<00:06:27.110> this<00:06:27.770> elevator<00:06:28.340> color<00:06:28.759> shouldn't<00:06:29.180> is<00:06:29.660> not

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
and this elevator color shouldn't is not

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.499 
and this elevator color shouldn't is not
supposed<00:06:30.199> to<00:06:30.259> be<00:06:30.319> working<00:06:30.500> so

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.689 

in<00:06:33.629> another<00:06:34.289> tutorial<00:06:34.620> I<00:06:35.069> will<00:06:35.129> teach<00:06:35.400> you<00:06:35.430> how

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
in another tutorial I will teach you how

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.510 
in another tutorial I will teach you how
to<00:06:35.759> create<00:06:36.360> a<00:06:36.509> message<00:06:37.050> so<00:06:37.650> when<00:06:37.889> you<00:06:37.979> touch<00:06:38.490> it

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
to create a message so when you touch it

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.879 
to create a message so when you touch it
it<00:06:38.879> will<00:06:39.059> say<00:06:39.240> that<00:06:39.449> this<00:06:40.080> is<00:06:40.229> not<00:06:40.379> functioning

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
it will say that this is not functioning

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.749 
it will say that this is not functioning
it's<00:06:41.309> not<00:06:41.430> working<00:06:41.789> and<00:06:42.020> also<00:06:43.020> on<00:06:43.229> the<00:06:43.439> trigger

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 
it's not working and also on the trigger

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.049 
it's not working and also on the trigger

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:48.059 
first trigger when you push it a message

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.320 
first trigger when you push it a message
will<00:06:48.240> pop<00:06:48.270> out<00:06:48.569> that<00:06:48.809> says

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
will pop out that says
