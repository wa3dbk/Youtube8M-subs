00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.709
 Ecuadorian newspaper produced by the 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.740
 universe 'and the school of chefs 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:14.330

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.580
 the Ecuadorian products of 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.919
 Traditional intensive export for 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.439
 us in our kitchen which 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.290
 we have adopted partly with kitchen 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.840
 international culinary techniques of 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.450
 other countries but that conjugated with 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.160
 Our flavors and products achieve 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.739
 interesting dishes that can be 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.719
 Easily made by readers 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.609
 of the newspaper any marks first that 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.640
 we do is make an analysis of the 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.789
 traditional recipe based on that the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.190
 we separate in terms of ingredients 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.739
 textures and flavors techniques and 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.870
 we verify that it remains in what can be 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.450
 normally improve the technique always 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.360
 it can be improved 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.560
 and we add a little technique 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.450
 more sophisticated or precise we change to 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.190
 times the form or the order in which 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.350
 place the ingredients that in the end 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.330
 ended up making a plate with the same 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.940
 traditional ingredients but that its 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.270
 final composition gives a presentation 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.610
 much more elegant more gourmet and that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.290
 affects something also in the taste and 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.970
 texture of the dish between them are not 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.900
 complex professionals are suddenly going to 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.260
 see a picture something 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.720
 gourmet although it is not so much so but the 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.970
 nice dish is achieved by a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.770
 good technique and in photography 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.410
 we try that the dish that the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.720
 appetizing possible but basically all 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.630
 the recipes are very easy to make and 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.060
 if you look at the procedure and the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.700
 ingredients are products that we have not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.430
 used or we do not always use 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.400
 then it's not strange but you have to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.020
 have some detail of following the step to 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.020
 step of what the book indicates 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.790
 all
