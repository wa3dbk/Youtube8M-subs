have well these little clips replace

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.560

pins<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.650> sewing<00:00:16.890> room<00:00:17.070> well<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.180> don't

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
pins in the sewing room well I don't

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.710 
pins in the sewing room well I don't
think<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.990> but<00:00:19.590> they're<00:00:19.800> definitely<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.880> great

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
think so but they're definitely a great

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.300 
think so but they're definitely a great
addition<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.189> sewing<00:00:24.090> box<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.439> reason<00:00:25.920> is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
addition to the sewing box the reason is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.540 
addition to the sewing box the reason is
is<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:26.990> they<00:00:27.990> will<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.560> distort<00:00:29.250> your

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
is because they will not distort your

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.089 
is because they will not distort your
fabric<00:00:30.060> when<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> very<00:00:31.740> thick<00:00:32.070> piece

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
fabric when you have a very thick piece

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.389 
fabric when you have a very thick piece
of<00:00:32.340> fabric<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.540> put<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> pin<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> then

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
of fabric you put the pin in and then

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.330 
of fabric you put the pin in and then
you<00:00:35.610> turn<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.630> pin<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.260> order<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> pin<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
you turn the pin in order for the pin to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
you turn the pin in order for the pin to
come<00:00:38.550> back<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> top<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> fabric

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
come back out into the top of the fabric

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.790 
come back out into the top of the fabric
the<00:00:41.309> thicker<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> fabric<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.110> pin<00:00:43.469> will

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the thicker the fabric the pin will

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.600 
the thicker the fabric the pin will
actually<00:00:44.430> pivot<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> fabric<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.500> go<00:00:47.309> back

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
actually pivot the fabric as you go back

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.240 
actually pivot the fabric as you go back
up<00:00:47.940> through<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> fabric<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.710> distort

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
up through the fabric so it can distort

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.330 
up through the fabric so it can distort
it<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.270> other<00:00:51.510> thing<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.410> pins<00:00:52.829> well<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
it the other thing is with pins well you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.510 
it the other thing is with pins well you
can't<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.719> leather<00:00:55.280> sometimes<00:00:56.280> with

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
can't use them in leather sometimes with

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.779 
can't use them in leather sometimes with
silks<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.090> satins<00:00:57.559> also<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.160> don't<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
silks and satins also you don't want to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
silks and satins also you don't want to
use<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> pin<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:01.859> put

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
use a pin because they can actually put

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.870 
use a pin because they can actually put
little<00:01:02.820> pin<00:01:03.149> marks<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.220> cause<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
little pin marks in or it can cause a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.590 
little pin marks in or it can cause a
run<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.979> having<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.939> clips<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
run so having the little clips is a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.830 
run so having the little clips is a
great<00:01:10.170> addition<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.030> sewing<00:01:12.540> those

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
great addition just for sewing those

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
great addition just for sewing those
types<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.380> fabrics<00:01:13.860> alone<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> could

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
types of fabrics alone but you could

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.640 
types of fabrics alone but you could
also<00:01:15.270> use<00:01:15.689> them<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.350> lightweight

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
also use them for the lightweight

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.780 
also use them for the lightweight
fabrics<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.930> avoid<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.259> pins<00:01:19.619> altogether<00:01:20.520> if

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
fabrics and avoid the pins altogether if

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.149 
fabrics and avoid the pins altogether if
you're<00:01:21.360> hand<00:01:21.750> sewing<00:01:22.080> they're<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.950> nice

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you're hand sewing they're really nice

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.010 
you're hand sewing they're really nice
because<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> pins<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:24.570> gonna<00:01:24.750> poke

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
because then the pins are not gonna poke

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.280 
because then the pins are not gonna poke
your<00:01:25.229> hands<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.740> you're<00:01:25.890> hand<00:01:26.189> sewing<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
your hands as you're hand sewing and

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.600 
your hands as you're hand sewing and
instead<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> putting<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> pin<00:01:28.920> through<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
instead of putting the pin through you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.319 
instead of putting the pin through you
just<00:01:29.990> clip<00:01:30.990> them<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.619> keeping<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.970> flat

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
just clip them on keeping the flat

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.819 
just clip them on keeping the flat
surface<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.759> same<00:01:36.060> side<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.470> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
surface all on the same side so that it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980 
surface all on the same side so that it
runs<00:01:38.070> smoothly<00:01:38.700> along<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> bed<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
runs smoothly along the bed of the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.410 
runs smoothly along the bed of the
machine<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.500> no<00:01:41.040> different<00:01:41.460> than<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> pen<00:01:41.939> when

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
machine and no different than a pen when

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.810 
machine and no different than a pen when
you<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:42.990> coming<00:01:43.530> towards<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> sewing

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
you are coming towards it in the sewing

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.639 
you are coming towards it in the sewing
machine<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:46.110> take<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.860> pin<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:48.439> because<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
machine you take the pin out because you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.670 
machine you take the pin out because you
do<00:01:49.890> not<00:01:50.360> obviously<00:01:51.360> want<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.930> run<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.290> over

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
do not obviously want to run that over

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.880 
do not obviously want to run that over
and<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.140> hard<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.649> but

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and I know it's really hard to see but

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.200 
and I know it's really hard to see but
in<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.219> center<00:01:56.460> there's<00:01:56.759> actually

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
in the center there's actually

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
in the center there's actually
measurements<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.799> use<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.369> clips

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
measurements so you can use the clips

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.780 
measurements so you can use the clips
and<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.259> measurement<00:02:01.680> exactly<00:02:02.610> how

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and have that measurement exactly how

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.469 
and have that measurement exactly how
you<00:02:02.850> want<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:04.229> clipping<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.860> and

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
you want it as you're clipping them and

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.300 
you want it as you're clipping them and
another<00:02:06.479> thing<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.439> drop<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.740> pin<00:02:08.129> on

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
another thing if you drop your pin on
