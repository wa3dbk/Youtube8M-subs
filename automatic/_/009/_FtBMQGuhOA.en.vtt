and<00:00:04.190> so<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.279> asked<00:00:05.460> for<00:00:05.490> engineers<00:00:05.940> what<00:00:06.420> would

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
and so we asked for engineers what would

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.750 
and so we asked for engineers what would
a<00:00:07.200> deeply<00:00:07.830> integrated<00:00:08.189> mobile<00:00:08.429> first

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
a deeply integrated mobile first

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.150 
a deeply integrated mobile first
experience<00:00:09.360> look<00:00:09.630> like<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.170> example<00:00:10.230> when

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
display keyboard mouse all that kinda

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.859 
display keyboard mouse all that kinda
stuff<00:00:19.680> exactly<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:21.210> course<00:00:21.240> your

blackberry pendulum of course of course
so<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.570> thought<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.990> projecting<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.220> user

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
so we thought about projecting the user

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.630 
so we thought about projecting the user
interface<00:00:26.699> from<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> device<00:00:27.779> onto<00:00:28.640> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
interface from the device onto the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
interface from the device onto the
desktop<00:00:30.000> environment<00:00:30.720> taking<00:00:31.260> full

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
desktop environment taking full

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.010 
desktop environment taking full
advantage<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.910> ergonomics<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.809> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
advantage of the ergonomics of a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.569 
advantage of the ergonomics of a
workstation<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.890> your<00:00:35.010> keyboard<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.489> mouse

you<00:03:38.050> guys<00:03:38.440> been<00:03:38.470> working<00:03:38.920> with<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.130> mac<00:03:39.310> to

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
you guys been working with the mac to

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.670 
you guys been working with the mac to
Emma<00:03:39.670> Matthews<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:40.330> course<00:03:40.660> we<00:03:41.290> do<00:03:41.410> need<00:03:41.590> to

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
Emma Matthews of course we do need to

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.560 
Emma Matthews of course we do need to
try<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:41.980> out<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.610> mac<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:42.880> thinking<00:03:43.360> about

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
try it out on a mac and thinking about

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.210 
try it out on a mac and thinking about
other<00:03:43.720> environments<00:03:44.350> washing<00:03:44.770> then<00:03:44.950> we<00:03:45.070> can

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
other environments washing then we can

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.460 
other environments washing then we can
integrate<00:03:45.400> with<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.780> exactly<00:03:47.140> the

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
integrate with so this is exactly the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.890 
integrate with so this is exactly the
vision<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:48.010> we<00:03:48.310> see<00:03:48.640> for<00:03:49.300> mobile<00:03:49.570> computing

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
vision that we see for mobile computing

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.650 
vision that we see for mobile computing
why<00:03:50.380> we're<00:03:50.620> pushing<00:03:51.300> developers<00:03:52.300> to<00:03:52.450> think

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
why we're pushing developers to think

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.040 
why we're pushing developers to think
about<00:03:52.960> sex<00:03:53.410> understand<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.430> adapt<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.810> we're

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
about sex understand and adapt and we're

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.140 
about sex understand and adapt and we're
obviously<00:03:56.200> lacking<00:03:56.920> for<00:03:57.190> internal<00:03:57.700> engineers

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
obviously lacking for internal engineers

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.420 
obviously lacking for internal engineers

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
as much as I'm excited about where we

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.140 
as much as I'm excited about where we
could<00:04:02.470> go<00:04:02.620> with<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:03.070> with<00:04:03.520> mobile<00:04:03.820> computing

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
could go with the with mobile computing

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.060 
could go with the with mobile computing
I'm<00:04:04.330> really<00:04:04.600> excited<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.170> see<00:04:05.350> where<00:04:05.560> our

I'm really excited to see where our

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.680 
I'm really excited to see where our
developers<00:04:06.550> think<00:04:06.760> well<00:04:07.060> that's<00:04:07.300> phenomenal

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
developers think well that's phenomenal
