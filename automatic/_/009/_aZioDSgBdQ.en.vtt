00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.259
 video channel saloon hands represents 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 Hello everyone , I was here on 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.830
 small crucian 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.070
 pond tested our prikormochnye 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.430
 new development and although instrumentation with 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.660
 a good one was unfortunately not 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.660
 video quality can not boast but 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.430
 I decided to remove it all the same called 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.460
 how carp makes the brain 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:37.739
 here is the video 3 bite crucian I am not 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.050
 I know how many nerves you need to have to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.309
 so here is to catch this crucian changing 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.820
 honest for a long time was not enough and now he even 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.469
 and pulls twitches clearly visible 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.219
 straight perfectly visible on vershinka 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.260
 the day was windless and everything is perfect 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.140
 clearly every touch is visible 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.570
 versobka get sobolevskaya for probably 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.000
 one of the softest peaks that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.739
 only there is nature pay attention 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.640
 literally 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.610
 millimeter shifts well cut out already 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.710
 all this mess that went on 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.039
 here from a slightly different angle well what am i 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039
 I can say 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:27.030
 I tried deep and very different 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.930
 the meaning of such a run for quite such a here 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.630
 bite here she jerks more less and 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.350
 weaker stronger such here 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.720
 last up to five minutes or even 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.000
 ten and bite can never 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.590
 follow this real and cut 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.430
 here on these all in a fight 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.890
 meaningless 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.500
 Nothing happens if you smear depp 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 which is not very fish like well somewhere 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.220
 three minutes then good sure 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.649
 bite 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.380
 if you rub depp on fish 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.079
 this moment like exactly a minute 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.710
 there are minutes five seconds and then 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.440
 it sure follows a good bite and 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.510
 fish comes across here how much was the finder 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:22.019
 before the normal bite happened 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.770
 here is the episode now completely from 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.430
 casting 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.860
 yes actually bite the fish here I 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.340
 abandoned and immediately began to shoot here 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.630
 notice here or constantly go 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.130
 birds are fun i'm not arguing very fun 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.620
 miss you can not fall asleep on such 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.070
 fishing is also impossible ie abandoned 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.200
 hand on the butt and sit looking at 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.160
 vershinku interesting to bite 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.140
 just seen enough until the end of the season 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.420
 pull right here at this moment 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.820
 absolutely no sense i mean 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.530
 here are even here are now nothing 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.260
 will not end at all if this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.650
 hook in the time necessary to wait for a clear 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.870
 sure good bite only then 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.970
 it will be possible to pull out all the same fish 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.050
 now she's actually in some kind 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.050
 moment and follow 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.489
 here it is here it is drip along with 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.379
 the camera and here's the culprit 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.379
 celebrations 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:36.170
 Here is such a large Karasik Barsik 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.629
 which despite its small 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.049
 size was still able to bend 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:44.290
 Peter half of all the good or the tail 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.290
 no scales
