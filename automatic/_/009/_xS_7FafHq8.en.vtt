 how to install the ravines for hammocks and 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.710
 hammocks 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.830
 the hooks of today can be 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.340
 classify by the type of embedment 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.070
 The most common are hooked rings

 bolt and the box 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.970
 tools that you will use are to send 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.180

 extending the hammock on the floor already that 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.799
 measure up to half a meter as 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.020
 minimum for each end for the strings 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.090
 install the anchor to a meter 80

 centimeters of height approximately 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.270
 you must achieve that the lowest part of the 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:29.450
 Hammock with your included weight is about 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.789
 30 centimeters above the floor verify 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.340
 the recessed points and that you're not going to 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.399
 break the beams or columns of the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.130
 building protects the floor of the area 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.250
 where are you going to hammer with a mail 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.979
 of hand and a chisel pierces the wall 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.850
 opening a hole of approximately 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.190
 15 x 10 centimeters defines the hole and 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.600
 remove the debris with a piece of 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.759
 wire ties the spike to a spine 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.700
 presented in the hole introduces the 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.370
 on the side and lock it firmly 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.070
 between the blocks 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.920
 prepare the cement and sand mixture in 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.000
 proportion of three volumes of sand 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.850
 for one of cement and add water 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.180
 required 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.820
 push the mixture inwards using the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.370
 mason's spoon and helping you with a 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.070
 cardboard cap generously fills the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.680
 orifice procuring that the pin and the 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.640
 alcayata are immersed in the cement 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.720
 stuffed to almost reach the level of 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.100
 the wall let it dry for two days and 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.100
 then paint 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.290
 with the cement already dry checks its 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.230
 resistance using a whole rope 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.200
 the operation is repeated to place the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.260
 second asshole how about we review the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.230
 step by step presents the brand and brand 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.410
 the demolition points using a 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.350
 hand held and a chisel opens the 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.110
 holes in the wall with a wire ties 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.290
 the hook to a pin inserts the 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.900
 another bullet inside the hole prepares a 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.240
 mix of cement and sand in proportion 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.600
 of three volumes of sand by one of 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.540
 cement adds the necessary water stuffed 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.900
 completely the hole with cement 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.810
 level with the spoon let dry for 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.930
 two days and then paint the wall 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.600
 check your resistance using a 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.700
 rope the whole operation is repeated for 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.700
 place the second hook 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.280
