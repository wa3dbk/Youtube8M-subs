00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 everybody played hi with you again I 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.620
 Katya and I want to show everything how to make 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.599
 very beautiful and original logan and with 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.210
 using paper and anyone interested 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.250
 continue smith cancer about my hairstyle i 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.410
 I will take care in the evening and in the evening I will 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.810
 I will do my curls and so in order 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.090
 for me to do we need the usual 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.670
 a bowl of water to moisten 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.260
 hair wet next to us 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 will need a comb to comb 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.480
 hair and of course the most basic is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.790
 paper I plan to do on one 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.950
 side and without curls in large and on 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.559
 the other side also has 5 curls that is 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.100
 I get 10 curls or 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.059
 5 ordinary papers will be happy 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 uterine sheets and so I take a sheet here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.079
 such 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.320
 looking in half cutting or tearing off what 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.989
 for me there were such two 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.660
 parts and this we will already have 2 curlers 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.440
 either where for sure not said so 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.420
 let's get started right away 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:12.750
 With an eye meter I separate 5 pieces approximately here 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:16.409
 so time two three 4 5 just tronic so 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 I take the first strand but we have the front most 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.299
 beautiful will i be her very well 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.700
 combed 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:30.750
 further from the bowl I take water and just packs 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.369
 urine to keep your hair wet 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.979
 in order to curls 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.030
 Spun faster and held longer 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.369
 it is actually a very easy way 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.700
 than a curling iron with a curling needs a very long time 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.399
 mess around and curls quickly crumble it 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.130
 In the morning you will do it in the evening. 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.380
 still holds, and so after I 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.229
 wetted well 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.960
 I will now fold the paper done 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.590
 as I take in one of 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.430
 a piece of paper and fold like this 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.430
 to us 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:23.850
 1 hour well, that's how I got on 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:23.850
 I fold in half now I take my hair and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 I will now twist on this paper 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.860
 there is the very end of the gift so 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.830
 I wind and then 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.700
 twist winding to the desired length 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.110
 who like me there of course 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.530
 I would like more somewhere to here 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.830
 twist but does not allow hair but 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.470
 chamois completely cute then here 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.550
 we are on the same side 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:00.930
 here it is in him I cram 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:06.850
 the other edge of the paper is so very good 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:09.989
 so that nothing breaks up like this 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.580
 it turned out like this with all the hair and 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.650
 I will show you later what I got in 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.720
 in general , that's what I did for me 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.080
 It turned out such funny ones 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.390
 worms future curls I'll go to sleep 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.370
 and be sure to check before bedtime so that 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.190
 each curl held tight on paper 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.810
 so nothing jumped out differently with us 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.540
 Square hairstyle is not very neat 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.400
 also so that my hair does not interfere with sleep and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.459
 I somehow high up with a rezinochkoy 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.000
 or a hairpin in the morning, of course, growing 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.519
 and show that I did well and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.680
 general, we have already come morning only 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.080
 that I removed my paper curler from me 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.390
 It turned out so wonderful 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.540
 curls of course the last step we all 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.040
 we fix hairspray 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.780
 if you want to embellish a little more 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.950
 you can wear your hair somewhere 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.769
 flower pictures 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.940
 You can also take one strand of hair and 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.940
 put to the back of the head 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.489
 there fix barrette too 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.620
 very original and beautifully huge 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.780
 Thank you for your attention, put your fingers 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.519
