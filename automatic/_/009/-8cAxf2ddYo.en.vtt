not I'm going ahead and go for the probe
the<00:04:33.300> plug<00:04:33.660> itself<00:04:34.070> will<00:04:35.070> see<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.340> set<00:04:36.000> my

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
the plug itself will see you set my

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.220 
the plug itself will see you set my
sensitivity<00:04:36.630> here

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.700 

it's<00:04:43.830> kind<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.070> hard<00:04:44.280> on<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:45.620> holding<00:04:46.620> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
it's kind of hard on this holding the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.360 
it's kind of hard on this holding the
camera<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.430> doing<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.800> I'm<00:04:49.800> not<00:04:50.010> picking<00:04:50.220> up

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
camera and doing this I'm not picking up

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.790 
camera and doing this I'm not picking up
anything<00:04:50.670> with<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.090> probe<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.600> whole<00:04:51.810> so

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
anything with the probe and the whole so

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.030 
anything with the probe and the whole so
I<00:04:53.130> could<00:04:53.970> have<00:04:54.090> misread<00:04:54.840> it<00:04:55.200> wrong<00:04:55.380> try<00:04:55.860> by

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
I could have misread it wrong try by

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.730 
I could have misread it wrong try by
playing<00:04:56.310> itself<00:04:57.170> probably<00:04:58.170> more<00:04:58.440> than<00:04:58.560> likely

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
playing itself probably more than likely

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:12.410 
playing itself probably more than likely
where<00:04:59.040> it<00:04:59.160> is

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.700 

I<00:05:12.950> have<00:05:13.950> involved<00:05:14.280> with<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.670> yet<00:05:14.850> so<00:05:15.710> target

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
I have involved with it yet so target

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.390 
I have involved with it yet so target
could<00:05:16.860> be<00:05:17.510> fading<00:05:18.510> back<00:05:18.870> this<00:05:19.110> way<00:05:19.400> somewhere

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
could be fading back this way somewhere

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.160 
could be fading back this way somewhere
I<00:05:20.460> probably<00:05:20.730> bitten<00:05:21.060> pinpoint<00:05:21.690> it<00:05:21.810> as

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
I probably bitten pinpoint it as

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.420 
I probably bitten pinpoint it as
accurately<00:05:22.830> as<00:05:23.010> I<00:05:23.570> needed<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:25.100> but<00:05:26.100> that's<00:05:26.370> the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
accurately as I needed to but that's the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.560 
accurately as I needed to but that's the
way<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.640> is<00:05:28.280> tired<00:05:29.280> burning<00:05:29.670> up<00:05:29.760> just<00:05:30.120> one<00:05:30.330> hand

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
way it is tired burning up just one hand

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.620 
way it is tired burning up just one hand
and<00:05:31.320> then<00:05:31.410> trying<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.770> film<00:05:32.070> it<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:32.630> that

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
and then trying to film it and that

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.840 
and then trying to film it and that
going<00:05:33.780> to<00:05:33.870> tear<00:05:34.020> this<00:05:34.110> up<00:05:34.290> too<00:05:34.470> much<00:05:34.590> more<00:05:34.890> now

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
going to tear this up too much more now

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.930 
going to tear this up too much more now
put<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.090> back<00:05:36.180> in<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.540> hole<00:05:37.520> then<00:05:38.520> I<00:05:38.640> stick<00:05:38.910> it

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
put it back in the hole then I stick it

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.170 
put it back in the hole then I stick it
