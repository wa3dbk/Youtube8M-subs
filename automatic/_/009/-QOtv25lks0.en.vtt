resolve<00:01:32.660> back<00:01:32.870> to<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.140> court<00:01:33.440> by<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.220> way<00:01:34.310> you

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
resolve back to the court by the way you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.190 
resolve back to the court by the way you
don't<00:01:34.580> have<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.790> resolve<00:01:35.210> back<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.900> cord

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
don't have to resolve back to the cord

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.430 
don't have to resolve back to the cord
but<00:01:36.520> usually<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.850> that's<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.510> case<00:01:38.540> okay<00:01:39.020> so

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
but usually that that's the case okay so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.160 
but usually that that's the case okay so
you<00:01:39.500> have<00:01:39.650> this<00:01:39.770> kind<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.010> feeling<00:01:45.910> see<00:01:46.910> that

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
you have this kind of feeling see that

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.200 
you have this kind of feeling see that
okay<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.410> third<00:01:48.650> cortex<00:01:49.550> of<00:01:49.880> station

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
okay and the third cortex of station

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.640 
okay and the third cortex of station
technique<00:01:50.540> I'd<00:01:50.660> like<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.900> talk<00:01:51.110> about<00:01:51.320> are

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
technique I'd like to talk about are

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.070 
technique I'd like to talk about are
called<00:01:51.979> half-step<00:01:52.580> slides<00:01:53.000> anytime<00:01:53.930> you're

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
called half-step slides anytime you're

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.770 
called half-step slides anytime you're
moving<00:01:54.410> from<00:01:54.620> one<00:01:54.770> chord<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.220> another<00:01:55.780> look

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
moving from one chord to another look

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.930 
moving from one chord to another look
for<00:01:57.050> opportunities<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.740> do<00:01:58.040> half<00:01:58.280> step<00:01:58.580> slides

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
for opportunities to do half step slides

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.790 
for opportunities to do half step slides
what<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.240> mean<00:01:59.540> by<00:01:59.660> that<00:01:59.869> well<00:02:00.050> let's<00:02:00.530> say<00:02:00.650> we're

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
what I mean by that well let's say we're

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.300 
what I mean by that well let's say we're
going<00:02:00.979> from<00:02:01.160> C<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.520> F<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.690> C<00:02:02.930> chord<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.040> F

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
going from C to F the C chord to the F

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.199 
going from C to F the C chord to the F
chord<00:02:04.700> okay<00:02:06.070> well<00:02:07.070> what's<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.640> half<00:02:07.850> step<00:02:08.030> above

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
chord okay well what's a half step above

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.040 
chord okay well what's a half step above
f<00:02:08.890> it's<00:02:09.890> F<00:02:10.130> sharp<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.390> should<00:02:11.630> look<00:02:11.780> for<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
f it's F sharp so I should look for the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.590 
f it's F sharp so I should look for the
opportunity<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.770> play<00:02:13.430> an<00:02:13.850> F<00:02:14.000> sharp<00:02:14.209> chord

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
opportunity to play an F sharp chord

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.440 
opportunity to play an F sharp chord
right<00:02:14.870> before<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.620> play<00:02:16.220> an<00:02:16.370> F<00:02:16.489> court<00:02:16.790> or<00:02:16.940> what's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
right before I play an F court or what's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.920 
right before I play an F court or what's
a<00:02:17.540> half<00:02:17.690> step<00:02:17.870> below<00:02:19.300> fe2<00:02:20.300> play<00:02:20.540> an<00:02:20.720> E<00:02:20.900> chord

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
what's a half step of both see it's d

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.020 
what's a half step of both see it's d
flatted<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.290> play<00:02:49.799> D<00:02:50.069> flat<00:02:50.310> seventh<00:02:50.760> chord

watch

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.480 

and<00:02:55.569> again<00:02:56.290> if<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.500> use<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.770> seventh<00:02:57.280> or<00:02:57.460> a

and again if you use the seventh or a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.610 
and again if you use the seventh or a
knife<00:02:57.730> it's<00:02:58.240> smoother<00:02:58.660> but<00:02:58.960> even<00:02:59.380> if<00:02:59.500> you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
knife it's smoother but even if you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.250 

okay<00:03:06.000> let's<00:03:07.000> do<00:03:07.120> one<00:03:07.270> more<00:03:07.300> than<00:03:07.690> will<00:03:07.840> call<00:03:08.110> it

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
okay let's do one more than will call it

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.010 
okay let's do one more than will call it
if<00:03:08.740> you<00:03:09.010> have<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.250> let's<00:03:10.180> say<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.510> we're<00:03:10.720> going

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
if you have a let's say that we're going

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.090 
if you have a let's say that we're going
from<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.680> F<00:03:12.280> chord<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> B<00:03:14.110> flat<00:03:14.410> chord<00:03:14.800> what's

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
from a F chord to a B flat chord what's

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.530 
from a F chord to a B flat chord what's
a<00:03:15.370> half<00:03:15.550> step<00:03:15.820> below<00:03:16.230> be<00:03:17.230> B<00:03:17.860> flat<00:03:18.100> it's<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.209> isn't

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
a half step below be B flat it's a isn't

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.720 
a half step below be B flat it's a isn't
it<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.290> play<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.740> seventh<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.459> slight

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
it so you play a seventh and slight

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.840 
it so you play a seventh and slight
update<00:03:21.940> be<00:03:22.420> flat<00:03:22.720> or<00:03:23.160> we<00:03:24.160> could<00:03:24.310> play<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.640> B

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
update be flat or we could play the B

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.260 
update be flat or we could play the B
chord<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.739> slide<00:03:26.739> down<00:03:26.770> to<00:03:26.980> be<00:03:27.250> flood<00:03:27.580> let<00:03:28.180> me

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
chord and slide down to be flood let me

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.620 
chord and slide down to be flood let me
do<00:03:28.390> that<00:03:28.540> in<00:03:28.570> content

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.270 

now<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:32.660> voice<00:03:32.990> that<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.560> know<00:03:34.040> with

contemporary voicing meaning i'm using
Knights<00:03:37.480> eleventh<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:38.930> but<00:03:39.530> it's

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
Knights eleventh and so on but it's

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.890 
Knights eleventh and so on but it's
still<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.430> beat<00:03:40.610> for<00:03:40.820> going<00:03:41.150> down<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.330> be<00:03:41.570> flat

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
still the beat for going down to be flat

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.250 
still the beat for going down to be flat
so<00:03:42.170> look<00:03:42.380> for<00:03:42.560> opportunities<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.900> do<00:03:45.020> half

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
so look for opportunities to to do half

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.460 
so look for opportunities to to do half
step<00:03:45.530> slides<00:03:46.270> one<00:03:47.270> half<00:03:47.450> step<00:03:47.720> above<00:03:47.930> or<00:03:48.350> one

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
step slides one half step above or one

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.830 
step slides one half step above or one
half<00:03:48.680> step<00:03:48.830> below<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.790> cord<00:03:50.120> you're<00:03:50.300> going<00:03:50.630> to

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
half step below the cord you're going to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.660
