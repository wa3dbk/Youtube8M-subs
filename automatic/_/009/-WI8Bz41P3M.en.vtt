of us of ours coming into this season of

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.520 
of us of ours coming into this season of

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
offense was really good a year ago we

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.670 
offense was really good a year ago we
only<00:00:54.329> turned<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> ball<00:00:54.840> over<00:00:54.899> 12<00:00:55.410> times

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
only turned the ball over 12 times

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.639 
only turned the ball over 12 times
offensively<00:00:56.390> but<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.539> only<00:00:57.660> created<00:00:58.079> 23

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.770 
offensively but we only created 23
turnovers<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.430> we<00:01:00.059> want<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.449> into<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
turnovers and we want to get into the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
turnovers and we want to get into the
30s<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.379> think<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> look<00:01:02.010> at<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> elite

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
30s I think when you look at the elite

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.070 
30s I think when you look at the elite
teams<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.210> college<00:01:03.510> football<00:01:03.690> they're

teams in college football they're

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.350 
teams in college football they're
turning<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> ball<00:01:04.739> over<00:01:04.799> defensively<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.880> for

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
turning the ball over defensively so for

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.399 
turning the ball over defensively so for
our<00:01:06.390> defense<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> create<00:01:07.140> some<00:01:07.290> turnovers

you know it feels different in its not
not<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:03.760> much<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.629> depth<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.080> great<00:04:05.379> you<00:04:05.739> know

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
not so much the depth is great you know

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.830 
not so much the depth is great you know
but<00:04:06.129> it's<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> quality<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.299> depth<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.720> my

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
but it's the quality of the depth in my

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.030 
but it's the quality of the depth in my
opinion<00:04:08.110> I<00:04:08.230> mean<00:04:08.349> the<00:04:08.470> numbers<00:04:08.799> really

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
opinion I mean the numbers really

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.380 
opinion I mean the numbers really
haven't<00:04:09.310> changed<00:04:09.340> we<00:04:09.670> came<00:04:09.819> to<00:04:09.970> camp<00:04:10.180> last

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390

year<00:04:10.540> with<00:04:10.690> 105<00:04:11.260> players<00:04:12.030> but<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.060> think<00:04:13.299> if<00:04:13.390> you

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
year with 105 players but I think if you

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.059 
year with 105 players but I think if you
look<00:04:13.660> at<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.810> quality<00:04:14.140> of<00:04:14.380> depth<00:04:14.709> if<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:14.950> look

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
look at the quality of depth if you look

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.640 
look at the quality of depth if you look
at<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:16.030> quality<00:04:16.419> of<00:04:16.660> big<00:04:16.989> people<00:04:17.229> that<00:04:17.530> we
