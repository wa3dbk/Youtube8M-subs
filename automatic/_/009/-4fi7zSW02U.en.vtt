we<00:02:37.680> all<00:02:37.830> know<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.220> answer<00:02:38.250> it'd<00:02:38.670> be<00:02:38.790> up<00:02:38.910> inside

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
we all know the answer it'd be up inside

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.210 
we all know the answer it'd be up inside
the<00:02:39.450> trailer<00:02:39.690> trying<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.500> kill<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.739> from<00:02:41.040> day

we have absolutely built our bows like

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.580 
we have absolutely built our bows like
trusses<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.239> they're<00:03:09.450> building<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:10.200> unlike

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
trusses so they're building here unlike
