 surprise of the end that is the new framework 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.360
 new secret passage or live near 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.850

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.949
 cardoso that is a media that played here 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.869
 blog looks she finished the game already 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.390
 She wants to know now how she plays. 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.790

 I'll explain only the guys who 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.530
 composition in case we are receiving 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.860
 enough question about it like this 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.100
 the earthquake feet is that you buy the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.420
 advance ticket for a show does not want 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.060
 to say that the show will happen on time 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.100
 that you bought made a bad point to 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.530
 people advanced the conspiracy that was a 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.770
 digital trip is an additional trip 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.800
 Digital is we also took some 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.600
 weapons and exclusive clothing and the bone that 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.480
 the cake cherry is going to have an adventure 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.400
 exclusive that will now be released on 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.290
 second half of the year we do not have 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.170
 still exact date 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.690
 I can say it's going to be announced. 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.220
 so it 's close but not on the only scale 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.020
 a little bit like this was announced 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.820
 How tired are you, the download part goes? 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.229
 be done automatically it goes 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.940
 appear on your game menu 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.100
 Anyway, we'll let you know in the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.979
 fanpage also you can enjoy 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.870
 a fight of dreads the feet of that brother 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.870
 mature computers 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.069
 Are you owing without taking the joão vitor? 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.900
 I do not know if the guy came to 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.790
 get the pc beta but he's anxious 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.280
 to know if you will not have beta of 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.420
 console club probably wants 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.080
 that he did not take the stick from the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.080
 own bc 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.750
 in fact will have 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.770
 promoters revealed little or no 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.960
 even we knew it's a privilege 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.100
 Behind this beta is going to roll this 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.450
 the consoles 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.630
 I'm leaving the link here in 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.560
 comments for you to subscribe 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.600
 you should probably get a 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.640
 activation directly on the console and you 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.200
 register but only remembering the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.550
 confusion occurred in noticing that 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.770
 has a look that does not understand much that 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.260
 a beta the lipstick test closed by a 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.260
 limited time usually dodges hilton 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.120
 the other tests have an average of 54 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.950
 The two old days had to happen. 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.810
 this console we do not know yet 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.610
 How long will it last but only when? 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 it will start at the end of September to 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.489
 people should announce the date on the 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.160
 Facebook 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.070
 Then stay connected. Announced a date stands 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.350
 connected on your email wherever you 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.530
 You have registered and lost the deal. 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.940
 is playing soon do not think that beta is gambling 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.620
 even in the game it is not the last one 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.900
 Today's program question came from 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.020
 anthony p trade 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.640
 he made a joke very much of the infamous he 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.200
 want to know if he is aware of 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.440
 tribute they made to him with the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.070
 ipod music and iphone 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.070
 inside there 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.020
 It's nokia spelling for you to understand 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.819
 joke 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.290
 RAAA authorship or because this was our 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.700
 comrade that since the beginning of 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.099
 I could attend the program 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.620
 accompany you on adventures through chicago is 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.170
 that he likes a good electronic and I 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.600
 honestly I did not know this song 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.600
 my life was good I was a person 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.530
 happy and trying today to find a reason 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:12.430
 to smile again that the joke was bad 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:18.859
 the worst song happens anthony and there he 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.609
 Something to declare face that did 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.790
 that 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.229
 it's time for our new new board 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.120
 for the second time by the 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:35.479
 past program but if you missed the 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:37.250
 yes you 're not connected that's the 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.590
 secret passage is the picture that people 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.200
 shows answers to questions you 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.050
 did not even know about new games that will 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.580
 get out of the games that have come out much more 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.100
 games and have already left 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.600
 is basically revealing some secrets that 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.760
 were well hidden and well 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.950
 interesting games on the ubisoft 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.470
 this time the game of the time is the driver san 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.090
 francisco already advancing staff not 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.560
 we know about the new game in the series if the 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.940
 I know, people know, I know. 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.780
 They are anxious but for now they do not have 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.720
 novelty 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.150
 returning the tribute of the game is when 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.450
 You get a car, delorean, said pael. 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.180
 I saw the effect that it is yes but the time 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.460
 also for those who do not know this car 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.490
 it was time machine used for doctor 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.169
 brown and marketing maxiline in the 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.870
 series back to the future that I 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.669
 I really like it, damn it. 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.229
 It has a nice tip without the time. 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.590
 Did you get the car you want? 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.990
 88 miles per hour with him and was 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.210
 the speed set by the doctor 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.940
 brown in the movie for you power 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.860
 overcoming the barrier of something 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.479
 there and through the dimensions 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.430
 if you can achieve this 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.330
 Speed ​​you'll release a challenge 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.569
 that blast from the past is not 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.009
 Glaci from the pbs started cutting 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.479
 stated that he will appear this 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.729
 that we are showing in the 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.339
 map arriving on this point you 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.919
 can access a challenge that revives 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:02.809
 the challenges of the first game in the series 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.479
 you will make maneuvers inside a 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:07.639
 parking in an enclosed space is 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.529
 a far-off reference has nothing to do with 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.629
 to see with the game but probably some 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:14.539
 of any of the producers or 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:16.550
