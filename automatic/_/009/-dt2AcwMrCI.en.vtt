got from the Arnold it's like an
extra-large<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.110> really<00:02:22.410> want<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.620> wear

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
extra-large so you really want to wear

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.300 
extra-large so you really want to wear
loose<00:02:23.130> clothing<00:02:23.490> around<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:24.960> don't
