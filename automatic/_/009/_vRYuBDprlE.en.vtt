absolutely of course on pc right we go

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.939 
absolutely of course on pc right we go
with<00:00:21.460> a<00:00:21.760> keyboard<00:00:22.060> and<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.690> mouse<00:00:22.720> I<00:00:23.440> was<00:00:23.920> a

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
with a keyboard and a mouse I was a

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.770 
with a keyboard and a mouse I was a
tough<00:00:24.190> decision<00:00:24.610> it<00:00:24.820> was<00:00:25.090> a<00:00:25.119> very<00:00:25.510> tough

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
tough decision it was a very tough

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.960 
tough decision it was a very tough
decision<00:00:25.810> we<00:00:26.500> had<00:00:26.590> to<00:00:26.740> debate<00:00:26.890> it<00:00:27.160> is<00:00:27.340> for<00:00:27.820> two

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
decision we had to debate it is for two

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.660 
decision we had to debate it is for two
seconds<00:00:28.360> ago<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.970> one<00:00:31.600> thing<00:00:31.840> that<00:00:31.869> we<00:00:32.199> wanted

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:32.670 
seconds ago but one thing that we wanted

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.330 
seconds ago but one thing that we wanted
like<00:00:33.670> early<00:00:34.120> on<00:00:34.239> was<00:00:34.540> to<00:00:34.899> make<00:00:35.800> sure<00:00:35.980> that<00:00:36.160> we

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
like early on was to make sure that we

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.520 
like early on was to make sure that we
we<00:00:36.790> would<00:00:37.000> kind<00:00:37.270> of<00:00:37.360> recapture<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.230> feel<00:00:38.500> of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
we would kind of recapture the feel of

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.750 
we would kind of recapture the feel of
the<00:00:39.130> original<00:00:39.550> base<00:00:39.760> yes<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:41.079> pc<00:00:41.559> so<00:00:42.160> i<00:00:42.190> think

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
the original base yes on pc so i think

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.299 
the original base yes on pc so i think
of<00:00:43.180> course<00:00:43.450> we<00:00:43.780> cannot<00:00:44.110> add<00:00:44.320> exactly<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.070> same

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
of course we cannot add exactly the same

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.120 
of course we cannot add exactly the same
keyboard<00:00:45.969> mouse<00:00:46.420> scheme<00:00:47.140> as<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.710> original

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
keyboard mouse scheme as the original

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.500 
keyboard mouse scheme as the original
game<00:00:48.250> because<00:00:48.670> we<00:00:48.820> have<00:00:48.940> different<00:00:48.969> features

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
game because we have different features

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.319 
game because we have different features
that<00:00:49.899> were<00:00:50.290> slightly<00:00:50.680> differently<00:00:51.219> but<00:00:51.940> we

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
that were slightly differently but we

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.330 
that were slightly differently but we
have<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.690> lot<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:53.020> things<00:00:53.410> that<00:00:53.680> like<00:00:53.980> let's<00:00:54.250> say

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
have a lot of things that like let's say

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.549 
have a lot of things that like let's say
like<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.730> augmentations<00:00:55.329> there<00:00:56.110> are<00:00:56.290> still

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
like the augmentations there are still

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.069 
like the augmentations there are still
on<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.890> f<00:00:57.010> keys<00:00:57.280> like<00:00:57.550> in<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.879> old<00:00:58.000> gang<00:00:58.210> you

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
on the f keys like in the old gang you

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.569 
on the f keys like in the old gang you
still<00:00:59.350> have<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.680> numeral<00:01:00.039> keys<00:01:00.340> for<00:01:02.579> tagging

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
still have the numeral keys for tagging

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.910 
still have the numeral keys for tagging
items<00:01:04.239> or<00:01:04.420> weapons<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:05.049> we<00:01:05.229> want<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.650> get<00:01:05.860> a

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
items or weapons that we want to get a

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.149 
items or weapons that we want to get a
custom<00:01:06.280> exactly<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:07.780> kind<00:01:08.170> of<00:01:08.229> went<00:01:08.710> back

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
custom exactly so we kind of went back

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.810 
custom exactly so we kind of went back
to<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:11.229> vibe<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:12.130> original<00:01:12.580> one

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
to to to the vibe of the original one

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.469 
to to to the vibe of the original one
and<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.750> course<00:01:13.780> like<00:01:14.770> all<00:01:15.040> pc<00:01:15.490> games<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:16.270> can

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
and of course like all pc games you can

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.469 
and of course like all pc games you can
reconfigure<00:01:17.049> older<00:01:17.680> than<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.640> keys<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:19.299> to

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
reconfigure older than the keys to to

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.420 
reconfigure older than the keys to to
your<00:01:19.630> liking<00:01:20.080> change<00:01:20.560> all<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.799> hard<00:01:21.010> work<00:01:21.220> we

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
your liking change all the hard work we

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
your liking change all the hard work we
did<00:01:21.580> exactly<00:01:22.270> that<00:01:23.760> is<00:01:24.760> very<00:01:25.000> important<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
did exactly that is very important and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.980 
did exactly that is very important and
in<00:01:29.409> terms<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.830> sort<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:31.000> interface<00:01:31.509> we

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
in terms of sort of the interface we

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.010 
in terms of sort of the interface we
really<00:01:32.740> wanted<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.250> make<00:01:33.490> sure<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.869> play<00:01:34.869> on

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
really wanted to make sure that play on

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.090 
really wanted to make sure that play on
come<00:01:35.259> so<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.770> requires<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:37.090> certain<00:01:38.049> things<00:01:38.860> and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
come so it requires a certain things and

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.219 
come so it requires a certain things and
playing<00:01:39.400> on<00:01:39.490> pc<00:01:39.939> to<00:01:40.000> requires<00:01:40.600> different<00:01:40.840> in

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
playing on pc to requires different in

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.840 
playing on pc to requires different in
so<00:01:41.439> food<00:01:41.680> being<00:01:41.920> with<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> keyboard<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:42.759> i

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
so food being with a keyboard and i

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.490 
so food being with a keyboard and i
think<00:01:43.060> all<00:01:43.270> those<00:01:43.420> keys<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.960> need<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.290> be<00:01:44.439> able

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
think all those keys you need to be able

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.100 
think all those keys you need to be able
to<00:01:44.799> be<00:01:44.920> quick<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.520> what<00:01:46.180> not<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.540> therefore

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
to be quick and what not and therefore

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.929 
to be quick and what not and therefore
we're<00:01:47.560> coming<00:01:47.979> back<00:01:48.159> for<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.579> pc<00:01:48.909> version

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
we're coming back for the pc version

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.899 
we're coming back for the pc version
with<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.409> quick<00:01:50.890> inventory<00:01:51.159> bar<00:01:51.700> that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909
