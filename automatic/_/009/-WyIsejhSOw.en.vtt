00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:16.909
 hi to all and gregg coexistence 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.789
 so for once again they are beautiful if this studio that you need 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 start to know if you follow our videos a little bit 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.300
 today we'll linger a little bit about recording guitars from 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.179
 album 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.360
 I'm trying to explain to you how these recordings to record guitars 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.950
 but in vain we used a process a little bit a little bit special 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950
 would call ambient is a technique 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.060
 which is to reach who would first be the raw signal of the guitar the 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.800
 branch drives directly into a sequencer into the computer 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.880
 to then iron out is not reported that was recorded in an amp 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.260
 to do this time the actual recording and that emits the sound that you 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.170
 hear on the canvas I say it as explained the gold process first of all 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 here is the guitar that I used for most of the recordings on 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.340
 album 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.340
 it is a threat to the traditional 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.930
 and nor why not use a litter exploit 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.970
 while the battle ranged directly 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.159
 well a preamp our goal is not a guitar preamp 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.070
 it takes more for recording 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.160
 from jobbik thoune who was high 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.640
 plug directly into the sound card 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.040
 on the pc 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.450
 I saw the open sequencer 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.050
 so cuba ze5 is where to eat directly so the sound you have 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.430
 said just now and and petange very directly raw signal that is to say 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.500
 that's the clear sound of the guitar 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.740
 that the sequencer 100 euros records 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.439
 so for the convenience of recording and to have a 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.930
 illusion of sound 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.040
 % is saturated 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 what we used simple line his call plus you are 2 who gives 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.350
 the illusion of its saturated this is what we used during 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.640
 the recording but it's not the sound 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.029
 that you will hear giant on the album 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.029
 goodbye armed to the teeth 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.169
 Why 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.169
 sequencing raking wide front 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.230
 so here it is done sequence 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.519
 agreement 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.519
 1 I'm lucky 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:34.119
 and to show the door on this track 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.379
 Let's go 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.039
 point 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.029
 a year 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.779
 m 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:47.409
 m 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.409
 such 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.169
 your wife on the option directly on these cancers 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.169
 here is the track so I just recorded 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.040
 I'm going to iron it with the signal for 800 experts in this sense without 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.040
 sound editing 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.179
 be 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:17.259
 2 thanks to his affiliates for a guitar member now i'm going 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:18.169
 add 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:19.399
 the most useful 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.299
 amplitude that will make sense 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.509
 saturated 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.969
 that's what would have used in celebration during the story before a 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:27.450
 hour 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.780
 extra play comfort when register and saturated picards with a 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.699
 its clear it's not tip top 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.139
 so I'm launching you 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.139
 the same full sense but with the amplitude sound 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.809
 so it's still a lot more comfortable for us guitarist to 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.619
 to record with this are there 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.539
 even if the meaning you just heard is absolutely not 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.879
 representative of the sound you will hear on the album obviously 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.269
 now what will happen to this raw track that we come from 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.109
 to record well it's very simple 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.199
 we will not send the signal directly from the computer 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.959
 on the amp 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.500
 while the values ​​play alone so to speak is enough 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.650
 funny at the stop or we used several several will fill for the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.800
 for recording to ping 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.460
 we first used so my oracle system that you see don that is 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.710
 composed of ahmed aboul gheit triac systran preamp 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.990
 edu and a mouth of 50 times during all power all the bucks in the 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.180
 the boat is behind him a mouth 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.930
 of 12 years vitaliy 30 and the sound was captured scared 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:51.139
 this mic to sack 214 that does miracles for guitars 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.930
 and the man had abandoned them and concretize on the old port of olbia 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.909
 mikko 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:02.979
 % there too and an assignment would have worsened or the same signals then 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.639
 removed from the studios by the molson brothers who acquired to use it at a 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.879
 freelancer 21 50 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.150
 % and a killer and I want to say + on 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.420
 that you hear on the a25 combine these four configurations so triaxis its 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.719
 mouth more equal for more flight 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.889
 % due to their assets yesterday plus 51 50 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.979
 so for a patator effect on the stars 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.520
 so we find ourselves in front of the sequencer once again this time 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.059
 I opened the file 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.139
 for the director of the recordings we had last year 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.409
 so it's the same laugh that we listened to earlier that this 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.740
 times we had four guitars so recorded guitar per cent 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.889
 recorded by myself and two kits recorded by nico 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.610
 and% rated if again the raw signal what am I going to do to you 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.759
 listen 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.949
 so I'm throwing it to you 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.619
 delay 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.619
 a lot 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.029
 so now we're going to listen to the same 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:13.059
 passage 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:14.389
 but this time 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.479
 with the real meaning 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.509
 désempli 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.949
 this time it's not about the amplitude it's blood 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.249
 désempli 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:28.780
 we used here a small studio trainees the two amps and of 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:34.659
 configuration 4th 6 hours with reggae making it more power as well as 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.400
 the reggae the port bowl 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.949
 for 100 th the two cumulative amps 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.380
 knowing that on the album there are still two other employees that you 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.050
 will not hear here huh 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.050
 it's the only good idea of ​​the change 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.759
 I'll let you listen 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.849
 I hope you have enjoyed this little what attracts 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:11.089
 not so sure 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:13.860
 by the way 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.689
 to m in quebec for poitiers yes 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.110
 to leave 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.439
 I feel good 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:24.680
 convenient 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.399
 will soon have the title to draw 

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:30.399
 space by the end of the year 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:31.809
 so that's done
