00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.759
 stick batting bat honda wanna know 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.520
 and awe good so that's the real deal with 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.200
 the southern appearance complete soubelet 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.060
 until then the jsk after a cautious course 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.250
 by a hood and yvan because I 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.810
 had it already before we see there a few 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.200
 little trots do what they go to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.020
 survivors arava their lands and to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.600
 neutral pest I make this video a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.880
 shortly before the 2.0 update 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.259
 simply because will power 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.009
 still a lot of changes for 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.119
 flip spreads 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.630
 so I would like to test a little the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.770
 change that we are going to strive for that is a 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:00.009
 putch the symbol to 50 we will take it 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 So here we go and fuck here we go 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.979
 go 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.520
 good so we're telling this hour because 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:12.280
 that stÃ© and see what it gives to the heart 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.930
 at heart then will start in a past 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.010
 recent fossil lasts more time I 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.670
 believe it was still red belt 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:25.510
 and time in the next round I'm doing 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:28.599
 this is a small will always have z 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.040
 will have sanitized the clique to do ok with 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.630
 who I spent here I did this 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.269
 we seem a complete boost turn 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.060
 so at over 300 high schools a hotpot serves 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:44.079
 strictly to flers ah yes that I was 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.630
 still 1,357 witness 366 so 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.780
 knowing that if I'm a Belgian team and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.959
 earn 4 p more so suddenly and he 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.610
 was so I prefer three times 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.110
 it's still not the air we're going 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.870
 look a little bit I know that with 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:07.060
 grid of the single will be changed against 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.180
 will be changed following the setting 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.850
 at the moment 2.2 6 if I'm not wrong if I 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.160
 I'm not sure that a crisis of the single 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.799
 beat even a door is so 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.420
 now until then he had not the 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:25.569
 I think that now having a 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:27.180
 scope also have the spell at night and 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.620
 spell while I'm not mistaking hide 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:36.930
 blowjob who's going to be changed 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.930
 there is going to be quite as bluffing and 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.109
 ra also especially to the sheets that will be 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.540
 changed so there will be longer than 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.160
 it's tonight that has squeezed turkey 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.359
 that I like a lot anyway even if 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.280
 I always do zones will have enough of 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.090
 for words, it's not that bad 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.639
 really what he will miss 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.470
 because it was really fun like 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.250
 as principle is now facing who 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.470
 will make it's maybe we will 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.569
 throw in the sheet the first round we go 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.209
 throw and well we will win 2 p to 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.690
 gold we will win by 2 pm but we will 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.859
 lose 2 not because to bring wants 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.940
 the first round it where everyone 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.830
 move and approach them 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.850
 character will not hurt at all so 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.040
 there we will win us anyway two 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.950
 country can be closer but we 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.799
 talk about pea and in the second round well 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.120
 we will win 2 pea and lose sme but 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.620
 since we will already be in close combat 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.760
 normally well it would not be 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.220
 too ask us any problems and we ben 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.980
 will see well afterwards 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.840
 so that that's really the big the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.740
 big change rather gourmet and cafes 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.940
 forgiveness autographs so voila voila 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.050
 castors 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.170
 the only change is that it has more 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.380
 bonus 4 p to this will be two p2p m 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.000
 maximum now to offer everything to this 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.570
 game otherwise I can do everything he also 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.790
 changed but that I do not know too much and 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.200
 then I think that's about all 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.090
 yes yes that's about all so you 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.090

 so I 'm going to have to change some sort 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.990

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.669
