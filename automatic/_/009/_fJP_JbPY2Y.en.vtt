00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070

actually white I thought it was actually
the<00:00:56.190> color<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.719> know<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.109> thought<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> had

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the color that you know I thought it had

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
pigment to it I didn't know it was white

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.959 
pigment to it I didn't know it was white
am<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.960> also<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.620> Trump<00:01:01.890> beginning<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> realize

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
am I also and Trump beginning to realize

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
am I also and Trump beginning to realize
that<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> tinted<00:01:04.979> moisturizer

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
that it's not like a tinted moisturizer

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
that it's not like a tinted moisturizer
because<00:01:06.090> tinted<00:01:06.600> moisturizers<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.409> have

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
because tinted moisturizers do have

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.980 
because tinted moisturizers do have
color<00:01:07.860> whereas<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.510> basically<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
color whereas this is just basically a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.890 
color whereas this is just basically a
lotion<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:11.159> pigment<00:01:12.030> beads<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
lotion with pigment beads in it that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
lotion with pigment beads in it that
burst<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.500> guess<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.250> onto<00:01:14.460> your

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you don't have much to cover up but you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.380 
you don't have much to cover up but you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
no less than to wear

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.170 
no less than to wear
hours<00:02:13.980> ago<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.400> took<00:02:14.460> my<00:02:14.610> makeup<00:02:14.820> off<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
hours ago and I took my makeup off and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.570 
hours ago and I took my makeup off and
redid<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.730> went<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> my<00:02:18.600> face<00:02:18.900> looks<00:02:19.110> now

redid it so I went to my face looks now

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.820 
redid it so I went to my face looks now
because<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> put<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.270> BB<00:02:21.540> cream<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:22.650> i

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
because I put the BB cream on and then i

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.520 
because I put the BB cream on and then i
concealed<00:02:23.610> under<00:02:23.850> my<00:02:23.970> eyes<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.750> then<00:02:25.200> i<00:02:25.380> use

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
concealed under my eyes and then i use

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.340 
concealed under my eyes and then i use
my<00:02:25.680> powder<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.130> stuff<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:27.350> depending

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
my powder and stuff like that depending

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.410 
my powder and stuff like that depending
on the<00:02:28.560> occasion<00:02:29.220> i<00:02:29.370> might<00:02:29.640> be<00:02:29.880> able<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.180> get

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
on the occasion i might be able to get

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.180 
on the occasion i might be able to get
away<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.020> wearing<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.500> BB<00:02:31.770> cream<00:02:31.920> but

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
away with just wearing the BB cream but

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.460 
away with just wearing the BB cream but
i<00:02:32.220> probably<00:02:32.520> wouldn't<00:02:32.940> do<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.150> anyway<00:02:33.750> but

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
i probably wouldn't do that anyway but

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.580 
i probably wouldn't do that anyway but
for<00:02:35.100> its<00:02:35.670> purpose<00:02:36.480> i<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.020> does<00:02:37.200> surface

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
for its purpose i think it does surface

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.250 
for its purpose i think it does surface
purpose<00:02:38.000> again<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.150> two<00:02:39.420> more<00:02:39.600> weeks<00:02:39.660> or<00:02:40.170> maybe

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
purpose again in two more weeks or maybe

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.400 
purpose again in two more weeks or maybe
a<00:02:40.410> week<00:02:40.620> or<00:02:40.740> two<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.950> will<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.690> on<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.230> tell

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
anything in this is drugstore it that so

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:40.539 
anything in this is drugstore it that so

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.800 

okay<00:03:42.499> so<00:03:43.499> it's<00:03:43.680> not<00:03:43.829> actually<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.810> foundation

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
okay so it's not actually a foundation

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.830 
okay so it's not actually a foundation
it<00:03:46.499> just<00:03:46.769> has<00:03:46.950> like<00:03:46.980> infusing<00:03:47.969> pigment<00:03:48.569> beans

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
it just has like infusing pigment beans

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.280 
it just has like infusing pigment beans
in<00:03:49.139> it<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.590> guess<00:03:50.239> burst<00:03:51.239> when<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.019> use

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
in it that I guess burst when you use

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.399 
in it that I guess burst when you use
this<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:53.359> it's<00:03:54.359> supposed<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:54.659> perfect<00:03:55.170> your

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
skin over time I do feel the beads

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.740 
skin over time I do feel the beads
bursting<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.709> see<00:04:02.189> some<00:04:02.549> color<00:04:02.849> okay<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.389> see

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
bursting and I see some color okay I see

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:19.479 
bursting and I see some color okay I see
where<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:03.989> is<00:04:04.170> going

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.670 

and<00:04:20.000> I'm<00:04:20.180> going<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.449> further<00:04:20.690> bring<00:04:21.199> this<00:04:21.410> out

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
and I'm going to further bring this out

00:04:21.680 --> 00:05:03.450 
and I'm going to further bring this out
with<00:04:24.009> the<00:04:25.009> stippling<00:04:25.340> brush

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.809 

so<00:05:04.199> that<00:05:05.199> is<00:05:05.380> what<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.740> BB<00:05:06.009> cream<00:05:06.190> looks<00:05:06.550> like

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
so that is what the BB cream looks like

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:12.240 
so that is what the BB cream looks like
um<00:05:08.310> basically<00:05:10.289> and<00:05:11.289> when<00:05:11.440> they<00:05:11.530> try<00:05:11.740> to<00:05:11.800> use<00:05:12.039> a

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
um basically and when they try to use a

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.920 
um basically and when they try to use a
little<00:05:12.550> bit<00:05:12.669> more<00:05:12.880> under<00:05:13.120> my<00:05:13.240> eyes<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.720> see

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
little bit more under my eyes to see

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.680 
little bit more under my eyes to see
what<00:05:14.080> it<00:05:14.169> does<00:05:14.319> very<00:05:14.740> very<00:05:14.860> natural<00:05:15.729> um<00:05:16.030> it

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
what it does very very natural um it

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.540 
what it does very very natural um it
doesn't<00:05:17.020> really<00:05:17.349> give<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:17.770> coverage<00:05:18.250> i<00:05:18.400> don't

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
doesn't really give you coverage i don't

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.580 
doesn't really give you coverage i don't
think<00:05:18.759> i<00:05:18.970> think<00:05:19.449> it<00:05:19.509> just<00:05:19.539> bursts<00:05:19.900> some<00:05:20.169> extra

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
think i think it just bursts some extra

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.589 
think i think it just bursts some extra
piggin<00:05:20.919> into<00:05:21.190> your<00:05:21.340> skin<00:05:21.610> it<00:05:22.090> does<00:05:22.120> leave<00:05:22.569> a

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
little bit of a white cast on its own so

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.969 
little bit of a white cast on its own so
I<00:05:27.130> definitely<00:05:27.870> wouldn't<00:05:28.870> wear<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.139> on<00:05:29.470> its<00:05:29.560> own
