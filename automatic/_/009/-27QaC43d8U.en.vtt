show<00:00:08.980> you<00:00:09.010> how<00:00:09.430> to<00:00:09.780> multiply<00:00:10.780> numbers<00:00:11.200> in

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
show you how to multiply numbers in

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.060 
show you how to multiply numbers in
Excel<00:00:13.389> so<00:00:14.080> we're<00:00:14.290> just<00:00:14.320> going<00:00:14.620> to<00:00:14.650> keep<00:00:14.889> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
simple and we can do it a couple of ways

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.800 
simple and we can do it a couple of ways
so<00:00:20.020> first<00:00:20.770> thing<00:00:21.130> I've<00:00:21.399> done<00:00:21.460> one<00:00:22.180> already

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
so first thing I've done one already

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
I can see the formula that I've put in

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.660 
I can see the formula that I've put in
there<00:00:30.099> so<00:00:31.029> that<00:00:31.599> means<00:00:32.410> that<00:00:32.739> I've<00:00:32.860> put<00:00:33.340> I'll

here it is the exact formula is that is

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.950 
here it is the exact formula is that is
the<00:01:42.159> sum<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.750> 1<00:01:44.260> times<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:45.280> 3<00:01:45.880> all<00:01:46.659> right<00:01:46.860> so

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
two times three of these instead of just

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.510 
two times three of these instead of just
two<00:02:35.280> numbers<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.060> that's<00:02:36.990> really<00:02:37.290> easy<00:02:37.560> so

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
again and we'll do the asterisks this is

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.340 
again and we'll do the asterisks this is
just<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.950> very<00:02:56.190> simple<00:02:56.490> one<00:02:57.050> now<00:02:58.050> we'll<00:02:58.260> go<00:02:58.440> b1

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
just a very simple one now we'll go b1

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.220 
just a very simple one now we'll go b1
asterisks<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.850> for<00:03:04.280> cc-1<00:03:05.310> sorry<00:03:06.110> okay<00:03:07.110> now

asterisks and for cc-1 sorry okay now
just<00:03:07.440> press<00:03:07.650> Enter<00:03:08.160> now<00:03:08.850> there's<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.600> thing

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
just press Enter now there's the thing

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
just press Enter now there's the thing
so<00:03:10.800> it's<00:03:10.950> eight<00:03:11.220> 2's<00:03:11.640> are<00:03:12.030> 16<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.840> 16<00:03:13.350> times<00:03:13.650> 4

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
so it's eight 2's are 16 and 16 times 4

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.850 
so it's eight 2's are 16 and 16 times 4
is<00:03:14.400> 64<00:03:15.710> all<00:03:16.710> right<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.220> just<00:03:17.430> say<00:03:17.670> we<00:03:17.940> wanted

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
is 64 all right so just say we wanted

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.800 
is 64 all right so just say we wanted
these<00:03:19.860> ones<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.340> be<00:03:20.490> all<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.730> same<00:03:20.760> we<00:03:21.480> just

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
these ones to be all the same we just

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.280 
these ones to be all the same we just
drag<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:23.220> corner<00:03:23.820> down<00:03:24.060> when<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.450> comes<00:03:24.690> when

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
drag this corner down when it comes when

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.110 
drag this corner down when it comes when
this<00:03:25.500> becomes<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:26.040> cross<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.910> that

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
this becomes a cross like that that

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.390 
this becomes a cross like that that
small<00:03:27.480> cross<00:03:27.950> we<00:03:28.950> drag<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.520> down<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:31.400> that

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
small cross we drag it down and that

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.340 
small cross we drag it down and that
means<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.940> formula<00:03:33.540> has<00:03:33.690> carried<00:03:34.200> on

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
means that the formula has carried on

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.130 
means that the formula has carried on
all<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.710> way<00:03:34.860> down<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:36.180> when<00:03:36.360> we<00:03:36.480> click<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:36.930> it

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
all the way down so when we click on it

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:46.610 
all the way down so when we click on it
it'll<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:39.740> a2<00:03:40.790> times<00:03:41.790> b2<00:03:42.980> times<00:03:43.980> c2<00:03:45.620> okay

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
it'll have in a2 times b2 times c2 okay

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.500 
it'll have in a2 times b2 times c2 okay
and<00:03:47.240> so<00:03:48.240> on<00:03:48.450> goes<00:03:49.050> down<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.440> line<00:03:50.450> okay<00:03:51.450> so

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
and so on goes down the line okay so

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.630 
and so on goes down the line okay so
we'll<00:03:51.810> just<00:03:51.840> get<00:03:52.260> rid<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.560> few<00:03:52.920> more<00:03:53.160> columns

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
we'll just get rid of a few more columns

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.430 
we'll just get rid of a few more columns
let's<00:03:53.910> go<00:03:54.090> delete<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.810> we'll<00:03:54.930> start<00:03:55.230> with<00:03:55.410> our

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
I wanted to just simply times these ones

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.090 
I wanted to just simply times these ones
8<00:04:04.680> times<00:04:05.040> 7<00:04:05.250> times<00:04:05.430> 6<00:04:05.700> times<00:04:06.090> 5<00:04:06.270> times<00:04:06.450> 4<00:04:07.100> okay

bracket and press the enter now this is
the<00:04:48.070> answer<00:04:48.280> here<00:04:49.150> eight<00:04:49.780> seven<00:04:50.590> two<00:04:50.860> 56<00:04:51.550> 56

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
the answer here eight seven two 56 56

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.160 
the answer here eight seven two 56 56
times<00:04:52.720> six<00:04:53.230> you<00:04:53.800> know<00:04:53.890> etc<00:04:54.220> etc<00:04:54.870> gets<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:56.020> bit

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
times six you know etc etc gets a bit

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.060 
times six you know etc etc gets a bit
out<00:04:56.320> of<00:04:56.350> my<00:04:56.500> league<00:04:56.890> but<00:04:58.290> that's<00:04:59.290> how<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.560> do<00:04:59.830> a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
out of my league but that's how you do a

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.140 
out of my league but that's how you do a
range<00:05:00.640> of<00:05:01.180> numbers<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.470> times<00:05:03.160> them<00:05:03.550> all<00:05:03.730> so

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
range of numbers and times them all so

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.330 
range of numbers and times them all so
it's<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.420> one<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.830> five<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:07.000> they're<00:05:07.330> all

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
it's a one to a five and they're all

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.300 
it's a one to a five and they're all
multiplied<00:05:09.600> okay<00:05:12.420> another<00:05:13.420> thing<00:05:13.570> is<00:05:14.290> that<00:05:14.320> we

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
multiplied okay another thing is that we

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.050 
multiplied okay another thing is that we
can<00:05:15.550> also<00:05:17.070> just<00:05:18.070> say<00:05:18.670> comma<00:05:19.180> two<00:05:20.670> right<00:05:21.670> press

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
can also just say comma two right press

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.520 
can also just say comma two right press
ENTER<00:05:23.070> now<00:05:24.070> what<00:05:24.550> that<00:05:24.580> does<00:05:25.030> is<00:05:25.480> that<00:05:25.690> it

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
ENTER now what that does is that it

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.650 
ENTER now what that does is that it
actually<00:05:26.800> times<00:05:27.370> it<00:05:27.610> by<00:05:27.790> two<00:05:27.850> when<00:05:28.510> it's

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
actually times it by two when it's

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.410 
actually times it by two when it's
finished<00:05:29.140> now<00:05:29.500> just<00:05:30.460> have<00:05:30.670> a<00:05:30.700> look<00:05:30.910> if<00:05:31.060> I<00:05:31.150> take

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
finished now just have a look if I take

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.040 
finished now just have a look if I take
that<00:05:31.600> away<00:05:31.900> again<00:05:33.120> okay<00:05:34.120> so<00:05:34.180> it's<00:05:34.630> six

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
that away again okay so it's six

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.340 
that away again okay so it's six
thousand<00:05:35.650> seven<00:05:35.920> hundred<00:05:36.100> and<00:05:36.460> twenty<00:05:37.140> but<00:05:38.140> if

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
thousand seven hundred and twenty but if

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.600 
thousand seven hundred and twenty but if
I<00:05:39.720> so<00:05:40.720> it's<00:05:40.900> got<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.230> range<00:05:41.530> there<00:05:42.040> but<00:05:42.370> I<00:05:42.430> can

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
I so it's got the range there but I can

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.610 
I so it's got the range there but I can
times<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:43.240> whole<00:05:43.600> range<00:05:44.250> by<00:05:45.250> two<00:05:46.110> press<00:05:47.110> ENTER

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
times the whole range by two press ENTER

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.400 
times the whole range by two press ENTER
and<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:48.370> comes<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.820> thirteen<00:05:49.300> thousand<00:05:50.080> four

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
and it comes to thirteen thousand four

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.660 
and it comes to thirteen thousand four
hundred<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.920> forty<00:05:51.630> okay<00:05:52.630> so<00:05:53.530> basically<00:05:54.070> I've

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
hundred and forty okay so basically I've

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.820 
hundred and forty okay so basically I've
got<00:05:55.090> a<00:05:55.300> 1<00:05:55.920> to<00:05:56.920> a<00:05:56.950> five<00:05:57.850> and<00:05:58.480> it's<00:05:58.840> all<00:05:59.050> timesing

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
got a 1 to a five and it's all timesing

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.970 
got a 1 to a five and it's all timesing
each<00:06:00.010> other<00:06:00.360> but<00:06:01.360> then<00:06:01.630> I<00:06:01.660> got<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.170> total<00:06:02.500> and

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
each other but then I got the total and

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
each other but then I got the total and
times<00:06:03.400> that<00:06:03.730> by<00:06:03.970> two<00:06:04.030> as<00:06:04.690> well<00:06:05.520> okay<00:06:06.520> so<00:06:06.580> that's

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
times that by two as well okay so that's

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.190 
times that by two as well okay so that's
something<00:06:07.270> a<00:06:08.260> little<00:06:09.250> bit<00:06:09.400> more<00:06:09.580> different

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
something a little bit more different

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.710 
something a little bit more different
