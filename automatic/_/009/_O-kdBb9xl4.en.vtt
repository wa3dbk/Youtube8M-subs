00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
to be the first truly affordable

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.960 
to be the first truly affordable
professional<00:00:20.170> level<00:00:20.950> Wireless<00:00:21.700> full<00:00:21.880> of

professional level Wireless full of

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.000 
professional level Wireless full of
focus<00:00:22.330> in<00:00:22.900> posture<00:00:23.260> had<00:00:23.380> an<00:00:23.500> opportunity<00:00:23.950> to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
focus in posture had an opportunity to

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.950 
focus in posture had an opportunity to
use<00:00:24.160> both<00:00:24.369> low<00:00:24.640> end<00:00:24.880> and<00:00:25.119> high<00:00:25.180> end<00:00:25.630> follow

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
use both low end and high end follow

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.570 
use both low end and high end follow
focuses<00:00:26.439> so<00:00:26.619> I<00:00:26.650> think<00:00:26.800> I've<00:00:27.100> got<00:00:27.250> a<00:00:27.279> fairly

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
focuses so I think I've got a fairly

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.730 
focuses so I think I've got a fairly
good<00:00:27.790> idea<00:00:27.820> of<00:00:28.150> what<00:00:28.390> makes<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.900> good<00:00:29.349> wireless

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
good idea of what makes a good wireless

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.330 
good idea of what makes a good wireless
for<00:00:29.950> focus<00:00:30.340> I<00:00:30.580> think<00:00:31.210> this<00:00:31.420> BD<00:00:31.840> movie<00:00:32.349> remote<00:00:33.160> a

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
for focus I think this BD movie remote a

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.910 
for focus I think this BD movie remote a
represents<00:00:34.000> both<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.239> affordability<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.410> the

represents both the affordability of the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.479 
represents both the affordability of the
low<00:00:36.220> end<00:00:36.360> remote<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:38.620> functionality<00:00:39.460> of

wireless<00:00:48.850> floor<00:00:49.059> focus<00:00:49.420> so<00:00:50.050> let's<00:00:50.260> take<00:00:50.440> a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
wireless floor focus so let's take a

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.410 
wireless floor focus so let's take a
closer<00:00:50.769> look<00:00:50.890> at<00:00:51.159> each<00:00:51.339> component<00:00:51.580> and<00:00:52.030> we'll

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
closer look at each component and we'll

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.410 
closer look at each component and we'll
start<00:00:52.750> with<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.500> actual<00:00:54.129> focusing<00:00:54.850> remote<00:00:55.150> as

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
used in all the tripod stand so you can

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.690 
used in all the tripod stand so you can
potentially<00:01:52.630> mount<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.440> its<00:01:53.770> own<00:01:53.980> stand<00:01:54.370> on

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
potentially mount it on its own stand on

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.290 
potentially mount it on its own stand on

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
the side of your setup you can also use

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.720 
the side of your setup you can also use
it<00:01:58.450> with<00:01:58.480> something<00:01:58.810> like<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.140> neck<00:01:59.380> strap<00:01:59.770> that

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
it with something like a neck strap that

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.330 
it with something like a neck strap that
you<00:02:00.880> just<00:02:01.060> screw<00:02:01.420> in<00:02:01.570> at<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.290> back<00:02:02.530> well<00:02:03.159> this

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
you just screw in at the back well this

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.160 
you just screw in at the back well this
is<00:02:03.520> just<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.820> little<00:02:04.060> touch<00:02:04.300> but<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.659> think<00:02:05.020> it

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
is just a little touch but I think it

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.540 
is just a little touch but I think it
makes<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.530> lot<00:02:05.620> of<00:02:05.650> difference<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.400> end

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
makes a lot of difference to the end

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.790

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
removable marking disc you can either

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.759 
removable marking disc you can either
put<00:02:11.890> marks<00:02:12.580> directly<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.510> or<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.409> can<00:02:14.560> put

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
put marks directly on it or you can put

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.009 
put marks directly on it or you can put
some<00:02:14.950> tape<00:02:15.190> around<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.060> Mark<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.870> out

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
some tape around it and Mark it out

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.589 
some tape around it and Mark it out
according<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:18.010> whatever<00:02:18.340> lens<00:02:18.819> you'd<00:02:19.360> have

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
according to whatever lens you'd have

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.650 
according to whatever lens you'd have
mapped<00:02:20.019> out

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
mapped out

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.870 
mapped out
on<00:02:20.780> there<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.890> next<00:02:22.040> time<00:02:22.220> moving<00:02:22.430> on<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
on there so next time moving on to the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.880 
on there so next time moving on to the
actual<00:02:23.090> motor<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.810> said<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.350> EF

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
actual motor like I said this is the EF

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.460 
actual motor like I said this is the EF
version<00:02:25.460> which<00:02:25.790> works<00:02:26.090> fine<00:02:26.480> for<00:02:26.750> most<00:02:27.140> lenses

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
version which works fine for most lenses

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.620 
version which works fine for most lenses
certainly<00:02:28.460> works<00:02:28.670> fine<00:02:28.910> for<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.210> lens<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.570> I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
certainly works fine for the lens that I

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.740 
certainly works fine for the lens that I
have<00:02:29.960> on<00:02:30.260> there<00:02:30.470> today<00:02:30.740> but<00:02:31.670> there<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:31.940> also<00:02:32.240> a

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
have on there today but there is also a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.250 
have on there today but there is also a
max<00:02:33.260> version<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.670> motor<00:02:35.060> with<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.420> higher

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
max version of this motor with a higher

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.830 
max version of this motor with a higher
torque<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.580> there<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.150> only<00:02:38.300> one<00:02:38.540> connection

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
torque so there is only one connection

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.420 
torque so there is only one connection
on<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.440> side<00:02:39.620> there<00:02:39.890> which<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.280> a

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
on the side there which is a

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.580

millimeters rods all you need to do is
take<00:02:55.970> out<00:02:56.210> this<00:02:56.960> silver<00:02:57.320> adapter<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:58.580> as<00:02:58.730> you

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
take out this silver adapter so as you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.030 
take out this silver adapter so as you
can<00:02:58.940> see<00:02:59.120> there<00:02:59.300> are<00:02:59.420> also<00:02:59.630> two<00:03:00.020> knobs<00:03:00.260> one<00:03:00.740> is

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
can see there are also two knobs one is

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.760 
can see there are also two knobs one is
for<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.550> actual<00:03:02.060> rail<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.230> second<00:03:03.590> one

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
for the actual rail and the second one

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.510 
for the actual rail and the second one
allows<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:05.330> adjust<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:06.050> motor<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:07.250> and

allows you to adjust the motor in and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
allows you to adjust the motor in and
out<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.590> depending<00:03:10.100> on<00:03:10.280> how<00:03:10.610> big<00:03:10.880> your<00:03:11.060> lenses

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
out so depending on how big your lenses

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.500 
out so depending on how big your lenses
or<00:03:11.900> what<00:03:12.530> kind<00:03:12.770> of<00:03:12.860> rails<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.400> have<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:14.300> have

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
or what kind of rails you have you have

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.290 
or what kind of rails you have you have
that<00:03:14.720> kind<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:14.990> flexibility<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.770> adjust<00:03:16.730> to

it can also be mounted both on 15 and 19

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.040 
it can also be mounted both on 15 and 19
millimeter<00:03:24.680> rods<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.940> has<00:03:26.210> just<00:03:26.420> one<00:03:26.540> button

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
millimeter rods it has just one button

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.250 
millimeter rods it has just one button
on<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.320> top<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.980> switches<00:03:28.580> it<00:03:28.700> on<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:30.080> as<00:03:30.200> you

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
on the top that switches it on so as you

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.750 
on the top that switches it on so as you
can<00:03:30.380> see<00:03:30.530> it's<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.740> very<00:03:30.770> straightforward<00:03:31.130> unit

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
can see it's a very straightforward unit

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.640 
can see it's a very straightforward unit
so<00:03:32.300> now<00:03:32.420> let's<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.810> quick<00:03:32.930> look<00:03:33.170> at<00:03:33.350> what

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
so now let's have a quick look at what

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.560 
so now let's have a quick look at what
feature<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.220> full<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.430> focus<00:03:34.820> has<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.330> first

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
feature this full of focus has the first

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.300 
feature this full of focus has the first
one<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.290> one<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.590> like<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:36.770> lot<00:03:36.920> is<00:03:37.250> the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
one and the one that I like a lot is the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.360 
one and the one that I like a lot is the
automatic<00:03:38.060> lens<00:03:38.690> mapping<00:03:39.140> all<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.190> need<00:03:40.280> to

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
automatic lens mapping all you need to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.580 
automatic lens mapping all you need to
do<00:03:40.460> is<00:03:40.550> press<00:03:40.730> one<00:03:40.820> button<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:42.200> will<00:03:42.320> map

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
do is press one button and it will map

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.490 
do is press one button and it will map
the<00:03:43.100> lens<00:03:43.340> automatically<00:03:46.690> now<00:03:47.690> on<00:03:47.930> one<00:03:48.140> end<00:03:48.350> of

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
the lens automatically now on one end of

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.990 
the lens automatically now on one end of
my<00:03:48.680> focus<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.160> range<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.610> have<00:03:49.670> the

Infinity and on the other end I have the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.620 
Infinity and on the other end I have the
closest<00:03:54.950> focusing<00:03:55.340> range<00:03:58.210> that's<00:03:59.210> it

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
closest focusing range that's it

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.290 
closest focusing range that's it
my<00:04:00.020> lenses<00:04:00.380> map<00:04:00.590> automatically<00:04:01.550> you<00:04:01.970> can<00:04:02.120> also

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
my lenses map automatically you can also

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.060 
my lenses map automatically you can also
map<00:04:02.630> your<00:04:02.840> lenses<00:04:03.080> manually<00:04:03.560> which<00:04:03.740> can<00:04:03.950> be

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
map your lenses manually which can be

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.550 
map your lenses manually which can be
useful<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.610> you<00:04:04.760> want<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.180> use<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.660> limited

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.950 
useful if you want to use a limited
focusing<00:04:07.010> range<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.490> your<00:04:07.640> lens<00:04:07.820> or<00:04:08.180> if<00:04:08.780> you

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
focusing range of your lens or if you

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.780 
focusing range of your lens or if you
have<00:04:09.200> something<00:04:09.620> like<00:04:09.650> canon<00:04:10.100> EF<00:04:10.400> lenses

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
have something like canon EF lenses

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.360 
have something like canon EF lenses
which<00:04:11.030> don't<00:04:11.300> have<00:04:11.510> proper<00:04:11.870> hard<00:04:12.110> stops<00:04:12.470> the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
which don't have proper hard stops the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.670 
which don't have proper hard stops the
manual<00:04:13.940> mapping<00:04:14.540> might<00:04:14.810> work<00:04:15.140> better<00:04:15.380> in<00:04:15.560> that

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
manual mapping might work better in that

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.740 
manual mapping might work better in that
case<00:04:15.920> -<00:04:16.190> another<00:04:16.760> feature<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.239> also<00:04:17.450> really

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
case - another feature I also really

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.270 
case - another feature I also really
like<00:04:17.870> is<00:04:18.140> ability<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.710> quickly<00:04:18.920> and<00:04:19.130> simply

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
like is ability to quickly and simply

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.060 
like is ability to quickly and simply
change<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:20.270> direction<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.560> focusing

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
change the direction of the focusing

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.450 
change the direction of the focusing
motor<00:04:22.250> rotation<00:04:23.320> allowing<00:04:24.320> both<00:04:24.590> mcore<00:04:25.190> and

cannon or cinestyle lenses to be used in
the<00:04:28.550> same<00:04:28.729> way<00:04:28.970> all<00:04:29.419> these<00:04:29.660> features<00:04:29.960> are

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
the same way all these features are

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.840 
the same way all these features are
great<00:04:30.110> but<00:04:30.260> what<00:04:30.500> really<00:04:30.680> sets<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.400> quality

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
great but what really sets a quality

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.500 
great but what really sets a quality
full<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.120> focus<00:04:32.390> apart<00:04:32.750> from<00:04:32.960> an<00:04:33.169> hour

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
full of focus apart from an hour

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.480 
full of focus apart from an hour
which<00:04:33.600> one<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.350> response<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:35.040> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
which one is the response of the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.730 
which one is the response of the
receiver<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:35.970> motor<00:04:36.300> when<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.230> focusing<00:04:37.620> op

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
the lower end wireless phone focuses

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.410 
the lower end wireless phone focuses
that<00:04:44.010> I've<00:04:44.190> tried<00:04:44.430> before<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:45.060> response

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
that I've tried before the response

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.230 
that I've tried before the response
would<00:04:45.570> be<00:04:45.630> anything<00:04:45.960> from<00:04:46.350> half<00:04:47.040> to<00:04:47.550> even<00:04:47.880> one

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
would be anything from half to even one

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.660 
would be anything from half to even one
second<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.710> can<00:04:49.920> be<00:04:50.100> okay<00:04:50.370> in<00:04:50.430> some

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
second and it can be okay in some

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.660 
second and it can be okay in some
situations<00:04:51.420> if<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:52.260> are<00:04:52.440> doing<00:04:52.950> slow<00:04:53.280> focus

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
situations if you are doing slow focus

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.820 
situations if you are doing slow focus
pools<00:04:53.910> but<00:04:54.510> if<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:54.720> have<00:04:54.900> someone<00:04:55.410> moving

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
pools but if you have someone moving

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.770 
pools but if you have someone moving
towards<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.190> camera<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.790> lot<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.420> things<00:04:57.600> can

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
towards the camera a lot of things can

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.740 
towards the camera a lot of things can
happen<00:04:57.990> in<00:04:58.260> half<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:58.740> second<00:04:59.160> so<00:04:59.880> such<00:05:00.270> lack

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
happen in half of a second so such lack

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.560 
happen in half of a second so such lack
is<00:05:00.990> unacceptable<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.610> would<00:05:02.910> always<00:05:03.180> be

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
is unacceptable and you would always be

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.220 
is unacceptable and you would always be
missing<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.320> marks<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:04.890> you<00:05:05.130> need<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.430> hit

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
missing the marks that you need to hit

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.790 
missing the marks that you need to hit
so<00:05:07.850> instead<00:05:08.850> of<00:05:09.030> me<00:05:09.210> trying<00:05:09.390> to<00:05:09.750> guess<00:05:09.990> how

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
so instead of me trying to guess how

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.670 
so instead of me trying to guess how
responsive<00:05:11.460> this<00:05:11.730> unit<00:05:12.120> is<00:05:12.270> let's<00:05:12.960> just<00:05:13.110> try

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
responsive this unit is let's just try

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.490 
responsive this unit is let's just try
it<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:14.070> you<00:05:15.030> can<00:05:15.150> see<00:05:15.360> for<00:05:15.540> yourself<00:05:15.960> how

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
it and you can see for yourself how

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:34.870 
it and you can see for yourself how
responsive<00:05:17.040> it<00:05:17.160> is

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.550 

so<00:05:35.880> as<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.420> can<00:05:36.600> see<00:05:36.750> there's<00:05:36.960> literally<00:05:37.290> no

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
so as you can see there's literally no

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.470 
so as you can see there's literally no
delay<00:05:37.950> in<00:05:38.010> there<00:05:38.280> whatsoever<00:05:38.640> and<00:05:39.270> let's

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
delay in there whatsoever and let's

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.480 
delay in there whatsoever and let's
remember<00:05:39.660> that<00:05:39.900> this<00:05:40.440> is<00:05:40.680> actually<00:05:41.250> a

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
remember that this is actually a

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.880 
remember that this is actually a
wireless<00:05:42.120> signal<00:05:42.300> traveling<00:05:43.020> into<00:05:43.800> the

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
wireless signal traveling into the

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.250 
wireless signal traveling into the
receiver<00:05:44.280> first<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:45.000> then<00:05:45.450> fed<00:05:45.780> into<00:05:45.990> the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
receiver first and then fed into the

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.070 
receiver first and then fed into the
motor<00:05:46.500> so<00:05:47.130> such<00:05:47.370> incredible<00:05:47.910> speed<00:05:48.270> is<00:05:48.540> very

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
motor so such incredible speed is very

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.700 
motor so such incredible speed is very
very<00:05:49.260> impressive

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
very impressive

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.770 
very impressive
not<00:05:49.980> just<00:05:50.250> for<00:05:50.490> an<00:05:50.730> affordable<00:05:51.030> flow<00:05:51.420> focus

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
not just for an affordable flow focus

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.290 
not just for an affordable flow focus
like<00:05:51.930> this<00:05:52.110> but<00:05:52.650> for<00:05:52.890> any<00:05:53.220> full<00:05:53.610> of<00:05:53.700> focus<00:05:54.090> I

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
like this but for any full of focus I

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.080 
like this but for any full of focus I
didn't<00:05:54.870> really<00:05:55.290> expect<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:56.100> to<00:05:56.640> be<00:05:56.820> that<00:05:56.850> good

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
didn't really expect it to be that good

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.600 
didn't really expect it to be that good
and<00:05:57.570> that<00:05:58.020> is<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:58.290> reason<00:05:58.440> why<00:05:58.740> I<00:05:58.800> decided<00:05:59.430> to

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
and that is the reason why I decided to

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.210 
and that is the reason why I decided to
do<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.450> review<00:06:00.510> on<00:06:01.020> this<00:06:01.170> one<00:06:01.440> this<00:06:01.800> is<00:06:01.950> not<00:06:02.100> my

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
do a review on this one this is not my

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.770 
do a review on this one this is not my
full<00:06:02.430> review<00:06:02.520> because<00:06:02.790> I<00:06:02.940> only<00:06:03.120> had<00:06:03.360> this<00:06:03.480> unit

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
full review because I only had this unit

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.660 
full review because I only had this unit
for<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.020> few<00:06:04.230> days<00:06:04.440> and<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:05.100> haven't<00:06:05.310> had<00:06:05.640> a

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
for a few days and I haven't had a

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.090 
for a few days and I haven't had a
chance<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.180> use<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.540> properly<00:06:06.630> but<00:06:07.560> hopefully

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
chance to use it properly but hopefully

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.740 
chance to use it properly but hopefully
I'll<00:06:08.280> be<00:06:08.460> using<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:08.760> on<00:06:08.940> my<00:06:08.970> current<00:06:09.390> short

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
I'll be using it on my current short

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.690 
I'll be using it on my current short
film<00:06:09.990> which<00:06:10.260> will<00:06:10.470> allow<00:06:10.680> me<00:06:10.890> to<00:06:10.920> test<00:06:11.310> it<00:06:11.520> in

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
film which will allow me to test it in

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.090
