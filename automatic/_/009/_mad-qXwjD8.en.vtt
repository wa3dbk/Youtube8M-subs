for that thing I think it's a fantastic

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:16.670 
for that thing I think it's a fantastic
car<00:06:15.779> as<00:06:15.899> long<00:06:16.050> as<00:06:16.139> you<00:06:16.199> don't<00:06:16.259> drive<00:06:16.529> the

good<00:06:31.139> car<00:06:31.349> in<00:06:31.439> a<00:06:31.499> lot<00:06:31.649> of<00:06:31.680> ways<00:06:31.889> I<00:06:32.129> just<00:06:32.309> don't

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
good car in a lot of ways I just don't

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.519 
good car in a lot of ways I just don't
feel<00:06:32.729> like<00:06:32.969> it's<00:06:33.180> into<00:06:33.509> that<00:06:33.689> upper<00:06:34.379> echelon

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
feel like it's into that upper echelon

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.739 
feel like it's into that upper echelon
of<00:06:34.919> luxury<00:06:35.550> vehicles<00:06:35.909> quite<00:06:36.089> yet<00:06:36.269> yeah<00:06:36.719> I

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:36.749 
of luxury vehicles quite yet yeah I

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:38.420 
of luxury vehicles quite yet yeah I
thought<00:06:37.409> they<00:06:37.559> did<00:06:37.709> a<00:06:37.740> pretty<00:06:37.860> good<00:06:38.039> job<00:06:38.099> you

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
thought they did a pretty good job you

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.279 
thought they did a pretty good job you
know<00:06:38.459> they've<00:06:38.729> got<00:06:38.939> that<00:06:39.289> continuously

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
know they've got that continuously

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.499 
know they've got that continuously
controlled<00:06:40.769> dampers<00:06:41.459> on<00:06:41.819> it<00:06:42.059> to<00:06:42.300> me<00:06:42.419> it

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:42.509 
controlled dampers on it to me it

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.499 
controlled dampers on it to me it
doesn't<00:06:42.659> ride<00:06:42.959> like<00:06:43.229> an<00:06:43.349> escape<00:06:43.709> and<00:06:44.039> no<00:06:44.509> III

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
doesn't ride like an escape and no III

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:46.579 
doesn't ride like an escape and no III
think<00:06:45.719> they've<00:06:45.990> done<00:06:46.139> a<00:06:46.169> pretty<00:06:46.349> good<00:06:46.469> job

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:46.589 
think they've done a pretty good job

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:49.159 
think they've done a pretty good job
with<00:06:46.829> it<00:06:47.129> as<00:06:47.249> well<00:06:47.459> so<00:06:48.089> and<00:06:48.389> it's<00:06:48.569> innovative

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
with it as well so and it's innovative

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:51.159 
with it as well so and it's innovative
because<00:06:49.349> you<00:06:49.709> know<00:06:49.860> they<00:06:50.009> have<00:06:50.219> the<00:06:50.369> the

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
because you know they have the the

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.899 
because you know they have the the
shifter<00:06:52.169> is<00:06:52.349> on<00:06:52.529> the<00:06:52.709> dash<00:06:52.949> you<00:06:53.490> push<00:06:53.759> a<00:06:53.789> button

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909 
shifter is on the dash you push a button

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:55.969 
shifter is on the dash you push a button
that's<00:06:54.599> the<00:06:54.749> one<00:06:54.899> thing<00:06:55.050> I<00:06:55.199> always<00:06:55.409> forget<00:06:55.740> am

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
that's the one thing I always forget am

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.529 
that's the one thing I always forget am

driver<00:06:57.779> Park<00:06:58.259> you<00:06:58.439> know<00:06:58.469> but<00:06:59.099> you<00:06:59.309> get<00:06:59.519> used<00:06:59.729> to

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909 
driver Park you know but you get used to

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:01.639 
driver Park you know but you get used to
that<00:07:00.059> no<00:07:00.389> I<00:07:00.419> never<00:07:00.749> got<00:07:01.019> used<00:07:01.259> to<00:07:01.349> it<00:07:01.409> I<00:07:01.589> don't

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:01.649 
that no I never got used to it I don't

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:03.200 
that no I never got used to it I don't
like<00:07:01.949> that<00:07:02.159> push<00:07:02.459> button<00:07:02.819> and

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
like that push button and

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.640 
like that push button and
part<00:07:03.389> of<00:07:03.419> the<00:07:03.509> reason<00:07:03.810> is<00:07:03.960> I<00:07:04.139> think<00:07:04.259> the

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
part of the reason is I think the

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.680 
part of the reason is I think the
buttons<00:07:04.979> feel<00:07:05.220> cheap<00:07:06.000> I<00:07:06.030> think<00:07:06.509> they<00:07:06.630> should

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
buttons feel cheap I think they should

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.629 
buttons feel cheap I think they should
spend<00:07:07.080> a<00:07:07.199> little<00:07:07.350> bit<00:07:07.530> extra<00:07:07.889> money<00:07:08.039> and<00:07:08.460> make

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 
spend a little bit extra money and make

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.950 
spend a little bit extra money and make
those<00:07:08.789> things<00:07:09.090> really<00:07:09.330> feel<00:07:09.600> like<00:07:09.630> good

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
those things really feel like good

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.110 
those things really feel like good

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
that's probably the only thing that

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.540 
that's probably the only thing that
annoys<00:07:13.440> me<00:07:13.470> about<00:07:13.620> the<00:07:13.860> car<00:07:14.039> is<00:07:14.220> the<00:07:14.400> push
