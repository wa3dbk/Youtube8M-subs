00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.610 

now<00:01:40.090> I'm<00:01:40.420> assuming<00:01:40.660> you've<00:01:41.110> seen<00:01:41.290> Jurassic

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
now I'm assuming you've seen Jurassic

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.280 
now I'm assuming you've seen Jurassic
Park<00:01:41.980> love<00:01:42.730> Jurassic<00:01:43.360> Park<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.870> question

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
Park love Jurassic Park the question

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.990 
Park love Jurassic Park the question
should<00:01:44.440> be<00:01:44.470> how<00:01:44.710> many<00:01:44.770> times<00:01:45.160> have<00:01:45.430> I<00:01:45.520> seen<00:01:45.790> it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
should be how many times have I seen it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.950 
should be how many times have I seen it
probably<00:01:46.540> more<00:01:46.660> than<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.900> dozen<00:01:47.170> right<00:01:48.690> on<00:01:49.690> par

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
probably more than a dozen right on par

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.510 
probably more than a dozen right on par
with<00:01:50.020> each<00:01:50.290> other<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:50.950> Terraria

with each other and in Terraria
great<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:52.330> obviously<00:01:52.780> michael<00:01:53.110> crichton<00:01:53.470> is

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
great so obviously michael crichton is

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.410 
great so obviously michael crichton is

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.970 
science edge to a lot of his books and
films<00:01:57.940> how<00:01:58.720> close<00:01:59.050> is<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.440> science<00:01:59.830> in

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980

there<00:02:11.200> was<00:02:11.290> quite<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> bit<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.770> input<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:13.240> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
there was quite a bit of input to the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.110 
there was quite a bit of input to the
anatomy<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.920> dinosaurs<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.970> their

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
anatomy of the dinosaurs and their

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.140 
anatomy of the dinosaurs and their
behavior<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:17.770> it's<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.130> real<00:02:18.310> fan<00:02:18.610> favorite

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
behavior and so it's a real fan favorite

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.630 
behavior and so it's a real fan favorite
among<00:02:19.420> scientists<00:02:19.959> because<00:02:20.560> we<00:02:20.740> feel<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.010> it

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
among scientists because we feel that it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.660 
among scientists because we feel that it
does<00:02:21.910> accurately<00:02:22.600> portray<00:02:23.080> what<00:02:23.770> we<00:02:24.400> think

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
does accurately portray what we think

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.310 
does accurately portray what we think
the<00:02:24.850> dinosaurs<00:02:25.360> did<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.840> how<00:02:25.900> they<00:02:26.080> moved

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
the dinosaurs did and how they moved

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.650 
the dinosaurs did and how they moved
during<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.100> Jurassic<00:02:27.580> now<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.300> actually

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
during the Jurassic now is this actually

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.150 
during the Jurassic now is this actually
something<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:29.050> might<00:02:29.200> show<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.650> class<00:02:29.890> for

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
something you might show in a class for

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160 
something you might show in a class for
example<00:02:30.280> or<00:02:30.940> would<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.270> show<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.630> as<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:31.959> not

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
example or would you show it as what not

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.620 
example or would you show it as what not
to<00:02:32.410> do<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.830> terms<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.250> paleontology<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.330> a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
to do in terms of paleontology it's a

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.170 
to do in terms of paleontology it's a
very<00:02:34.959> popular<00:02:35.230> way<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.680> instruct<00:02:36.610> from<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
very popular way to instruct from the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.960 
very popular way to instruct from the
film<00:02:37.450> it's<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:38.080> looking<00:02:38.500> at<00:02:38.970> dinosaur

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
film it's just looking at dinosaur

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.850 
film it's just looking at dinosaur
habitats<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.930> all<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.260> different<00:02:41.620> species

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
habitats and all the different species

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.509 
habitats and all the different species
and<00:02:42.370> things<00:02:42.610> but<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:44.230> starts<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.650> get<00:02:44.830> into<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
and things but it starts to get into the

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.920 
and things but it starts to get into the
fiction<00:02:45.910> realm<00:02:46.410> when<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.890> science<00:02:48.340> of

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
fiction realm when the science of

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.080 
fiction realm when the science of
replication<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.830> cloning<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.820> whether

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
replication and and cloning and whether

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.580 
replication and and cloning and whether
or<00:02:52.209> not<00:02:52.300> we<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.600> recreate<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.470> know

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
or not we can recreate you know

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.060 
or not we can recreate you know
dinosaurs<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:55.269> entered<00:02:55.720> into<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.080> film<00:02:56.800> and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
dinosaurs is entered into the film and

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.040 
dinosaurs is entered into the film and
so<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.580> think<00:02:57.760> there's<00:02:58.269> some<00:02:58.480> useful<00:02:58.690> lessons

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
so I think there's some useful lessons

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.320 
so I think there's some useful lessons
there<00:02:59.560> well<00:03:00.100> let's<00:03:00.760> talk<00:03:00.910> about<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.180> a

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
there well let's talk about that a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.910 
there well let's talk about that a
little<00:03:01.510> bit<00:03:01.720> more<00:03:01.930> because<00:03:02.080> obviously<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
little bit more because obviously in the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.520 
little bit more because obviously in the
film<00:03:03.160> they're<00:03:03.459> taking<00:03:03.910> blood<00:03:04.810> samples<00:03:04.840> found

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
film they're taking blood samples found

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.470 
film they're taking blood samples found
from<00:03:05.800> inside<00:03:06.190> mosquitoes<00:03:06.700> encased<00:03:07.180> within

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
from inside mosquitoes encased within

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.470 
from inside mosquitoes encased within
amber<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.500> actually<00:03:08.950> clone<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.730> dinosaurs<00:03:10.269> is

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
amber to actually clone the dinosaurs is

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.610 
amber to actually clone the dinosaurs is
this<00:03:10.630> something<00:03:10.930> that's<00:03:11.080> within<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.470> realm

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
this something that's within the realm

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.610 
this something that's within the realm
of<00:03:11.800> possibility<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.640> would<00:03:13.090> say<00:03:13.330> not<00:03:13.620> for

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
of possibility I would say not for

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.520 
of possibility I would say not for
beginners<00:03:15.030> although<00:03:16.030> we<00:03:16.300> know<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.870> plenty<00:03:17.500> of

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
beginners although we know of plenty of

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.830 
beginners although we know of plenty of
examples<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:18.430> insects<00:03:18.910> preserved<00:03:19.390> in<00:03:19.630> amber

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
examples of insects preserved in amber

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.400 
examples of insects preserved in amber
it's<00:03:20.680> very<00:03:21.040> very<00:03:21.459> rare<00:03:21.790> for<00:03:22.080> mosquitoes<00:03:23.080> from

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
it's very very rare for mosquitoes from

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.250 
it's very very rare for mosquitoes from
the<00:03:23.650> Jurassic<00:03:24.130> period<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:25.450> be<00:03:25.600> preserved<00:03:25.989> in

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
the Jurassic period to be preserved in

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.560 
the Jurassic period to be preserved in
amber<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.459> likelihood<00:03:27.670> of<00:03:28.120> being

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
amber and so the likelihood of being

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.340 
amber and so the likelihood of being
able<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.900> find<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:30.160> mosquito<00:03:30.940> with<00:03:31.390> preserved

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
able to find a mosquito with preserved

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.480 
able to find a mosquito with preserved
blood<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:33.250> know

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
blood you know

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.060 
blood you know
in<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.700> amber<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.480> has<00:03:34.630> extractable<00:03:35.320> DNA<00:03:35.770> is

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
in the amber that has extractable DNA is

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.880 
in the amber that has extractable DNA is
a<00:03:36.310> it's<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:37.060> big<00:03:37.390> a<00:03:37.540> bit<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.990> leak<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:38.560> say<00:03:38.740> we

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
a it's a big a bit of a leak so say we

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.310 
a it's a big a bit of a leak so say we
did<00:03:39.070> find<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.460> mosquito<00:03:39.850> encased<00:03:40.450> in<00:03:40.720> amber<00:03:40.930> of

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
did find a mosquito encased in amber of

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.500 
did find a mosquito encased in amber of
some<00:03:41.560> kind<00:03:41.860> with<00:03:42.370> that<00:03:42.520> DNA<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.120> they<00:03:43.240> find

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
some kind with that DNA that they find

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.480 
some kind with that DNA that they find
in<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.810> still<00:03:44.170> be<00:03:44.290> viable<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.800> do<00:03:45.010> any<00:03:45.220> kind

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
in that still be viable to do any kind

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.670 
in that still be viable to do any kind
of<00:03:45.580> cloning<00:03:45.820> well<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.810> would<00:03:46.930> probably<00:03:46.960> be

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
of cloning well it would probably be

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.270 
of cloning well it would probably be
fragmentary<00:03:48.460> DNA<00:03:49.350> something<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.800> we've

and<00:04:12.490> so<00:04:12.790> it's<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.360> challenge<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:14.380> DNA<00:04:15.100> upon

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
and so it's a challenge and DNA upon

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.760 
and so it's a challenge and DNA upon
extraction<00:04:16.270> really<00:04:16.870> breaks<00:04:17.140> down<00:04:17.380> quite

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
extraction really breaks down quite

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.890 
extraction really breaks down quite
quickly<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.940> presence<00:04:19.299> of<00:04:19.420> water<00:04:19.690> and

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
quickly in the presence of water and

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.890 
quickly in the presence of water and
oxygen<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:21.580> yeah<00:04:21.850> that<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.300> chances<00:04:22.780> are

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
oxygen and so yeah that the chances are

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.810 
oxygen and so yeah that the chances are
slim<00:04:23.080> well<00:04:23.860> just<00:04:24.070> thinking<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.460> little<00:04:24.700> outside

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
slim well just thinking a little outside

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.550 
slim well just thinking a little outside
the<00:04:25.030> box<00:04:25.360> for<00:04:25.480> a<00:04:25.630> minute<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.990> did<00:04:26.320> mention

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
the box for a minute I did mention

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.890 
the box for a minute I did mention
implanting<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.550> DNA<00:04:28.000> into<00:04:28.300> other<00:04:28.420> kinds<00:04:28.810> of

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
implanting that DNA into other kinds of

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.590 
implanting that DNA into other kinds of
animals<00:04:29.050> for<00:04:29.620> for<00:04:29.890> cloning<00:04:30.190> purposes<00:04:30.700> what<00:04:31.480> we

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
animals for for cloning purposes what we

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.300 
animals for for cloning purposes what we
kind<00:04:31.840> of<00:04:31.960> know<00:04:32.110> now<00:04:32.140> is<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.710> perhaps<00:04:32.890> you

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
kind of know now is that perhaps you

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.040 
kind of know now is that perhaps you
know<00:04:33.370> dinosaurs<00:04:33.850> actually<00:04:34.000> evolved<00:04:34.630> into

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
know dinosaurs actually evolved into

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.040 
know dinosaurs actually evolved into
birds<00:04:35.470> as<00:04:35.890> opposed<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.460> frogs<00:04:37.090> would<00:04:37.420> birds<00:04:37.750> be

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
birds as opposed to frogs would birds be

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.360 
birds as opposed to frogs would birds be
a<00:04:38.080> better<00:04:38.350> option<00:04:38.620> should<00:04:38.980> they<00:04:39.100> have<00:04:39.190> used

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
a better option should they have used

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.910 
a better option should they have used
birds<00:04:39.670> in<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:39.970> film<00:04:40.180> instead<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.800> amphibians

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
birds in the film instead of amphibians

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.580 
birds in the film instead of amphibians
well<00:04:42.670> birds<00:04:43.120> are<00:04:43.390> very<00:04:43.660> close<00:04:43.900> relatives<00:04:44.440> of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
well birds are very close relatives of

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.710 
well birds are very close relatives of
dinosaurs<00:04:45.130> in<00:04:45.430> fact<00:04:45.640> many<00:04:45.880> of<00:04:45.940> us<00:04:46.150> say<00:04:46.390> that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
dinosaurs in fact many of us say that

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.690 
dinosaurs in fact many of us say that
they<00:04:46.870> are<00:04:47.020> living<00:04:47.260> dinosaurs<00:04:47.950> in<00:04:48.280> many<00:04:48.460> ways

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
they are living dinosaurs in many ways

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.180 
they are living dinosaurs in many ways
if<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.570> look<00:04:49.750> at<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.050> comparative<00:04:50.650> anatomy

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
if you look at the comparative anatomy

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.630 
if you look at the comparative anatomy
and<00:04:52.500> kinds<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.620> things<00:04:53.890> that<00:04:53.980> we<00:04:54.160> find<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
and kinds of things that we find in the

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.060 
and kinds of things that we find in the
fossil<00:04:54.820> record<00:04:55.180> too<00:04:55.900> that<00:04:56.410> suggests<00:04:57.040> that

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
fossil record too that suggests that

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.460 
fossil record too that suggests that
there's<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.670> clear<00:04:57.940> transition<00:04:58.470> between

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
there's a clear transition between

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.580 
there's a clear transition between
dinosaurs<00:04:59.980> and<00:05:00.220> birds<00:05:00.400> then<00:05:01.240> that<00:05:02.140> would<00:05:02.410> be<00:05:02.560> a

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
dinosaurs and birds then that would be a

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.770 
dinosaurs and birds then that would be a
more<00:05:02.830> likely<00:05:03.040> subject<00:05:03.670> than<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:03.910> frog<00:05:04.300> than<00:05:04.660> an

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
more likely subject than a frog than an

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.870 
more likely subject than a frog than an
amphibian<00:05:05.290> but<00:05:05.620> once<00:05:06.160> again<00:05:06.310> it's<00:05:06.700> really

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
amphibian but once again it's really

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.140 
amphibian but once again it's really
quite<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.210> leap<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.900> try<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.920> no<00:05:09.670> clone<00:05:09.940> an

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
quite a leap to try to no clone an

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.390 
quite a leap to try to no clone an
entire<00:05:10.450> animal<00:05:10.780> frame<00:05:11.440> from<00:05:11.770> that<00:05:11.980> you<00:05:12.250> know

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
entire animal frame from that you know

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.010 
entire animal frame from that you know
in<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.700> later<00:05:12.910> films<00:05:13.360> we<00:05:13.600> see<00:05:13.780> dinosaurs

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
in the later films we see dinosaurs

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.080 
in the later films we see dinosaurs
coming<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.040> mainland<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:15.730> actually

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
coming to the mainland and actually

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.530 
coming to the mainland and actually
getting<00:05:16.360> into<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:17.410> know<00:05:17.760> modern-day<00:05:18.760> society

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
getting into you know modern-day society

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.660 
getting into you know modern-day society
would<00:05:19.990> we<00:05:20.140> be<00:05:20.290> on<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.500> food<00:05:20.620> chain<00:05:20.950> if<00:05:21.280> that

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
would we be on the food chain if that

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.790 
would we be on the food chain if that
ever<00:05:21.820> happened<00:05:22.270> would<00:05:22.420> we<00:05:22.600> be<00:05:22.780> praying<00:05:23.050> let<00:05:23.590> me

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
ever happened would we be praying let me

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.030 
ever happened would we be praying let me
say<00:05:24.070> so<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.820> know<00:05:24.850> when<00:05:25.570> you<00:05:25.660> look<00:05:25.870> at<00:05:26.140> the

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
say so you know when you look at the

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.370 
say so you know when you look at the
just<00:05:27.520> veracity<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.270> some<00:05:28.660> of<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:28.840> dinosaurs

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
just veracity of some of the dinosaurs

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.590 
just veracity of some of the dinosaurs
and<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:30.340> meat-eaters<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.150> everything<00:05:31.480> they

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
and the meat-eaters and everything they

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.230 
and the meat-eaters and everything they
like<00:05:31.780> to<00:05:31.930> eat<00:05:31.990> we<00:05:32.980> would<00:05:33.130> certainly<00:05:33.430> be<00:05:33.760> a

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
like to eat we would certainly be a

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.650 
like to eat we would certainly be a
prime<00:05:34.840> meal<00:05:35.110> like

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
prime meal like

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.230 
prime meal like
so<00:05:36.230> our<00:05:36.470> final<00:05:36.710> judgement<00:05:37.400> is<00:05:37.610> this<00:05:37.970> is

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
so our final judgement is this is

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.390 
so our final judgement is this is
totally<00:05:38.780> fictional<00:05:38.990> there's<00:05:39.560> no<00:05:39.800> chance<00:05:40.130> that

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
totally fictional there's no chance that

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.610 
totally fictional there's no chance that
we<00:05:40.490> could<00:05:40.640> take<00:05:40.910> DNA<00:05:41.270> from<00:05:41.450> a<00:05:41.900> mosquito<00:05:42.080> from

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
we could take DNA from a mosquito from

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.770 
we could take DNA from a mosquito from
the<00:05:42.740> Jurassic<00:05:43.160> period<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:43.820> clone<00:05:44.120> it<00:05:44.330> into<00:05:44.510> a

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
the Jurassic period and clone it into a

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.990 
the Jurassic period and clone it into a
modern-day<00:05:45.170> dinosaur<00:05:45.790> totally<00:05:46.790> fictional

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
modern-day dinosaur totally fictional

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.660 
modern-day dinosaur totally fictional
but<00:05:47.840> we<00:05:47.960> can<00:05:48.110> still<00:05:48.380> have<00:05:48.440> a<00:05:48.980> lot<00:05:49.190> of<00:05:49.310> fun<00:05:49.460> with

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
but we can still have a lot of fun with

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.730 
but we can still have a lot of fun with
the<00:05:49.790> movies<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.420> enjoy<00:05:50.720> them<00:05:50.990> thank<00:05:51.440> you<00:05:51.530> so

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
the movies and enjoy them thank you so

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.840 
the movies and enjoy them thank you so
much<00:05:51.920> sure<00:05:52.310> thing

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
much sure thing

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.750 
much sure thing
interestingly<00:05:53.840> enough<00:05:54.560> dinos<00:05:55.220> will<00:05:55.400> not<00:05:55.610> be

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
interestingly enough dinos will not be

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.790 
interestingly enough dinos will not be
making<00:05:56.030> a<00:05:56.120> comeback<00:05:56.330> anytime<00:05:56.990> soon<00:05:57.290> so<00:05:57.710> this

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
making a comeback anytime soon so this

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.400 
making a comeback anytime soon so this
one<00:05:57.980> gets<00:05:58.070> a<00:05:58.220> big<00:05:58.490> old<00:05:58.790> fictional<00:05:59.450> DNA<00:06:00.110> can<00:06:00.260> not

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
one gets a big old fictional DNA can not

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.050 
one gets a big old fictional DNA can not
be<00:06:00.560> naturally<00:06:01.070> preserved<00:06:01.430> well<00:06:01.670> enough<00:06:01.940> in

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
be naturally preserved well enough in
