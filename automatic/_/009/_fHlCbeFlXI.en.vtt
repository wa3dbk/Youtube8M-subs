00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
which blocks it can replace in this

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.979 
which blocks it can replace in this
instance<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:52.189> tell<00:01:52.939> it<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.119> only<00:01:53.270> replace<00:01:53.719> air

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
instance I tell it to only replace air

then can be later thought I find this
very<00:05:16.430> useful<00:05:17.210> in<00:05:17.720> most<00:05:18.110> circumstances<00:05:18.560> and

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
very useful in most circumstances and

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.450 
very useful in most circumstances and
music<00:05:19.610> much<00:05:19.820> more<00:05:20.090> than<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.330> older<00:05:20.660> light<00:05:20.810> or

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
the fill command could be very useful it

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.730 
the fill command could be very useful it
allows<00:05:24.680> you<00:05:24.950> to<00:05:25.190> fill<00:05:25.790> an<00:05:26.090> area<00:05:26.479> with<00:05:27.260> another
