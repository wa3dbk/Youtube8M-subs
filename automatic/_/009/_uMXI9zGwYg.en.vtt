00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 hello I'm paola builes aristizÃ¡bal I have 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.599
 20 years I live in the neighborhood the colors and 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.210
 I am currently studying social communication 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.779
 and journalism in the upv 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 since I was little I always had the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.790
 desire and all the push to do the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 model then I looked for all 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.199
 means to model but equally 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.960
 I was very little, my mom always told me 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.530
 supported in all this story and when 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.300
 I was about 12 years old 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.489
 to a modeling academy 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.620
 in the academic part it was always very 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.770
 well always occupied the first 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.540
 posts at school I'm not very 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.780
 Amiguera I have few friends I have five 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.500
 years modeling at the beginning it was 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.420
 difficult looking at the agencies tells me 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.250
 photographic book then I took them to 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.590
 the agencies to several people who 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.200
 They worked in the middle because, 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.540
 I knew nobody and I started opening 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.490
 space and well here I go super well I take 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.619
 five years I started first in protocol 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.290
 and then I was climbing and doing short 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:33.509
 advertising campaigns videos 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.700
 good to be Miss Antioquia calls me 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.619
 the attention and the social part that I 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.799
 I would like very much to combine it with the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.530
 social communication I think it's a 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.890
 opportunity to combine beauty with 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.110
 social work take advantage of that the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.479
 beauty attracts people call the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 attention of people to do works 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.970
 social to make many happy 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.039
 people and also journalism is very 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.229
 important as journalism one has 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.530
 a very big voice within the media 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.659
 and in everything you can talk and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.630
 accumulate a lot of people to join 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.489
 very nice social causes 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.709
 sometimes lunch with my mother because as 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.410
 I live with her and not to leave her too much 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.250
 time alone because we are so nail and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.430
 We are the little friends 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.070
 I really like home then also 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.860
 video how to find a good person 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.710
 to be able to have children a very nice home 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.260
 for that part and for the professional part 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.230
 so I do not focus anymore after the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 modeling I finished focusing on my career 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.670
 although also by modeling I can 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.590
 focus on the audiovisual media that 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.319
 they also like it a lot 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.500
 the members of my family are very 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.099
 broad but in my first core it is 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.349
 my mother only that school that I live 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:58.640
 but then it extends to my grandparents 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.340
 I have like 12 guys I have 20 cousins â€‹â€‹of 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.890
 a typical giant family paisa family 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.319
 I meet with them are Sundays 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.739
 then my plan will always be to go 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.930
 on Sundays to spend with them to laugh 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.450
 to eat where my grandmother eats 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.319
 too much and so I can not diet 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.489
 it gives me much more child the lies he hears the 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.959
 people lying and I always try like 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.879
 start by myself then always 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.680
 tell the truth although after the 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.720
 little things denotes who can say 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.720
 a big lie or who does not 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.160
 yes 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.080
 sometimes I feel like a lot of anxiety 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.880
 because things come already then 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.910
 as too anxious though I want 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.210
 all since everyone is made the instant 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.790
 that everything is as I want then that 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:02.299
 It's like the part I do not like it 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.670
 love for others and tenderness 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.819
 I am as always very very warm to 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.620
 treat other people I always see 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.299
 like the kind face of things 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.069
 so I think it's not the part like 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.200
 that people stand out and I like it 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.660
 being with me is like that part of the 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.209
 sweetheart I'm too tender 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.209
 with all the people around 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:29.010
 in a difficult moment of my life when 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.950
 I was 15 years old that was like I was 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.770
 came over all this from the separation 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.660
 from my parents an economic moment 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.940
 difficult too 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.380
 So much so that I had to withdraw from the 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.840
 school a little time a few months then 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.000
 It was like a hard time for my life 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.670
 he was still very young then like that 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.060
 facing it for me was complicated 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.460
 all the moments for me are always 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.070
 as joy happiness and as I say 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.770
 on Sundays where my family I charge 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.840
 energy are those moments of happiness 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.430
 where I say it's worth a lot of things 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.180
 I thank God because I have a 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.250
 giant family that loves me too 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.230

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.850
