00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and before I picked it up I decided to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.890 
and before I picked it up I decided to
do<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> little<00:01:16.590> research<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.880> baking<00:01:18.630> soda

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
do a little research about baking soda

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.969 
do a little research about baking soda
so<00:01:20.150> what<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> came<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.170> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so what I came up with is that this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.760 
so what I came up with is that this
stuff<00:01:23.310> right<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:23.909> although<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
stuff right here although the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.490 
stuff right here although the
ingredients<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.490> box

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
ingredients on the box

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.069 
ingredients on the box
the<00:01:28.500> only<00:01:28.740> thing<00:01:29.220> listed<00:01:29.759> as<00:01:29.939> ingredient<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the only thing listed as ingredient is

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.450 
the only thing listed as ingredient is
sodium<00:01:32.270> bicarbonate<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:34.140> turns<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:36.350> it

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
sodium bicarbonate it turns out that it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.080 
sodium bicarbonate it turns out that it
has<00:01:38.460> aluminum<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:41.159> thinking<00:01:41.700> okay

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
has aluminum in it so I'm thinking okay

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
has aluminum in it so I'm thinking okay

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
I stopped using deodorant with aluminum

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.219 
I stopped using deodorant with aluminum
because<00:01:44.790> they<00:01:44.939> were<00:01:45.000> making<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.570> underarms

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
because they were making my underarms

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.889
