 them belongs to the railway industry 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.610
 mechanical engineering at plants near Astana 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.710
 for example, an issue has already been put on stream. 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.289
 came to Kazakhstan production with 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.360
 modern technology this year 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.910
 the factory begins production of new 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.609
 passenger locomotive which will 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.730
 most advanced in the CIS 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:07.970
 In addition, we are nearing completion. 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.010
 project on the engine and creation 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.150
 diesel production which will 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.680
 work in astana 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.920
 which will be completed in 2015

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.330
 engine which says President I 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.189
 transportation transportation 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.710
 one of the main parts of Kazakhstan 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.900
 locomotive and if today it starts up in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.060
 country ready with the next 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.770
 years will be made in Kazakhstan 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.220
 construction of a plant near Astana 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.990
 started in July 2013 and today successfully 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.270
 another joint project is underway 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.670
 Kazakh and this time French 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.369
 railway locomotive assembly 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.409
 plant its design capacity is 50 2 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.600
 breakout year already for electric 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.030
 first year of work 2013 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.880
 here was released 12 locomotives in 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.250
 about 20 more are planned this year. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.890
 if the first cars came to kazakhstan 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.170
 almost ready then gradually the list 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.370
 local work details increases 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.460
 food is like that first 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.040
 electric locomotives comes countries from factories 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.930
 belfort which we supply here 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.690
 some and get parts and 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.370
 at the same time fully produced 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.800
 already Kazakh assembly so it goes 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.970
 double as a double production 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.560
 this electric locomotive 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.740
 is one of the most powerful 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.650
 electric locomotives in the world today it has 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.080
 power is 8800 kilowatts which allows in 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.020
 principle to drive freight trains weighing 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.650
 up to 9 thousand tons on gentle profiles 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.760
 railroad locomotives are available 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.280
 approximate in their technical 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.260
 characteristics to our product but 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.300
 just such a unique kind of you 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.550
 it was specially designed by the company 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.830
