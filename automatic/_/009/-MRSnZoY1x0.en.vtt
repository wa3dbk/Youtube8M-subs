00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 the question and assaulted until he could 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 saw a couple of times in the first 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.519
 time he got there Pablo 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.370
 brushing a ball in the front and 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.259
 ended up scaring athletic a little bit 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.790
 that game control that is what the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.470
 The book referred to the book 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.529
 refer to it comes much from this 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.480
 tranquility that the athletic finds 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.920
 playing in front of his supporter the support 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
 of the fan then sometimes a pass 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.820
 wrong and the fans continue to push the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.740
 team 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.720
 today the team was a bit more 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.600
 slower than bernard no available 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.370
 of your physical form has had a problem 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.410
 of health during the week was slow 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.300
 to recover 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.950
 very heavy marking 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.079
 hard ronaldinho gaucho finding 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.550
 difficulty raising your head to 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.230
 find the goals 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.469
 in the first one that ronaldinho gaÃºcho 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.000
 found room to play and he 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.289
 ended up going for a pass 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.489
 sensational for me to do what we 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.739
 will see from here a little civilian in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.989
 some opportunities that the strong 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.960
 was precisely because of the athletic 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.120
 get too excited about ball possession and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.909
 to go out all the time especially 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.159
 right side the athletic defense is 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.560
 undressed 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.930
 but this tranquility and thus the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.280
 victory was threatened after the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.979
 athletic goal scored 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.259
 did not see the slightest possibility of strokes 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.180
 to turn the game into really athletic is a 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.630
 very offensive snow team up to 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.659
 escalelli tardelli johann naldinho 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.280
 bernard is this also has to do with the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.409
 configuration of the opponent it is clear that the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.180
 partying like this all the time but 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.040
 knowing that there is an opponent going 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.119
 playing with two closed lines and 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.439
 a ball is going to stick this ball 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.150
 to play head-to-head with 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.250
 defender then you have to play forward 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.380
 really anyway you know that Victor 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.630
 made some good defenses mainly 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.850
 ronaldinho gaucho had smashed balls 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.159
 opportunity to make another charge 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.530
 of really missing the ball we 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.329
 saw little Bernardo right now is that it's a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.649
 evil has not entered into it is a 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.110
 little slower in the game the people 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.250
 explained why but this ball to the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.320
 sectional and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.030
 I'm going to touch the beam and then 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.890
 ronaldinho gaucho free 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 there he throws the ball that he still has a 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.490
 detour the game make the goal 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.290
 from that moment the victory of the 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.020
 athletic was not threatened 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.270
 It is the doubt was going to make a thrashing 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.820
 because the strokes will try to open not 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.620
 opened in the last five 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.300
 minutes in which the coach put more 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.640
 two attackers will see what happened 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.760
 he just managed to score a goal but the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.910
 athletic breathed relieved put the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.830
 ball on the floor came to think the game had 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.950
 opportunities and saw it on the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.620
 audiovisual tardelli does not give 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.630
 to know the flag did not hit the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.760
 people saw him after the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.450
 Electronic straw but he hit the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.150
 south 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.580
 The ronaldinho that he unbalances 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.170
 because he thinks faster than the 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.989
 others with his signature looks with a 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.670
 side touches the other and then 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.210
 to beat the penalty and 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.190
 make the goal 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.440
 was the first goal of ronaldinho for 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.930
 on the Liberators 2013 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.910
 he had already been decisive in the game 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.340
 against Sao Paulo giving the assists 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.490
 for the two goals of the athletic in victory 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.010
 by 2 to 1 over Sao Paulo in this match 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.050
 gave assistance to one of the goals created the 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.540
 which resulted in a penalty kick and then 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.130
 made the second goal the melgar yet 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.320
 decreased at the end of the game to 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.380
 team of the strong that now faces 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.380
 the athletic at altitude 3,600 meters
