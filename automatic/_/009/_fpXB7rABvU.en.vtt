trains<00:00:10.500> part<00:00:10.740> 4<00:00:10.950> out<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.309> weekend<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
trains part 4 out this weekend the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.940 
trains part 4 out this weekend the
reasoning<00:00:12.630> behind<00:00:12.750> not<00:00:13.170> having<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.590> out<00:00:13.710> yet

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
reasoning behind not having it out yet

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.820 
reasoning behind not having it out yet
is<00:00:14.219> because<00:00:14.759> College<00:00:15.240> takes<00:00:15.509> up<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.809> lot<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.619> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
is because College takes up a lot and a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.810 
is because College takes up a lot and a
lot<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.220> time<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.289> I<00:00:19.289> mean<00:00:20.010> it's<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.430> easy<00:00:20.609> to

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
lot of time and I mean it's it's easy to

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.529 
lot of time and I mean it's it's easy to
put<00:00:20.970> together

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
put together

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.040 
put together
just<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.289> little<00:00:22.710> riff<00:00:22.920> trains<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:24.050> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
just like a little riff trains but it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.570 
just like a little riff trains but it
does<00:00:25.470> take<00:00:25.680> time<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.010> put<00:00:26.099> together<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
does take time to put together the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.330 
does take time to put together the
longer<00:00:26.910> stuff<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:28.380> time<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.710> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
longer stuff and it's time that this
