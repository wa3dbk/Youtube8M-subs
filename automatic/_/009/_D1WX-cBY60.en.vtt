00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Look, my name is Felipe. I came. 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.529
 Here to show you today. 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.840
 the last update that microsoft 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.070
 released windows phone that like you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.400
 You can see I just received the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.580
 message on the screen 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 nuno markl 1720 plug the cable here in 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:35.700
 USB port automatically already far 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:41.480
 has appeared now it will start to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:47.450
 look for a device that is 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.450
 synchronized update already appeared 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:03.390
 your phone just click update and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:07.650
 waiting and that's the thing is in 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 in heaven there is thus in his 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.439
 computer 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.590
 so in this period it is good to 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.189
 phone and on the computer so that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.189
 there may be no problem and check 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.920
 if the device should take a little 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.970
 depends very much on the speed of your 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.130
 Internet 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 he first downloads the file 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 to the computer 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.710
 then transfer to the mobile phone 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.710
 starts to install 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.170
 ready now the update has already been made 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:54.960
 June itself shows it to us 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:02:00.500
 you can see here we have here 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.500
 new screen with bing menu 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.840
 and is the message hits and windows was 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.840
 updated 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.850
 good now with our device 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.770
 updated show you that he 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.750
 It was much faster to start the 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.750
 I push the year off button 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.989
 Pedro starter got much faster 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.500
 we will also see the difference in the screen 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.600
 now looked similar to the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.610
 with windows phone 8 and ready 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.380
 started the system 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.220
 one of the great innovations of this 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.060
 update is the fact that now the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.720
 block 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.700
 you can choose the bing service for 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.590
 can change the photo as the wallpaper 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.720
 wall 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.720
 daily every day a new photo 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.049
 appears on the screen and along the benfica in 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.730
 close to the network bar 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.190
 now with antero started you can 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.510
 realize that we can change the 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.940
 size of the taiyo for example aquino of 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.180
 music then large size already 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:29.930
 I set it up I can put it 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.930
 the standard medium and small 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.430
 this can be done with almost all 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:41.329
 applications for example the kilo of photo 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.329
 of contacts 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.460
 it's just you push hard 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:01.370
 and play in Mexico, right from the corner 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:05.280
 here and you can resize it 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.700
 a difference also if you already 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.020
 here in the corner on the set with 5 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.410
 there was a button for you and for the corner 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:22.200
 it was removed so we managed 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:25.260
 more space on the home screen but the 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.090
 did not leave and is there in the corner but 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.700
 I believe that almost nobody uses this 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.730
 button because we can use 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:37.380
 proved a legal change is also the 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:43.350
 increased color options for 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:53.870
 customize the start year has several 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:53.870
 options as you want I'm interested 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.930
 the office button that turned out differently 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.610
 also 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:15.280
 now the orange test means that a standard 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:17.470
 now from office 2013 and also has the 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.520
 bluetooth apps for 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.550
 Bluetooth transfer and the 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.840
 application to create your environment 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:31.540
 you can download it on your 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.490
 windows phone through the market place 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.760
 the bluetooth application is not yet 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:40.390
 running is still being done but the 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.580
 an app to create your ringtone already 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.740
 is also available in the marketplace 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.020
 Brazilian 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:50.620
