I<00:01:46.409> win<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> match<00:01:48.229> after<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.439> goal<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.979> scored<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
I win the match after a goal I scored to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.999 
I win the match after a goal I scored to
him<00:01:51.329> again<00:01:51.630> at<00:01:52.380> 386<00:01:53.070> minutes<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:55.009> he

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
him again at 386 minutes so I think he

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.139 
him again at 386 minutes so I think he
thinks<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.579> too

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
thinks it too

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.719 
thinks it too
the<00:01:57.329> match<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.780> over<00:01:57.930> free<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> match

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the match is over free one but the match

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.459 
the match is over free one but the match
isn't<00:01:59.939> over<00:02:00.149> because<00:02:00.450> guess<00:02:01.020> what

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
isn't over because guess what

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.929 
isn't over because guess what
