00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.920
 today consider mods for the game 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.330
 minecraft with just mega super 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.310
 wonderful mod that adds to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.480
 shru chess up dear friends you don't 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.860
 misheard today we will 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.660
 consider a mod that adds to 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.850
 intellectual game which game 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.440
 called chess and the first thing that I 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.660
 I'll show you so it is of course craft and 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.519
 this fashion and then see the most 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.470
 interesting well of course i tell you this also 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.690
 I'll show you well let's get down to it 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.640
 craft first thing to 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.649
 play chess we need 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.090
 to craft a board because you probably 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.460
 many know to play 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.850
 chess will need to deliver without him 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.010
 no way 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.140
 it is done as follows to us 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.629
 need 1 diamond 4 red dust well and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 of course absolutely any form of wool 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.590
 four pieces well, and in general, that after 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 how do we cut this board we can 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.480
 put but be sure 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.770
 if you put it in any 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.649
 closed space 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.199
 you can immediately grieve for your one 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.700
 diamond because the board just takes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.700
 and let us go right now we 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.859
 put this board in some 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 closed place here for example here and we 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.149
 see what she is missing we are not her 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.979
 saw in her inventory that is she 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.719
 really gone and that means something 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.179
 that she didn't turn around and at the same time 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.099
 our diamond is gone a little thought out 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.439
 I tell you, but at the same time be 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.779
 more attentively and here we have an open 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.990
 space we put this board and she have 

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:30.689
 us 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.209
 deployed also want to say right away 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.669
 what if we break at least one block out 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:38.520
 of this whole structure everything will collapse then 

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:39.450
 have we break the wool all the wool collapses 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.939
 of course it falls 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.259
 it is very good for du perov but i am you 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.599
 I will not say that if you want to play 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.369
 chess you will love in general how 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:50.219
 see the structure broke go better 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.349
 do not break further I'll show you the sticks 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.299
 which allows you to manage these 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:55.770
 here are the cubes that are actually 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.380
 need to play chess 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.659
 this is our black chopstick 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.639
 it is crafted as follows 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.380
 way just two sticks and rotten 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.509
 the flesh to rule the whites 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 figures we need two sticks well 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.349
 and of course the bone we get 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.870
 white wand let's go right now I'm 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.650
 turn on creative mode otherwise without it 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.720
 no way 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.180
 and show you how to start playing 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.870
 first when we just created this 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.040
 construction 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.480
 we can already with a friend choose who will 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.400
 first walk ie it will be either 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.349
 black or white but since 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.019
 defaults usually chess go white 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.689
 we will be the first to play 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.879
 white here we have a white stick 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.530
 let's right now we press right 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.750
 click on absolutely any figures 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.540
 for example on a horse and try it 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.609
 transplanted here as you see here 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.530
 nothing happened because if so 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.329
 does not go if we again press on 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.510
 right -click it and put it here 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.430
 here then as you can see everything he did that is 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.379
 put in my 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.980
 the water step is pretty good 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:02.099
 everything works and then we go black 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.409
 as you probably know many, but if you 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.409
 want to play a little trick on the system and 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:12.379
 over friend then you probably want 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.379
 do so and look like i am one more time 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.049
 can no longer walk until it is like 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.780
 another color 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.060
 okay this system does not cheat walks 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.250
 black again we take for example the same 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.230
 the horse we walk like this and the horse 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.699
 we were like and after that we did not again 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.849
 we can go black until they are like 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.639
 whites i think you understand my system 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.230
 this is an awesome mod that is 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.120
 really thought he doesn't 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.980
 cheat but although using it at the same 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.139
 time can be bought but not in large 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.720
 sizes and I hope that you mod yourself 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.090
 I hope I hope all those who love 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.940
 chess even those who don't like chess and 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.639
 I know that the mod itself is pretty 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.169
 cool hope to like you and I 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.310
 I say if you are here for the first time then you 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.739
 can subscribe to the channel to put 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.299
 Like call your friends and you had a spoon 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.299
 good luck everyone all bye
