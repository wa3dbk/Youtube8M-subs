 wanted to emphasize, for example, fascinated the automatic at the photo booth 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.489
 Photography is 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.859

 that the shots had the political consequences 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.609
 as far as you accept 4 or 8 different pictures of yourself 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.930
 somehow you also accept a story about yourself 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.929
 Fasting Kings 2 8 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:55.949
 For neutral background no zoom in the photo booths let the user 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.969
 not give a lot of freedom the imagination of the artist seems this if 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.389
 I, however, to be stimulated 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.849
 a separation

 he suffers min 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.469
 Sometimes, for example, you can get the seat out and put a ladder in it 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.590
 Cabin stand 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.740
 who let ourselves be boosted for different heights 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.279
 I also like to use different color filters in front of the glass 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:33.789
 or colorful paper on the back wall in december could be in a photo 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.639

 to pose her 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.559
 the result can be seen on the net 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:00.969
 Meeting point is the Fanpark There are funny surprises in the project 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.729
 alone in the place we have photos with their customers for example 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.659
 there are many dogs 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.770
 there was no mouse on a photo 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.210
 the Volvo stopped 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.139

 In every city, people react differently 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.759
 in Berlin, for example, we met many people with a sense of art who 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.339
 have made great photos Reuters 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:45.339
 when we were against Italy and Finland, the people were more reserved and 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.969
 just made a kind of passport photo 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.729
 but we also think super vacationers can 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.759
 this is going on 18 an Argentine photo artist is driving the alienation of the

 he was in Berlin where the cabins are outside, one was on one 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.500
 Sidewalk he sat down with a mirror in and left the project 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:08.709
 open as an example for the use of the photo booth completely around and after 

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.369
 I repeatedly portrait pictures of themselves but pictures of the environment 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:16.229
 reflected in the media so aligned that the machine street scenes 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.229
 Löw is a bit of a learning shaft 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.099
 The history of the photo booth is available in English 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.199
