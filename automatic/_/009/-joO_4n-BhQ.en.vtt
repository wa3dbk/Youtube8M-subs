enough temple fast-paced game they have

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.819 
enough temple fast-paced game they have
a<00:01:27.090> lot<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> new<00:01:27.689> faces<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.229> year<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> think

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
a lot of new faces this year I think

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.649 
a lot of new faces this year I think
they<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.280> least<00:01:29.430> 10<00:01:29.790> freshmen<00:01:30.060> coming<00:01:30.479> in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
they have at least 10 freshmen coming in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.140 
they have at least 10 freshmen coming in
not<00:01:31.380> sure<00:01:31.409> how<00:01:31.710> many<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.950> them<00:01:32.070> play<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
not sure how many of them play so I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.399 
not sure how many of them play so I
think<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.420> there<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:33.810> youth<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
think that there are youth and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.640 
think that there are youth and
inexperience<00:01:35.990> that'll<00:01:36.990> probably<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
inexperience that'll probably one of the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
inexperience that'll probably one of the
things<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.250> pray<00:01:38.460> hope<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.970> take

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
things that we can pray hope to take

advantage of the seats are empty now but

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.490 
advantage of the seats are empty now but
