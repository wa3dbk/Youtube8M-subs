much
but<00:02:20.870> with<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.990> twist<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.380> telle<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:23.100> does

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
but with the twist to telle it it does

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.950 
but with the twist to telle it it does
make<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.610> real<00:02:23.940> big<00:02:24.240> difference<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.720> it's

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
make a real big difference because it's

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:43.910 
make a real big difference because it's
very<00:02:25.080> strat<00:02:25.560> like

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.190 

then<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.040> back<00:02:45.220> pick<00:02:45.580> up<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:46.200> broadcaster

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
then the back pick up is a broadcaster

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.490 
then the back pick up is a broadcaster
type<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.530> pickup<00:02:47.890> but<00:02:48.130> it's<00:02:48.600> not<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.840> why

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
type of pickup but it's not is why

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.560 
type of pickup but it's not is why
resounding<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.310> classic<00:02:51.820> broadcaster<00:02:52.480> and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
resounding is a classic broadcaster and

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.210 
resounding is a classic broadcaster and
I<00:02:52.660> think<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.960> has<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.080> little<00:02:53.260> bit<00:02:53.440> more<00:02:53.500> output

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
I think it has a little bit more output

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.560 
I think it has a little bit more output
also<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.580> even<00:03:00.670> by<00:03:00.910> turning<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.360> tone

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
also and even by turning the tone

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.940 
also and even by turning the tone
control<00:03:01.990> down<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> little<00:03:02.500> bit<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.620> was<00:03:02.800> just

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
control down a little bit I was just

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.650 
control down a little bit I was just
fooling<00:03:03.130> around<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.640> couple<00:03:03.940> minutes<00:03:04.180> ago<00:03:04.480> with

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
fooling around a couple minutes ago with

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.800 
fooling around a couple minutes ago with
this<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.830> get<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:05.980> nice<00:03:06.220> fat<00:03:06.580> almost<00:03:07.090> p90

particularly<00:05:24.060> with<00:05:24.960> this<00:05:25.169> twist<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.680> telling

neck<00:05:26.160> pickup<00:05:26.490> is<00:05:26.639> and<00:05:26.790> what<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.270> when<00:05:27.389> you

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
neck pickup is and what is that when you

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.140 
neck pickup is and what is that when you
overdrive<00:05:28.139> it<00:05:28.320> it<00:05:28.800> really<00:05:29.160> still<00:05:29.580> retains<00:05:29.910> all

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
overdrive it it really still retains all

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.590 
overdrive it it really still retains all
of<00:05:30.300> its<00:05:30.419> definition<00:05:30.630> and<00:05:31.610> twang<00:05:32.610> factor<00:05:33.210> and

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
of its definition and twang factor and

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.750 
of its definition and twang factor and
and<00:05:34.080> it's<00:05:34.290> sort<00:05:34.590> of<00:05:34.680> like<00:05:34.860> togetherness<00:05:35.550> its

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
and it's sort of like togetherness its

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.060 
and it's sort of like togetherness its
cohesiveness<00:05:36.389> I<00:05:36.750> think<00:05:37.410> these<00:05:37.530> two<00:05:37.740> pickups

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
cohesiveness I think these two pickups

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.740 
cohesiveness I think these two pickups
together<00:05:38.400> are<00:05:38.700> a<00:05:38.940> really<00:05:39.570> really<00:05:39.600> great

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
together are a really really great

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.710 
together are a really really great
musical<00:05:42.750> marriage<00:05:43.020> of<00:05:43.169> pickups<00:05:43.560> if<00:05:43.740> you<00:05:43.889> will
