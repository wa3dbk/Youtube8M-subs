 this design go through your channel 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.070
 let's start applying in two fingers 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.950
 this beautiful opi color that is a 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.640
 super pigmented beige is called 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.110
 go to pat van gogh the rest of our 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.540
 I'm going to paint them with this color of 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.900
 revlon that is a dark green super 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.400
 super cute that is the tone 225 django and 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.379
 finally i will need these guides 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.720
 for the French that come in thousands of 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.760
 million patrician kits from 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.020
 maybelline a lot of brands and that 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.300
 You can probably find them in 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.610
 pharmacies but artisanal and finally 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.440
 if they do not have they can cut tape 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.059
 adhesive to use it as a guide I will 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.680
 paste the first thing in my hand to remove 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.810
 the excess glue we do not want that 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.550
 the enamel is lifted and then 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.950
 remove it I'm going to stick it on my nail 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.479
 focusing it and the best possible so 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.060
 this can be a bit difficult so 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.850
 I have a trick that I do that is 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.100
 make a line right in the middle of the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.660
 sticker and then put my nail and so 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.910
 makes it much easier for me to know in what 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.950
 place should be the medium I'm going to 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.649
 paste it very well having a lot 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.160
 careful to stick it well in the part of 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.160
 the corners 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.820
 and with the green tone I'm going to start 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.760
 paint the entire tip of the nail so that 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.650
 that is half-circle half moon I'm going to 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.150
 Try to remove a little excess with 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.540
 an orange stick and I will repeat what 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.220
 same in the other one eye that is much more 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.750
 easy to remove the sticker when the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.010
 enamel is still wet if 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.720
 you wait for the 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.170
 enamel is most likely to be 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.170
 I raised 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.660
 then I will use a glue from 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.300
 nails and here I am showing you the one 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.400

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.710
 I like this club because it has a 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.240
 brush like enamel but you 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.770
 they could also occupy perfectly 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.390
 whatever you find fairs 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.400

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.350

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.840

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.910
 wheels that are round and golden 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.860
 and I'll apply some glue 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.810

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.670

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.050
 we are almost ready 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.370
 and then I'm going to take my favorite top that 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.620
 is the quick-drying enamel sealer 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.079

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.749
 coat first well stuck in the area of 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.730

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.760

 hands dry a lot and they start to 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.849
