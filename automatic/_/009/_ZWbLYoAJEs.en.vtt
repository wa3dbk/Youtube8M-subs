talking about various ways when we start

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.480 
talking about various ways when we start
out<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.929> single<00:00:13.290> finger<00:00:13.650> melody<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
adding a third below the melody so

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.850 
adding a third below the melody so
instead<00:00:51.700> of<00:00:51.760> just<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:52.060> melody<00:00:52.680> we'll<00:00:53.680> put<00:00:53.830> a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
instead of just a melody we'll put a

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:09.390 
instead of just a melody we'll put a
third<00:00:54.160> below

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:28.800 

sorry<00:01:10.400> about<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.730> have

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.510 

and<00:01:29.810> we<00:01:29.870> said<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.229> Third's<00:01:30.680> don't<00:01:31.340> work

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
and we said the Third's don't work

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.430 
and we said the Third's don't work
everywhere<00:01:32.090> they<00:01:32.240> work<00:01:32.750> most<00:01:33.020> of<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.229> time

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
everywhere they work most of the time

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.440 
everywhere they work most of the time
but<00:01:33.619> sometimes<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.310> just<00:01:34.490> doesn't<00:01:35.090> work<00:01:35.299> so

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
but sometimes it just doesn't work so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.870 
but sometimes it just doesn't work so
you<00:01:35.900> could<00:01:36.260> put<00:01:36.440> in<00:01:36.530> 1/4<00:01:36.920> instead<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.369> 1/3<00:01:37.640> or

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
you could put in 1/4 instead of 1/3 or

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.640 
you could put in 1/4 instead of 1/3 or
just<00:01:38.090> play<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.450> melody<00:01:38.540> by<00:01:38.840> itself<00:01:39.140> it

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
just play the melody by itself it

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.770 
just play the melody by itself it
doesn't<00:01:39.860> matter<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.580> then<00:01:41.270> we<00:01:41.420> took<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:41.720> a

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
doesn't matter and then we took it a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.200 
doesn't matter and then we took it a
step<00:01:41.810> further<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.560> we<00:01:43.100> add<00:01:43.250> an<00:01:43.400> octave<00:01:43.880> thirds

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
step further and we add an octave thirds

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.760 
step further and we add an octave thirds
in<00:01:44.540> other<00:01:44.659> words<00:01:44.869> we<00:01:44.990> played<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.350> melody<00:01:45.530> in

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
in other words we played the melody in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.880 
in other words we played the melody in
octaves<00:01:46.509> but<00:01:47.509> beneath<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.930> top<00:01:48.290> octave<00:01:48.740> we

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
octaves but beneath the top octave we

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.300 
octaves but beneath the top octave we
fill<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:49.280> 1/3<00:01:49.670> ok<00:01:53.649> that's<00:01:54.649> when<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.040> want<00:01:55.250> a

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
fill in 1/3 ok that's when you want a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:16.180 
fill in 1/3 ok that's when you want a
little<00:01:55.490> stronger<00:01:55.909> melody

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
it a step further and instead of just

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.110 
it a step further and instead of just
thirds<00:02:25.710> let's<00:02:26.010> put<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.220> whole<00:02:26.430> quart<00:02:26.880> in

you<00:03:01.220> get<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.520> idea

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
you get that idea

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.330 
you get that idea
it<00:03:02.630> creates<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.500> creates<00:03:03.800> a<00:03:03.890> much<00:03:04.100> bigger

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
it creates a it creates a much bigger

that's called a two-step you said a
one-note

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.520 

well<00:03:31.910> that's<00:03:32.120> lousy<00:03:32.450> example<00:03:33.110> but<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.320> get

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
well that's lousy example but you get

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.260 
well that's lousy example but you get
the<00:03:33.650> idea<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.130> play<00:03:34.430> two<00:03:34.670> at<00:03:34.820> once

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
the idea so you play two at once

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.860 
the idea so you play two at once
I<00:03:35.300> mean<00:03:35.720> two<00:03:36.700> two<00:03:37.700> notes<00:03:38.000> in<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.270> place<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:38.510> one

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
I mean two two notes in the place of one

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.690 
I mean two two notes in the place of one
there<00:03:39.110> okay<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.680> you'd<00:03:39.950> fill<00:03:40.160> in<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.430> entire

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
there okay and you'd fill in the entire

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.580 
there okay and you'd fill in the entire
octave<00:03:41.090> okay<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.930> left<00:03:42.110> hand<00:03:42.290> encounter

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
octave okay and the left hand encounter

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.740 
octave okay and the left hand encounter
kind<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.100> strum<00:03:43.340> but<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.120> just<00:03:44.330> wanted<00:03:44.600> to

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
kind of strum but I just wanted to

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.360 
kind of strum but I just wanted to
illustrate<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.530> fact<00:03:45.740> that<00:03:45.860> you<00:03:46.010> can<00:03:46.130> go<00:03:46.250> from

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
illustrate the fact that you can go from

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.940 
illustrate the fact that you can go from
a<00:03:46.520> single<00:03:46.730> melody<00:03:47.000> two<00:03:47.660> thirds<00:03:48.110> in<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.560> melody

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
a single melody two thirds in the melody

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.420 
a single melody two thirds in the melody
to<00:03:49.550> octave<00:03:50.000> thirds<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:51.610> complete<00:03:52.610> chords<00:03:54.430> and

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
to octave thirds to complete chords and

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.130 
to octave thirds to complete chords and
it<00:03:55.640> doesn't<00:03:55.940> always<00:03:56.090> work<00:03:56.240> but<00:03:56.630> it<00:03:56.750> works<00:03:56.870> most

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
it doesn't always work but it works most

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.290 
it doesn't always work but it works most
of<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.380> time<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.920> if<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.970> doesn't<00:03:59.120> work

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
of the time and if it doesn't work

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.790 
of the time and if it doesn't work
sometimes<00:03:59.450> just<00:03:59.840> leave<00:04:00.080> leave<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.650> middle

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
sometimes just leave leave the middle

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.610 
sometimes just leave leave the middle
notes<00:04:00.980> out<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.370> put<00:04:01.490> it<00:04:01.550> in<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.670> octave<00:04:02.030> okay

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
notes out and put it in the octave okay

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.560 
notes out and put it in the octave okay
so<00:04:03.620> I<00:04:03.890> hope<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.190> helps<00:04:04.700> gives<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.120> few
