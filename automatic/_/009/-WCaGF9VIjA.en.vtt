the<00:03:15.150> finger<00:03:15.390> positioning<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:15.989> something<00:03:16.230> that

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
the finger positioning is something that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.990 
the finger positioning is something that
Logan's<00:03:16.650> been<00:03:16.739> working<00:03:17.070> on<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.700> actually

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
Logan's been working on and actually

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.120 
Logan's been working on and actually
thought<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.269> were<00:03:18.330> showing<00:03:18.540> off<00:03:18.750> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
thought we were showing off the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.400 
thought we were showing off the
individual<00:03:20.130> notes<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.900> think<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.230> just

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
individual notes so I think that just

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.630 
individual notes so I think that just
shows<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.709> fat<00:03:23.010> fingers<00:03:23.040> on<00:03:23.519> here<00:03:28.640> so

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
shows I have fat fingers on here so

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.449 
shows I have fat fingers on here so
here's<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.150> single<00:03:30.390> note<00:03:30.690> set<00:03:30.959> up<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:32.250> actually

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
here's a single note set up and actually

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.800 
here's a single note set up and actually
you<00:03:32.880> know<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.120> we're<00:03:33.299> gonna<00:03:33.390> go<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.630> show

you know and we're gonna go to show

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.090 
you know and we're gonna go to show
there's<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.110> number<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.380> apps<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.799> work<00:03:34.920> with

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
there's a number of apps that work with

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
instrument digital input you can

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.520 
instrument digital input you can
actually<00:03:48.450> use<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> number<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.350> apps
