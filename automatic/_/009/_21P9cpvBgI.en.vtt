00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
worried that people could end up losing

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.770 
worried that people could end up losing
their<00:01:43.670> jobs<00:01:43.909> you're<00:01:44.119> having<00:01:44.300> their<00:01:44.420> hours<00:01:44.690> cut

their jobs you're having their hours cut

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.570 
their jobs you're having their hours cut
because<00:01:45.080> of<00:01:45.229> Obamacare<00:01:45.800> oh<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.340> already

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
because of Obamacare oh it's already

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.359 
because of Obamacare oh it's already
happened<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.119> my<00:01:47.240> father<00:01:47.450> yeah<00:01:48.369> Obamacare

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
happened to my father yeah Obamacare

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.760 
happened to my father yeah Obamacare
gives<00:01:49.580> 47<00:01:50.240> separate<00:01:50.570> powers<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.200> IRS<00:01:51.500> do

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
gives 47 separate powers to the IRS do

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.749 
gives 47 separate powers to the IRS do
you<00:01:51.830> think<00:01:52.009> that's<00:01:52.160> a<00:01:52.220> good<00:01:52.340> thing<00:01:52.520> or<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.729> bad

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
you think that's a good thing or a bad

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.760 
you think that's a good thing or a bad
thing<00:01:52.910> I<00:01:53.450> think<00:01:53.690> less<00:01:53.869> power<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.410> IRS<00:01:54.649> to

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
thing I think less power to the IRS to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.279 
thing I think less power to the IRS to
be<00:01:54.860> better<00:01:55.039> than<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.340> more<00:01:55.490> Bowers<00:01:56.229> why<00:01:57.229> is

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
be better than the more Bowers why is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.779 
be better than the more Bowers why is
that<00:01:57.380> more<00:01:57.830> power<00:01:58.009> probably<00:01:58.429> means<00:01:58.580> more

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
that more power probably means more

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.639 
that more power probably means more
revenue<00:01:59.090> more<00:01:59.270> taxes<00:01:59.690> for<00:02:00.170> dollars<00:02:00.470> out<00:02:00.619> of

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
that's a good idea not so much not for

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.710 
that's a good idea not so much not for
what<00:02:07.729> we're<00:02:07.820> getting<00:02:07.909> out<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.600> know

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
it's just taking more and more money out

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.220 
it's just taking more and more money out
of<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.729> economy<00:02:11.000> it's<00:02:11.840> one<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:12.050> those<00:02:12.110> things

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
of the economy it's one of those things

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
and if they don't repeal it soon enough

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.180 
and if they don't repeal it soon enough
it's<00:02:24.140> going<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.350> be<00:02:24.470> permanent<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:24.950> we're<00:02:25.130> in

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
it's going to be permanent and we're in

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.069 
it's going to be permanent and we're in
big<00:02:25.340> trouble<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:26.150> that's<00:02:26.390> why<00:02:26.570> we<00:02:26.780> have<00:02:26.930> this

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
big trouble so that's why we have this

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.539 
big trouble so that's why we have this
billboard<00:02:27.350> saying<00:02:27.739> Obamacare<00:02:28.340> may<00:02:28.489> be
