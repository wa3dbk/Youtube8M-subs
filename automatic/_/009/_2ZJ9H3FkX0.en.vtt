00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
pros when it comes to a flexible partial

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.750 
pros when it comes to a flexible partial
denture<00:00:14.929> basically<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.760> partial

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
denture basically this is what a partial

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.529 
denture basically this is what a partial
denture<00:00:17.910> looks<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.800> it's<00:00:19.800> called<00:00:20.609> partial

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
denture looks like it's called partial

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.480 
denture looks like it's called partial
denture<00:00:21.960> because<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.320> only<00:00:22.470> replacing<00:00:23.160> part

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
denture because it's only replacing part

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.849 
denture because it's only replacing part
of<00:00:23.699> your<00:00:24.300> teeth<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.960> your<00:00:24.990> mouth<00:00:25.109> only<00:00:25.650> the

of your teeth in your mouth only the
ones<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.189> you're<00:00:26.310> missing<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:27.720> flexible

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
ones that you're missing and flexible

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.240 
ones that you're missing and flexible
because<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.789> acrylic<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.529> half<00:00:31.529> base<00:00:31.920> it's

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
because the acrylic is half base it's

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.569 
because the acrylic is half base it's
50%<00:00:33.090> acrylic<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> 50%<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.130> rubber<00:00:35.340> base

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
50% acrylic and the 50% of a rubber base

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.840 
50% acrylic and the 50% of a rubber base
material<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.140> return<00:00:38.010> hints<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> gets

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
material which in return hints it gets

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.510 
material which in return hints it gets
its<00:00:39.030> name<00:00:39.059> flexible<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.190> great

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
its name flexible what it it's great

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.240 
its name flexible what it it's great
because<00:00:41.850> there's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.780> lot<00:00:43.050> less<00:00:43.410> adjusting

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
because there's a lot less adjusting

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.549 
because there's a lot less adjusting
with<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> flexible<00:00:45.420> partial<00:00:45.690> denture<00:00:46.260> than

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
with a flexible partial denture than

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.990 
with a flexible partial denture than
there<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:46.890> an<00:00:47.190> acrylic<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
there is with an acrylic because the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.700 
there is with an acrylic because the
acrylic<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.420> much<00:00:48.600> harder<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
acrylic is much harder and with the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.819 
acrylic is much harder and with the
flexible<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.579> actually<00:00:51.030> flex<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:52.620> fit

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
flexible one it actually flex to fit

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
flexible one it actually flex to fit
your<00:00:53.010> mouth<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.719> keep

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
your mouth so you don't have to keep

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
your mouth so you don't have to keep
going<00:00:55.020> back<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.500> general<00:00:55.829> dentist<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
going back to your general dentist and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
going back to your general dentist and
getting<00:00:56.610> adjustments<00:00:57.270> done<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> time<00:00:57.989> in

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
getting adjustments done all the time in

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.110 
getting adjustments done all the time in
order<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.590> form<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> fit<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.789> mouth

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
order to form it to fit to your mouth

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.180 
order to form it to fit to your mouth
and<00:01:00.420> actually<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.289> basically<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.649> custom

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and actually just basically a custom

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.440 
and actually just basically a custom
fits<00:01:02.460> itself<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.539> your<00:01:03.629> mouth<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.710> type<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
fits itself to your mouth the type of

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.450 
fits itself to your mouth the type of
base<00:01:06.450> material<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:08.130> partial

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
base material that is on a partial

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.910 
base material that is on a partial
denture<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.150> heats<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> warmth<00:01:10.799> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
denture it heats up with the warmth of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.679 
denture it heats up with the warmth of
your<00:01:10.979> mouth<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.549> then<00:01:11.790> therefore<00:01:12.299> becomes<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
your mouth and then therefore becomes a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.929 
your mouth and then therefore becomes a
lot<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:12.810> pliable<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.650> flexible<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.340> there's

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
lot more pliable and flexible so there's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.530 
lot more pliable and flexible so there's
a<00:01:15.000> lot<00:01:15.210> less<00:01:15.740> adjustments<00:01:16.850> also<00:01:17.850> too<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.360> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
a lot less adjustments also too so it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
a lot less adjustments also too so it's
a<00:01:18.720> lot<00:01:18.960> less<00:01:19.170> time<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.799> go<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
a lot less time you have to go see the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.210 
a lot less time you have to go see the
dentist<00:01:20.750> plus<00:01:21.750> -<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.500> actually<00:01:22.830> choose<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
dentist plus - you can actually choose a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880 
dentist plus - you can actually choose a
different<00:01:23.520> kind<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.939> color<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.590> acrylic

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
different kind of color of the acrylic

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.800 
different kind of color of the acrylic
so<00:01:26.280> therefore<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.790> match<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.299> shade<00:01:27.570> of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
so therefore it can match the shade of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.499 
so therefore it can match the shade of
the<00:01:28.350> gums<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.740> are<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.040> your<00:01:29.159> mouth<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.329> then

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the gums that are in your mouth and then

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
the gums that are in your mouth and then
basically<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> lot<00:01:31.590> more<00:01:31.770> comfortable<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
basically it's a lot more comfortable to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
basically it's a lot more comfortable to
eat<00:01:32.400> where<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.659> lot<00:01:33.780> easier<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.350> get

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
eat where and it's a lot easier to get

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.160 
eat where and it's a lot easier to get
used<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.030> because<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.329> won't<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
used to because you won't you don't you

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.050 
used to because you won't you don't you
will<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.380> tend<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> get<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:38.009> many<00:01:38.189> sore<00:01:38.700> spots

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
will not tend to get as many sore spots

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.450 
will not tend to get as many sore spots
as<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.270> would<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.900> an<00:01:40.140> acrylic<00:01:40.409> denture<00:01:40.710> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
as you would with an acrylic denture so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.760 
as you would with an acrylic denture so
basically<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.420> different<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.930> pros<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.680> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
basically the different the pros when it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
basically the different the pros when it
comes<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> flexible<00:01:44.579> partial<00:01:44.790> denture<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
comes to a flexible partial denture is
