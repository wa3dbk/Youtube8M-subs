00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.400
 or the secretive as in the title today 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.260
 I bring you a new video review the 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.389
 channel this time we're going to talk about 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.700
 two of cody that pringles this is a 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.940
 novel of the neo editorial and has 300 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.940
 pages 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.390
 bianchi her friends are some girls 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.640
 normal students like guys 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.830
 they go to parties they go to dances the only 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.110
 problem is that one of them does not 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.220
 I really like to do this kind of thing and 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.590
 I mean bianca, which is the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.840
 protagonist Kate and Jessica who are the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.760
 Two best friends of Dianca are 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.810
 they find dancing in a bar 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.520
 having fun 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.500
 while every time as most 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.930
 of time our protagonist does not 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.460
 considers the most beautiful of its group but 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.980
 if it's smart enough 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.900
 to outwit the most attractive guy and 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.700
 womanizer that there is in the institute and 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.560
 now our male protagonist the 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.880
 which is weasley ralph these two 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.800
 protagonists are from the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.660
 first chapter in a whitney bar by 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.909
 nature principle approaches her 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.040
 to introduce her friends and 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.570
 to be able to have a night with her as 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.820
 I said it before, it's what 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.860
 smart enough then I swear 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.420
 or ignores that none of the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.210
 girls from school I would because it's the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.770
 most handsome that exists in school 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.240
 it seems that the relationship between these two 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.650
 characters will stay that way for a long time 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.350
 time and what will be 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.420
 I hate hate and more hate but soon 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.310
 we will discover that it will not be like that in one of 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.500
 these holidays where they would go with 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.360
 her friends casey and jessica will end 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.670
 kissing weekly rose at this moment 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.800
 begins a relationship of love and hate 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.800
 where they begin to use their bodies 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.300
 to relax and de-stress begin 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.580
 to have relationships begin to have 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.500
 sex to get away from the problems that 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.000
 they have and while all this happens 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.020
 they will realize that they have much more in 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.750
 common than I thought 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.250
 janka has a nickname which is 2 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.479
 phil I will not tell you what it means for 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.479
 go and read it 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.720
 Y 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.280
 I have a lot to say about this book 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.200
 because I've loved it since the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.539
 characters from the drama from the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.610
 history since as cody kretsinger we 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.310
 narrates this fascinating romance novel 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.560
 the setting everything from the first 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.810
 chapter the book I get hooked because 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.110
 I knew it was not cliché and that it was not so 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.730
 simple and as common as any novel 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.220
 romantic youth that we see today 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.010
 klínger code tells us a story 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.900
 very realistic and very contemporary is not 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.730
 the same old story that 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.890
 Chava is totally in love with the guy 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.300
 and falls in his arms and falls in love 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.550
 fully and is a love story 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.440
 forever this starts it like this 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.870
 begins with a relationship of hatred and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.790
 superb towards a character I love 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.580
 the touches of humor that you add with 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.350
 klínger are a little epic humor 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.880
 because I do not know many authors who 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.160
 handle this kind of humor that makes you 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.840
 laugh out loud laughter and our 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.850
 white main character also me 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.590
 loved it is very smart and pretty 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.910
 brave I also have to accept that 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.560
 have your moments I mean your 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.360
 moments of confusion your moments of 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.940
 sad 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.350
 drama depression but it's a novel 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.660
 there has to be a bit of all code 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.820
 klínger is not a complicated narrator 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.500
 in the absolute narrates total and of a 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.040
 very simple way 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.030
 that is, you can understand, you can reach me 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.410
 identify with the characters that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.330
 she believes before people who 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.830
 secondary to the main I think 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.300
 which are pretty good 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.490
 literally it is a book that does not have 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.170
 hairs on the tongue knows neither is erased nor 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.970
 stops for nothing describes you the 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.280
 things like teenagers currently 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.630
 we do it good director at least I 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.330
 when I started the book I could not 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.800
 to stop I read like 150 pages like that of a 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.020
 only hit is in the middle of the book 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.239
 because it was literally being like that 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.190
 so I've stuck all day all day and 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.620
 all night as in is a book that 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.780
 It was full of post-it and also 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.220
 they underlined some parts besides I have 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.680
 have to confess that books that have 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.540
 a post up here is for some reason 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.950
 important almost always those who have 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.230
 some healthy carnival stalls that I 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.300
 they end up pleasing if here is that 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.970
 cut the chapters are going fast are 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.670
 pretty nimble to read are pretty 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.650
 addictive you will laugh out loud 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.840
 I kept laughing at many of the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.760
 chapter I also got corny and I started 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.980
 to sigh for some characters that do not 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.620
 I know why I did it but I did it too 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.630
 I got a little sad with the 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.489
 protagonist is the point of the story 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.650
 have a problem then that problem 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.300
 it's like those things that squeeze your 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.620
 heart they make you squeeze it up 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.990
 that there is some tear of those 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.400
 tears that are like to arrive and 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.990
 embrace the protagonist tell you I'm 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.669
 with you but good enough of 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.530
 5 stars on five 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.480
 in nutrients because it is worth it to be 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.310
 100% recommended if you want not have 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.020
 nothing letter or if you want to buy it from 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.610
 For some time now they have been waiting for a book 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.050
 fantastic and it's a level I'm sure 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.240
 that will be in my top 10 books 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.190
 read or in 2014 and if so, it was 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.900
 with the bookstore and they saw it I hope 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.820
 go running to the bookstore and buy 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.590
 I do not know what is a bit expensive but buy what 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.060
 because it's worth every penny even though it's not 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.310
 you can hit because the truth is that 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.360
 I would study a lot but finish 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.790
 purchase video 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.850
 remember to read everything because it is a book 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.229
 very very good and very agile to read this 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.669
 is in the review I hope there is 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.380
 liked remember that I have networks 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.390
 can not find and that between 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.960
 they are 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.670
 roger waters sound instagram and my other 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.410
 YouTube account where I'm uploading 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.000
 videos more often all these networks 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.010

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.900

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.680

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.060
 find 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.010
 and finally remember that reader does not 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.570
 choose a book but the book chooses 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.700
 reader see you in the next video 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.490
