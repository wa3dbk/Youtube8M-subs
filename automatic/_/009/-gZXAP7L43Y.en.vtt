yet you can't because if you want to

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.670 
yet you can't because if you want to
compete<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.880> have<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.239> have<00:03:52.480> another<00:03:53.170> Renault

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
compete you have to have another Renault

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.460

a<00:03:54.000> sports<00:03:55.000> one<00:03:55.269> that<00:03:55.720> is<00:03:55.870> specifically

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
a sports one that is specifically

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.069 
a sports one that is specifically
constructed<00:03:57.190> for<00:03:57.579> racing<00:03:57.970> so<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.810> car

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
constructed for racing so this car

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.770 
constructed for racing so this car
really<00:03:59.799> seems<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.430> be<00:04:00.549> a<00:04:00.819> total<00:04:01.390> waste<00:04:01.540> of

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
really seems to be a total waste of

really seems to be a total waste of
space

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:37.689 
of this car because actually as a

of this car because actually as a
driver's<00:05:38.409> machine<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:39.069> is<00:05:39.129> splendid<00:05:39.870> but<00:05:40.870> the

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
driver's machine it is splendid but the

driver's machine it is splendid but the
problem<00:05:41.289> is<00:05:41.409> there's<00:05:41.860> no<00:05:42.009> way<00:05:42.219> it's<00:05:42.550> any<00:05:42.729> use

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
problem is there's no way it's any use

problem is there's no way it's any use
to<00:05:43.090> you<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.810> probably<00:05:44.319> would<00:05:44.770> work<00:05:44.919> as<00:05:45.189> a<00:05:45.219> third

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
to you it probably would work as a third
