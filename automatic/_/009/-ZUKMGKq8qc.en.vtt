00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
biggest thing for me is really about

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.630 
biggest thing for me is really about
adaptive<00:00:24.869> gameplay<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.650> regardless<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.519> how

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
adaptive gameplay so regardless of how

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.490

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
good you are how good you are with the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.439 
good you are how good you are with the
game<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.250> games<00:00:29.460> will<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.670> adjust<00:00:30.060> itself<00:00:30.330> to

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
game the games will to adjust itself to

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.299 
game the games will to adjust itself to
you<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.050> variety<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.470> categories<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.219> you

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you in a variety of categories so if you

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.100 
you in a variety of categories so if you
have<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> hard<00:00:32.730> time<00:00:32.910> rushing<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> ball<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
have a hard time rushing the ball and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.540 
have a hard time rushing the ball and
you<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.290> an<00:00:34.380> easy<00:00:34.590> time<00:00:34.710> passing<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> ball

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you have an easy time passing the ball

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.590 
you have an easy time passing the ball
it's<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.270> harder<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it's that's going to make it harder to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.690 
it's that's going to make it harder to
pass<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> easier<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> rush<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.579> even

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
pass and easier to rush and I think even

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.030 
pass and easier to rush and I think even
for<00:00:38.850> our<00:00:39.030> most<00:00:39.270> casual<00:00:39.719> fans<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.739> game<00:00:40.920> will

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
for our most casual fans the game will

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.440 
for our most casual fans the game will
be<00:00:41.129> much<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.520> accessible<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.120> them<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
be much more accessible with them and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
be much more accessible with them and
for<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> hardcore<00:00:42.840> guys<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.770> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> push

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

progress<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.320> version<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.860> things

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
progress in this version and things

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.890 
progress in this version and things
maybe<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.820> guys<00:01:05.970> didn't<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> chance<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
maybe you guys didn't get a chance to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.980 
maybe you guys didn't get a chance to
add<00:01:07.049> man<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.100> SLO<00:01:08.340> 9<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.119> biggest<00:01:09.570> leap

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
add man and SLO 9 is the biggest leap

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.179 
add man and SLO 9 is the biggest leap
forward<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.500> graphics<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.950> we've<00:01:11.100> ever

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
forward and graphics that we've ever

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.010 
forward and graphics that we've ever
seen<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> franchise<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.689> think<00:01:12.780> we've

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
seen the franchise and I think we've

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.359 
seen the franchise and I think we've
done<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.350> couple<00:01:13.380> different<00:01:13.680> ways<00:01:13.920> first

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
done in a couple different ways first

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.460 
done in a couple different ways first
I'll<00:01:14.670> mention<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.509> finally<00:01:15.810> hit<00:01:16.049> 60

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I'll mention that we finally hit 60

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
I'll mention that we finally hit 60
