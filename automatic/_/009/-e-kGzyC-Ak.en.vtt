00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
probably the best finger protection I've

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.790 
probably the best finger protection I've
ever<00:02:26.520> had

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
ever had

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.250 
ever had
right<00:02:28.800> here<00:02:29.130> he<00:02:29.400> added<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:31.050> is

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
right here he added that and this is

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.190 
right here he added that and this is
really<00:02:31.290> nice<00:02:31.830> because<00:02:32.160> um<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:33.660> doesn't<00:02:33.690> get

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
really nice because um this doesn't get

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.320 
really nice because um this doesn't get
in<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.350> way<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.800> stick<00:02:35.130> because<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.060> moves

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
in the way of the stick because it moves

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.010 
in the way of the stick because it moves
with<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.470> your<00:02:38.220> stick<00:02:38.610> with<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.660> lays

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
with it so your stick with it like lays

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.650 
with it so your stick with it like lays
on<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.350> stick<00:02:40.860> pretty<00:02:41.220> much<00:02:41.600> it's<00:02:42.600> just

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
on the stick pretty much it's just

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.600 
on the stick pretty much it's just
really<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.290> nice<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.830> seals<00:02:44.040> up<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.400> hole

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
really really nice so it seals up a hole

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.390 
really really nice so it seals up a hole
as<00:02:44.850> well<00:02:45.170> which<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.350> great<00:02:48.590> but<00:02:49.590> uh<00:02:49.650> yeah<00:02:50.250> it's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
as well which is great but uh yeah it's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.420 
as well which is great but uh yeah it's
pretty<00:02:50.550> yes<00:02:50.850> standard<00:02:51.420> rather<00:02:51.660> than<00:02:51.840> that

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
pretty yes standard rather than that

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.920 
pretty yes standard rather than that
really<00:02:53.430> nice<00:02:53.610> blocker<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.920> yeah<00:02:56.810> onto<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
really nice blocker so yeah onto the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.470 
really nice blocker so yeah onto the
glove<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.220> where<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.489> gets<00:02:59.670> really<00:02:59.910> kind

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
glove this is where it gets really kind

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.259 
glove this is where it gets really kind
of<00:03:00.570> really<00:03:00.870> confusing<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:02.060> first<00:03:03.060> thing

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
of really confusing so first thing

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.080 
of really confusing so first thing
you'll<00:03:03.390> notice<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.110> closure<00:03:04.910> it's<00:03:05.910> got<00:03:06.060> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
you'll notice is the closure it's got a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.150 
you'll notice is the closure it's got a
really<00:03:06.390> unique<00:03:06.540> closure<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.800> but<00:03:08.040> if

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
really unique closure to it but if

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.880 
really unique closure to it but if
actually<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.820> feels<00:03:09.000> weird<00:03:09.390> at<00:03:09.570> first<00:03:09.600> but<00:03:10.110> now

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
actually it feels weird at first but now

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.180 
actually it feels weird at first but now
it<00:03:11.010> actually<00:03:11.280> feels<00:03:11.519> kind<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.060> nice<00:03:13.190> it's

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
it actually feels kind of nice it's

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.979 
it actually feels kind of nice it's
almost<00:03:14.489> like<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.880> fingers<00:03:15.239> are<00:03:15.390> overlapping

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
almost like the fingers are overlapping

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.220 
almost like the fingers are overlapping
the<00:03:16.470> thumb<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:18.299> it's<00:03:18.480> got<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> really<00:03:18.930> weird

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
the thumb and it's got a really weird

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.920 
the thumb and it's got a really weird
closure<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.549> again<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.880> feels<00:03:21.030> nice<00:03:21.450> though

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.789 

and<00:03:25.400> yeah<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.670> next<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.630> got<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.930> floating<00:03:28.380> tea

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
and yeah so next it's got a floating tea

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.000 
and yeah so next it's got a floating tea
and<00:03:29.670> what<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.329> is<00:03:30.570> it's<00:03:30.930> connected<00:03:31.769> with

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
and what that is it's connected with

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.360 
and what that is it's connected with
laces<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.090> then<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.570> tea<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.930> shortened<00:03:34.410> so

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
laces and then the tea is shortened so

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.910 
laces and then the tea is shortened so
it's<00:03:35.549> almost<00:03:35.670> like<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:35.970> floating<00:03:36.329> effect<00:03:36.920> and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
it's almost like a floating effect and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.400 
it's almost like a floating effect and
it's<00:03:38.549> also<00:03:38.670> got<00:03:38.970> skate<00:03:39.329> lace<00:03:39.570> pockets<00:03:40.110> of

in the pocket also you won't see this
from<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.060> outside<00:03:48.870> but<00:03:49.200> when<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.620> open<00:03:49.980> up

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
opponent's for added protection and it's

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.440 
opponent's for added protection and it's
just<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.140> add<00:04:01.430> adhesive<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.640> there<00:04:02.850> glued<00:04:03.269> in

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
protection and it actually felt weird at

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.780 
protection and it actually felt weird at
first<00:04:10.320> but<00:04:10.650> now<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.010> actually<00:04:11.160> feels<00:04:11.519> pretty

and I don't think this is a picky mod
but<00:04:30.910> it's<00:04:31.750> not<00:04:31.990> on<00:04:32.110> my<00:04:32.260> Kip<00:04:32.470> respect<00:04:32.889> gloves<00:04:33.130> I
