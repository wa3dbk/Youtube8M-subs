00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 in the center of Moscow activists today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.670
 handed out letters 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140
 gutters just so social activists 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.389
 call those motorists who 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.670
 park in parking lots and do not pay for them 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 so that the camera does not count video 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.650
 state number part of it is veiled with a cloth 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.490
 a piece of paper well or some rubbish 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.080
 a kind of raid with activists 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410
 Our correspondent Oleg has gone 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.269
 capable of such items closing state 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.980
 rooms look very strange on expensive 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.330
 foreign cars which park in the center 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.670
 capital with the help of all sorts of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.070
 gadgets car owners hope 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.930
 avoid paying for parking activists 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.620
 trying to bring such drivers to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.120
 clean water photographed taped number 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.309
 then remove what closes the number 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.730
 take pictures again after that we 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.739
 send a message to the website of the Interior Ministry all 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.989
 machines with unreadable numbers activist 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.489
 decorate unusual diplomas drivers 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.239
 that save on parking in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.840
 document 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.410
 called quite a shame and unpleasant by this 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.870
 rumors 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.370
 In words, I think that if a person bought 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.400
 which car for two and a half 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.530
 million and squeezed 50 rubles for parking 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.360
 He forehead then in many parking lots 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.860
 registration marks close each 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.750
 the fourth car owner is all this 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.640
 occurs on the eyes of the inspectors in gbdd 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 but they are such violations as if not 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.540
 notice explaining that before the road 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.390
 police have other tasks 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.240
 number 02 parking battalion is understandable 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.729
 we are not engaged 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.780
 from parking battalion parking 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.090
 who take off the visa and you so on 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.970
 but you yourself can not frustrate we can but 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.799
 and we can train us like me semi poly 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 I canâ€™t explain by day 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.030
 so activists continue to tear off 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.420
 stickers from other people's cars on your own 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.400
 risk 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 it's amazing but for a couple of hours we don't 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.240
 met a single motorist 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.950
 who would show his young people 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.060
 discontent curious what now 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 activists do not meet any 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.380
 Resistance The fact is that the owners 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.180
 cars knowing that they violate the rights 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.130
 prefer not to mess with young 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.530
 people and watch everything that happens 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.660
 so far so far from here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.340
 Moscow was not a single conflict to us 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.410
 just got one driver who 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.540
 honestly admitted that it stuck 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.110
 man is absolutely confident in his 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.480
 right 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.580
 general for adhesive glue stick 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.120
 and why so that it did not come 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.850
 fines 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.890
 Do you know the responsibility there is serious 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.080
 because of and to reflect on you 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.510

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.269

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.040
 paper so on it's actually you 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.950

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.130
 administrative code desire to cheat 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.110
