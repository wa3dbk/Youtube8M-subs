00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.160
 now to be ten years for a designer to take care of the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.160
 text 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.569
 first part we need a title 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.909
 we could imagine having a calculation comments that I get well 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:18.849
 pass 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.849
 we see that I am text 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.739
 the other we will call it 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.739
 an unfortunate port of forgetfulness 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.589
 at 8:20 pm on the text layer we take a little exhibition by drawing a block 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.420
 we are better 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 the clip the big of q2 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.790
 hand in hand 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.250
 in total a paragraph style 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.180
 plus it's a big team 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.250
 the most important point for them 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.080
 the country 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 banid 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.950
 once the hands of lescure 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.550
 we will choose to be born there will be google 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.320
 valbuena 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.320
 we have a good 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.810
 lyon will position these 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.500
 go to that moment 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
 like that 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.980
 not now a young party 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.370
 luc dumont 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.380
 foot over 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.939
 the color a year for five years to sing a part that did not 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.320
 good if I take the palette of color separations 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.770
 in 100 countries 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.240
 overview of separations 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.780
 I'm good pantone colors you can activate these 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.120
 with the separation 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.100
 and I decide to hide everything that does not help bakou apa 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.119
 and I find that 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.709
 my pantone color 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.819
 and over the text outremangers a beautiful skin in the text veil the text 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.189
 would have created a debt towards the purple color 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.329
 I now have a headline 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.309
 I put him expectations 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:32.999
 a color 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.999
 with an outline 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.579
 it will be blank 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.189
 I now go around the lfp given a blank 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.329
 and this for any withdrawal of frau in the pantone color 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.729
 I validate this choice 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.729
 you see your black hair 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.469
 and that the pantone colors kacm 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:00.959
 it's the black of the photo over the law haby text if i post the afp anton 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.189
 is only there pantone 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.699
 roger leblanc of the contest of the text and the black of italians over the pantone 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.549
 so here the artist name has over the pantone will know a little more intense 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.749
 we can still hold some time 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.249
 black 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.049
 from the rest of the country 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.469
 then to guarantee collective be the same color everywhere 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.199
 in the dark mitchell 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.659
 during the advertised everything is offered to you 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.519
 I mentioned in an optics she for me richard 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.809
 benoît riche it's benoît cuche does not have a name yet 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.160
 on which 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
 we are on one foot 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.989
 we went to chaouchi 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.900
 we need our others 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.900
 they can also the proportion of 30% 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.319
 it means we will lose 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.319
 A nuance 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:05.699
 during the interview 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.209
 so we go 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.209
 a color it must contain longer 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.779
 I give a name 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.539
 see things 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.389
 I would like to lie down my checkered flag 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.789
 halak did not hear it open 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.789
 and this pantone of afp this king at 50% 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:30.529
 because it fits 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.529
 for the color that you apply a role in 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:35.949
 I valid 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.020
 this news this lavender color 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.809
 appears in my endurance 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:44.809
 we learn the setting of montpellier 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.360
 I go in the colors of the characters 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.960
 I'm looking for the new color I created the black it houses a small 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.449
 icon here if you live the debate is launched 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.849
 in nord-eclair 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.590
 I chose this color 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.590
 watch out this second round it's all wrong 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.099
 I want a competition in white but at bottom this sport for the memory of the country 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.189
 and now the word talent of the oars are maintained 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:13.460
 during all winter 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.400
 we will not play panthers in the intensity of me child the good 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.740
 slope 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.729
 we have the particularity 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.729
 bangoura resume for this example there 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.219
 and if the track the right just the right the biggest pic these assets for 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.219
 the count of the hardness we're going 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.860
 meanwhile the VAT for this video concretely they lie so we 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.979
