this<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.820> MIDI<00:00:03.179> controller<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.810> made<00:00:04.700> using

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
this is a MIDI controller I made using

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.959 
this is a MIDI controller I made using
the<00:00:05.940> Hale<00:00:06.240> micro<00:00:06.890> UMC<00:00:07.890> 32<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:09.679> basically<00:00:10.969> these

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
the Hale micro UMC 32 so basically these

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.480 
the Hale micro UMC 32 so basically these
I'm<00:00:12.389> using<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.719> with<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.019> Ableton<00:00:13.490> these

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
I'm using it with the Ableton these

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.510 
I'm using it with the Ableton these
basically<00:00:14.910> trigger<00:00:15.480> clips<00:00:16.020> all<00:00:16.830> clips<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.340> one

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
basically trigger clips all clips in one

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.130 
basically trigger clips all clips in one
column<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.240> these<00:00:18.420> trigger<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.869> bunch<00:00:19.050> of

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
column and these trigger a bunch of

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.630 
column and these trigger a bunch of
clips<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.439> different<00:00:19.680> column<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.520> these

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
clips and different column and these

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.939 
clips and different column and these
switch<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.960> loop<00:00:22.410> they're<00:00:22.890> triggering<00:00:23.359> the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
switch what loop they're triggering the

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.870 
switch what loop they're triggering the
faders<00:00:25.949> control<00:00:27.080> Bruins<00:00:28.580> on<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> green<00:00:30.029> one

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
faders control Bruins on the green one

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:57.069 
faders control Bruins on the green one
these<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:33.030> bunch<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.270> effects

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.079 

so<00:00:58.079> then<00:00:58.290> yes<00:00:59.190> oh<00:00:59.339> thanks<00:00:59.550> sugar<00:00:59.670> monthlies

is Mike simultaneously I switched

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.550 
is Mike simultaneously I switched
theories<00:01:53.459> in<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.610> yellow<00:01:53.849> one<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.300> that<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
theories in the yellow one like that the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.880 
theories in the yellow one like that the
bottom<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.690> then<00:01:58.440> yeah<00:01:58.619> these<00:01:58.739> are

bottom like that and then yeah these are

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:15.440 
bottom like that and then yeah these are
just<00:01:59.009> tricks<00:01:59.310> ping<00:01:59.550> clips<00:02:00.330> being<00:02:00.630> triggered
