00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 remember unhappy children who 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.850
 had to wear glasses with glasses 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.440
 the size of a cobblestone now even 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.809
 you have very poor eyesight you can wear 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.099
 fashion glasses with thin and light 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:20.010
 plastic lenses being nerds 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:21.480
 it was then what will become the lenses in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.820
 beginning represent the big 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.859
 plastic discs in the first stage on 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.420
 wear a protective film on the convex tea 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.320
 so as not to damage it during processing 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.320
 concave part 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.120
 the scanner reads the recipe information 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 customers and bring it into the computer 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.010
 drive trays with discs then 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.390
 alloy of seven metals warmed to 50 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.219
 degrees centigrade from molten 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.170
 the masses make the holder using 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.170
 which disk is fixed for processing 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.880
 robots are valid from now on 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.130
 when the disc tray arrives 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.810
 milling machine read information and 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.810
 gives the product the desired shape 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.730
 first he thin the disk reduces it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.860
 diameter and gives the right fold now 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:21.960
 the disc becomes a lens but remains 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.270
 concentric circles from processing yes and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.050
 the surface is rough therefore the lens is ground 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.240
 watering 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.619
 water temperature must be constant 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.619
 otherwise the lens is deformed 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.010
 now when the lens has the right 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.010
 the form is removed metal holder 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.690
 then protective film 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.080
 with a device called a lens 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:18.460
 metro check compliance lenses 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:20.230
 the prescription then the lens goes through 15 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.750
 graded dry cleaning 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.420
 then to make them sustainable 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.670
 scratch varnish to apply 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.670
 Lacquer lens placed in the oven for three hours 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.460
 anti-reflective coating applied now 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.040
 which increases the transparency of linz 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.870
 allows more light to pass then 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.870
 It sends a special camera lens at 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.910
 different chemical elements are added 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.170
 for example silicon dioxide titanium oxide 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.670
 zirconia with powerful 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.780
 electron beam and to heat up 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.510
 boiling point 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.840
 powder turns to gas covers 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.840
 lenses 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.210
 finally it's time to put the lenses in 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.210
 frame 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.460
 lenses and fastens with 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.960
 special suction cups to 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.960
 hold them during processing 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.560
 special machine measures the frame 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:04:03.940
 and cuts the lens the shape you want in 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.940
 ordinary lens frames come in easily 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.450
 to install 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.680
 ultra light metal drilled right 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.680
 holes right in the lenses 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:41.909
 from a piece of plastic to fashionable glasses total 

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:41.909
 in 3 days
