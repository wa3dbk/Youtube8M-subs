00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
ingrown toenails so one of the reasons

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.779 
ingrown toenails so one of the reasons
how<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.210> get<00:00:18.420> ingrown<00:00:18.840> toenails<00:00:19.289> is

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
how you get ingrown toenails is

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.429 
how you get ingrown toenails is
basically<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.060> edge<00:00:21.210> or<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> corner<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
basically the edge or the corner of the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.490 
basically the edge or the corner of the
nail<00:00:22.680> cuts<00:00:23.430> into<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> skin<00:00:24.420> at<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.170> edge<00:00:25.260> or

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
nail cuts into the skin at the edge or

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.439 
nail cuts into the skin at the edge or
the<00:00:25.590> end<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> toe<00:00:26.279> usually<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> happens<00:00:27.119> on

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the end of the toe usually it happens on

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.960 
the end of the toe usually it happens on
the<00:00:27.570> big<00:00:27.750> toe<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.439> sides<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.550> two<00:00:29.760> main

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the big toe on the sides the two main

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.479 
the big toe on the sides the two main
reasons<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.810> because<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.710> ill-fitting<00:00:32.460> shoes

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
reasons are because of ill-fitting shoes

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.389 
reasons are because of ill-fitting shoes
they<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.239> too<00:00:33.480> tight<00:00:33.780> pointy<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.829> high<00:00:35.370> heels

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
they are too tight pointy or high heels

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.840 
they are too tight pointy or high heels
that<00:00:36.329> causes<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.989> toes<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.680> squeeze<00:00:38.399> together

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that causes the toes to squeeze together

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.560 
that causes the toes to squeeze together
and<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.480> nail<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.140> curl<00:00:40.440> into<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> skin<00:00:41.570> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and then nail to curl into the skin the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.380 
and then nail to curl into the skin the
other<00:00:42.600> main<00:00:43.020> reason<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.860> they're<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:45.090> cut

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
other main reason is they're not cut

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
other main reason is they're not cut
properly<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:46.140> ought<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.350> cut<00:00:46.800> them<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
properly you ought to cut them so it's a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
properly you ought to cut them so it's a
straight<00:00:48.480> line<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> way<00:00:49.110> across<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
straight line all the way across the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.670 
straight line all the way across the
nail<00:00:50.420> because<00:00:51.420> otherwise<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.289> cut<00:00:52.500> them

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
nail because otherwise if you cut them

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.069 
nail because otherwise if you cut them
with<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> slant<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> corners<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.660> they<00:00:54.899> can

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
with a slant at the corners and they can

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.709 
with a slant at the corners and they can
grow<00:00:55.289> into<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.770> sides<00:00:56.360> there's<00:00:57.360> some<00:00:57.539> other

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
grow into the sides there's some other

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
grow into the sides there's some other
rarer<00:00:58.050> reasons<00:00:58.680> sometimes<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.489> nail<00:00:59.699> has

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
rarer reasons sometimes if your nail has

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.000 
rarer reasons sometimes if your nail has
been<00:01:00.149> ripped<00:01:00.480> off<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:00.930> peeled<00:01:01.230> off<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.800> can

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
been ripped off or peeled off that can

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.179 
been ripped off or peeled off that can
cause<00:01:02.250> an<00:01:02.489> ingrown<00:01:02.789> toenail<00:01:04.489> aging<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.760> fungal

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
cause an ingrown toenail aging or fungal

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
cause an ingrown toenail aging or fungal
nail<00:01:08.189> infections<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.150> cause<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.869> nail<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
nail infections can cause the nail to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
nail infections can cause the nail to
become<00:01:10.740> thicker<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.369> wider<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
become thicker and wider and then it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.570 
become thicker and wider and then it
just<00:01:12.750> pushes<00:01:13.200> into<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.680> sides<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> skin

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
just pushes into the sides of the skin

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.679 
just pushes into the sides of the skin
and<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:16.080> some<00:01:17.040> medical<00:01:17.970> treatments<00:01:18.509> such<00:01:18.659> as

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and also some medical treatments such as

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.670 
and also some medical treatments such as
Roaccutane

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
Roaccutane

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.609 
Roaccutane
or<00:01:20.189> asset<00:01:20.549> Retton<00:01:20.939> used<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> psoriasis

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
or asset Retton used for a psoriasis

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.249 
or asset Retton used for a psoriasis
acne<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.210> cause<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.659> nail<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> thicken

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
acne they can cause the nail to thicken

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.649 
acne they can cause the nail to thicken
and<00:01:25.710> again<00:01:26.009> press<00:01:26.610> into<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> sides<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and again press into the sides of the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.020 
and again press into the sides of the
skin<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.829> there's<00:01:29.040> three<00:01:29.310> different<00:01:29.340> stages

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
skin so there's three different stages

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
skin so there's three different stages
of<00:01:30.060> ingrown<00:01:30.540> toenail<00:01:31.110> Stage<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
of ingrown toenail Stage one is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.249 
of ingrown toenail Stage one is
basically<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.509> goes<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:33.960> bit

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
basically when it just goes a little bit

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.220 
basically when it just goes a little bit
red<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.829> bit<00:01:35.009> sore<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> bit<00:01:35.850> swollen

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
red and a bit sore and a bit swollen

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.670 
red and a bit sore and a bit swollen
and<00:01:37.890> stage<00:01:38.640> 2<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.240> those<00:01:40.050> symptoms<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.620> worse

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and stage 2 is those symptoms get worse

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
and stage 2 is those symptoms get worse
but<00:01:41.070> there's<00:01:41.250> also<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.550> little<00:01:41.670> bit<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.990> watery

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
but there's also a little bit of watery

yellowy<00:01:43.440> whitish<00:01:44.220> pus<00:01:44.550> that<00:01:44.820> comes<00:01:45.090> out<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
yellowy whitish pus that comes out and

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.890 
yellowy whitish pus that comes out and
it's<00:01:46.410> maybe<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> bit<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.160> sore<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.630> stage

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
it's maybe a bit more sore and the stage

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.590 
it's maybe a bit more sore and the stage
3<00:01:49.260> is<00:01:49.770> very<00:01:50.100> painful<00:01:50.370> and<00:01:50.910> there's<00:01:51.240> lots<00:01:51.480> more

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
3 is very painful and there's lots more

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.170 
3 is very painful and there's lots more
pass<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.200> also<00:01:52.380> particularly<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.610> extra

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
pass but also particularly you get extra

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.250

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
area of the ingrown nail and that just

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.990 
area of the ingrown nail and that just
makes<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.450> symptoms<00:02:00.720> worse<00:02:01.820> stages<00:02:02.820> 2

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
makes all the symptoms worse stages 2

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.180 
makes all the symptoms worse stages 2
and<00:02:03.180> 3<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.630> associated<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:06.110> with

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
it will be painful but it will be worth

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.820 
it will be painful but it will be worth
it<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.930> long<00:03:06.989> run<00:03:07.350> because<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.739> will

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
it in the long run because it will

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.970 
it in the long run because it will
prevent<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.250> from<00:03:08.280> getting<00:03:08.550> worse<00:03:09.290> stage<00:03:10.290> 2<00:03:10.320> is

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
prevent it from getting worse stage 2 is

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.000 
prevent it from getting worse stage 2 is
you<00:03:11.790> can<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.239> still<00:03:12.510> do<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.080> above<00:03:13.440> processes

you can you still do the above processes

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.210 
you can you still do the above processes
but<00:03:14.610> also<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:15.060> might<00:03:15.239> need<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:16.220> cream

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
but also you might need a cream

anesthetic cream can help reduce the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.740 
anesthetic cream can help reduce the
pain<00:03:24.390> as<00:03:24.630> well<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:26.580> can<00:03:26.760> get<00:03:26.880> lignan<00:03:27.270> angel

for<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.290> which<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.650> quite<00:03:28.830> useful<00:03:29.390> then

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
for that which is quite useful then

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.510 
for that which is quite useful then
stage<00:03:30.840> three<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.739> when<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.190> get<00:03:32.310> this

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
extra tissue growing and pass an

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.790 
extra tissue growing and pass an
infection<00:03:35.370> that's<00:03:35.730> really<00:03:36.450> can<00:03:37.290> be<00:03:37.410> quite<00:03:37.440> bad

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
infection that's really can be quite bad

infection that's really can be quite bad
so<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.130> do<00:03:38.400> need<00:03:38.610> surgery<00:03:39.150> for<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.510> where

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750
