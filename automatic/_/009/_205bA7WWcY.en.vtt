00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.113
 You know, people say actors live by lying, 

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:11.483
 but... 

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:13.322
 This is to live in a lie. 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.172
 Well, Robe, when you're ready. 

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:16.944
 Camera 2. Prepare. 

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:22.960
 Jesus, shit! 

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.596
 Looks like he's infected with something. 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.157
 - Almost no difference. - Thanks buddy. 

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:30.487
 Surprise! 

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:33.297
 We already have 1000 parts! 

00:00:34.058 --> 00:00:37.450
 Congratulations on 1000 hours, sell it like that. 

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:38.287
 Who do you mean? 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.174
 Guys, the photos just appeared, it looks like McConaughey fucks a goat. 

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:43.613
 McConaughey Goat Duster? 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.712
 McConaughey Goat Goat. 

00:00:44.887 --> 00:00:46.653
 Get it! Get the goat! 

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:47.925
 Get the goat! 

00:00:49.144 --> 00:00:50.518
 I have a few questions for the goat. 

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:53.694
 Millions of people are wondering about our show every night. 

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:58.914
 I want to give real news, not news of uncovering vagina Nicki Minaj at Grammy Awards. 

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:01.363
 - You don't like the brown sugar? - With sugar brown it has nothing to do. 

00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:02.685
 - Aaron, look! 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.085
 Kim Jong-un wants an interview with Dave Skylark? 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.108
 He's our fan! 

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:07.436
 Look at him. 

00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:09.750
 If this is not true, then what is it? 

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:13.229
 - All right, it's on. - We're going to North Korea. 

00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:14.893
 FROM "APOKALYPSA IN HOLLYWOOD" 

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:16.740
 And "SOUSEDI" 

00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:23.372
 Mr. Rapoport, I'm Agent Lacey, CIA 

00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:24.318
 Hey, Aaron ... 

00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:29.703
 I don't know who I fucked with yesterday, but I smell pretty. 

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.590
 Dave, he's here ... 

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.033
 Aaron, does your dick stink? 

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.621
 It's weird how you have to sniff it all the time. 

00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:39.643
 Dave, there's the CIA! 

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:40.685
 YEAR ON CHRISTMAS 

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:43.891
 You two will be alone with Kim. 

00:01:44.017 --> 00:01:46.086
 We have an interview with him! 

00:01:46.352 --> 00:01:49.662
 The CIA would love to take care of him. 

00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:52.909
 Take care of him ... 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.418
 - How to take him for a drink? - Take him to dinner? 

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:55.406
 Take him to town? 

00:01:55.423 --> 00:01:57.896
 No ... "take care of him". 

00:01:57.964 --> 00:01:59.908
 You want us to kill North Korea's leader? 

00:01:59.992 --> 00:02:00.495
 Yes. 

00:02:04.662 --> 00:02:06.965
 Hi North Korea! 

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:11.416
 We can die, but we'll be pretty stupid if we don't. 

00:02:12.453 --> 00:02:14.717
 I had a great life, and the best friend, 

00:02:15.012 --> 00:02:16.886
 and fucked more girls than Ellen Degeneres. 

00:02:18.813 --> 00:02:20.915
 Kim must die, that's American style. 

00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:26.033
 Do you want this? Do you like it? 

00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:31.165
 You have to secure the charge! 

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:31.978
 What should I do with it? 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.732
 - What should I do with it? - People are coming. 

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:35.395
 &lt;i&gt; Where do I hide this ?! &lt;/i&gt; 

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:38.465
 You have to put it in your ass. 

00:02:38.532 --> 00:02:39.752
 I don't want to put it in my ass. 

00:02:39.863 --> 00:02:41.337
 You have to, now. 

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:44.450
 - A little big to put it in my ass. - They surround you. 

00:02:48.214 --> 00:02:49.416
 The package is secured. 

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:50.576
 THE INTERVIEW 

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:52.181
 - This?! - Yeah! 

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:54.443
 Fucking weapon of annihilation. 

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:56.582
 Robocop fucked you, buddy! 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.788
 AT CHRISTMAS 

00:02:59.083 --> 00:02:59.805
