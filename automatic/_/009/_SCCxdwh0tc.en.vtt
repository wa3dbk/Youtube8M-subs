candidate<00:01:23.340> why<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.840> i<00:01:25.590> think<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
candidate why is that I i think that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.630 
candidate why is that I i think that
there's<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.479> sphere<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.049> being<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.830> spoiler<00:01:29.369> so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
there's a sphere of being a spoiler so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.300 
there's a sphere of being a spoiler so
that<00:01:29.880> people<00:01:30.299> end<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.320> voting<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:32.009> what<00:01:32.159> they

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
that people end up voting for what they

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.210 
that people end up voting for what they
consider<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.090> lesser<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.689> two<00:01:33.840> evils

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
consider to be the lesser of two evils

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.580 
consider to be the lesser of two evils
rather<00:01:35.220> than<00:01:35.610> rising<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> occasion<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
rather than rising to the occasion and I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.300 
rather than rising to the occasion and I
think<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.369> very<00:01:39.000> unique

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
think that we have very unique

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.260 
think that we have very unique
circumstances<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.119> it's

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
circumstances now and I think it's

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.539 
circumstances now and I think it's
reflected<00:01:42.900> by<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.110> Occupy<00:01:43.799> movement<00:01:44.280> i<00:01:44.310> think

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
reflected by the Occupy movement i think

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.600 
reflected by the Occupy movement i think
it's<00:01:44.700> reflected<00:01:45.299> by<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.479> polls<00:01:45.960> nine<00:01:46.829> percent

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
it's reflected by the polls nine percent

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.179 
it's reflected by the polls nine percent
approval<00:01:48.000> rating<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.630> our<00:01:48.930> Congress<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
approval rating for our Congress the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.929 
approval rating for our Congress the
approval<00:01:50.729> rating<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.090> our<00:01:51.390> president<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.939> way

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
approval rating for our president is way

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.210 
approval rating for our president is way
down<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.720> i<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:55.950> has

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
down and i think it's because he has

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.460 
down and i think it's because he has
lost<00:01:56.579> his<00:01:56.850> base<00:01:57.270> he<00:01:57.630> has<00:01:57.900> not<00:01:58.229> delivered<00:01:59.009> on

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
lost his base he has not delivered on

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.920 
lost his base he has not delivered on
almost<00:02:01.470> anything<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:03.000> he<00:02:03.210> promised<00:02:03.780> us

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
almost anything that he promised us
