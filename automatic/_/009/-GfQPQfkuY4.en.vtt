friends and you guys gave me some

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.410 
friends and you guys gave me some
exercises<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.550> put<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.700> some<00:00:35.910> calluses

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
exercises so I can put up some calluses

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
exercises so I can put up some calluses
just<00:00:36.690> kind<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> dexterity<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
just kind of get the dexterity going and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.940 
just kind of get the dexterity going and
build<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.930> my<00:00:40.079> wrist<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.770> fun

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
build out my wrist and all that fun

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.680 
build out my wrist and all that fun
stuff<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.820> culmination<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
stuff so this is the culmination of the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.479 
stuff so this is the culmination of the
past<00:00:45.930> five<00:00:46.350> minutes<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.860> me<00:00:46.950> actually<00:00:47.129> playing

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
past five minutes of me actually playing

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.260 
past five minutes of me actually playing
this<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.820> figured<00:00:48.090> I'd<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.329> video<00:00:48.719> for

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
this I figured I'd get on video for

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:04.579 
this I figured I'd get on video for
continued<00:00:51.270> on<00:01:02.600> all<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.780> doing<00:01:04.049> right<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
continued on all I'm doing right now is

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.030 
continued on all I'm doing right now is
just<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:05.010> through<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.830> starting<00:01:07.830> at<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
just going through and starting at the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.359 
just going through and starting at the
open<00:01:08.900> then<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.290> by<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:12.979> it's<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.220> my

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
open then going one by one it's all my

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.830 
open then going one by one it's all my
fingers<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.909> being<00:01:15.090> used<00:01:15.360> being<00:01:15.600> pressed

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
fingers are being used being pressed

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.719 
fingers are being used being pressed
down<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:18.500> guess<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.710> supposed<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.220> build

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
down I guess is supposed to build

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:37.130 
down I guess is supposed to build
dexterity<00:01:35.450> this<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.600> pretty<00:01:36.750> much<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> extent

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
dexterity this is pretty much the extent

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
dexterity this is pretty much the extent
of<00:01:37.350> what<00:01:37.530> I've<00:01:37.619> been<00:01:37.710> doing<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.130> far<00:01:38.400> I'll

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
of what I've been doing so far I'll

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.160 
of what I've been doing so far I'll
probably<00:01:38.939> doing<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.329> next<00:01:39.689> day<00:01:39.810> or<00:01:39.930> two<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
probably doing this next day or two and

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.270 
probably doing this next day or two and
just<00:01:40.350> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.439> grip<00:01:43.439> make

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
just kind of get it so I can grip make

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.740 
just kind of get it so I can grip make
all<00:01:44.490> these<00:01:44.670> notes<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.479> fun<00:01:45.720> stuff

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
all these notes and all that fun stuff

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.600 
all these notes and all that fun stuff
so<00:01:47.030> we'll<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.210> how<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> goes<00:01:48.479> hopefully<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
so we'll see how it goes hopefully in a

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.639 
so we'll see how it goes hopefully in a
little<00:01:50.610> bit<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.790> time<00:01:51.000> I'll<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.810> able<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.079> play

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
little bit of time I'll be able to play

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.870 
little bit of time I'll be able to play
a<00:01:53.009> song<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:54.090> may<00:01:54.750> suck<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:56.490> will<00:01:56.610> each<00:01:56.850> be

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
a song it may suck but it will each be

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.929 
a song it may suck but it will each be
something<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.860> I'll<00:01:58.860> leave<00:01:59.250> some<00:01:59.460> staying

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
something and I'll leave some staying

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.950 
something and I'll leave some staying
busy<00:02:00.119> during<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> summer<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.140> doing<00:02:01.469> stuff<00:02:01.740> I

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
busy during the summer so doing stuff I

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.510 
busy during the summer so doing stuff I
don't<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.500> don't<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.219> what<00:02:05.399> else

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
don't really I don't know what else

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
don't really I don't know what else
would<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.729> done<00:02:05.850> if<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.090> wasn't<00:02:06.329> for<00:02:06.450> this

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
would be done if it wasn't for this

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.540 
would be done if it wasn't for this
right<00:02:06.750> now<00:02:07.459> just<00:02:08.459> watch<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> TV<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.030> guess<00:02:09.289> but

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
right now just watch the TV I guess but

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.890 
right now just watch the TV I guess but
until<00:02:11.550> next<00:02:11.670> video

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
until next video

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.560 
until next video
enjoy
