that's easy to refill and easy to drink
from<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.920> there's<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.340> suppose<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.570> S

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
from so there's a I suppose the S

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.419 
from so there's a I suppose the S
component<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> straight<00:00:28.890> six<00:00:29.130> items

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
component of the straight six items

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.460 
component of the straight six items
you've<00:00:29.580> gotta<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.420> up<00:00:30.599> steel<00:00:30.840> water<00:00:31.050> bottle

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you've gotta just up steel water bottle

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620 
you've gotta just up steel water bottle
I<00:00:31.500> suppose<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.369> cheat<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.880> just<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> little

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
I suppose if you cheat in just a little

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.930 
I suppose if you cheat in just a little
bit<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.380> two<00:00:34.649> items<00:00:35.070> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
bit because really it's two items you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.000 
bit because really it's two items you
could<00:00:36.090> say<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> Crusader<00:00:37.079> cut<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
could say that the Crusader cut and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.459 
could say that the Crusader cut and
bottle<00:00:38.399> which<00:00:39.000> you've<00:00:39.180> seen<00:00:39.390> before<00:00:39.690> in

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
bottle which you've seen before in

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.600 
bottle which you've seen before in
previous<00:00:40.620> videos<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.850> um<00:00:43.219> you<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
previous videos is um you know it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.250 
previous videos is um you know it
probably<00:00:44.820> more<00:00:45.300> practical<00:00:45.809> than<00:00:45.840> something

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
probably more practical than something

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.479 
probably more practical than something
like<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> bowl<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.950> because<00:00:47.219> you've<00:00:47.340> got

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
like the bowl just because you've got

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.830 
like the bowl just because you've got
something<00:00:47.760> that's<00:00:47.820> easier<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.270> clean<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.690> can

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
something that's easier to clean you can

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
something that's easier to clean you can
use<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.590> paddock<00:00:49.950> actually<00:00:50.219> cook<00:00:50.399> inside

use it as a paddock actually cook inside

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.340 
use it as a paddock actually cook inside
it<00:00:51.059> rather<00:00:51.210> than<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.390> heating<00:00:51.840> water<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it rather than just heating water and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.310 
it rather than just heating water and
and<00:00:52.530> cooking<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.239> um<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:55.260> I'm

get<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.460> end<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.909> where<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.119> looped

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
get to the end there where it's looped

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.280 
get to the end there where it's looped
and<00:01:30.890> what<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.460> twist<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.970> round<00:01:33.290> feed

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and what you do just twist it round feed

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.830 
and what you do just twist it round feed
it<00:01:34.409> through<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:36.060> create<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.600> slip

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it through like that they create a slip

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.020 
it through like that they create a slip
knot<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.040> pull<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.820> out

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
knot what I'm going to do pull that out

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.120 
knot what I'm going to do pull that out

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
I'll just tie it in another double dot

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.740 
I'll just tie it in another double dot
there<00:02:03.619> at<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.860> front

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
it through the edge there and then back

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.870 
it through the edge there and then back
underneath<00:03:04.150> there<00:03:05.250> okay<00:03:06.250> pull<00:03:06.670> tight<00:03:06.940> and

underneath there okay pull tight and
let's<00:03:09.880> go<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.380> through<00:03:11.380> there<00:03:11.590> again<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:14.280> back

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
let's go it through there again and back

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.070 
let's go it through there again and back
underneath<00:03:16.690> there<00:03:17.250> they<00:03:18.250> go<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.930> you've

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
underneath there they go and so you've

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.990 
underneath there they go and so you've
got<00:03:20.110> your<00:03:20.950> two<00:03:21.160> ends<00:03:21.340> there<00:03:21.610> obviously

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
got your two ends there obviously

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.120 
got your two ends there obviously
doesn't<00:03:22.510> really<00:03:22.630> matter<00:03:22.840> too<00:03:23.080> much<00:03:23.110> but<00:03:23.500> you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
doesn't really matter too much but you

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.310 
doesn't really matter too much but you
can<00:03:24.220> just<00:03:24.340> secure<00:03:24.550> those<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.840> depending

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
can just secure those in the depending

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.660 
can just secure those in the depending
upon<00:03:26.380> which<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:26.770> measure<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.160> according<00:03:27.640> to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
upon which you measure that according to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.580 
upon which you measure that according to
your<00:03:27.760> shoulder<00:03:28.150> length<00:03:28.330> tie<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.380> Brown

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
your shoulder length tie that Brown

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.820 
your shoulder length tie that Brown
wants<00:03:30.010> tie<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:30.970> round<00:03:31.180> again<00:03:31.330> like<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.830> and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
wants tie it round again like that and

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.190 
wants tie it round again like that and
pull<00:03:33.070> through<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.610> you've<00:03:34.300> got<00:03:34.480> figure<00:03:35.080> eight

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
pull through so you've got figure eight

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.300 
pull through so you've got figure eight
knot<00:03:35.230> at<00:03:35.860> that<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:37.170> there<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.200> go<00:03:38.410> and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
knot at that and there you go and

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.550 
knot at that and there you go and
obviously<00:03:39.430> what<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.150> does<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.410> ensures

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
obviously what that does is it ensures

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.650 
obviously what that does is it ensures
that<00:03:42.040> you're<00:03:42.370> carrying<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.880> cut<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.330> the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
that you're carrying the cut and the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.570 
that you're carrying the cut and the
bottle<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.590> they<00:03:44.709> don't<00:03:44.860> rattle<00:03:45.040> in<00:03:45.459> each

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
bottle so they don't rattle in each

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.910 
bottle so they don't rattle in each
other<00:03:45.820> they<00:03:46.570> don't<00:03:46.780> these<00:03:47.380> handles<00:03:47.739> don't

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
other they don't these handles don't

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.170 
other they don't these handles don't
rattle<00:03:48.100> obviously<00:03:48.489> because<00:03:48.820> they're<00:03:48.970> tied

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
rattle obviously because they're tied

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.470 
rattle obviously because they're tied
securely<00:03:49.420> into<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.019> side<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:52.120> can<00:03:52.269> get

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
securely into the side and you can get

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.380 
securely into the side and you can get
the<00:03:53.019> lid<00:03:53.200> on<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.860> off<00:03:54.100> easily<00:03:54.580> because<00:03:55.209> you've

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
the lid on and off easily because you've

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.970 
the lid on and off easily because you've
got<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.810> little<00:03:56.260> bit<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.440> distance<00:03:56.620> there<00:03:56.950> a

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
got a little bit of distance there a

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.960 
got a little bit of distance there a
little<00:03:57.160> bit<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.370> lip<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:58.290> that's<00:03:59.290> where<00:03:59.500> the

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
little bit of a lip and that's where the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.729 
little bit of a lip and that's where the
knot<00:04:00.970> sort<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.300> like<00:04:01.510> tied<00:04:01.780> in<00:04:01.930> there<00:04:02.050> so<00:04:02.260> you

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
knot sort of like tied in there so you

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.170 
knot sort of like tied in there so you
can<00:04:02.890> easily<00:04:03.190> sort<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.430> get<00:04:03.550> that<00:04:03.670> on<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.120> off

can easily sort of get that on and off

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.390 
can easily sort of get that on and off
without<00:04:04.600> too<00:04:04.810> much<00:04:04.930> sure<00:04:05.230> that's<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.280> much

very quick carry option for this is that

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.370 
very quick carry option for this is that
you'd<00:04:14.709> need<00:04:15.519> to<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:16.329> mean<00:04:16.570> if<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:17.049> didn't<00:04:17.290> have

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
you'd need to I mean if you didn't have

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.740 
you'd need to I mean if you didn't have
one<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.680> these<00:04:17.829> and<00:04:18.040> just<00:04:18.130> had<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.670> one<00:04:19.540> of<00:04:19.630> these

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
one of these and just had a one of these

bottles and

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.950 
bottles and
this<00:04:21.820> would<00:04:22.000> involve<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.480> suppose<00:04:22.690> another

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
this would involve a suppose another

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.860 
this would involve a suppose another
item<00:04:23.410> of<00:04:23.500> kit<00:04:23.740> but<00:04:24.370> what<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.270> could<00:04:25.450> do<00:04:25.630> is

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
item of kit but what you could do is

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.990 
item of kit but what you could do is
just<00:04:26.860> take<00:04:28.800> something<00:04:29.800> like<00:04:29.890> this<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.730> mean

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
just take something like this I mean

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.550 
just take something like this I mean
though<00:04:31.450> if<00:04:31.570> you're<00:04:31.720> being<00:04:31.900> again<00:04:32.350> another

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
though if you're being again another

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.190 
though if you're being again another
sort<00:04:32.920> cotton<00:04:33.250> bag<00:04:33.460> thing<00:04:33.790> but<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:34.810> a<00:04:34.900> little

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
sort cotton bag thing but just a little

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.440 
sort cotton bag thing but just a little
sort<00:04:35.470> of<00:04:35.530> cotton<00:04:35.920> sling<00:04:36.160> bag<00:04:36.370> what<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.300> would

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
sort of cotton sling bag what that would

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.180 
sort of cotton sling bag what that would
do<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.840> mean<00:04:38.170> carrying<00:04:38.680> something<00:04:38.830> like<00:04:39.040> this

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
do I mean carrying something like this

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.160 
do I mean carrying something like this
in<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.550> sling<00:04:39.850> quite<00:04:40.570> difficult<00:04:40.750> when<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.080> can

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
in a sling quite difficult when you can

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.420 
in a sling quite difficult when you can
put<00:04:41.290> it<00:04:41.380> through<00:04:41.470> there<00:04:41.650> but<00:04:41.830> it's<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:42.250> there's

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
put it through there but it's so there's

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.910 
put it through there but it's so there's
a<00:04:42.460> high<00:04:42.580> probability<00:04:43.080> I<00:04:44.080> mean<00:04:44.260> something<00:04:44.800> like

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
a high probability I mean something like

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.140 
a high probability I mean something like
this<00:04:45.010> come<00:04:45.220> business<00:04:45.490> together<00:04:45.700> it's<00:04:46.030> going

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
this come business together it's going

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.020 
this come business together it's going
to<00:04:46.210> weigh<00:04:46.270> something<00:04:46.480> like<00:04:46.630> 1.3<00:04:47.380> kilos<00:04:48.030> that's

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
to weigh something like 1.3 kilos that's

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.400 
to weigh something like 1.3 kilos that's
going<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.330> break<00:04:49.540> eventually<00:04:50.110> if<00:04:50.290> you're

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
going to break eventually if you're

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.690 
going to break eventually if you're
bouncing<00:04:50.710> up<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:50.890> down<00:04:51.010> on<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.370> like<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.550> and

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
bouncing up and down on it like that and

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.040 
bouncing up and down on it like that and
obviously<00:04:52.060> there's<00:04:52.270> no<00:04:52.420> sort<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.780> like<00:04:52.930> that's

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
obviously there's no sort of like that's

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.560 
obviously there's no sort of like that's
tapered<00:04:53.650> inwards<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.670> side<00:04:54.850> so<00:04:55.120> carrying<00:04:55.510> it

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
tapered inwards the side so carrying it

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.270 
tapered inwards the side so carrying it
like<00:04:55.690> eysan<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.170> really<00:04:56.440> practical<00:04:56.800> making<00:04:57.220> a

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
like eysan is really practical making a

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.680 
like eysan is really practical making a
sort<00:04:57.460> of<00:04:57.490> webbing<00:04:57.850> thing<00:04:58.210> out<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.480> string

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
sort of webbing thing out of the string

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.180 
sort of webbing thing out of the string
is<00:04:58.780> going<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.960> involve<00:04:59.110> cutting<00:04:59.860> it<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.010> lot<00:05:00.160> of

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
is going to involve cutting it a lot of

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.620 
is going to involve cutting it a lot of
times<00:05:00.490> which<00:05:00.700> isn't<00:05:00.850> really<00:05:00.970> practical

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
times which isn't really practical

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.090 
times which isn't really practical
either<00:05:01.780> because<00:05:02.290> you<00:05:02.770> don't<00:05:02.890> wanna<00:05:03.010> be

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
either because you don't wanna be

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.890 
either because you don't wanna be
chopping<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.550> your<00:05:04.030> one<00:05:04.270> piece<00:05:04.480> of<00:05:04.660> rope<00:05:04.870> that

chopping you your one piece of rope that

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.270 
chopping you your one piece of rope that
you've<00:05:05.200> got<00:05:05.410> in<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.620> world<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.980> piece<00:05:06.130> of

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
you've got in the world a piece of

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.890 
you've got in the world a piece of
