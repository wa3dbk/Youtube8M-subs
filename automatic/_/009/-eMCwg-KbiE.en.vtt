nether<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:23.390> you<00:00:24.390> probably<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:25.260> saw<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
nether and you probably just saw the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.279 
nether and you probably just saw the
time<00:00:25.949> lapse<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.119> see<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.660> picked

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
time lapse and as you can see I picked

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.990 
time lapse and as you can see I picked
up<00:00:28.410> another<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.340> that's<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
up another one so just that's the one I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.319 
up another one so just that's the one I
just<00:00:30.240> picked<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:31.550> for<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.940> will<00:00:33.090> tint

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
just picked up up for that will tint

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.389 
just picked up up for that will tint
that<00:00:33.660> time<00:00:33.989> lapse<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.530> ten<00:00:34.800> minutes<00:00:35.100> worth<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that time lapse was ten minutes worth of

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.299 
that time lapse was ten minutes worth of
this<00:00:35.579> farm<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.540> 10<00:00:36.719> minutes<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.230> got<00:00:37.440> 15

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
this farm and so in 10 minutes I got 15

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.170 
this farm and so in 10 minutes I got 15
gold<00:00:38.550> nuggets<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.120> 15<00:00:39.570> rotten<00:00:39.899> flesh<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:41.180> so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
gold nuggets and 15 rotten flesh and so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.860 
gold nuggets and 15 rotten flesh and so
what<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.860> hello<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.539> is

what this is is a hello what this is is

what this is is a hello what this is is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a redstone 'less zombie pigmen farm I

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
a redstone 'less zombie pigmen farm I
know<00:00:51.680> I've<00:00:52.760> seen<00:00:53.760> some<00:00:54.480> good<00:00:54.899> zombie<00:00:55.260> pigmen

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
know I've seen some good zombie pigmen

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.979 
know I've seen some good zombie pigmen
farms<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.340> usually<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.210> either<00:00:57.360> take<00:00:57.570> some

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
farms but usually they either take some

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.650 
farms but usually they either take some
like<00:00:58.140> complicated<00:00:58.800> timers<00:00:59.609> or<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.420> take

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
like complicated timers or they take

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.310 
like complicated timers or they take
like<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.340> stack<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> Pistons<00:01:03.300> which<00:01:03.780> by<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> way

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
like a stack of Pistons which by the way

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
like a stack of Pistons which by the way
is<00:01:04.760> freaking<00:01:05.760> expensive<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.570> people<00:01:06.600> in

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
is freaking expensive for people in

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.140 
is freaking expensive for people in
survival<00:01:07.439> mode<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> thought<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.760> would<00:01:08.820> make

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
survival mode so I thought I would make

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.330 
survival mode so I thought I would make
the<00:01:09.570> cheapest<00:01:10.020> possible<00:01:11.270> pig<00:01:12.270> farm<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.710> pig

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the cheapest possible pig farm and a pig

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.609 
the cheapest possible pig farm and a pig
farm<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.850> cheap<00:01:15.119> involves<00:01:15.780> absolutely

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
farm that is cheap involves absolutely

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.910 
farm that is cheap involves absolutely
no<00:01:16.830> redstone<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.729> any<00:01:18.150> level<00:01:18.360> whatsoever<00:01:20.180> show

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
no redstone on any level whatsoever show

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.230 
no redstone on any level whatsoever show
what<00:01:22.920> I've<00:01:23.100> done<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:25.700> just<00:01:26.700> created

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
what I've done here is just created

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
what I've done here is just created
something<00:01:27.509> where<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> pigmen<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.590> end<00:01:28.740> up

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
something where the pigmen will end up

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.630 
something where the pigmen will end up
walking<00:01:29.130> down<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> killing<00:01:29.880> themselves<00:01:31.640> it's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
walking down and killing themselves it's

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.140 
walking down and killing themselves it's
pretty<00:01:33.000> simple<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.979> first<00:01:34.979> off<00:01:35.189> before<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.000> go

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
pretty simple and first off before we go

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.580 
pretty simple and first off before we go
over<00:01:36.329> how<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> build<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.930> I'll<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.229> over<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
over how to build it I'll go over the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:47.569 
over how to build it I'll go over the
stats<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:39.259> ok<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:46.220> release<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.549> i

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
stats with you ok so in release what i

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.480 
stats with you ok so in release what i
like<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.970> call<00:01:48.229> realistic<00:01:49.229> mode<00:01:49.470> which<00:01:50.100> means

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
like to call realistic mode which means

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.149 
like to call realistic mode which means
that<00:01:50.670> someone<00:01:51.299> has<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.869> kind<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:53.579> know

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
that someone has just kind of you know

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.060 
that someone has just kind of you know
haphazardly<00:01:56.750> covered<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.200> surrounding<00:01:58.770> area

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
haphazardly covered the surrounding area

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
haphazardly covered the surrounding area
or<00:01:59.189> destroyed<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.030> pigmen<00:02:00.479> would<00:02:00.659> spawn<00:02:01.020> on

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
or destroyed it so pigmen would spawn on

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.130 
or destroyed it so pigmen would spawn on
it<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.560> realistic<00:02:02.310> mode<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.240> two<00:02:03.270> tiers

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it on realistic mode and with two tiers

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.260 
it on realistic mode and with two tiers
of<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.649> farm<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.969> get<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.509> per<00:02:06.780> minute<00:02:08.270> one

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
of this farm you get one per minute one

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.930 
of this farm you get one per minute one
permit<00:02:09.660> pigmen<00:02:10.229> wise<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.890> that's<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:11.670> two

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
permit pigmen wise and that's with two

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.050 
permit pigmen wise and that's with two
layers<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.840> you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
layers so you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.910 
layers so you
no<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:13.360> it's<00:02:13.630> not<00:02:13.840> too<00:02:14.080> bad<00:02:14.260> that's<00:02:14.500> not<00:02:14.560> too

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
no it's it's not too bad that's not too

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.339 
no it's it's not too bad that's not too
much<00:02:15.130> work<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.849> of<00:02:16.390> course<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.900> really<00:02:17.080> easy

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
much work and of course it's really easy

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.260 
much work and of course it's really easy
to<00:02:17.440> add<00:02:17.650> more<00:02:17.950> layers<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.580> really<00:02:18.849> fastly

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
to add more layers and really fastly

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.780 
to add more layers and really fastly
increase<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.870> now<00:02:20.650> at<00:02:20.800> optimized<00:02:21.489> mode

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
increase that now at optimized mode

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.000 
increase that now at optimized mode
which<00:02:22.000> means<00:02:22.030> most<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.050> area<00:02:23.290> around<00:02:23.470> it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
which means most of the area around it

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.190 
which means most of the area around it
is<00:02:24.160> covered<00:02:24.580> up<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:24.970> zombie<00:02:25.540> pigmen<00:02:25.870> can

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
is covered up so zombie pigmen can

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.309 
is covered up so zombie pigmen can
mostly<00:02:26.680> only<00:02:27.040> spawn<00:02:27.580> on<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.000> farm<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:29.080> get

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
mostly only spawn on the farm you get

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.570 
mostly only spawn on the farm you get
about<00:02:29.560> 5<00:02:30.130> per<00:02:30.550> minute<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:31.000> two<00:02:31.390> layers<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.550> I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
about 5 per minute on two layers so I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.880 
about 5 per minute on two layers so I
think<00:02:33.910> for<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.420> redstone<00:02:34.780> was<00:02:35.080> fun<00:02:35.349> that's<00:02:35.680> not

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
think for a redstone was fun that's not

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.370 
think for a redstone was fun that's not
terribly<00:02:36.400> bad<00:02:36.910> especially<00:02:37.480> for<00:02:37.959> only<00:02:38.080> two

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
terribly bad especially for only two

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.490 
terribly bad especially for only two
layers<00:02:38.709> which<00:02:39.040> isn't<00:02:39.340> much<00:02:39.930> now<00:02:40.930> how<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.140> build

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
layers which isn't much now how to build

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.160 
layers which isn't much now how to build
this<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:42.120> first<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.330> find<00:02:43.540> yourself<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.050> decent

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
this is first you find yourself a decent

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.809 
this is first you find yourself a decent
place<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.500> build<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.100> recommend<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.610> lava

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
place to build it I recommend a lava

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.059 
place to build it I recommend a lava
like<00:02:46.090> something<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.910> start

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
like something like that and you start

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.150 
like something like that and you start
with<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.370> 21<00:02:52.239> by<00:02:52.450> 21<00:02:53.080> square<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:54.069> half<00:02:54.819> slabs

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
with a 21 by 21 square of half slabs

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.539 
with a 21 by 21 square of half slabs
which<00:02:58.110> uh<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.590> half<00:02:59.739> slabs<00:03:00.099> are<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.459> ensure

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
which uh the half slabs are to ensure

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.850 
which uh the half slabs are to ensure
that<00:03:00.819> things<00:03:01.299> don't<00:03:01.569> start<00:03:01.870> spawning<00:03:02.470> down

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
that things don't start spawning down

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.970 
that things don't start spawning down
here<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:04.560> then<00:03:06.540> why<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:08.440> might<00:03:08.590> not<00:03:08.739> call

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
here and then why you might not call

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.259 
here and then why you might not call
that<00:03:09.130> run<00:03:09.489> I'm<00:03:09.640> flying<00:03:10.000> mode<00:03:10.330> okay<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.900> then

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
that run I'm flying mode okay and then

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.370 
that run I'm flying mode okay and then
when<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.360> come<00:03:13.569> up<00:03:13.720> here<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.140> start

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
when you come up here and you start

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.009 
when you come up here and you start
building<00:03:14.650> your<00:03:14.739> layers<00:03:15.010> these<00:03:15.790> layers<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
building your layers these layers the

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.690 
building your layers these layers the
blocks<00:03:17.290> themselves<00:03:17.920> not<00:03:18.070> including<00:03:18.549> these

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
blocks themselves not including these

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.220 
blocks themselves not including these
outside<00:03:19.420> fence<00:03:19.900> gates<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:21.400> 17<00:03:22.090> x<00:03:22.329> 17<00:03:22.989> now<00:03:23.170> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
outside fence gates is 17 x 17 now the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.960 
outside fence gates is 17 x 17 now the
reason<00:03:23.440> it's<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:23.829> much<00:03:24.070> smaller<00:03:24.370> than<00:03:24.670> down

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
reason it's so much smaller than down

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.849 
reason it's so much smaller than down
below<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.930> when<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.230> zombie<00:03:26.500> pigmen

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
below is so that when the zombie pigmen

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.800 
below is so that when the zombie pigmen
go<00:03:27.010> walking<00:03:27.489> off<00:03:27.670> they<00:03:27.910> still<00:03:28.150> fall<00:03:28.420> on<00:03:28.600> this

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
go walking off they still fall on this

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.930 
go walking off they still fall on this
edge<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.799> they<00:03:29.890> don't<00:03:30.010> walk<00:03:30.310> off<00:03:30.519> into<00:03:30.730> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
edge and they don't walk off into the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.849 
edge and they don't walk off into the
lava<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.630> lose<00:03:31.810> your<00:03:32.019> drops<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:32.739> all

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
lava and you lose your drops and all

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:40.050 
lava and you lose your drops and all
that<00:03:33.329> badness<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:37.480> make<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.930> 17<00:03:38.829> x<00:03:39.010> 17<00:03:39.730> layer

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
that badness so you make a 17 x 17 layer

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:48.000 
that badness so you make a 17 x 17 layer
here<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:40.810> then<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:42.609> cut<00:03:42.970> out<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:46.799> 33<00:03:47.799> wide

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
here and then you cut out a 33 wide

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.479 
here and then you cut out a 33 wide
section<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.790> center<00:03:49.239> on<00:03:49.709> all<00:03:50.709> these<00:03:51.040> sides

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
section to the center on all these sides

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.300 
section to the center on all these sides
here<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.560> even<00:03:53.560> though<00:03:53.829> these<00:03:53.950> are<00:03:54.010> fence

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
here and even though these are fence

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.129 
here and even though these are fence
gates<00:03:54.609> i<00:03:54.790> recommend<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.209> fill<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.600> with<00:03:55.780> glass

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
gates i recommend you fill it with glass

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.069 
gates i recommend you fill it with glass
panes<00:03:56.680> like<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.430> like<00:03:58.120> i<00:03:58.269> did<00:03:58.450> up<00:03:58.600> here<00:03:58.630> you<00:03:59.049> can

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
panes like so like i did up here you can

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.960 
panes like so like i did up here you can
see<00:03:59.350> it's<00:03:59.470> glass<00:03:59.799> panes<00:04:00.160> instead<00:04:00.609> of<00:04:00.700> fence

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
see it's glass panes instead of fence

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.009 
see it's glass panes instead of fence
gates<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.989> then<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.440> cut<00:04:02.799> out<00:04:03.180> before<00:04:04.180> in<00:04:04.660> the

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
gates and then you cut out before in the

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.990 
gates and then you cut out before in the
approximate<00:04:05.680> center<00:04:05.889> of<00:04:06.100> these<00:04:06.250> things<00:04:06.609> since

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
approximate center of these things since

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.490 
approximate center of these things since
they're<00:04:07.180> not<00:04:07.209> exactly<00:04:07.510> square<00:04:08.109> they<00:04:08.350> don't

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
they're not exactly square they don't

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.110 
they're not exactly square they don't
have<00:04:08.620> a<00:04:08.650> perfect<00:04:09.069> center<00:04:09.280> but<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.519> cut<00:04:09.760> out<00:04:09.790> a

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
have a perfect center but you cut out a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.150 
have a perfect center but you cut out a
4<00:04:10.840> by<00:04:10.959> 4<00:04:10.989> hole<00:04:11.350> in<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.530> center<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:11.829> put<00:04:11.950> glass

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
4 by 4 hole in the center and put glass

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.960 
4 by 4 hole in the center and put glass
panes<00:04:12.489> in<00:04:12.639> it<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:12.970> then<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.810> reason<00:04:14.230> i

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
panes in it and then the reason i

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.279 
panes in it and then the reason i
recommend<00:04:15.970> using<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.239> glass<00:04:16.539> panes<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.019> sped

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
recommend using the glass panes and sped

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.750 
recommend using the glass panes and sped
to<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.410> fence<00:04:17.709> gates<00:04:18.010> even<00:04:18.370> though<00:04:18.489> glass

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
to the fence gates even though glass

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.520 
to the fence gates even though glass
panes<00:04:19.150> are<00:04:19.329> slightly<00:04:19.690> less<00:04:20.019> effective<00:04:20.500> than

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
panes are slightly less effective than

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.409 
panes are slightly less effective than
thin<00:04:20.829> skates<00:04:21.130> when<00:04:21.849> you're<00:04:21.970> doing<00:04:22.240> one<00:04:22.390> of

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
thin skates when you're doing one of

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.690 
thin skates when you're doing one of
these<00:04:22.599> farms

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
these farms

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.170 
these farms
you<00:04:23.880> will<00:04:24.060> start<00:04:24.600> getting<00:04:25.430> some<00:04:26.430> magma<00:04:26.730> cubes

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
you will start getting some magma cubes

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.920 
you will start getting some magma cubes
and<00:04:27.710> if<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.860> use<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.070> fence<00:04:29.490> gates<00:04:29.930> instead

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
and if you use the fence gates instead

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.780 
and if you use the fence gates instead
of<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:32.180> glass<00:04:33.180> panes<00:04:33.620> then<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.650> magma<00:04:35.190> cube<00:04:35.460> can

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
of the glass panes then a magma cube can

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.880 
of the glass panes then a magma cube can
fall<00:04:36.060> through<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.420> fence<00:04:36.690> gates<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.320> magma

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
fall through the fence gates a magma

down<00:04:43.740> here<00:04:44.040> it's<00:04:44.160> just<00:04:44.250> going<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.760> kill<00:04:45.000> you

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
down here it's just going to kill you

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
magma cubes that can fall through are

the smallest size and those ones can't
hurt<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:53.010> think<00:04:53.580> there's<00:04:53.790> one<00:04:54.090> or<00:04:54.210> two<00:04:54.240> of

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
hurt you I think there's one or two of

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.810 
hurt you I think there's one or two of
them<00:04:54.900> in<00:04:55.170> the<00:04:56.240> time<00:04:57.240> lapse<00:04:58.220> but<00:04:59.220> yeah<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.580> then

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
them in the time lapse but yeah and then

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.990 
them in the time lapse but yeah and then
with<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.150> fence<00:05:00.360> pains<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.780> have<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.320> too<00:05:02.190> wide

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
with the fence pains you have a too wide

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.710 
with the fence pains you have a too wide
layer<00:05:03.450> all<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.990> way<00:05:04.080> along<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.560> outside<00:05:05.720> and

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
layer all the way along the outside and

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.450 
layer all the way along the outside and
it's<00:05:07.140> basically<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.500> same<00:05:07.740> design<00:05:08.100> and<00:05:08.370> the

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
it's basically the same design and the

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.840 
it's basically the same design and the
17<00:05:09.060> x<00:05:09.240> 17<00:05:09.750> q<00:05:10.050> now<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:10.560> 17<00:05:11.040> x<00:05:11.160> 17<00:05:11.580> doesn't

17 x 17 q now that 17 x 17 doesn't

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.790 
17 x 17 q now that 17 x 17 doesn't
include<00:05:12.060> these<00:05:12.390> outsides<00:05:13.140> and<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:15.360> want

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
include these outsides and you want

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.890 
include these outsides and you want
three<00:05:16.800> spaces<00:05:17.310> that's<00:05:18.030> faced<00:05:18.330> enough<00:05:18.630> for<00:05:18.810> you

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
three spaces that's faced enough for you

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.920 
three spaces that's faced enough for you
to<00:05:19.050> jump<00:05:19.290> between<00:05:19.590> each<00:05:20.070> layer<00:05:20.630> just<00:05:21.630> because

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
to jump between each layer just because

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.290 
to jump between each layer just because
i<00:05:21.960> found<00:05:22.320> that<00:05:22.500> a<00:05:22.680> base<00:05:23.490> for<00:05:23.820> some<00:05:24.000> reason

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
i found that a base for some reason

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.070 
i found that a base for some reason
spawned<00:05:24.950> more<00:05:25.950> pigment<00:05:26.550> when<00:05:27.330> they<00:05:27.480> had<00:05:27.660> three

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
spawned more pigment when they had three

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.430 
spawned more pigment when they had three
instead<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:28.710> two<00:05:28.830> not<00:05:29.700> exactly<00:05:29.940> sure<00:05:30.410> why<00:05:31.410> that

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
instead of two not exactly sure why that

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.370 
instead of two not exactly sure why that
is<00:05:31.800> but<00:05:32.610> yet<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.150> it's<00:05:33.300> pretty<00:05:33.480> simple<00:05:33.720> the

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
is but yet so it's pretty simple the

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.310 
is but yet so it's pretty simple the
only<00:05:34.710> expensive<00:05:35.640> part<00:05:35.910> of<00:05:36.060> this<00:05:36.660> would<00:05:37.050> be<00:05:37.170> the

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
only expensive part of this would be the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.110 
only expensive part of this would be the
glass<00:05:37.590> panes<00:05:38.040> because<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.640> platforms

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
glass panes because the platforms

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.150 
glass panes because the platforms
themselves<00:05:39.660> can<00:05:39.840> be<00:05:39.930> made<00:05:40.140> out<00:05:40.170> of<00:05:40.290> whatever

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
themselves can be made out of whatever

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.520 
themselves can be made out of whatever
material<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:41.910> have<00:05:42.060> now<00:05:42.900> you<00:05:42.960> do<00:05:43.110> have<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.410> be

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
material you have now you do have to be

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.080 
material you have now you do have to be
really<00:05:43.830> careful<00:05:43.980> walking<00:05:44.370> around<00:05:44.790> up<00:05:45.060> here

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
really careful walking around up here

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.930 
really careful walking around up here
because<00:05:45.390> you<00:05:45.570> can<00:05:45.720> easily<00:05:46.430> fall<00:05:47.430> through<00:05:47.790> the

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
because you can easily fall through the

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.730 
because you can easily fall through the
glass<00:05:48.120> panes<00:05:48.420> like<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:48.780> zombie<00:05:49.080> pigmen<00:05:49.440> can

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
glass panes like the zombie pigmen can

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.480 
glass panes like the zombie pigmen can
and<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:52.200> nice<00:05:52.470> thing<00:05:52.920> about<00:05:53.480> this<00:05:54.480> farm<00:05:54.870> is

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
and the nice thing about this farm is

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.920 
and the nice thing about this farm is
aside<00:05:56.490> from<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.790> fact<00:05:56.820> that<00:05:57.150> it's<00:05:57.390> cheap<00:05:57.780> to

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
aside from the fact that it's cheap to

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.050 
aside from the fact that it's cheap to
build<00:05:58.110> because<00:05:58.530> aside<00:05:59.100> from<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.460> glass<00:05:59.700> panes

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
build because aside from the glass panes

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.930 
build because aside from the glass panes
you<00:06:00.300> can<00:06:00.480> just<00:06:00.690> use<00:06:01.040> whatever<00:06:02.040> cheap

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
you can just use whatever cheap

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.800 
you can just use whatever cheap
resources<00:06:03.840> you<00:06:03.990> have<00:06:04.340> you<00:06:05.340> can<00:06:05.520> also<00:06:05.790> use<00:06:06.480> it

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
resources you have you can also use it

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.160 
resources you have you can also use it
as<00:06:06.930> an<00:06:07.020> agro<00:06:07.530> farm<00:06:07.860> now<00:06:08.700> I<00:06:09.090> wanted<00:06:09.780> to<00:06:09.840> build<00:06:10.080> a

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
as an agro farm now I wanted to build a

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.230 
as an agro farm now I wanted to build a
farm<00:06:10.350> where<00:06:10.500> you<00:06:10.620> wouldn't<00:06:10.920> have<00:06:11.310> to<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.880> grow

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
farm where you wouldn't have to a grow

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.000 
farm where you wouldn't have to a grow
the<00:06:12.390> zombie<00:06:12.750> pigmen<00:06:13.110> because<00:06:13.350> a<00:06:13.380> growing<00:06:13.860> the

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
the zombie pigmen because a growing the

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.520 
the zombie pigmen because a growing the
zombie<00:06:14.310> pigmen<00:06:14.730> can<00:06:15.030> be<00:06:15.210> dangerous<00:06:15.960> for<00:06:16.260> your

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
zombie pigmen can be dangerous for your

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.740 
zombie pigmen can be dangerous for your
health<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:17.010> don't<00:06:17.670> have<00:06:17.910> any<00:06:18.060> pigment<00:06:18.390> on<00:06:18.630> the

health I don't have any pigment on the

health I don't have any pigment on the
top<00:06:18.930> layer<00:06:19.170> at<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:19.500> moment<00:06:19.830> because<00:06:19.890> we've

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
top layer at the moment because we've

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.550 
top layer at the moment because we've
been<00:06:20.160> flying<00:06:20.550> around<00:06:20.820> up<00:06:21.180> here<00:06:21.240> but<00:06:22.230> if<00:06:22.410> you

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
been flying around up here but if you

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.550 
been flying around up here but if you
wanted<00:06:22.950> to<00:06:23.510> you<00:06:24.510> could<00:06:24.660> use<00:06:24.810> this<00:06:24.960> as<00:06:25.110> an<00:06:25.230> agro

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
wanted to you could use this as an agro

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.610 
wanted to you could use this as an agro
farm<00:06:25.770> as<00:06:25.950> well<00:06:26.160> so<00:06:26.490> you<00:06:26.960> you've<00:06:27.960> been<00:06:28.140> AF<00:06:28.260> kin

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
farm as well so you you've been AF kin

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.050 
farm as well so you you've been AF kin
for<00:06:28.920> a<00:06:28.950> while<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.250> you<00:06:29.340> see<00:06:29.550> there's<00:06:29.760> still<00:06:30.030> a

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
for a while and you see there's still a

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.340 
for a while and you see there's still a
bunch<00:06:30.210> of<00:06:30.360> pigment<00:06:30.720> up<00:06:30.810> here<00:06:31.050> you<00:06:31.170> can<00:06:31.200> just

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
bunch of pigment up here you can just

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.560 
bunch of pigment up here you can just
shoot<00:06:31.710> one<00:06:31.980> and<00:06:32.190> then<00:06:32.310> they'll<00:06:32.520> all<00:06:32.730> try<00:06:33.510> to

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
shoot one and then they'll all try to

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.210 
shoot one and then they'll all try to
run<00:06:33.870> to<00:06:34.020> you<00:06:34.140> and<00:06:34.410> fall<00:06:34.590> through<00:06:34.830> the<00:06:34.950> glass

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
run to you and fall through the glass

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.220 
run to you and fall through the glass
panes<00:06:35.610> and

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
panes and

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:42.430 
panes and
fall<00:06:36.860> to<00:06:37.280> their<00:06:37.570> imminent<00:06:38.570> doom<00:06:39.460> so<00:06:40.460> I<00:06:41.440> thought

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
fall to their imminent doom so I thought

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.820 
fall to their imminent doom so I thought
it<00:06:43.430> was<00:06:43.580> pretty<00:06:43.850> neat<00:06:44.120> and<00:06:44.450> I<00:06:45.050> like<00:06:45.440> it<00:06:45.650> because

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
it was pretty neat and I like it because

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.740 
it was pretty neat and I like it because
it's<00:06:46.160> cheap<00:06:46.520> it<00:06:46.670> doesn't<00:06:46.940> involve<00:06:47.120> redstone

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
it's cheap it doesn't involve redstone

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.480 
it's cheap it doesn't involve redstone
however<00:06:49.930> just<00:06:50.930> because<00:06:51.020> you<00:06:51.800> can<00:06:52.070> do<00:06:52.340> it

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
however just because you can do it

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.120 
however just because you can do it
without<00:06:52.670> redstone<00:06:53.420> i<00:06:53.720> would<00:06:54.230> recommend<00:06:54.830> if

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
without redstone i would recommend if

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.370 
without redstone i would recommend if
you<00:06:55.640> know<00:06:55.850> enough<00:06:56.120> about<00:06:56.240> redstone<00:06:56.870> and<00:06:57.140> have

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
you know enough about redstone and have

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.320 
you know enough about redstone and have
enough<00:06:57.590> resources<00:06:57.770> that<00:06:58.460> you<00:06:58.520> do<00:06:58.910> make<00:06:59.180> it

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
enough resources that you do make it

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.280 
enough resources that you do make it
with<00:06:59.480> redstone<00:07:00.130> because<00:07:01.130> a<00:07:01.430> redstone<00:07:01.850> farm<00:07:02.360> is

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
with redstone because a redstone farm is

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.440 
with redstone because a redstone farm is
you<00:07:04.190> know<00:07:04.310> probably<00:07:04.520> about<00:07:04.880> twice<00:07:05.240> as

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
you know probably about twice as

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.690 
you know probably about twice as
efficient<00:07:05.900> as<00:07:05.960> this<00:07:06.170> farm<00:07:06.500> is<00:07:06.680> that<00:07:07.250> this<00:07:07.370> farm

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
efficient as this farm is that this farm

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.040 
efficient as this farm is that this farm
is<00:07:07.790> good<00:07:08.120> and<00:07:08.240> cheap<00:07:08.450> for<00:07:08.660> someone<00:07:08.900> just

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
is good and cheap for someone just
