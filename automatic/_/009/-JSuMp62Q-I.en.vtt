00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
square root of a perfect square 1 square

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.910 
square root of a perfect square 1 square
is<00:00:10.990> 1<00:00:11.320> 2<00:00:11.800> squared<00:00:11.830> is<00:00:12.310> 4<00:00:12.370> 3<00:00:13.210> squared<00:00:13.570> is<00:00:13.750> 9<00:00:13.920> 4

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
is 1 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9 4

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.030 
is 1 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9 4
squared<00:00:15.100> is<00:00:15.400> 16<00:00:15.640> and<00:00:16.029> so<00:00:16.900> on<00:00:17.170> till<00:00:17.440> 10<00:00:17.710> square

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
squared is 16 and so on till 10 square

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.200 
squared is 16 and so on till 10 square
assembled<00:00:18.520> so<00:00:19.090> what<00:00:19.360> we<00:00:19.510> can<00:00:19.720> see<00:00:20.160> if<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
assembled so what we can see if the

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.710 
assembled so what we can see if the
perfect<00:00:22.539> square<00:00:23.140> is<00:00:23.350> ending<00:00:23.920> with<00:00:24.130> 4<00:00:24.720> then

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
perfect square is ending with 4 then

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.010 
perfect square is ending with 4 then
there<00:00:26.080> are<00:00:26.230> only<00:00:26.530> two<00:00:26.980> possibilities<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:28.090> at

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
there are only two possibilities and at

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.689 
there are only two possibilities and at
that<00:00:29.230> time<00:00:29.410> we<00:00:29.590> can<00:00:29.830> say<00:00:30.010> that<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.400> square

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
that time we can say that the square

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.970 
that time we can say that the square
root<00:00:31.029> of<00:00:31.210> that<00:00:31.390> number<00:00:31.559> will<00:00:32.559> be<00:00:32.769> either

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
root of that number will be either

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.059 
root of that number will be either
ending<00:00:33.609> with<00:00:33.819> 2<00:00:34.239> or<00:00:34.649> let's<00:00:35.649> say<00:00:35.859> a<00:00:36.069> or<00:00:36.730> 8<00:00:38.069> let's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:39.069 
ending with 2 or let's say a or 8 let's

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:40.829 
ending with 2 or let's say a or 8 let's
say<00:00:39.219> suppose<00:00:39.640> we<00:00:39.850> have<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.089> perfect<00:00:40.659> square

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
say suppose we have a perfect square

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.090 
say suppose we have a perfect square
which<00:00:41.079> is<00:00:41.140> ending<00:00:41.559> with<00:00:41.679> 6<00:00:42.010> as<00:00:42.420> only<00:00:43.420> once<00:00:43.870> 6<00:00:44.859> is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
which is ending with 6 as only once 6 is

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.739 
which is ending with 6 as only once 6 is
coming<00:00:45.399> in<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.789> square<00:00:46.059> so<00:00:46.269> we<00:00:46.389> can<00:00:46.420> directly

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:46.749 
coming in the square so we can directly

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.739 
coming in the square so we can directly
say<00:00:47.289> that<00:00:47.429> square<00:00:48.429> root<00:00:48.609> of<00:00:48.789> that<00:00:49.120> number<00:00:49.179> will

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
say that square root of that number will

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.189 
say that square root of that number will
be<00:00:49.899> ending<00:00:50.289> with<00:00:50.319> 6<00:00:51.239> similarly<00:00:52.239> if<00:00:52.420> we<00:00:52.989> have

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
be ending with 6 similarly if we have

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.789 
be ending with 6 similarly if we have
non<00:00:53.769> perfect<00:00:54.159> square<00:00:54.639> ending<00:00:55.120> with<00:00:55.329> 9<00:00:55.719> we<00:00:56.589> can

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
non perfect square ending with 9 we can

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.299 
non perfect square ending with 9 we can
say<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.370> square<00:00:57.819> will<00:00:58.539> have<00:00:58.839> either<00:00:59.309> 7

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
say that the square will have either 7

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.389 
say that the square will have either 7
or<00:01:00.569> 3<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:03.269> similarly<00:01:04.269> for<00:01:05.159> rest<00:01:06.159> of<00:01:06.340> the

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
or 3 and similarly for rest of the

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.910 
or 3 and similarly for rest of the
numbers<00:01:06.909> let's<00:01:07.810> say<00:01:07.930> suppose<00:01:08.350> we<00:01:08.380> want<00:01:08.770> to

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
numbers let's say suppose we want to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.370 
numbers let's say suppose we want to
find<00:01:09.130> square<00:01:09.610> root<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:10.860> 6<00:01:11.860> 0<00:01:12.219> 8<00:01:12.490> foot<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:14.020> we

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
find square root of 6 0 8 foot which we

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.920 
find square root of 6 0 8 foot which we
are<00:01:14.500> provided<00:01:15.070> at<00:01:15.250> 6:08<00:01:16.149> 4<00:01:16.450> is<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.659> perfect

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
are provided at 6:08 4 is a perfect

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:26.910 
are provided at 6:08 4 is a perfect
square<00:01:20.579> so<00:01:21.579> when<00:01:22.000> we<00:01:22.299> have<00:01:23.159> even<00:01:24.159> widgets<00:01:25.920> then

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
square so when we have even widgets then

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.580 
square so when we have even widgets then
the<00:01:27.100> square<00:01:27.399> root<00:01:27.640> will<00:01:27.909> have<00:01:28.180> n<00:01:28.450> by<00:01:28.869> 2<00:01:28.929> digits

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
the square root will have n by 2 digits

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.080 
the square root will have n by 2 digits
so<00:01:30.159> in<00:01:30.399> this<00:01:30.609> case<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.990> are<00:01:32.020> 4<00:01:32.770> digits<00:01:33.250> so

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
so in this case there are 4 digits so

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.560 
so in this case there are 4 digits so
the<00:01:34.329> square<00:01:34.659> root<00:01:34.689> will<00:01:35.170> have<00:01:35.439> 2<00:01:35.770> digits<00:01:36.479> 1<00:01:37.479> &amp;<00:01:37.840> 2

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the square root will have 2 digits 1 &amp; 2

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.469 
the square root will have 2 digits 1 &amp; 2
now<00:01:40.570> this<00:01:40.840> number<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.829> ending<00:01:42.310> with<00:01:42.520> full<00:01:43.149> and

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
now this number is ending with full and

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.719 
now this number is ending with full and
this<00:01:43.929> is<00:01:44.109> a<00:01:44.140> perfect<00:01:44.679> square<00:01:44.770> we<00:01:45.100> are<00:01:45.249> provided

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
this is a perfect square we are provided

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.719 
this is a perfect square we are provided
with<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:46.479> what<00:01:46.689> we<00:01:46.869> can<00:01:47.049> say<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:48.009> square<00:01:48.520> root

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
with so what we can say the square root

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.700 
with so what we can say the square root
will<00:01:49.149> be<00:01:49.600> ending<00:01:50.020> it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
will be ending it

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
will be ending it
-<00:01:50.980> or<00:01:51.600> eight<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.710> last<00:01:53.980> digit<00:01:54.400> will<00:01:54.580> be

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
- or eight so the last digit will be

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.080 
- or eight so the last digit will be
either<00:01:54.970> two<00:01:55.450> or<00:01:55.690> eight<00:01:56.320> so<00:01:57.160> this<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.520> our<00:01:57.700> first

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
either two or eight so this is our first

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.190 
either two or eight so this is our first
step<00:01:58.590> finding<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.770> last<00:01:59.980> two<00:02:00.610> digits<00:02:01.200> also

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
step finding the last two digits also

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.010 
step finding the last two digits also
his<00:02:02.320> last<00:02:02.470> digit<00:02:02.920> now<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.729> second<00:02:04.270> step<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:07.020> we

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
his last digit now the second step is we

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.170 
his last digit now the second step is we
need<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.440> find<00:02:09.600> c<00:02:10.600> 0<00:02:10.929> 8<00:02:11.260> 4<00:02:11.530> lies<00:02:12.190> between<00:02:12.700> which

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
need to find c 0 8 4 lies between which

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.960 
need to find c 0 8 4 lies between which
perfect<00:02:13.840> squares<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.100> we<00:02:16.770> know<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:17.970> 70

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
perfect squares so we know that 70

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.490 
perfect squares so we know that 70
squared<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.890> 4<00:02:20.890> 9<00:02:21.250> 0<00:02:21.280> 0<00:02:22.120> +<00:02:22.680> 8<00:02:23.680> d<00:02:24.010> square<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.670> 6<00:02:25.600> 4<00:02:26.050> 0

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
squared is 4 9 0 0 + 8 d square is 6 4 0

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.449 
squared is 4 9 0 0 + 8 d square is 6 4 0
0<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:27.910> number<00:02:28.209> 6<00:02:28.720> 0<00:02:28.989> 8<00:02:29.170> 4<00:02:29.470> lies<00:02:29.770> between<00:02:30.070> 4

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
0 so this number 6 0 8 4 lies between 4

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.070 
0 so this number 6 0 8 4 lies between 4
9<00:02:30.700> 0<00:02:30.730> 0<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.600> 6<00:02:32.530> 4<00:02:32.800> 0<00:02:33.130> 0<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.570> can<00:02:34.780> say<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
9 0 0 and 6 4 0 0 so we can say the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.710 
9 0 0 and 6 4 0 0 so we can say the
square<00:02:35.380> root<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.340> number<00:02:36.610> will<00:02:37.540> be

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
square root of this number will be

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.490 
square root of this number will be
between<00:02:38.110> 70<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:38.950> 80<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.640> we<00:02:40.270> are<00:02:40.510> already<00:02:41.050> in

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
between 70 and 80 and we are already in

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.370 
between 70 and 80 and we are already in
knowing<00:02:41.920> what<00:02:42.700> can<00:02:42.970> be<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.270> last<00:02:43.600> digit<00:02:44.230> of

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
knowing what can be the last digit of

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.580 
knowing what can be the last digit of
that<00:02:44.620> square<00:02:45.520> root<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.330> we<00:02:46.360> can<00:02:46.780> say<00:02:46.989> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
that square root so we can say the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.840 
that square root so we can say the
answer<00:02:47.830> can<00:02:48.370> be<00:02:48.630> 72<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:50.790> 78<00:02:53.250> now<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.310> third

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
answer can be 72 on 78 now the third

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.680 
answer can be 72 on 78 now the third
step<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.450> exactly<00:02:56.410> which<00:02:56.739> number<00:02:57.400> will<00:02:58.239> be<00:02:58.450> our

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
step is exactly which number will be our

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.440 
step is exactly which number will be our
answer<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.010> for<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.400> third<00:03:00.640> step<00:03:00.940> what<00:03:01.239> we'll

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
answer so for the third step what we'll

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
answer so for the third step what we'll
have<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.660> do<00:03:01.810> will<00:03:02.440> have<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:03.150> compare<00:03:04.150> 6<00:03:04.630> 0<00:03:04.930> 8<00:03:05.170> 4

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
of which thing will be lesser that is

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.910 
of which thing will be lesser that is
this<00:03:18.489> number<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.209> closer<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.780> which<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.739> these

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
this number is closer to which of these

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.150 
this number is closer to which of these
two<00:03:21.190> numbers<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:22.420> if<00:03:22.660> we<00:03:22.810> consider<00:03:22.989> 4<00:03:23.470> 9<00:03:23.709> 0<00:03:24.130> 0

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
two numbers so if we consider 4 9 0 0

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.590 
two numbers so if we consider 4 9 0 0
then<00:03:25.030> 6<00:03:25.420> 0<00:03:25.690> 8<00:03:25.870> 4<00:03:26.140> it's<00:03:26.320> almost<00:03:27.299> 1,000<00:03:28.299> greater

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
then 6 0 8 4 it's almost 1,000 greater

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.640 
then 6 0 8 4 it's almost 1,000 greater
than<00:03:28.959> 4<00:03:29.470> 9<00:03:29.680> 0<00:03:29.890> 0<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.430> if<00:03:30.970> we<00:03:31.000> consider<00:03:31.540> 6<00:03:31.989> 4<00:03:32.260> 0<00:03:32.620> 0

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
than 4 9 0 0 and if we consider 6 4 0 0

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.229 
than 4 9 0 0 and if we consider 6 4 0 0
then<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:34.329> is<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:35.440> difference<00:03:35.829> is<00:03:36.010> almost<00:03:36.239> 400

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
then it is the difference is almost 400

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.520 
then it is the difference is almost 400
and<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:38.260> case<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.650> 4<00:03:38.860> 9<00:03:39.070> 0<00:03:39.400> 0

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
and in case of 4 9 0 0

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.240 
and in case of 4 9 0 0
most<00:03:41.160> thousand<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:42.330> can<00:03:42.860> clearly<00:03:43.860> say<00:03:44.220> that

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
most thousand so we can clearly say that

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.500 
most thousand so we can clearly say that
this<00:03:44.940> number<00:03:45.240> is<00:03:45.690> closer<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.320> 6400<00:03:47.300> that<00:03:48.300> is

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
this number is closer to 6400 that is

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.490 
this number is closer to 6400 that is
the<00:03:49.020> number<00:03:49.320> is<00:03:49.440> closer<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:50.100> 80<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:51.360> our<00:03:51.630> answer

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
the number is closer to 80 so our answer

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.550 
the number is closer to 80 so our answer
is<00:03:52.710> now<00:03:53.280> 78<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.960> that's<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.770> answer

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
is now 78 so that's the answer

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.830 
is now 78 so that's the answer
let's<00:03:58.560> take<00:03:58.860> another<00:03:59.630> perfect<00:04:00.630> square

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
let's take another perfect square

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:11.920 
let's take another perfect square
example<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:07.770> this<00:04:08.580> is<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> perfect<00:04:09.240> square

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.620 

number<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:12.959> digits<00:04:13.470> are<00:04:13.739> five<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.459> all<00:04:14.910> so

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
number of digits are five that is all so

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.680 
number of digits are five that is all so
the<00:04:15.900> square<00:04:16.260> root<00:04:16.350> will<00:04:16.829> have<00:04:17.100> n<00:04:17.400> plus<00:04:17.940> 1<00:04:18.180> by<00:04:18.450> 2

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
the square root will have n plus 1 by 2

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.340 
the square root will have n plus 1 by 2
digits<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:20.150> since<00:04:21.150> these<00:04:21.660> total<00:04:22.140> number<00:04:22.320> of

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
digits so since these total number of

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.890 
digits so since these total number of
digits<00:04:22.770> are<00:04:22.950> 5<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.850> square<00:04:24.180> root<00:04:24.210> will

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
digits are 5 so the square root will

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.290 
digits are 5 so the square root will
have<00:04:25.169> 6<00:04:25.500> 5<00:04:25.740> 2<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:26.100> is<00:04:26.250> three<00:04:26.580> digits

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.280 

first<00:04:30.300> step<00:04:30.540> we<00:04:30.780> need<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.590> find<00:04:32.010> which<00:04:33.290> what

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
first step we need to find which what

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.170 
first step we need to find which what
what<00:04:34.650> can<00:04:34.890> be<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.250> last<00:04:35.490> digit<00:04:35.880> of<00:04:35.970> this

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
what can be the last digit of this

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.870 
what can be the last digit of this
square<00:04:36.450> so<00:04:36.750> this<00:04:37.140> square<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:38.100> ending<00:04:38.430> with<00:04:38.610> one

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
square so this square is ending with one

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.330 
square so this square is ending with one
so<00:04:39.510> we<00:04:39.720> have<00:04:40.020> square<00:04:40.500> root<00:04:40.680> which<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:40.919> ending

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
so we have square root which is ending

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.360 
so we have square root which is ending
with<00:04:41.460> one<00:04:41.730> or<00:04:42.000> nine<00:04:42.870> so<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.560> last<00:04:43.770> digit<00:04:44.130> can

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
with one or nine so the last digit can

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.080 
with one or nine so the last digit can
be<00:04:44.550> 1<00:04:44.880> or<00:04:45.150> 9<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:46.229> is<00:04:46.380> our<00:04:46.530> first<00:04:46.830> step<00:04:47.100> second

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
be 1 or 9 that is our first step second

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.400 
be 1 or 9 that is our first step second
step<00:04:49.310> we<00:04:50.310> need<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.610> find<00:04:50.850> between<00:04:51.330> these<00:04:52.050> two

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
step we need to find between these two

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.200 
step we need to find between these two
perfect<00:04:52.919> squares<00:04:53.100> this<00:04:54.200> square<00:04:55.200> lines<00:04:55.820> so<00:04:56.820> for

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
perfect squares this square lines so for

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.320 
perfect squares this square lines so for
that<00:04:57.690> we<00:04:57.990> need<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.260> know<00:04:58.680> squares<00:04:59.250> from<00:04:59.640> 1<00:04:59.940> to

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
that we need to know squares from 1 to

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:12.380 
that we need to know squares from 1 to
25<00:05:01.070> so<00:05:03.470> square<00:05:04.470> of<00:05:04.710> 22<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:07.310> 484<00:05:09.800> square<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:11.390> 23

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
25 so square of 22 is 484 square of 23

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:20.840 
25 so square of 22 is 484 square of 23
is<00:05:13.760> 529<00:05:14.870> square<00:05:15.870> of<00:05:16.080> 24<00:05:16.890> is<00:05:17.330> 576<00:05:18.330> and<00:05:19.520> so<00:05:20.520> we<00:05:20.669> can

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
is 529 square of 24 is 576 and so we can

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.180 
is 529 square of 24 is 576 and so we can
say<00:05:22.760> 20<00:05:23.760> to<00:05:24.030> 30<00:05:24.270> square<00:05:24.479> is<00:05:25.110> 5<00:05:25.830> to<00:05:26.190> 9

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
say 20 to 30 square is 5 to 9

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.410 
say 20 to 30 square is 5 to 9
zero<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:28.420> 40<00:05:28.960> square<00:05:29.380> is<00:05:29.560> five<00:05:30.100> seven<00:05:30.550> six<00:05:31.090> zero

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
zero to 40 square is five seven six zero

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.710 
zero to 40 square is five seven six zero
zero<00:05:31.780> so<00:05:32.620> we<00:05:32.770> can<00:05:32.800> say<00:05:33.010> five<00:05:33.820> three<00:05:34.150> three<00:05:34.180> six

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
zero so we can say five three three six

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.490 
zero so we can say five three three six
one<00:05:34.990> lies<00:05:35.230> between<00:05:36.570> four<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.600> nine<00:05:37.930> zero<00:05:38.260> zero

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
one lies between four to nine zero zero

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.010 
one lies between four to nine zero zero
and<00:05:38.680> five<00:05:38.950> seven<00:05:39.400> six<00:05:39.580> zero<00:05:39.700> zero<00:05:39.940> so<00:05:40.780> we<00:05:40.990> can

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
and five seven six zero zero so we can

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.540 
and five seven six zero zero so we can
say<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:42.760> numbers<00:05:43.570> can<00:05:43.840> be<00:05:43.900> two<00:05:44.560> three<00:05:44.920> one<00:05:45.280> or

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
say the numbers can be two three one or

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.520 
say the numbers can be two three one or
two<00:05:46.360> three<00:05:46.780> nine<00:05:48.270> now<00:05:49.270> we<00:05:49.330> need<00:05:49.840> to<00:05:50.020> find<00:05:50.200> which

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
two three nine now we need to find which

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.100 
two three nine now we need to find which
of<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.890> which<00:05:51.580> of<00:05:51.610> these<00:05:51.880> two<00:05:52.510> numbers<00:05:52.720> will

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
of the which of these two numbers will

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.440 
of the which of these two numbers will
be<00:05:53.290> our<00:05:53.410> perfect<00:05:54.040> square<00:05:54.280> for<00:05:54.670> this<00:05:54.850> perfect

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
be our perfect square for this perfect

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.730 
be our perfect square for this perfect
square<00:05:57.060> so<00:05:58.060> again<00:05:58.420> we<00:05:58.600> need<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:58.930> find<00:05:59.170> this

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
square so again we need to find this

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.970 
square so again we need to find this
number<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.550> closer<00:06:00.880> to<00:06:01.060> which<00:06:01.360> number<00:06:01.840> so<00:06:02.800> if

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
number is closer to which number so if

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.160 
number is closer to which number so if
we<00:06:03.130> consider<00:06:03.490> two<00:06:03.730> five<00:06:04.000> two<00:06:04.510> nine<00:06:04.750> zero<00:06:05.140> zero

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
we consider two five two nine zero zero

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:12.470 
we consider two five two nine zero zero
the<00:06:06.040> difference<00:06:06.550> is<00:06:06.820> almost<00:06:08.040> 400<00:06:09.040> and<00:06:09.390> if<00:06:10.390> we

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
the difference is almost 400 and if we

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.630 
the difference is almost 400 and if we
consider<00:06:13.480> this<00:06:14.080> number<00:06:14.560> five<00:06:14.800> seven<00:06:15.220> six<00:06:15.520> zero

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
consider this number five seven six zero

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.140 
consider this number five seven six zero
zero<00:06:16.210> the<00:06:16.500> difference<00:06:17.500> will<00:06:17.770> be<00:06:17.800> almost<00:06:18.220> four

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
zero the difference will be almost four

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.710 
zero the difference will be almost four
thousand<00:06:19.750> so<00:06:20.440> we<00:06:20.620> can<00:06:20.800> clearly<00:06:21.160> say<00:06:21.490> that<00:06:21.720> then

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
thousand so we can clearly say that then

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.530 
thousand so we can clearly say that then
of<00:06:22.870> the<00:06:23.230> perfect<00:06:23.650> square<00:06:23.860> lies<00:06:24.240> much<00:06:25.240> closer

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
of the perfect square lies much closer

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.620 
of the perfect square lies much closer
to<00:06:25.870> five<00:06:26.080> five<00:06:26.530> two<00:06:26.830> nine<00:06:27.040> zero<00:06:27.070> zero<00:06:27.460> or<00:06:27.940> the

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
to five five two nine zero zero or the

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.710 
to five five two nine zero zero or the
square<00:06:28.930> it<00:06:29.080> will<00:06:29.320> be<00:06:29.470> closer<00:06:29.740> to<00:06:30.070> 230<00:06:30.760> so<00:06:31.540> the

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
square it will be closer to 230 so the

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.580 
square it will be closer to 230 so the
square<00:06:32.050> root<00:06:32.230> will<00:06:32.440> be<00:06:32.940> 231<00:06:34.020> so<00:06:35.020> that's<00:06:35.290> the

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
square root will be 231 so that's the

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.330 
square root will be 231 so that's the
answer<00:06:39.570> so<00:06:40.570> this<00:06:40.750> was<00:06:40.960> possible<00:06:41.470> when<00:06:41.710> we<00:06:42.010> are

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
answer so this was possible when we are

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.700 
answer so this was possible when we are
aware<00:06:42.700> that<00:06:43.000> we<00:06:43.510> need<00:06:43.540> to<00:06:43.870> find<00:06:44.080> square<00:06:44.410> root

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
aware that we need to find square root

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.080 
aware that we need to find square root
of<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:45.040> perfect<00:06:45.280> square<00:06:45.700> in<00:06:46.470> next<00:06:47.470> example<00:06:48.090> in

of a perfect square in next example in
next<00:06:49.480> video<00:06:49.600> we'll<00:06:49.960> find<00:06:50.530> a<00:06:50.800> general<00:06:51.430> method

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
next video we'll find a general method

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.230 
next video we'll find a general method
which<00:06:52.780> can<00:06:52.810> be<00:06:53.200> applied<00:06:53.530> even<00:06:53.980> if<00:06:54.130> we<00:06:54.490> are<00:06:54.850> not

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
which can be applied even if we are not

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.120 
which can be applied even if we are not
aware<00:06:55.540> that<00:06:55.600> we<00:06:55.990> are<00:06:56.020> having<00:06:56.470> a<00:06:56.620> perfect

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
aware that we are having a perfect

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.290 
aware that we are having a perfect
square<00:06:57.510> thank<00:06:58.510> you<00:06:58.630> for<00:06:58.810> watching<00:06:59.050> this<00:06:59.140> video
