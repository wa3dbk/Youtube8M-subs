00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.700
 Welcome to 1 September on today it will be colorful unspectacular 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.940
 Program on board is very diverse and right here in the year day everyone finds 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.110
 differently a different show instead of the head of the entertainment Thomas Schmidt as 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.110
 Candidate 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.890
 and yesterday to 20 years 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.190
 but today for everything 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 Ahoi Energies Aldi have already met Berliners one time 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.060
 the castings for the artists 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.880
 and now the program is ready I sat down exciting Salomon which 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.030
 Shows await guests who start the casting and then gradually 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.329
 our creative teams come together 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.390
 now there are 14 different shows we have one 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.150
 a whole hand reminiscent of reminding or remembering the show 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.850
 Storck was busy with the birth of Earth's life that of the world 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 out of the water 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.150
 then we have a comedy show staged by karl-heinz fein kÃ¤mmen 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.530
 around that the urban Pfaff and Klimbim and Sketche at its very funny thing 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.460
 a kind of comedy then we have the premiere of tonight for example 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.110
 Tango distributor his real tango show we would be in the future too 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.000
 Classical we have become artiste Rehart meters acrobatics we have become 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.120
 Various forms of children's theater have an ounce restaurant 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.300
 Atlantik what word for me because of this diverse program for the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.820
 only in the theater instead of or arranged 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.430
 we'll do something at the casino like on the pool deck doing something 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.250
 So today, for example, when we leave Stockholm we have in the archipelago 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 played for jazz standards 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:17.950
 and we try 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.229
 to stage the whole ship, so to speak, to a theater stage 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:26.349
 The theater in itself remained so what you can find from the charming alone 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.609
 tec-dax has been changed a lot 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.369
 the theater has a very nice auditorium there you do not have much 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.119
 In this respect, we now have a whole new theater technology 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.640
 have sensational projection technology now with a projector 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.220
 which has no big German cinema and with an elegy Wolf 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.759
 In the truest sense of the word Britney Spears bought from her last 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.999
 Tour and here on 24 square meters greatest most colorful and 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.999
 fastest pictures 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.510
 all songs Chantal on 9 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.750
 haha Lehmann what a perfect name for a costume designer etc the journey home 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.709
 a plethora of Kristine behind us and is just starting to grow 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.089
 read 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:14.509
 just below 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.129
 there is a part of Acquah that I especially like a driver's license 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.399
 the return had to be open as it dare 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:28.529
 that is again ready of the head but a victory ago it shall be of 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:29.709
 educate him 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.620
 I had already watched the show NPP and there are a lot of impulses 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.419
 an exceptional one that you can take part in 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.889
 while the 7th 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.159
 these are my ideas and one of these Christine Sinclair as alternatives 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.499
 stood so 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.059
 it was about many people's 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.949
 eleven fire water air and earth 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.790
 So for example what was that in the swing of one and in wellness and so on 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:54.829
 the watersports have these 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.669
 then parents have to choose this wave all the way to the kids 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.669
 literally bouncing around them 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.059
 All this has made me extremely curious, of course 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:15.439
 to the next show Tondo today at the premiere the theater feels slow 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.249
 and I just want to be like Xing is the first time a ship makes the trip 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.819
 again under the front
