00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 all beaver people and you know came out new 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.240
 little teaser for future events from 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.639
 scott on his page in baby 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.540
 there was a picture of a hat all as usual 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.740
 but the name of the picture says something 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.049
 great 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.630
 Coming and I am very interested in what is there 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.060
 such a big game could be 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.740
 pancake would be cool but still 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.500
 I doubt Scott will release her like that. 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.449
 soon as you think though it is possible if 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.150
 will release the game then this though wait a minute 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.669
 it was the same trailer boom means most likely 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.489
 one of the options that will come soon 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.280
 trailer for five nights at freddy's 4 and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.250
 create a page in steven but this too 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.680
 maybe but i'm guessing that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 business will not be something so big 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.000
 because if you believe the release date on 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.219
 site, it will come out very soon 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.460
 somehow early to create a trailer so 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.699
 maybe another teaser comes out and here on 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.859
 this teaser will be something really important and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 You can show that animatronics which 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.049
 hiding in the dark or on show 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 Freddie himself I am a hat and a bow 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.200
 lying on the ground that is that freddie 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.240
 Phaseber which was family deiner or 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.630
 actually this hat belongs 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.600
 the pink guy who was in 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.880
 the first family pizzeria is a mystery and maybe 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.759
 he was there for the workers and maybe exactly 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.610
 he wore this bow tie which has obviously 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.950
 purple color and also essay logo 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.470
 light it also takes on the color of the killer 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.220
 did you agree to the appearance of the pink guy 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.860
 on a teaser 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.549
 will be a big enough event to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.460
 call it 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.369
 big event or there like me 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.770
 supposed to be springtrap which 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.560
 finally come out of the shadows and create 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.200
 something quite powerful is also possible 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.240
 fits a big event and so 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.490
 Summing up the first version of the exit game 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.130
 unlikely the second option trailer 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.890
 more likely already the third option is that 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.680
 is this some kind of freddie and is it your own timer 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.350
 or is it a springtrap or is it 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.830
 some kind of animatronic else who was standing in 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.869
 darkness can mango can not matra 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.350
 how can something like this be thought 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.060
 or is it a pink or purple guy 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.160
 himself 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.530
 write in the comments guys like you 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.350
 think what the big event is 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.390
 and on this all dear friends I hope you 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.390
 good bye good bye good luck
