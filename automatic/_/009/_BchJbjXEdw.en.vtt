00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.629
 right now your friends from youtube that 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.149
 I hope so good that they are from 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.130
 revolution we are already in a new video 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.650
 in which to talk about a new module 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.660
 that I found on exposed before 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.600
 nothing I want to say that this information 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.670
 I have found it personally there is no 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.680
 no video unless what there is 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.449
 searched there is no talking video 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.029
 Hispanic who talks about this 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.830
 application and well I want to patent the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.720
 Obviously the application 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.269
 It's not mine, so that's not possible 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.830
 patent but good if you see someone 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.420
 that talks about the same application of 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.360
 speaks Spanish because the information has 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.640
 come out of this video well this apart 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.340
 let's go to the application that I'm going to 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.170
 teaching today is called knock code 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.300
 this will ring those of us who are involved 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.440
 in the world of android and so on but for 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.650
 those who make us a quick explanation 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.940
 it's a blocking system in plan as if 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.980
 out a pattern only that they are from the range 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.840
 it is only in the range of lg g2 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.090
 from g2 it seems to me that it started 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.780
 to incorporate this kind of touches in the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.150
 screen to unlock the device 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.840
 it's a kind of pin or a pattern 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.130
 which is very simple to unlock 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.350
 the only thing we need for this 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.290
 application work is the ex post it that 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.460
 obviously the module that is called 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.950
 I do not code here is this here and the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.800
 requirements have a device with 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.000
 android 4.2 onwards obviously 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.120
 we also have to have the device 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.370
 rooted so good once 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.500
 we install module we activate and we do 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.650
 We open the whole topic and we are going to 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.810
 find us with this one 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.270
 this screen is to whom there is not no 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.160
 nothing else then we have here to draw 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.690
 the touches we make on the screen and 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.640
 draw the lines in which we are going to 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.500
 split the screen the screen is going to 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.110
 divide into four parts if we make one 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580
 middle line and another line in the middle 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.800
 of the screen then there will be four 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.690
 parts to change the good 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.670
 obviously to put the code what 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.400
 only thing you have to do is king code 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 do not code and here we enter here will ask us 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.840
 that will enter as you see break as a 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.090
 fence can not be observed but here there are 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.940
 some lines, well, it will tell us that 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.160
 let's put the code not that we have put 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.500
 currently in my case I have to put 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.570
 this one I have it like that and then it will tell us 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.070
 that we enter the new code of fact 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.380
 I think that from the beginning he already asks us 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.780
 that the new good code came in 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.060
 I'll put the same one and repeat as if 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.200
 out an unlock pattern and you're done 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.540
 we will have our codec activated 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.220
 there are more things there are more things that we have 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.019
 to know about this application that 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.170
 we have to have the screen lock 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.080
 by default that is from the system and this 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.660
 it is done therefore being adjustments in security 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.430
 and we put the one that comes by default and what 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.590
 what we see what to do is put a pattern 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.510
 a normal pattern for example let's 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.920
 put mine that is this and then what 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.970
 The only thing he does is put pattern 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.970
 we make the pattern 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.610
 and once we have it, we will have the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.150
 code activated the only thing that we have to 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.650
 do is we lock the screen and this 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.910
 also has the disadvantage that 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.530
 obviously not having the same 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.030
 technology than all the others 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.470
 shaft devices 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.390
 we have to have the screen turned on 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.060
 as you can see he has not ordered us 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.560
 observe if to forgive forgiveness the only thing 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.350
 what we have to do is give the touches 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.140
 that we have put in 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.790
 in the lock code so good 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.680
 this is very simple is an application that 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.080
 the truth does not waste any battery 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.210
 because even so, despite all the good 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.500
 reputation that has Xbox and others there 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.110
 People who still think they spend 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.630
 battery more because it makes changes and so on 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.360
 and for nothing this is a direct change to 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.460
 system with what neither slows down nor 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.930
 spend battery as well as for example others 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.310
 screen locks I've seen in 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.950
 google play that there is one that touch two 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.900
 sometimes to pay but then finally you have 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.660
 great variety of errors with this 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.410
 you just have it gone to which 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.390
 obviously if we have the screen 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.970
 blocked we can not turn on our 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.680
 device because we do not have that same 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.080
 technology so the only thing I have 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.670
 what to do is turn it on and we give 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.080
 four taps on the screen go me 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.270
 left wrong because I was wrong to 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.820
 touch something is worth now let's put it 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.530
 well and that's it, we'll have our 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.540
 device unlocked and suitable for 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.040
 all use so good I hope that you 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.810
 you liked this video you follow in video 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.060
 very short but it is really 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.310
 information was incredible that I take 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.750
 time looking for this kind of codes and 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.639
 for the time I find something that is 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.379
 still in beta 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.849
 the truth is that he deserved to make a video 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.129
 so I hope you liked it 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.870
 of the life favorites that subscribe to 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.400
 more and go to the last not well
