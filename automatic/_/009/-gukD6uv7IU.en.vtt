00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 then roll up to the old model 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 switched off and the drive 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.870
 rotor blades is done actually through 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:15.480
 the wind rewards the sentence of our paula 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.060
 the cent pro is near by 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.590
 pour extra the tournament arrived and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.220
 As I said it is a premiere in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.330
 Germany 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:31.650
 The model is available for purchase costs about 6000 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:36.059
 euro including drive and taxes yet 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.890
 the rotor needs electric motor 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.980
 dissuaded to a certain 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 speed 300 turns and 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.070
 so that the beginning is occurring target 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.910
 he then turns electric motor 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:00.120
 turned off and the power goes to the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.760
 drive motor over the wants can over 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.510
 a so-called impact controlled joint 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.180
 that will not be a height or no 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.180
 but wonder is about this route 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 controlled 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.549
 but eurocopter will too 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.600
 There are called gillers 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:30.049
 pen drawings already in the year 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:35.119
 In 1920 before a horse- trading achja was a 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:40.850
 developed and pursued Spanish 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.679
 So a very long tradition of 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.469
 listen model series there is one 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.079
 Original aircraft built in Austria 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.899
 and it's my current one here 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:55.520
 copy including tax was 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.959
 Everything from the original we copied 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.909
 here a rotor diameter of three 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:03.909
 meters 20 and a take-off weight of 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:18.069
 1670 cubic centimeter two- stroke engine or 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.069
 here everywhere electric drive 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.830
 So a great story too 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.830
 about original it is a giro account
