00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello today in this video i 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.519
 tell you how to weave this 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.450
 a simple little bauble we need three 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.210
 colors two threads each that is just 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:22.410
 will get 6 no this case we take two 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:25.789
 purple two black and two green we 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.420
 collect all the threads let's say so in a bunch and 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:34.430
 retreat about here so much does 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:40.940
 forgive the knot with this trick 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.660
 we will do we will attach our book 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.629
 any 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.629
 or journal or guts 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:58.710
 what do we do when stapled stitch our 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.660
 strings of the floor 2 and 1 those which we put and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.540
 will be the first row 2 2 and 3 3 so from what 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.970
 we will start we need to decide what 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.240
 The thread we will have is working, that is, we 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:20.130
 take our first thread and look the most 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.070
 the very most extreme here it is with us 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.659
 she will be their worker 1 will patronize 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:32.220
 all other threads that we do we 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.400
 we take and we undertake I will decide not to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.140
 we will braid and make a bundle, see 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:45.210
 how do we take and put it like this then work 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.500
 we spend under it the worker we pull out 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.700
 what we should get and we delay 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.300
 not too weak but not too strong 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.240
 one string we gain two times that is 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.150
 commander of the second zilog all of us this not 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.000
 workers and postpone later on 100 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.720
 workers torn off the leftmost and obsessed 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.100
 hands do not lower see the following 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.210
 the thread we have is black greek 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.800
 nickelas not getting confused by this often 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:26.400
 there are mistakes just here it is higher 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:37.580
 them that we will take our braid 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:37.580
 working and doing exactly the same nodule 1 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.680
 2 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.680
 tighten and 1 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.280
 at 2 knot you make it whale black 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.580
 non-working we put off the side take 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:08.640
 following a string of it, we also here comes 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:08.640
 little black we take and 1 2 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:26.850
 three four like this 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:29.120
 in the same way we will make all the threads i 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.120
 more 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.110
 nothing convoluted actually in 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.130
 weaving baubles nope but that's enough 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.290
 hard work that I think 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.350
 can be taken seriously to 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.190
 get beautiful corollas after all bauble 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.030
 actually 20 friend sing rubles for 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:58.820
 month is dismissive therefore 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:04.730
 It means to merge the post office once 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.730
 was his last thread dopletaem 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.630
 everything 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:15.320
 here it is our working we postpone and 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:19.750
 re- put all the threads in what order 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.750
 we will crush them so as not to get confused 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.030
 We look at the most extreme left with us again 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:39.440
 purple she is now and will be working we 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:42.130
 take the black one and do the same 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.130
 nodule 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.480
 did the port what we do 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.990
 all set aside and in this way we 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:06.050
 done now need for on gas years 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:10.070
 will need he does not have a bracelet to do 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.230
 that is what hand we have let me 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:29.150
 I'll show you how it should look 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:32.090
 like this about like that 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.750
 bartack that we hit our 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:39.760
 bracelet 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.760
 magazines well all date
