00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.100
 do you do to climb this case and 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.470
 then you'll just jump in 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.480
 some name is 6 until you reach a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.719
 public saying that the point where you 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.700
 will get your ticket from 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.879
 mortality and will also be able to get 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.880
 the most important paragraphs are 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.400
 be able to show a strategic point for 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.120
 you stay on top of the house killing 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.710
 zombies 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 only in this environment what you do not 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.780
 to catch the red ones not from this 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.149
 because I wanted to show this point 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.850
 So what are you going to achieve? 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.340
 both its invincibility grid and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.440
 get the power up and still have some 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.670
 with someone can put together a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.680
 team 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.750
 Good first, I'll tell you what. 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.969
 so you can do the following you 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.060
 you have to do the right procedures 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:15.439
 to reduce the chances of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.439
 cash attempts 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.979
 developed by people for me and for 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.759
 team the team powered rogÃ©rio 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.529
 you're going to get half-electronic on soy 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.499
 while the right position this position 

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:35.009
 with the power and have him ask you 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:36.630
 find the right setting of wood in the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.759
 grade you have to look for is 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.299
 practically the symbol of the grid it has 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.119
 that match and then you have to 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.340
 wait to obey the window reminding 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.889
 that will only work if you are tenth 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.529
 the window will not work if you are 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:55.139
 rising up in the window because with it nothing 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.369
 he comes nearer out of this grace if 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:02:01.139
 no more you 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.840
 he puts both his hands on the grid or 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:06.689
 to be totally is the stable coral 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.880
 With certainty you must run to 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.250
 try to stab us 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.530
 so if you have playing with a friend 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.380
 He can help you and help you there. 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.600
 to always come up with it you need 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.420
 you are positioned just had in 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.069
 make the goal 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.019
 so you can see that if you have 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.959
 the right position if the control in 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.629
 as well as the fear of putting 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.170
 hands out the window leaving I can already 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.450
 Run that knife there. 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.250
 in this space you will be tempted to 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.739
 and you will not be able to 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.530
 find the perfect combination of 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.540
 this combination is one of the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.930
 to succeed combinations 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.230
 the opposition exists another angulation exists 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.540
 also another position of the b and you will 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.290
 able to do this but it's always good to 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.760
 people to analyze what to do for you if 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.370
 bring a reference to the rival was 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.409
 This is easier, we managed 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.569
 I actually tried to get another 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.310
 way but this was the reference of the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.560
 our rogÃ©rio friend that he 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.959
 He managed and found it quite easy and 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.739
 simple to do 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:23.629
 so if you can get where 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:30.069
 we arrived and before we bring people 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:30.069
 tested between us and not only for me 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.280
 after I got into the house you can jump 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:41.090
 on that rock that I showed at the beginning 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.760
 of the video after you jump a career 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.440
 blank you have to give a stent 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.019
 even for that you 'll have to 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.479
 just walk away a little PatatÃ¡ 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.609
 got to run and was you jump on 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.440
 of these debris to get 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.970
 approach the truck that is your 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.549
 of invincibility 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.780
 remembering that you should depart by 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.150
 some time ago when it arrives at 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.590
 confidentiality caf head on top of 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.199
 armchair 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.849
 if you get too close you can 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.579
 take a gang 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.579
 especially if you are not 19 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:17.320
 which automatically still a rapa 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.650
 Sunday you will end up falling dead 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.460
 unity 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.949
 But be careful you get here on this one. 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.870
 here on the truck try to stay on top of the 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.779
 yellow armchair preferably more 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.129
 to attract more 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:36.189
 it's just you testing if a new level 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.469
 This passion is everything and so is the 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:40.089
 opposition and you telling what you are going 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:42.249
 change this position 

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:44.139
 as it appears to the Colorados 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.969
 appear a power up you find in the 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.659
 front to pick up then back to 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:51.189
 position and will work if in that 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.869
 environment I recorded together with my 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:55.269
 My fish friend was trying to do this. 

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:57.399
 border with me too 

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:59.259
 You may realize that he had her. 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:01.059
 painted chilli and getting vacant 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:05.110
 inside has brought you the 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:06.339
 correct references the nearest act 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.229

 This was a differential there for you. 

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:18.490
 until then I had seen in a channel 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.889
