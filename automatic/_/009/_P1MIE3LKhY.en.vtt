00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
might be building another map that

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.990 
might be building another map that
actually<00:03:37.500> isn't<00:03:37.650> from<00:03:38.160> black<00:03:38.400> ops<00:03:38.640> might<00:03:38.910> be

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
actually isn't from black ops might be

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.970

with a friend or something probably like

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.700 
with a friend or something probably like
a<00:03:43.410> giant<00:03:43.890> school<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:45.240> don't<00:03:45.870> know<00:03:45.990> something

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
a giant school I don't know something

a giant school I don't know something
like<00:03:46.800> that<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.480> right<00:03:48.480> there<00:03:48.630> that's<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
like that and right there that's the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.660 
like that and right there that's the
ginormous<00:03:50.840> like<00:03:51.840> turret<00:03:52.170> machine<00:03:52.440> yeah<00:03:53.310> it's

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
ginormous like turret machine yeah it's

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.980 
ginormous like turret machine yeah it's
crazy<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:54.090> actually<00:03:54.390> don't<00:03:54.510> need<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.840> power

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
crazy you actually don't need the power

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.830 
crazy you actually don't need the power
on<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.620> use<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.160> that's<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.540> don't<00:03:57.720> think

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
on to use it and that's it I don't think

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.120 
on to use it and that's it I don't think
there's<00:03:57.990> really<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.200> way<00:03:58.440> for<00:03:58.710> me<00:03:58.740> to<00:03:58.860> do<00:03:59.010> that

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
there's really a way for me to do that

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.950 
there's really a way for me to do that
unless<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.580> just<00:03:59.730> extremely<00:04:00.330> annoying<00:04:00.690> so

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
unless it's just extremely annoying so

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.930 
unless it's just extremely annoying so
here's<00:04:01.650> one<00:04:01.830> example<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.520> perk<00:04:02.730> it's

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
here's one example of a perk it's

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.300 
here's one example of a perk it's
cobwebs<00:04:03.450> it's<00:04:04.110> replacing<00:04:04.710> a<00:04:04.860> speed<00:04:05.130> cool

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
cobwebs it's replacing a speed cool

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.540 
cobwebs it's replacing a speed cool
because<00:04:05.550> i'm<00:04:06.080> making<00:04:07.080> this<00:04:07.230> mop<00:04:07.710> without<00:04:08.370> any

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
because i'm making this mop without any

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.490 
because i'm making this mop without any
mods<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.150> don't<00:04:09.480> have<00:04:09.600> any<00:04:09.840> like<00:04:10.020> actual

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
mods so I don't have any like actual

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.170 
mods so I don't have any like actual
weapons<00:04:10.800> or<00:04:10.920> anything<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.760> wasn't<00:04:12.030> pulled

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
weapons or anything and it wasn't pulled

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.400 
weapons or anything and it wasn't pulled
down<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.330> lever<00:04:12.570> but<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.020> don't<00:04:13.200> get

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
down the lever but you don't get

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.800 
down the lever but you don't get
anything<00:04:13.590> because<00:04:14.550> you<00:04:15.390> have<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.570> try<00:04:15.690> on<00:04:15.750> the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
anything because you have to try on the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.550 
anything because you have to try on the
power<00:04:15.960> to<00:04:16.500> use<00:04:16.650> anything<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.840> can't

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
power to use anything so and I can't

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.469 
power to use anything so and I can't
that<00:04:19.950> trap<00:04:20.580> won't<00:04:20.729> work<00:04:20.850> because<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.330> power

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
that trap won't work because the power

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.310 
that trap won't work because the power
is<00:04:21.510> not<00:04:21.690> on

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
is not on

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.110 
is not on
so<00:04:22.890> i'll<00:04:23.010> have<00:04:23.190> another<00:04:23.430> door<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.850> now<00:04:23.970> this

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
so i'll have another door and now this

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.670 
so i'll have another door and now this
is<00:04:24.300> stage<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:26.310> power<00:04:26.490> switch<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.030> right<00:04:27.180> there

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
is stage the power switch is right there

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.440 
is stage the power switch is right there
I<00:04:28.680> will<00:04:29.130> switch<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.520> on<00:04:29.610> in<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.760> second<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.270> just

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
I will switch it on in a second I just

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.830 
I will switch it on in a second I just
gonna<00:04:30.600> go<00:04:31.200> check<00:04:31.380> out<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.560> alley<00:04:32.390> now<00:04:33.390> that

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
gonna go check out the alley now that

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.240 
gonna go check out the alley now that
room<00:04:34.020> right<00:04:34.170> there<00:04:34.230> with<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.650> stairs<00:04:34.890> I'm

room right there with the stairs I'm

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.830 
room right there with the stairs I'm
probably<00:04:35.640> going<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.030> change<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.480> before<00:04:36.600> I

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
probably going to change it before I

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.630 
probably going to change it before I
release<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.170> because<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:37.980> mean<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.280> still<00:04:38.490> can

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
release it because I mean I still can

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.300 
release it because I mean I still can
make<00:04:38.790> it<00:04:38.940> look<00:04:39.120> pretty<00:04:39.150> nice<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:40.170> know<00:04:40.650> was<00:04:41.070> not

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.430 
only spiders spawn but if you play a day
it<00:04:59.310> doesn't<00:04:59.880> really<00:05:00.210> matter<00:05:00.420> day<00:05:00.900> or<00:05:01.020> night<00:05:01.200> I

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
it doesn't really matter day or night I

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.840 
it doesn't really matter day or night I
mean<00:05:01.680> it's<00:05:02.010> kind<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.250> cool<00:05:02.430> play<00:05:02.580> at<00:05:02.670> data

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
mean it's kind of cool play at data

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.730 
mean it's kind of cool play at data
sometimes<00:05:03.120> zombie<00:05:03.900> will<00:05:04.020> catch<00:05:04.170> on<00:05:04.290> fire<00:05:04.530> if

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
sometimes zombie will catch on fire if

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.960 
sometimes zombie will catch on fire if
there's<00:05:04.860> like<00:05:04.980> a<00:05:05.010> hole<00:05:05.250> in<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.460> ceiling<00:05:05.640> and

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
there's like a hole in the ceiling and

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
I'm gonna turn on the power a little bit

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.670 
I'm gonna turn on the power a little bit
of<00:05:15.300> lag<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:17.370> I<00:05:17.640> just<00:05:18.110> cannot<00:05:19.110> wait<00:05:19.320> to<00:05:19.530> get<00:05:19.620> a

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680

hard drive like both both things are

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.850 
hard drive like both both things are

the<00:06:25.320> hard<00:06:25.530> drive<00:06:25.680> doesn't<00:06:25.890> have<00:06:26.130> to<00:06:26.340> be

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
the hard drive doesn't have to be

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.280

every<00:06:59.800> single<00:07:00.039> i<00:07:00.099> think<00:07:00.310> is<00:07:00.400> on<00:07:00.490> like<00:07:00.639> two

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:00.789 
every single i think is on like two

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:02.790 
every single i think is on like two
weapons<00:07:01.180> that<00:07:01.509> aren't<00:07:01.960> this<00:07:02.080> way<00:07:02.229> because<00:07:02.680> uh

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
weapons that aren't this way because uh

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.219 
weapons that aren't this way because uh
like<00:07:03.490> I<00:07:03.610> think<00:07:03.819> one<00:07:04.000> of<00:07:04.030> them<00:07:04.300> is<00:07:04.330> like

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:05.229 
like I think one of them is like

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:07.230 
like I think one of them is like
crunched<00:07:05.650> up<00:07:05.800> in<00:07:06.009> a<00:07:06.340> corner<00:07:06.610> so<00:07:06.879> you<00:07:06.969> actually

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
crunched up in a corner so you actually

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.760 
crunched up in a corner so you actually
had<00:07:07.599> so<00:07:07.810> it<00:07:07.900> just<00:07:08.050> basically<00:07:08.199> just<00:07:08.500> comes<00:07:08.680> out

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
had so it just basically just comes out

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.980 
had so it just basically just comes out
of<00:07:08.889> the<00:07:08.979> wall<00:07:09.099> instantly<00:07:09.909> but<00:07:10.539> every<00:07:10.900> other

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
of the wall instantly but every other

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.240 
of the wall instantly but every other
weapon<00:07:11.349> pretty<00:07:11.560> much<00:07:11.740> you<00:07:11.830> have<00:07:11.949> to<00:07:11.979> wait<00:07:12.219> just

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
weapon pretty much you have to wait just

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.719 
weapon pretty much you have to wait just
for<00:07:12.580> a<00:07:12.639> little<00:07:12.759> while<00:07:12.939> to<00:07:13.810> get<00:07:13.960> I<00:07:14.460> also<00:07:15.460> try<00:07:15.669> to

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:15.729 
for a little while to get I also try to

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:17.339 
for a little while to get I also try to
work<00:07:15.879> on<00:07:16.000> the<00:07:16.120> detail<00:07:16.479> of<00:07:16.509> like<00:07:16.810> looking

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:17.349 
work on the detail of like looking

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:19.200 
work on the detail of like looking
inside<00:07:17.830> of<00:07:17.979> a<00:07:18.069> room<00:07:18.279> like<00:07:18.490> if<00:07:18.699> you<00:07:18.789> remember<00:07:18.849> on

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
inside of a room like if you remember on

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.330 
inside of a room like if you remember on
that<00:07:19.240> the<00:07:19.719> actual<00:07:19.810> keno<00:07:20.529> map<00:07:20.710> you<00:07:20.860> can<00:07:20.979> look<00:07:21.250> in

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340 
that the actual keno map you can look in

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.070 
that the actual keno map you can look in
the<00:07:21.430> room<00:07:21.580> it's<00:07:22.090> probably<00:07:22.330> not<00:07:22.479> exactly<00:07:22.960> the

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
the room it's probably not exactly the

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.839 
the room it's probably not exactly the
same<00:07:23.139> but<00:07:23.349> it<00:07:23.889> you<00:07:24.069> can<00:07:24.219> still<00:07:24.400> look<00:07:24.460> inside<00:07:24.699> of

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:24.849 
same but it you can still look inside of

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:27.899 
same but it you can still look inside of
it<00:07:24.969> I<00:07:25.150> try<00:07:25.779> to<00:07:25.810> keep<00:07:26.169> it<00:07:26.409> you<00:07:26.740> know<00:07:26.800> I<00:07:27.129> wanted<00:07:27.669> is

a<00:07:28.150> lot<00:07:28.479> of<00:07:28.599> detail<00:07:28.960> as<00:07:29.229> much<00:07:30.099> as<00:07:30.250> I<00:07:30.370> could<00:07:30.430> have

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:31.029 
a lot of detail as much as I could have

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:33.119 
a lot of detail as much as I could have
gotten<00:07:31.419> and<00:07:31.719> I<00:07:31.810> had<00:07:32.110> a<00:07:32.169> pretty<00:07:32.379> well<00:07:32.620> job<00:07:32.860> I

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.129 
gotten and I had a pretty well job I

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:35.459 
gotten and I had a pretty well job I
don't<00:07:33.400> only<00:07:33.610> get<00:07:33.789> it<00:07:33.909> perfect<00:07:34.090> I<00:07:34.509> think<00:07:35.409> the

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:35.469 
don't only get it perfect I think the

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:36.719 
don't only get it perfect I think the
first<00:07:35.680> room<00:07:35.889> is<00:07:36.009> a<00:07:36.039> little<00:07:36.099> too<00:07:36.460> small

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:36.729 
first room is a little too small

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:38.700 
first room is a little too small
especially<00:07:37.509> with<00:07:37.599> the<00:07:37.659> stairs<00:07:37.900> I<00:07:38.229> could<00:07:38.500> I

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
especially with the stairs I could I

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.100 
especially with the stairs I could I
could<00:07:38.770> if<00:07:38.979> I<00:07:39.039> tell<00:07:39.219> you<00:07:39.279> guys<00:07:39.400> that<00:07:39.460> but

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810
