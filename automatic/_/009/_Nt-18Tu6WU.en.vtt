00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
80's 90's setting we've chosen to let

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920 
80's 90's setting we've chosen to let
you<00:01:07.470> play<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.610> several<00:01:08.970> archetypes<00:01:09.600> or

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you play as one of several archetypes or

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.730 
you play as one of several archetypes or
stereotypes<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
stereotypes the one you can see here I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.660 
stereotypes the one you can see here I
think<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.490> stolen<00:01:15.030> identity<00:01:15.659> guy<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
think is the stolen identity guy and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.830 
think is the stolen identity guy and
he's<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.909> regular<00:01:18.060> guy<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:18.720> some

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
he's just a regular guy but for some

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.170 
he's just a regular guy but for some
reason<00:01:19.200> he<00:01:19.290> has<00:01:19.380> an<00:01:19.560> outrageous<00:01:20.430> Austrian

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
reason he has an outrageous Austrian

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
reason he has an outrageous Austrian
accent<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.830> kind<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> basic

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
accent so this is kind of the basic

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.149 
accent so this is kind of the basic
basic<00:01:26.880> gameplay<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> core<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
basic gameplay and at the core of that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.749 
basic gameplay and at the core of that
we<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> Dodge<00:01:30.479> mechanic<00:01:31.369> quite<00:01:32.369> similar

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
we have a Dodge mechanic quite similar

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.300 
we have a Dodge mechanic quite similar
to<00:01:32.790> any<00:01:33.380> defender<00:01:34.380> guard<00:01:34.619> mechanic<00:01:35.100> from<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to any defender guard mechanic from a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.760 
to any defender guard mechanic from a
fighting<00:01:35.909> game<00:01:35.939> which<00:01:36.810> means<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.470> long

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
fighting game which means that as long

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
fighting game which means that as long
as<00:01:38.040> you're<00:01:38.159> guarding<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:39.360> can't<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.720> hit<00:01:39.840> by

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
as you're guarding you can't be hit by

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.420 
as you're guarding you can't be hit by
anything<00:01:40.200> your<00:01:40.409> character<00:01:40.680> character<00:01:41.100> will

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
anything your character character will

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.319

automatically<00:01:42.119> dodge<00:01:42.299> any<00:01:42.659> bullets<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.240> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
automatically dodge any bullets but you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.630 
automatically dodge any bullets but you
can't<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.689> indefinitely<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.500> course<00:01:46.740> we

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
can't do that indefinitely of course we

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.580 
can't do that indefinitely of course we
wanted<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.420> make<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.049> feel<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
wanted to just make you feel like you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.200 
wanted to just make you feel like you
could<00:01:49.710> pull<00:01:49.920> off<00:01:49.950> awesome<00:01:50.340> moves<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
could pull off awesome moves and at the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.109 
could pull off awesome moves and at the
same<00:01:51.390> time<00:01:51.750> make<00:01:52.560> combat<00:01:53.159> longer<00:01:53.820> without

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
same time make combat longer without

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.929 
same time make combat longer without
having<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> tone<00:01:55.170> down<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.710> firearms<00:01:56.250> too

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
having to tone down the firearms too

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.830 
having to tone down the firearms too
much<00:01:58.909> also

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
much also

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.649 
much also
the<00:02:01.710> idea<00:02:02.070> behind<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.850> level<00:02:03.119> design<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the idea behind the level design and the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.499 
the idea behind the level design and the
gameplay<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.729> kinda<00:02:05.729> not<00:02:06.179> give<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
gameplay is to kinda not give the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.529 
gameplay is to kinda not give the
players<00:02:06.750> too<00:02:07.109> much<00:02:07.439> ammo<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> begin<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.789> so

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
players too much ammo to begin with so

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.380 
players too much ammo to begin with so
when<00:02:09.899> they<00:02:10.050> run<00:02:10.200> out<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.349> ammo<00:02:10.970> we<00:02:11.970> want<00:02:12.209> them

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
when they run out of ammo we want them

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.059 
when they run out of ammo we want them
to<00:02:12.420> kind<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> improvise<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.739> know<00:02:13.830> maybe
