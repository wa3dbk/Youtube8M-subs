watt of power and talk and it does weigh

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.250 
watt of power and talk and it does weigh
a<00:00:23.550> fair<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.330> I'm<00:00:24.420> sure<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.960> power<00:00:25.109> will

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
a fair bit but I'm sure the power will

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.859 
a fair bit but I'm sure the power will
overcome<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:27.000> has<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> slight<00:00:27.539> ride

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
overcome that and this has a slight ride

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.450 
overcome that and this has a slight ride
height<00:00:28.170> advantage<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> normal

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
height advantage to the normal

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.099 
height advantage to the normal
challenging<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.510> upgraded

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
challenging because it's the upgraded

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.380 
challenging because it's the upgraded
version<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> film<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.149> also<00:00:33.300> has

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
bull bars in a wing book whether or not

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.150 
bull bars in a wing book whether or not
they'll<00:00:35.309> help<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.850> doubt<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.710> anyway<00:00:37.710> let's<00:00:38.010> see

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
they'll help I doubt it anyway let's see

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:48.290 
they'll help I doubt it anyway let's see
what<00:00:38.280> he<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.460> do

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.850 

again<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.170> no<00:00:49.290> image<00:00:49.559> all-wheel<00:00:49.920> drive

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
again this was no image all-wheel drive

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:04.460 
again this was no image all-wheel drive
it's<00:00:52.160> gonna<00:00:52.310> stir<00:00:52.580> it<00:00:52.880> up<00:00:53.290> to<00:00:54.290> see

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470

technically<00:01:38.090> count<00:01:38.540> hell<00:01:39.340> handling

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:53.060 

will<00:01:44.780> truly<00:01:45.350> know<00:01:45.500> until<00:01:45.680> this<00:01:46.010> one

this game
humble<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.010> perfect

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.330 

this<00:02:04.210> is<00:02:04.360> crushing<00:02:04.750> 20<00:02:05.020> trees<00:02:05.289> will<00:02:05.619> die<00:02:06.039> in

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
this is crushing 20 trees will die in

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.850 
this is crushing 20 trees will die in
real<00:02:06.520> life<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.840> case<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.319> 4<00:02:08.860> walls<00:02:09.039> everywhere

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860

Oh

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:39.180 

the<00:02:24.620> car<00:02:24.800> garage

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.340 

yeah<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.210> was<00:02:40.330> even<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.750> platform<00:02:41.680> along

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.990 

like<00:02:44.890> all<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.130> cars<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.460> have<00:02:45.550> bounced<00:02:45.970> back

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
like all the cars that have bounced back

00:02:46.000 --> 00:03:08.840 
like all the cars that have bounced back
and<00:02:46.390> then

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.040 

and<00:03:09.110> quickest<00:03:10.110> car

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
and quickest car

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.830 
and quickest car
it's<00:03:12.650> even<00:03:12.860> slower<00:03:13.130> than<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.430> 1970<00:03:14.330> charger

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
it's even slower than the 1970 charger

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.360 
it's even slower than the 1970 charger
but<00:03:15.290> that's<00:03:15.440> not<00:03:15.560> surprised<00:03:15.920> because<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.220> was

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
but that's not surprised because I was

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.580 
but that's not surprised because I was
nine<00:03:16.760> extra<00:03:17.180> horsepower<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:18.320> lot<00:03:18.560> less

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
nine extra horsepower and a lot less

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.700 
nine extra horsepower and a lot less
weight<00:03:19.150> but<00:03:20.150> yeah<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.630> was<00:03:20.960> fairly<00:03:21.290> decent

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
weight but yeah it was fairly decent

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.110 
weight but yeah it was fairly decent
it's<00:03:21.980> obviously<00:03:22.340> never<00:03:22.490> meant<00:03:22.760> for<00:03:22.940> doing

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
it's obviously never meant for doing

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.760 
it's obviously never meant for doing
this<00:03:23.180> kind<00:03:23.330> of<00:03:23.450> thing<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:23.960> on<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.170> fact<00:03:24.380> is

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
this kind of thing so on the fact is

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.070 
this kind of thing so on the fact is
that<00:03:24.800> is<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.310> quicker<00:03:25.790> at<00:03:26.390> all<00:03:26.540> he's<00:03:27.050> a

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
that is that quicker at all he's a

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.570 
that is that quicker at all he's a
surprise<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.580> yeah<00:03:28.730> fairly<00:03:29.720> decent<00:03:30.580> pretty

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
surprise so yeah fairly decent pretty

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.310 
surprise so yeah fairly decent pretty
sure<00:03:31.760> if<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:31.970> kept<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.300> we<00:03:32.420> will<00:03:32.630> drive<00:03:32.930> it

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
sure if you kept it we will drive it

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.370 
sure if you kept it we will drive it
would<00:03:33.650> be<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.890> fair<00:03:34.280> bit<00:03:34.430> better<00:03:35.050> especially<00:03:36.050> in

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
would be a fair bit better especially in

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.960 
would be a fair bit better especially in
terms<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.710> cross-country<00:03:37.130> races<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.790> you'd

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
terms of cross-country races that you'd

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.080 
terms of cross-country races that you'd
normally<00:03:38.150> do<00:03:38.420> online<00:03:38.570> or<00:03:38.990> offline<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:39.710> yeah

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
normally do online or offline so yeah
