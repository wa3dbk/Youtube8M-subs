00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 this month i had to see how i got this 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.899
 make a mallet 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.059
 handy to work at if something true 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.360
 you then less quickly piece but also handy 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.360
 to assemble or disassemble items 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.320
 here 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.330
 for the hammer you need two largest 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.980
 hardwood 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.820
 structural adhesive he is became the 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.820
 care of the head 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.060
 I am inspired by bull function 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.060
 soot working form models.com 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.750
 quietly the hammer exists a lot 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.240
 could hear wood for 35 centimeters long 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.040
 that it is four pieces of wood which from 25 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.560
 and keeps being met 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.560
 saw cuts are at 2 degrees in a saw 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.480
 I make a hammer out of hard wood which I use 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.790
 old garden furniture harvest 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.640
 I repeated pin-hole connection 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.890
 each other I saw the holes before that full 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.730
 add the parts and paste them with 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.730
 structural glue 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.960
 before I sand the hole 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.190
 I remove the with a chisel 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.190
 rest excess glue 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.819
 yes safe 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.390
 get directions in fresh cut 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.390
 good brings 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.150
 the holes for the weight of the hammer 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.460
 I'm going to make first 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.390
 i start there for turning off the 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.160
 sizes 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.970
 know exactly where i have the gaps in it 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.970
 heart can make 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.490
 look up in moderation for a drawing 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.020
 noise and hold 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.020
 blogspot point nl 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.820
 the awl i will take the points off her 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.820
 go live later 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:08.490
 use is now even a 40 saw drill 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:11.870
 from the small angle of 2 degrees I saw 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.870
 then these pieces 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.890
 the residual wood is used for it 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.780
 make the sides 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.950
 these are corner of 2 degrees in 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.680
 said 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.310
 place the clamp both are pieces equally 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.310
 to make it long 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.370
 first a glimpse of the head 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.670
 for the old oak used quietly 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.670
 floorboards 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.480
 this keeps turned a few millimeters thin 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.250
 so we are this construction 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.160
 take some 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.160
 Creative paste nicely embellished 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.549
 here too I have excess glue 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.379
 west with the chisel removed and 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.239
 Then the hand- 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.049
 the wood finished to continue 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.849
 process for rejuvenating it 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.220
 end of the stem 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.790
 I adjust the saw guide to 60 mm and 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.620
 the case on 2 mm I typed all sides 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.250
 of the silent in the making 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.139
 across the table and see the result here 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.310
 I have also already indicated where the 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:34.479
 grooves for the speech must come too 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.479
 I am going to look into this afterwards 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.440
 I place here for my stop block 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.039
 whereby the length of the saw cut will 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.039
 be limited 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.230
 because we saw blade is so blown around 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.230
 piece will have to be typed by hand 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.290
 the parts are ready to visit 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.900
 start with gluing 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.860
 I start with the rings where the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.860
 increase in weight 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.099
 two side, I do but 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.750
 do not bond yet and give me the 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.379
 space around the glue clips 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.379
 to be able to place properly 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.770
 I use iron in the experience 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.320
 closing plates 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.389
 which I still filled with the effervescent glue 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.750
 so that these also do not go walking along 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.180
 the use it if you just bought a 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.449
 rattle you just do not want to go on glue 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.449
 to apply 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.220
 everything it tasty in the glue pa's last 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.830
 share and check the weight approximately 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.870
 half a kilo causeway 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.320
 I put the furious clamps on it 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.320
 dry overnight 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.490
 yes and that construction line for mine 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.310
 so buzzing that we are going to be neat again 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.320
 be cleaned up 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.470
 before we continue 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.360
 finishing the lady 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.760
 the adhesive residues are also absolutely important 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.010
 on the inside of the path 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.730
 remove so that later also the silent 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.730
 fits well 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.780
 I made speeches from the dressed 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.600
 loves the head by placing it 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.850
 in slots we made earlier 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.620
 put on the end of a quiet these 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.620
 out and it will fix the head 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.790
 use white glue to put the skewers in 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.260
 slots to fixes there are also friction 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.960
 also sit still but it is 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:06.360
 just more secure also fix the head itself 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.360
 I with the nice layer of white life 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.080
 yes and then just put it together 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.590
 that is what push and pull and what 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.480
 forcing and whipping and hammering with the 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.830
 unfortunately no wooden hanging because that 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.390
 discussed 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.860
 so here is actually such a wooden mark 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.050
 hammer for 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.280
 carefully put together that fat van 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.980
 skewers 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:38.640
 in this type of construction connections 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.380
 here since they got in and what remains 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.380
 is sucking the speech to the 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:46.140
 front end to be quiet and it looks nice 

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.849
 sanding the head and keeping them quiet 

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.409
 fits comfortably in the hand 

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:56.499
 thank for looking in next month 

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:56.499
 new plus noise and houtbrox.nl
