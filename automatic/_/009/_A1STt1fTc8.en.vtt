I<00:00:05.150> don't<00:00:06.150> know<00:00:06.210> if<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.390> can<00:00:06.569> see<00:00:06.750> those<00:00:06.960> ranges

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
I don't know if you can see those ranges

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.110 
I don't know if you can see those ranges
behind<00:00:07.799> me<00:00:07.950> but<00:00:08.250> that's<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:08.790> just

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
behind me but that's what we just

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.480 
behind me but that's what we just
crossed<00:00:09.480> on<00:00:10.349> our<00:00:10.889> bike<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.690> tour<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.349> far

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
crossed on our bike that on tour so far

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.189 
crossed on our bike that on tour so far
there<00:00:14.490> were<00:00:14.580> lots<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.940> ups<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.299> downs<00:00:15.389> they

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
there were lots of ups and downs they

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.580 
there were lots of ups and downs they
were<00:00:16.260> challenging<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.400> fun<00:00:17.960> we're<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.199> six

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
were challenging and fun we're about six

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.260 
were challenging and fun we're about six
miles<00:00:19.770> away<00:00:20.100> from<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.430> New<00:00:20.550> Mexico<00:00:20.760> border

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
miles away from the New Mexico border

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.230 
miles away from the New Mexico border
then<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> Continental<00:00:22.350> Divide<00:00:23.060> we<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
then a Continental Divide we have a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.900 
then a Continental Divide we have a
couple<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.570> big<00:00:24.720> Peaks<00:00:25.050> still<00:00:25.590> left<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.640> then

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
couple of big Peaks still left but then

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.990 
couple of big Peaks still left but then
we<00:00:27.420> should<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.660> mostly<00:00:28.170> flat<00:00:28.670> with<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> little

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
we should be mostly flat with a little

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.569 
we should be mostly flat with a little
Hills<00:00:30.359> these<00:00:31.289> are<00:00:31.470> beautiful<00:00:31.830> mountains<00:00:32.399> by

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
Hills these are beautiful mountains by

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.069 
Hills these are beautiful mountains by
the<00:00:32.640> way<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.870> kind<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> look<00:00:34.380> forward<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
the way but we kind of look forward to

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.819 
the way but we kind of look forward to
so<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.649> woke<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.160> morning<00:00:38.930> at<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> camp<00:00:40.500> in

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
so we woke up this morning at a camp in

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.090 
so we woke up this morning at a camp in
threeway<00:00:41.550> Arizona<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.500> knew<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.770> had<00:00:43.800> this

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
threeway Arizona and we knew we had this

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.920 
threeway Arizona and we knew we had this
big<00:00:44.160> climb<00:00:44.640> ahead<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.059> us<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
big climb ahead of us that was going to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.250 
big climb ahead of us that was going to
take<00:00:46.140> us<00:00:46.289> 14<00:00:46.829> miles<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.550> through<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.260> but

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
take us 14 miles to get through and but

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.779 
take us 14 miles to get through and but
we<00:00:49.350> didn't<00:00:49.620> realize<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> majority

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
we didn't realize is that the majority

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.000 
we didn't realize is that the majority
of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.390> climb<00:00:51.629> happens<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> last<00:00:52.500> three

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
of the climb happens the last three

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.880 
of the climb happens the last three
miles<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:54.350> 4,000<00:00:55.350> feet<00:00:55.500> over

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
miles and it's like 4,000 feet over

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.299 
miles and it's like 4,000 feet over
three<00:00:56.160> miles<00:00:56.340> or<00:00:56.610> something<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.149> so

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
three miles or something it was so

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.410 
three miles or something it was so
intense<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.699> I<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> may<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.230> been<00:01:01.680> as

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
intense it I think it may have been as

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.119 
intense it I think it may have been as
bad<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.660> day<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.260> don't<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.769> that's<00:01:04.979> up

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
bad as day one I don't know that's up

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.330 
bad as day one I don't know that's up
for<00:01:05.250> debate<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.930> payoff<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.159> once

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
for debate but the payoff is that once

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.149 
for debate but the payoff is that once
we<00:01:08.460> came<00:01:08.760> over<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.090> hill<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:10.140> suddenly<00:01:10.470> were

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
we came over the hill we suddenly were

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.899 
we came over the hill we suddenly were
surrounded<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:12.270> by<00:01:12.450> cactus<00:01:13.460> and/or<00:01:14.460> cacti

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and desert rock but suddenly we are in a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.850 
and desert rock but suddenly we are in a
pine<00:01:19.860> forest<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.570> smells<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.020> good<00:01:22.530> and
