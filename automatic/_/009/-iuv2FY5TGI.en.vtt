settle into fine lines of lips and they
were<00:00:50.100> completely<00:00:50.550> opaque<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:52.199> swipe

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.260 
completely opaque once way that would
really<00:00:55.770> blew<00:00:56.010> me<00:00:56.160> away<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:57.059> under

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
really blew me away because I was under

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.549 
really blew me away because I was under
the<00:00:57.300> impression<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:58.020> lipsticks<00:00:58.379> were

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the impression that these lipsticks were

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.779 
the impression that these lipsticks were
streaky<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.070> why<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> stayed<00:00:59.550> away<00:00:59.640> from

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
streaky that's why I stayed away from

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
streaky that's why I stayed away from
the<00:01:00.030> fergie<00:01:00.390> collection<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> these<00:01:01.500> kind<00:01:01.710> of

the fergie collection of these kind of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.590 
the fergie collection of these kind of
lipsticks<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.760> long<00:01:02.940> these<00:01:03.120> are<00:01:03.270> actually

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
lipsticks for so long these are actually

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.140 
lipsticks for so long these are actually
my<00:01:03.750> first<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.100> wet<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.400> wild<00:01:05.519> fergie

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.670 
my first kind of the wet and wild fergie
I<00:01:08.240> love<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.270> too<00:01:10.729> sorry<00:01:11.729> guys<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> first

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
I love you too sorry guys so the first

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
I love you too sorry guys so the first
thing<00:01:13.740> I'm<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> show<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.700> swerve

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
thing I'm going to show you is swerve

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.719 
thing I'm going to show you is swerve
and<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> coral<00:01:16.860> pink<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> feel<00:01:17.700> like

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and this is a coral pink and I feel like

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.780 
and this is a coral pink and I feel like
this<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.119> perfect<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:19.229> summer<00:01:19.790> wear

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
this will be perfect for summer wear

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
this will be perfect for summer wear
because<00:01:21.090> coral<00:01:21.420> pink<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.930> such<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.409> summer

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
because coral pink is such a summer

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 
because coral pink is such a summer
shade<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.790> believe<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.299> flatter

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
shade and I believe this would flatter

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.109 
shade and I believe this would flatter
most<00:01:24.930> skin<00:01:25.439> tones<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:26.070> light<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.880> dark

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
most skin tones from light to dark

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
most skin tones from light to dark
especially<00:01:27.540> medians<00:01:28.110> consults<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.650> find<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
especially medians consults I find that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.800 
especially medians consults I find that
coral<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.939> beautiful<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.509> medium

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
coral look so beautiful in the medium

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
coral look so beautiful in the medium
skin<00:01:30.990> tones<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> next<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.159> will

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
skin tones and then the next one will

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.010 
skin tones and then the next one will
show<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.640> turnt<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.360> an<00:01:33.479> orangey

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
show you is turnt up and it's an orangey

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.969 
show you is turnt up and it's an orangey
red<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.500> more<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
red and this is more of like a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.530 
red and this is more of like a
conventional<00:01:35.430> color<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.150> you're<00:01:36.299> trying<00:01:36.450> to
