00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
sticking out okay we shade the read

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.670 
sticking out okay we shade the read
really<00:00:14.370> thin<00:00:14.759> here<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:15.990> basically<00:00:16.170> like

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
really thin here and it's basically like

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.560 
really thin here and it's basically like
this<00:00:17.690> three<00:00:18.690> pieces<00:00:19.760> all<00:00:20.760> you're<00:00:21.090> doing<00:00:21.390> is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
putting this to the top just like that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.230 
putting this to the top just like that
you<00:00:24.539> take<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> read<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.470> shave<00:00:25.740> side<00:00:26.099> up<00:00:26.400> put

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
top of the read and put it in the top of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.920 
top of the read and put it in the top of
the<00:00:45.930> tone<00:00:46.140> channel<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.489> and

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
the tone channel just like that and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
the tone channel just like that and
bring<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> where<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:49.860> only<00:00:50.309> got

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
bring this up to where you have only got

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.360 
bring this up to where you have only got
like<00:00:51.559> quarter<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> three<00:00:52.890> eighths<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.160> an<00:00:53.280> inch

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
like quarter to three eighths of an inch

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.720 
like quarter to three eighths of an inch
like<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.480> twist<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.020> tight<00:00:55.379> okay<00:00:56.100> let's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
like that and twist it tight okay let's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.119 
like that and twist it tight okay let's
see<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.030> sounds<00:00:57.480> like<00:01:00.530> okay<00:01:01.530> I've<00:01:01.920> got

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
see what that sounds like okay I've got

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.650 
see what that sounds like okay I've got
that<00:01:02.160> that's<00:01:02.520> good<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.210> did<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.539> because

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that that's good that I did that because

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
that that's good that I did that because
the<00:01:03.989> top<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.680> too<00:01:04.920> far<00:01:05.159> into<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> tone

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the top of that is too far into the tone

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
the top of that is too far into the tone
channel<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.750> let's<00:01:06.780> bring<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> back<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> little

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
channel so let's bring it back a little

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:20.999 
channel so let's bring it back a little
bit<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.610> go

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.280 

looks<00:01:21.580> like<00:01:21.759> that<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.299> you<00:01:22.780> can<00:01:22.960> get<00:01:23.140> that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
looks like that and you can get that

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.660 
looks like that and you can get that
little<00:01:23.439> higher<00:01:23.680> pitch<00:01:23.979> little<00:01:24.220> easier<00:01:24.520> blow

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
little higher pitch little easier blow

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.429 
little higher pitch little easier blow
by<00:01:24.880> shortening<00:01:25.420> this<00:01:25.659> distance<00:01:26.200> right<00:01:26.380> here

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
by shortening this distance right here

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.560 
by shortening this distance right here
but<00:01:27.100> what<00:01:27.250> I<00:01:27.280> did<00:01:27.520> before<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.119> had<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.390> too

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
but what I did before is I had it too

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.420 
but what I did before is I had it too
far<00:01:28.810> into<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.170> tone<00:01:29.350> channel<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.100> started

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
far into the tone channel and it started

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.520 
far into the tone channel and it started
sticking<00:01:30.670> okay<00:01:31.450> so<00:01:31.509> I<00:01:31.659> brought<00:01:31.899> it<00:01:31.990> down<00:01:32.020> just

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
sticking okay so I brought it down just

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.010 
sticking okay so I brought it down just
a<00:01:32.740> hair<00:01:32.770> just<00:01:33.490> about<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.909> that<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.570> distance

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
a hair just about to that that distance

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.320 
a hair just about to that that distance
right<00:01:35.200> there<00:01:35.700> lengthen<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:36.820> just<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.119> hair

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
right there lengthen this just a hair

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.399 
right there lengthen this just a hair
and<00:01:37.360> when<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:37.659> can<00:01:37.810> hear<00:01:37.930> what<00:01:38.049> it<00:01:38.170> sounded

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
and when you can hear what it sounded

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:38.760 
and when you can hear what it sounded
like

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
like

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.410 
like
but<00:01:39.220> if<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.399> can<00:01:39.549> shorten<00:01:39.909> this<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.240> get<00:01:40.360> a

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
but if you can shorten this you get a

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.999 
but if you can shorten this you get a
higher<00:01:40.659> pitch<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.170> be<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.289> little<00:01:41.409> bit<00:01:41.590> easier

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
higher pitch and be a little bit easier

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.160 
higher pitch and be a little bit easier
to<00:01:42.039> blow<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.240> big<00:01:46.570> difference<00:01:46.930> in<00:01:47.049> at

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
to blow now the big difference in at

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.840 
to blow now the big difference in at
under<00:01:47.350> savor<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.280> difference<00:01:48.640> in<00:01:48.759> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
under savor the difference in the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.910 
under savor the difference in the
straightening<00:01:49.240> Hong<00:01:49.390> LRS<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:50.020> calls<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.649> is

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
straightening Hong LRS it calls this is

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.149 
straightening Hong LRS it calls this is
super<00:01:51.490> thin<00:01:51.759> right<00:01:52.030> here<00:01:52.270> then<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.440> acrylics

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
super thin right here then that acrylics

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.249 
super thin right here then that acrylics
really<00:01:54.399> thin<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.819> gives<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.210> loud<00:01:55.600> burst

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
really thin that gives you a loud burst

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.609
