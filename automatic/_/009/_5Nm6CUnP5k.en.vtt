00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.560 
because he is a deep closure and he
seems<00:03:10.489> like<00:03:10.640> he's<00:03:10.820> going<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.030> get<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.180> set<00:03:11.450> up

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
seems like he's going to get a set up

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.810 
seems like he's going to get a set up
but<00:03:12.079> I<00:03:12.230> don't<00:03:12.769> think<00:03:13.100> he's<00:03:13.250> fast<00:03:13.519> enough

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
but I don't think he's fast enough

Trial<00:03:19.910> I<00:03:20.180> don't<00:03:21.140> think<00:03:21.370> ice<00:03:22.370> box<00:03:22.790> is<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.359> to

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
improve in the Derby I think if anything

he's going to take a step

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.449 
he's going to take a step
back<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.109> I<00:03:27.409> just<00:03:27.560> don't<00:03:27.829> think<00:03:28.159> he's<00:03:28.280> going

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
back and I just don't think he's going

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.830 
back and I just don't think he's going
to<00:03:28.549> end<00:03:28.609> up<00:03:28.700> being<00:03:28.939> fast<00:03:29.150> enough<00:03:29.420> can<00:03:29.569> he<00:03:29.659> pick

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
to end up being fast enough can he pick

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.259 
to end up being fast enough can he pick
up<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.049> pieces<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.650> get<00:03:30.799> something<00:03:31.400> maybe<00:03:31.999> I

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
up the pieces and get something maybe I

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.910 
up the pieces and get something maybe I
think<00:03:32.719> he<00:03:32.810> can<00:03:32.959> definitely<00:03:33.109> think<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.680> check

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
think he can definitely think of a check

conveyance I love this horses talent I

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.140

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
think he has a world of ability but he

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.300 
think he has a world of ability but he
really<00:04:47.479> stopped<00:04:47.960> badly<00:04:48.500> at<00:04:48.590> sunland<00:04:48.979> going<00:04:49.220> a

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
really stopped badly at sunland going a

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.730 
really stopped badly at sunland going a
mile<00:04:49.460> in<00:04:49.610> an<00:04:49.699> eighth<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:50.229> don't<00:04:51.229> think<00:04:51.349> he's

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
mile in an eighth I don't think he's

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.800 
mile in an eighth I don't think he's
going<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:52.039> improve<00:04:52.430> on<00:04:52.669> Monica<00:04:53.120> or<00:04:53.210> anything<00:04:53.720> I

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
going to improve on Monica or anything I

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.240 
going to improve on Monica or anything I

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
think he's going to get even slower and

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.430 
think he's going to get even slower and
I<00:04:55.610> just<00:04:55.789> don't<00:04:56.060> think<00:04:56.449> with<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.840> pace<00:04:57.080> as<00:04:57.289> hot

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
I just don't think with the pace as hot

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.990 
I just don't think with the pace as hot
as<00:04:57.560> it's<00:04:57.710> going<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.919> be<00:04:58.070> I<00:04:58.280> don't<00:04:58.639> think

impossible again a horse that I think

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.999

he ever settled with the slow pace in
the<00:05:52.680> wood<00:05:52.860> I<00:05:53.070> think<00:05:53.580> he<00:05:53.730> handled<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.300> Gotham

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
the wood I think he handled the Gotham

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.660 
the wood I think he handled the Gotham
much<00:05:55.110> better<00:05:55.410> when<00:05:55.620> he<00:05:55.680> had<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.830> fast<00:05:56.130> pace<00:05:56.460> to

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
much better when he had a fast pace to

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.580 
much better when he had a fast pace to
fire<00:05:56.880> at<00:05:57.180> he's<00:05:57.660> going<00:05:57.870> to<00:05:57.960> get<00:05:58.020> a<00:05:58.080> fast<00:05:58.320> paced

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
fire at he's going to get a fast paced

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.260 
fire at he's going to get a fast paced
in<00:05:58.710> the<00:05:58.800> Derby<00:05:59.100> that's<00:05:59.550> really<00:05:59.850> going<00:06:00.090> to<00:06:00.210> help

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
in the Derby that's really going to help

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.960 
in the Derby that's really going to help
out<00:06:00.540> his<00:06:00.690> chances<00:06:01.170> super<00:06:01.980> saver<00:06:02.250> is<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.790> worst

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
out his chances super saver is the worst

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.970 
out his chances super saver is the worst
that<00:06:03.090> I<00:06:03.150> really<00:06:03.570> think<00:06:03.600> is<00:06:03.900> improving<00:06:04.470> his

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980

as good a chance as he's had coming into
this<00:07:09.090> race<00:07:09.330> I<00:07:09.600> mean<00:07:10.200> it<00:07:10.350> could<00:07:10.530> be<00:07:10.710> a<00:07:10.740> situation

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
this race I mean it could be a situation

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.250 
this race I mean it could be a situation
similar<00:07:11.520> to<00:07:11.730> Wendy<00:07:12.090> wayne<00:07:12.240> Lukas<00:07:12.690> finally<00:07:13.110> got

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.260 
similar to Wendy wayne Lukas finally got

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.020 
similar to Wendy wayne Lukas finally got
