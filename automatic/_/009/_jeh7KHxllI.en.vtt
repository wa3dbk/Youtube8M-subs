00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.370
 Well, this time I come with a 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.500
 video of how to be a better creepy 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.890
 pastero for those who want to create their 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.809
 own creepy pasta or horror story 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.150
 these are very personal tips and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.610
 most of you may be useful but 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.860
 good let's start in this video I will give 10 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.420
 tips to make a creepy pasta and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.420
 good to start the video 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.499
 advice number 1 the plot if you want that 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.990
 your creepy pasta scary or at least 

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:25.939
 entertain people it is necessary 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.280
 to carry an order in the frame as 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.289
 if you do not do it any mistake that does not 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.659
 take into account in your story you can 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.030
 take away the sense so when I 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.099
 you're doing, you can analyze it a little bit 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.679
 little and if you have an error in the plot 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:42.950
 correct what does not exactly have to be 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.859
 logical because it is not it simply has 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.759
 that take an order in the plot advice 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.799
 number 2 the order of the images is 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.289
 necessary that if you are talking about such 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.049
 part in your video the image is presented 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.450
 from that example part if the story is 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.670
 takes place in a haunted house you must 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.890
 put that image but if you change places 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.599
 try to put an image of the place in 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.640
 where the story takes no 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.979
 exactly you have to take an order 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.230
 if he thinks peep up is short good 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.720
 there you can put two or three images 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.700
 but if he believes pipes is longer 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.560
 you can put even the characters and 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.319
 all the places where it takes 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.969
 out the story 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.430
 tip number 3 the narration this one is 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:30.489
 a personal advice but good you can 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.349
 Do the one you like more or both 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.959
 be you who tells the story what 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.639
 I want to say is that if a person 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.620
 survived in the creepy pasta be the 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.930
 person who the ship since it gives a 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.639
 touch more real and it 's what I do or 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.639
 you can simply tell the story 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.650
 how it happened or even both narrate turn 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.139
 apart and that the one that survived has 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.169
 a part either the end or even 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:57.489
 other parts of the history council 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:59.199
 number 4 the avoidance I recommend you 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.329
 that you use a program with which you 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:03.669
 feel comfortable if you want to do your 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.620
 creepy pasta more real and with effects yo 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.750
 I think your best bet is the sony 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.760
 vegas but if you want your creepy 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.799
 pasta is just with a sequence of 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.010
 images you can use the camp like this 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.469
 studio 7 or 8 you can even use the 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.079
 windows movie maker i use the qantas since 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.370
 study 7 but you can use the one that 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.970
 more you like 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.909
 advice number 5 give a twist to the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.190
 good story to give a touch of 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.349
 fear you can make the victim the 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.540
 ghost or things like that is to say that 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.790
 change some things in the plot to 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.459
 that history changes its environment but 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.430
 that makes sense since to do this 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.780
 you need to explain how it happened or 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.480
 in which place advice number 6 the quality 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.790
 of sound this is what the 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.220
 check your story for errors 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.940
 correct it so that it has quality in the 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.799
 sound 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.840
 if you are the one who narrates it, try not to 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.420
 lock you and that you understand what you say 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.129
 you can even put a background music 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.680
 in the video tip number 7 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.750
 personal experiences if it has happened to you 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.239
 something extra normal something that gives a lot 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.879
 fear for example I recently had a 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.070
 dream in which I saw a mask and a 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.380
 hand was holding me from behind and I did not 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.660
 I let myself breathe or ask for help and from that 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.639
 dream I was inspired to make my believe and 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.460
 paste called the mask and it's my 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.420
 favorite added some things to do 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.940
 longer 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.000
 and pasta but it was because of that dream that I made 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.100
 the creepy pasta and it's also a good 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.140
 way so you can tell the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.450
 what happened to you in the form of a 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.990
 story without thinking that you are 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.570
 imagining if it is real and if it was a dream 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.200
 You can share it in your story if you 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.800
 you prefer advice number 8 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.630
 you can do it about something that is famous 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.210
 example you can do it from a series of 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.730
 television a video game a street and 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.400
 Well, I do not think it's necessary to tell you 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.160
 everything uses your imagination that was going to be the 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.390
 advice number 9 but good now I'll have 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.160
 that put another hehe advice number 9 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.350
 for those who want their creepy pasta 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.930
 give more fear than the face of the exorcist 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.660
 you can use the voice of saw there is a 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.730
 program to do it although good I do not 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.070
 I would recommend them since almost no 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.290
 understand you can use it for the voice of the 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.390
 ghost or the monster but if they want 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.610
 that your fear story will only give you 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.520
 a little advice that is the key to 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.969
 all this was the number one advice the 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.949
 plot 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:38.709
 the longer it is, the more it goes 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.749
 entertain and be scary if they add something 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:43.509
 of suspense but something very important 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.759
 do not make the plot that long either 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.709
 can even bore you make it a 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.379
 decent plot with a good story and 

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:53.439
 good characters but above all 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:56.619
 things with a touch of fear advice 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:59.079
 number 10 relax this is very 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:01.539
 important you can even put a 

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:04.119
 Background music while you do it can 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:07.289
 be calm music of fear and even 

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:07.289
 of an anime hehe 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.050
 and good a tip of pylon when the 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.450
 have fun, imagine that you are 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.640
 inventing your own characters can 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.920
 be from a series it is not known if the 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.680
 story that you invent can become 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.470
 famous or you can even do more parts 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.480
 alternative endings and those things and if 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.670
 you are not entirely satisfied with your 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.550
 work you can improve in the future 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.820
 believe me I started like that but you have to be 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.400
 good optimists I hope that at least 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.650
 one of these tips has been useful 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.780
 do not forget to give him little hand up if you 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.610
 liked it or if one of these tips you 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.510
 it served as something 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:53.400
