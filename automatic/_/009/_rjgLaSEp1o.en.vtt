00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.300 

just<00:01:07.390> think<00:01:07.659> these<00:01:07.840> things<00:01:08.140> are<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.680> bomb

so<00:01:12.180> hey<00:01:13.180> how<00:01:13.210> about<00:01:13.600> if<00:01:13.689> we<00:01:13.719> take<00:01:14.469> it<00:01:14.619> for<00:01:14.799> a

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
so hey how about if we take it for a

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.149 
so hey how about if we take it for a
test<00:01:15.069> drive<00:01:15.159> with<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:16.270> little<00:01:16.600> 1300<00:01:17.380> double

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
test drive with a little 1300 double

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.899 
test drive with a little 1300 double
overhead<00:01:18.579> cam<00:01:19.979> 4-cylinder<00:01:20.979> with<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.340> 5-speed

overhead cam 4-cylinder with the 5-speed

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.690 
overhead cam 4-cylinder with the 5-speed
let's<00:01:22.240> let's<00:01:22.869> see<00:01:23.049> how<00:01:23.229> she<00:01:23.289> goes<00:01:23.590> oh<00:01:23.950> sitting

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
let's let's see how she goes oh sitting

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.980 
let's let's see how she goes oh sitting

so turn the key here the electric fuel

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.239 
so turn the key here the electric fuel
pump<00:01:41.999> she<00:01:42.999> fires<00:01:43.299> right<00:01:43.719> up<00:01:43.749> always<00:01:44.289> every

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
pump she fires right up always every

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:52.789 
pump she fires right up always every
time<00:01:46.469> reverse<00:01:47.469> has<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.130> lockout

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.370 

I<00:01:52.829> was<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.729> doing<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.180> photo<00:01:54.450> shoot<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.110> by

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
I was just doing a photo shoot now I by

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.789 
I was just doing a photo shoot now I by
myself<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.460> its<00:01:56.640> stick<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.560> forgive<00:01:58.560> me<00:01:58.770> for

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
myself in its stick so forgive me for

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:10.450 
myself in its stick so forgive me for
any<00:01:59.670> any<00:02:00.299> issues<00:02:00.840> there

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.250 

now<00:02:11.460> we've<00:02:11.790> gone<00:02:12.000> all<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.630> way<00:02:12.660> through<00:02:12.780> this

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
now we've gone all the way through this

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.080 
now we've gone all the way through this
engine<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:13.950> dropped<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> oil<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:17.090> again

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
engine we dropped the oil in and again

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.200 
engine we dropped the oil in and again
when<00:02:18.390> went<00:02:18.930> completely<00:02:19.290> through<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.310> this

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
when went completely through it and this

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.040 
when went completely through it and this
this<00:02:22.080> engine<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:23.160> in<00:02:23.760> great<00:02:24.210> shape<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
this engine is is in great shape and the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.940 
this engine is is in great shape and the
transmission<00:02:28.130> we<00:02:29.990> resealed<00:02:30.990> everything<00:02:31.620> so

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
transmission we resealed everything so

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.360 
transmission we resealed everything so
it's<00:02:32.190> probably<00:02:32.760> one<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.480> least<00:02:34.370> leaking

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it's probably one of the least leaking

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.960 
it's probably one of the least leaking
Alfa<00:02:36.150> Romeos<00:02:36.660> around

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.750 

my<00:02:40.970> shift

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
my shift

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.590 
my shift
so<00:02:43.760> again<00:02:44.240> this<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.870> difficult<00:02:45.470> because<00:02:45.740> I'm

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
so again this is difficult because I'm

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.240 
so again this is difficult because I'm
filming<00:02:47.600> with<00:02:47.630> one<00:02:47.990> hand<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.740> driving

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
filming with one hand and driving

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.430 
filming with one hand and driving
driving<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.860> car<00:02:51.860> with<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.310> other<00:02:52.390> shifting

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
driving the car with the other shifting

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.990 
driving the car with the other shifting
so<00:02:54.440> now<00:02:54.620> I'm<00:02:54.800> in<00:02:54.830> fifth

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.860 

the<00:02:58.210> speedometer<00:02:58.930> does<00:02:59.530> not<00:02:59.770> work<00:03:00.870> everything

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
the speedometer does not work everything

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.150 
the speedometer does not work everything
else<00:03:02.170> works<00:03:02.500> mine

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
else works mine

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.870 
else works mine
so<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.730> can<00:03:05.030> see<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.450> gauges<00:03:06.400> it's<00:03:07.400> about

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
so you can see the gauges it's about

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.750 
so you can see the gauges it's about
right<00:03:08.420> now<00:03:08.630> it's<00:03:08.840> about<00:03:08.960> 90<00:03:09.620> degrees<00:03:10.070> here<00:03:10.400> and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
right now it's about 90 degrees here and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.260 
right now it's about 90 degrees here and
you<00:03:10.880> can<00:03:11.060> see<00:03:11.330> it's<00:03:11.510> running<00:03:11.750> very<00:03:11.960> very<00:03:12.470> cool

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
you can see it's running very very cool

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.420 
you can see it's running very very cool
and<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.480> oil<00:03:14.660> temperature<00:03:14.960> is<00:03:15.740> showing<00:03:16.250> that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
and the oil temperature is showing that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:25.470 
and the oil temperature is showing that
it's<00:03:16.670> no<00:03:17.090> more

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.170 

very<00:03:26.110> nice<00:03:26.470> we<00:03:26.950> went<00:03:27.190> through<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.520> break<00:03:27.790> so

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
very nice we went through the break so

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.589 
very nice we went through the break so
the<00:03:28.300> breaks<00:03:28.599> are<00:03:28.900> very<00:03:29.739> very<00:03:30.700> nice<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.330> tight

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
the breaks are very very nice and tight

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.900 
the breaks are very very nice and tight
they're<00:03:32.050> probably<00:03:32.500> still<00:03:32.830> needing<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.250> seat<00:03:33.670> a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
they're probably still needing to seat a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.500 
they're probably still needing to seat a
little<00:03:34.060> bit

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:50.230 

and<00:03:40.280> blinkers<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.790> all<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:42.120> lights<00:03:42.360> were

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:04:09.740 

so<00:03:50.660> I'm<00:03:50.750> gonna<00:03:50.900> flip<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.500> u-turn<00:03:52.060> one-handed

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:20.050 

that's<00:04:10.080> 5,000<00:04:10.950> rpm

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.280 

now<00:04:20.540> we're<00:04:20.780> probably<00:04:21.049> going<00:04:21.440> about<00:04:21.920> at<00:04:22.820> least

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
now we're probably going about at least

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.600 
now we're probably going about at least
70<00:04:24.290> I<00:04:24.320> would<00:04:24.650> say

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:42.420 

and<00:04:27.789> it<00:04:28.030> feels<00:04:28.300> feels<00:04:29.080> very<00:04:29.440> nice

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.810 

very<00:04:42.970> very<00:04:43.449> nice
