00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.480
 this comet got too close 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.740
 it is cooking by the heat of the sun 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.970
 creating a tail that extends 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.970
 millions of kilometers 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.930
 how cold towards here 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.240
 there is no doubt about the origin of this 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.930
 Comet the frozen waste of 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.930
 deep space 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.510
 but look at all this steam and the geysers 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.070
 and the dust is the sun again 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.739
 melting the icy heart of the comet 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.930
 it's strange a kind of snowball 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.350
 big and dirty covered by tar 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.350
 Dark 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.290
 tiny beads of what it looks like 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.409
 organic material preserved in ice 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.409
 since 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.600
 who knows when maybe it's the 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.549
 beginning of the solar system 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.290
 let's say that a comet like this one 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.720
 crashing against the young earth makes 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 billions of years maybe you 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.970
 provide water and organic matter 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.140
 the basic ingredients of life 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.570
 I could even have sown the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.490
 seeds of life on earth the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.869
 they evolved into 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.869
 you in me 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.020
 but suppose it crashed against 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.240
 the earth now think of the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.840
 dinosaurs swept by the impact of 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.560
 a comet or an asteroid 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.469
 it's only a matter of time later a 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.840
 day unless we find a way to 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.540
 protect us will happen to us the same as to 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.240
 the dinosaurs 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.110
 the earth is safe 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.110
 for now 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.180
 this starts to scare 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.410
 it's like being inside a gigantic 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.410
 computer game 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.320
 but this is too real 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.190
 asteroids some of them hundreds 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.190
 kilometers in diameter 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.190
 This must be 30 km long and 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.450
 look attached to it 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.450
 a space probe 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.359
 it should not have been easy to land 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.909
 on an asteroid that goes to 80,000 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.379
 kilometers per hour costs a lot 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.109
 effort to investigate a few 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.780
 debris rubble that normally 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:12.159
 collide they break and they throw themselves on 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.159
 Earth as meteorites 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.760
 magic signs prophecies 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.760
 supernatural and more than that 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.070
 it turns out that rubble like these is 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.060
 they joined together to become a planet 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.060
 included ours 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.400
 so adapt the meteorites that 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.800
 we find on earth we know that the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.340
 planets were created 4 thousand 500 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.340
 millions of years 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.890
 are the birth certificates of 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.720
 our solar system of our planet 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.980
 but for some reason these rocks do not 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.980
 they became a planet 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.640
 something must have prevented something like that 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.640
 something powerful
