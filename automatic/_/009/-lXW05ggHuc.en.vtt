00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.180
 first talking chihuahua sophie 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello to talk to you again about the covers 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.540
 mass and hopefully you watched a video about 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.130
 how to care for this dog 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.580
 which I promised to talk about heat 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.040
 blow 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.890
 that's about it, we'll talk well, let's go 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.119
 heat and sunstroke and remember that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.670
 death due to overheating can 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.900
 come in just minutes 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.580
 thermoregulation in dogs I said another 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.320
 it makes us very susceptible to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.820
 high temperatures because the average 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.830
 the dog's body temperature is in charge 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.060
 human 38 degrees cooling 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.920
 organism occurs due to evaporation 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 water from the pads of mucous membranes and 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.850
 by enhancing the breath of heat proudly and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.739
 so general overheating of the body in violation 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.030
 cerebral circulation solar 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.739
 the stomach happens and hammer cute 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.629
 Stay out of the sun it 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.730
 hanging dogs of any age

 heart cardiovascular disorders 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.190
 and respiratory systems 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.809
 dark dogs are less susceptible 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.550
 than the light one is especially sensitive 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.719
 northern breed dogs which like chamfer 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.609
 aches have a predisposition 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.649
 heat stroke and rock possessing 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.799

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.790
 boxers that contributes to heat stroke 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.950
 sunstroke excessive physical 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
 load or gref after keeping it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
 climate or carelessness for example 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.920
 put the dog in the car in the sun

 shortness of breath 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.860
 noisy sometimes mix wheezing sluggish 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.880
 behavior or even a dog falls can 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.130
 be vomiting or diarrhea

 heat stroke the dog's temperature 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.869
 severe cases may exceed 40 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.100
 degrees all these symptoms of course 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.390
 very similar to the signs of others 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.009
 diseases therefore need very much 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.750
 follow the dog closely 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.610
 from your logic for example you walked 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.500
 In the spring of female I have a very long morning 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.220
 there is shortness of breath this is dirt we have and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.810
 heat stroke 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.440
 absolutely all experts believe that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.880
 for a long time 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.620
 hsien fever in dogs 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.780
 negatively affects all organs and 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.790
 animal systems especially on 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.500
 gastrointestinal tract york and kidney and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.670
 nervous system if you still don't 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.440
 managed to detect deviations in time 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.820
 provide an animal cook that boost 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.740
 temperatures up to 43 degrees 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.570
 may cause irreversible changes in 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.490
 organs manifestation of signs of complications 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.710
 start usually flew 4 days 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.060
 after overheating and so first aid for 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.230
 thermal and sunstroke at 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.970
 confidence that with your little dog 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.010
 there was a heat stroke first 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.540
 help must be given immediately 1 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.680
 the dog must be carried cool 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.860
 place and put on a flat surface 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.930
 second dog you need to remove all the third 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.520
 attach the head to the back of the head and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.140
 pads over moistened with cold water 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.850
 a rag and and better wrap the whole body 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.590
 wet tissue constantly do 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.120
 cooling compress it you underarms and 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.490
 the inguinal zone that is the inner part 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.110
 hips but fear hypothermia if 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.060
 little dog your mind necessarily 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.100
 water it with cool water if the dog 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.020
 unconscious, her breathing was broken 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.030
 need to try to whet her breath 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.740
 To do this, open your jaws and insert 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.990
 between the teeth of some hard object 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.250
 solid bone piece of wood wrap 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.870
 tongue for example a piece of cloth and 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.250
 pull the tip of the tongue big and 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.900
 index finger every three seconds 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.640
 which corresponds to a normal rhythm and 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.020
 breathing has started the slightest 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.100
 language resistance means started 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.720
 breathing recovery 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.190
 call a veterinarian or 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.500
 politics well it yourself 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.630
 be sure to constantly monitor 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.130
 medium body temperature 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.200
 half an hour the temperature should fall to the floor 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.760
 degrees to reduce it to the level of 39 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.500
 degrees need no faster than an hour 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.750
 after this mark of procedure 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.280
 ceases it is believed that with severe 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.810
 breath on you look to the dog you can 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.280
 drop from 3 to 10 drops not 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.170
 diluted corvalol depending on 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.489
 age and weight doggie to hold 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.890
 cold water cremation 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.150
 prick inside the muscle sulfocamphocain 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.890
 which stimulates the heart muscle 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.600
 there is a more complicated veterinary 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.130
 treatments for various medications for 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.350
 different organs and symptoms therefore not 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.590
 pull immediately to the doctor and he told us 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.940
