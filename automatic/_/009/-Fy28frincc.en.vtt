00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Hello, Welcome to the kitchen of the Modest Taste, sir. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.720
 today we will reach our beautiful Amasya 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.280
 and "Making Bulgur Filtered" 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.360
 But let's take a look at the ingredients first if you want 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.360
 1 bowl of rice bulgur 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.640
 2 tablespoons of butter 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.800
 and 5 cups of water 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.440
 Very short after the material list ... 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.680
 We can start to make our special pilaf bulgur pilaf for our Amasya 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.800
 Let's go to the hearth for this 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 we put the pot on fire 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 5 cups of water 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.000
 add a small amount of salt, we expect to boil 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.240
 water started boiling, we add bulgur 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.680
 will start to boil again, cook only 5 minutes 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 Our findings have boiled for 5 minutes 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.840
 now we leave the filter 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.840
 we are doing the process 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.080
 and 1 glass of cold water 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.360
 Let's keep the butter on our way. 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.520
 our butter melts, bulgur literally crept 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.240
 now we're transferring it back to the pot 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.560
 adding salt 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.560
 and butter 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.320
 we mix without 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.800
 and very low heat for 15 minutes 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.320
 45 minutes later 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.960
 15 minutes is over, our rice is cooked 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.000
 We're closing the fire half an hour 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 After half an hour 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.560
 Our rice piled is now serving time 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 let's mix 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.440
 you might say; How can it be so delicious with such simple ingredients? 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.200
 of course the secret of butter, necessarily use butter 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.520
 We have shared a beautiful description of our beautiful Amasya 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.720
 We learned the construction of "Rice Bulgur 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.640
 I wish you to remember your experience and Modest Taste as soon as possible 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.400
 Good bye...
