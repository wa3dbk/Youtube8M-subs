even<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.440> in<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.950> second<00:02:10.340> half<00:02:10.490> did<00:02:10.850> you

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
even so in the second half did you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.460 
even so in the second half did you
change<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.420> style<00:02:11.690> you're<00:02:11.840> Peter<00:02:12.080> becoming

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
change the style you're Peter becoming

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.960 
change the style you're Peter becoming
in<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.740> middle<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.040> what<00:02:13.220> more<00:02:13.370> than<00:02:13.580> playing

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
in the middle of what more than playing

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.260 
in the middle of what more than playing
on<00:02:14.150> either<00:02:14.270> side<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.810> part<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.290> game<00:02:15.470> plan

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
on either side so to part the game plan

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.870 
on either side so to part the game plan
that's<00:02:17.270> probably<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.720> best<00:02:17.840> thing<00:02:17.990> about<00:02:18.880> in

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
that's probably the best thing about in

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.030 
that's probably the best thing about in
the<00:02:20.030> heart<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.420> we<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:20.690> they<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.260> what<00:02:21.890> they

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
the heart that we have they I what they

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.230 
the heart that we have they I what they
say<00:02:22.250> if<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.940> create<00:02:23.270> a<00:02:24.280> lot<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.400> space<00:02:25.640> for

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
say if you create a lot of space for

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.780 
say if you create a lot of space for
themselves<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.190> only<00:02:28.280> before<00:02:28.700> is

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
themselves but the only before is

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.250 
themselves but the only before is
probably<00:02:29.060> didn't<00:02:29.330> take<00:02:29.600> out<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.810> little<00:02:30.020> bit<00:02:30.170> in

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
probably didn't take out a little bit in

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.320 
probably didn't take out a little bit in
the<00:02:30.320> second<00:02:30.650> half<00:02:30.770> because<00:02:30.980> they<00:02:31.280> were<00:02:31.430> all

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the second half because they were all

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.880 
the second half because they were all
the<00:02:32.420> targets<00:02:32.600> there<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.110> they<00:02:33.200> start<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.740> see

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
the targets there and they start to see

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.470 
the targets there and they start to see
some<00:02:33.920> ID<00:02:34.190> out<00:02:34.400> there<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.880> they<00:02:35.000> don't<00:02:35.209> let<00:02:35.390> it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
some ID out there that they don't let it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.560 
some ID out there that they don't let it
on<00:02:35.630> our<00:02:36.590> boards<00:02:36.980> like<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.670> platform's<00:02:38.209> around

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
so that probably mighta for harvest for

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.690 
so that probably mighta for harvest for
