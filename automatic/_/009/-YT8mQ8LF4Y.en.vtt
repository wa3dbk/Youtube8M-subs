00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 we decided to use the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.780
 parmigiano reggiano as a base we say of 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.099
 flavor for which Parmesan cheese 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.639
 grated 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.310
 we boil it with water 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 we bring water to 90 degrees before that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.930
 nothing 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.650
 turn off let's put the Parmesan inside 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:29.760
 what is a liter and a half for 300 g of 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.109
 parmesan liter and a half of water 90 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.969
 degrees 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.600
 once the temperature we put 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.570
 inside parmesan we leave we give one 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.920
 whipped so that it melts 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.870
 quickly after that we leave it 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.370
 resting the water remains almost seems like a 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.270
 milk 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.350
 seems a little light, this is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.750
 all the part that remains after is that yes 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.160
 can use in a thousand ways because you can 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:07.170
 you can use hot as a broth is 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.850
 use cold putting on the ga race 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:16.290
 so if I add the same base 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:21.659
 about 5 grams or six newtons and agar agar 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.500
 if so, think about some agar agar 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.820
 I boil it to let it cool 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.030
 I get a solid mass 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.790
 once i solid the from it 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.299
 I get a consistency similar to one 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.430
 similar fondue obviously made only of 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.150
 water and said the red has the taste of 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.030
 Parmesan and then let them rest 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.399
 obviously it takes quite a while 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.250
 however, separation occurs in a manner 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.880
 absolutely 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.700
 and natural for which it rushes aside 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.430
 we say fatter and more full-bodied 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.240
 all the cheese remains 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.660
 all above the liquid part kane that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.050
 then this is what we saw here 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.090
 we have a variety of vegetables of 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.920
 very interesting scents we put 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.830
 some puntarelle that we are now at 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.709
 end because I like the puntarelle 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:23.160
 only for that reason of peas 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:25.959
 fresh turnips this is a white weapon 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:33.190
 put to soak with juice of 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:37.989
 asparagus beet then we have potatoes 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:41.560
 and we have two purple potatoes that always 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:45.190
 cocktails with water and regular potatoes or 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.930
 the celeriac and then the white turnip e 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:54.430
 of onions cauliflower carrots and 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.730
 celery so we made a kind 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.620
 once it was called a minestrone 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:06.489
 not in a very vulgar way today is not 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:12.070
 that a minestrone is a soup of 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:14.200
 Parmesan cheese with all fresh fragrances 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.200
 we put the herbs we made one 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.010
 they are what these are 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.959
 spinach and spinach you only stay 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.680
 always cook in water 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.450
 let dry then blend and put back 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.230
 inside some waters we get one 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.230
 test row
