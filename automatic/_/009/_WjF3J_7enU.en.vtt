00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.570
 it is a very large production apart from 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.150
 the anaconda how is depriving alligators and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.190
 turtles the anacondas can 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.620
 meet in estuaries and in areas where 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.720
 there is the plant devours so wilfredo 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.650
 will show us how llaneros do 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 to get them 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.740
 do not 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.410
 not to search 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.680
 to affect here where she does not hit her 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.680
 if not 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.090
 and you feel the flexibility with the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.720
 claw if it bothers the music not to mistreat 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.990
 the pearl if it is possible to touch it can be 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.600
 but we grabbed it 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.149
 leave her alone that day 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.189
 locals know animals well and 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.960
 who live with them daily is for 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.630
 which are the most suitable for 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.599

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.630
 in soybean in mating zones there are 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.050

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.810
 many who are out with only one 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.490
 from this date onwards 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.860
 it is advisable not to grab it 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.540
 but they did not catch the anacondas they 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.850
 they usually feed on chigÃ¼ires and 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.890
 small alligators as well as herons 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.470
 or turtles because they have a jaw 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.740
 very flexible to digest this kind of 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.710
 They believe the animals attacked 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.120
 but not she is harmless they do not 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.730
 they attack chasms 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.430
