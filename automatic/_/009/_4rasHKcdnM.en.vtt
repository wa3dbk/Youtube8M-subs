00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
first turned up and here it was just a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.179

trailer<00:00:22.020> load<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.470> rubbish<00:00:22.650> would<00:00:22.980> be<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
trailer load of rubbish would be the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.620 
trailer load of rubbish would be the

someone pulled it down to rebuild the
floor<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.199> found<00:00:28.529> out<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.769> was<00:00:28.859> just<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.070> bit

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
floor and it found out it was just a bit

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.609 
floor and it found out it was just a bit
more<00:00:29.429> they<00:00:29.670> anticipated<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.349> had<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> sort

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
more they anticipated so we had to sort

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.959 
more they anticipated so we had to sort
of<00:00:31.710> start<00:00:31.920> from<00:00:32.070> scratch<00:00:32.309> again<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.850> get<00:00:32.940> a

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
of start from scratch again and get a

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.080

chassis<00:00:33.620> sandblasted<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.710> painted<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.430> then

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
chassis sandblasted and painted and then

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.479 
chassis sandblasted and painted and then
we've<00:00:36.590> basically<00:00:37.590> rebuilt<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.280> from<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
we've basically rebuilt it from the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.580 
we've basically rebuilt it from the
ground<00:00:38.730> right<00:00:39.059> back<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> situation

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
ground right back up to the situation

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.380 
ground right back up to the situation
you<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.010> now<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.910> how<00:00:42.030> long<00:00:42.180> did<00:00:42.329> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
quite interested in doing that sort of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.649 
quite interested in doing that sort of
work<00:01:19.950> when<00:01:20.250> he<00:01:20.369> was<00:01:20.520> doing<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
work when he was doing it so in a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.570 
work when he was doing it so in a
roundabout<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> minister<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.130> carry<00:01:23.400> on

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
roundabout way of minister to carry on

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.670 
roundabout way of minister to carry on
the<00:01:24.119> family<00:01:24.299> trade<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.810> suppose<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.439> court

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the family trade I suppose you did court

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030 
the family trade I suppose you did court
and<00:01:25.970> it's<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.150> built<00:01:27.570> from<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and it's just built from there so you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
and it's just built from there so you
must<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.759> caravan<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.450> need<00:01:30.630> repairs<00:01:31.049> but

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
must get a caravan that need repairs but

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
must get a caravan that need repairs but
I<00:01:31.259> guess<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.920> more<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.340> enjoyment<00:01:33.000> when

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I guess it's more of an enjoyment when

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.420 
I guess it's more of an enjoyment when

ground build up so look like the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.539 
ground build up so look like the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
restoration rebuild from the ground up

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.249 
restoration rebuild from the ground up
as<00:02:03.810> well

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
as well

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.380 
as well
I<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:05.070> view<00:02:05.280> some<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.610> old<00:02:05.759> parts<00:02:06.149> but

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I will view some of the old parts but

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.050 
I will view some of the old parts but
pretty<00:02:07.320> much<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> sinew<00:02:07.860> care<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.910> how

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
pretty much the sinew care of it so how

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.570 
pretty much the sinew care of it so how
long<00:02:09.209> does<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.390> take<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.800> fully

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
long does it take to get to fully

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.020 
long does it take to get to fully
completed<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.209> guess

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
completed I guess

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.660 
completed I guess
it's<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.120> tricky<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.860> because<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.280> were

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
it's a tricky one because we were

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.960 
it's a tricky one because we were
actually<00:02:17.970> using<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:19.580> duplicate<00:02:20.580> some<00:02:20.610> more

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
actually using it to duplicate some more

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.700 
actually using it to duplicate some more
offer<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.540> sort<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.870> slowed<00:02:22.110> us<00:02:22.290> down<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.500> wee

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
offer it sort of slowed us down a wee

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.980 
offer it sort of slowed us down a wee
bit<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.580> would<00:02:24.030> say<00:02:24.210> once<00:02:24.510> we<00:02:24.600> actually<00:02:24.780> get

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
bit but I would say once we actually get

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.820 
bit but I would say once we actually get
running<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.730> start<00:02:26.730> producing<00:02:27.000> them<00:02:27.570> I

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
running and start producing them I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.350 
running and start producing them I
reckon<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:28.950> could<00:02:29.070> be<00:02:29.340> pokin<00:02:29.910> one<00:02:30.060> out<00:02:30.180> about

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
reckon we could be pokin one out about

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.210 
reckon we could be pokin one out about
every<00:02:30.600> month<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.560> looks<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:31.920> an<00:02:32.070> old

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
every month that looks like an old

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.890 
every month that looks like an old
Caravan<00:02:32.580> hopefully<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.570> this<00:02:33.720> one

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
Caravan hopefully we have this one

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.930 
Caravan hopefully we have this one
finished<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.410> couple<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.680> months<00:02:34.800> time<00:02:35.040> so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
finished in a couple of months time so

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.740 
finished in a couple of months time so
