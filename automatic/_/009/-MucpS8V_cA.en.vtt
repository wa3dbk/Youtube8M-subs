00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.270
 I'll do that here, I'll start that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.620
 storyboard and build my app 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:52.920

 ever good in the fold is in 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.930
 much clearer than at 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.729
 objective c 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.590
 I have no dealer vl looks quite 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 good 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:26.600

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:35.600
 outlet 1 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:41.720
 okay for the text view and i was 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.720
 action for the button 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:57.360

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.890
 strike place I try all the time 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.340

 I created with swift quite well 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.910
 works are specially made but the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.070
 thing that bothered me from the app 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.380
 develop with objective c looks here 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.390
 much nicer I think so 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.610
 will not have been my last app 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.780

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.590
 new language characteristics from yes that
