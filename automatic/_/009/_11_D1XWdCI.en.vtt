00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
glitches um so this would be a good

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.469 
glitches um so this would be a good
daily<00:01:33.150> driver<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> use<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.369> so

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
daily driver if you want to use it so

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.230 
daily driver if you want to use it so
keep<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.720> mind<00:01:37.130> it'd<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.670> good<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.909> flash

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
keep that in mind it'd be good to flash

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.990 
keep that in mind it'd be good to flash
and<00:01:39.630> some<00:01:40.200> custom<00:01:40.650> things<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.490> added<00:01:41.820> um

and some custom things that are added um
its<00:01:42.810> boot<00:01:43.049> animation<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.770> different<00:01:44.280> its<00:01:44.520> boot

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
its boot animation is different its boot

animation<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.259> why<00:01:47.130> um<00:01:47.520> international<00:01:48.360> s3's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
animation is why um international s3's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.370 
animation is why um international s3's
look<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:50.070> no<00:01:50.460> four<00:01:50.670> that's<00:01:50.790> four<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.390> as

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
look like up no four that's four and as

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.580 
look like up no four that's four and as
you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.340> top<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:54.110> TouchWiz<00:01:55.110> these
