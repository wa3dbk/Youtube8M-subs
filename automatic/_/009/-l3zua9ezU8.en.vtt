00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 running the game nice here without recording 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.019

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.070
 mouth and the first part that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:49.110
 is blank in the game in pc game 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:51.300
 gaming that can kill one here in 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.040
 the same recording game is running 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:09.560
 right that nothing is a game 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.560

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.280
 first part of our five to three 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:48.690
 and living here was recording only that the 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.790
 sound was too loud 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:59.550
 the debt there again the tap was 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.890
 recording so far the game is pretty cool 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.010
 remembering that it 's free to play 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.600
 So it's too bad in this game and I do not 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:15.770
 I know how it slides that in this game 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:21.390

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.310

 button c and be serious at playing this serious 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.239
 football does not have a badge yet, no it's not 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.950
 it would be too much 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.670
 the recommendation that runs on weak pcs 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.060

 one board has no video card and one hd 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.570
 and graphic hd is only that it is not easy nor 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.079
 without every computer taking the time 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.850
 for one more 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.299
 how many points you have won or even missed 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.299

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.849
 You win only you have one more. 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:19.169
 our world and now the game is 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.169

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.330

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.229
 game is worse than a kilometer from the 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.229

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.490

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:58.620
 there down there and 10/7 converted balance 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.620

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.370

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:44.550
