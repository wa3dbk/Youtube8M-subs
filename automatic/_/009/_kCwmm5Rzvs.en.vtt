00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
pretty it is a 20 22 24 the 24 stops

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.120 
pretty it is a 20 22 24 the 24 stops
while<00:03:33.930> I'm<00:03:34.020> sitting<00:03:34.260> down<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.680> stops<00:03:34.920> at<00:03:35.100> my

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
while I'm sitting down and stops at my

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.270 
while I'm sitting down and stops at my
head<00:03:35.900> when<00:03:36.900> I'm<00:03:37.020> standing<00:03:37.380> up<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.740> comes<00:03:37.950> about

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
head when I'm standing up it comes about

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.850 
head when I'm standing up it comes about
waist<00:03:39.060> length<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.900> guess<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.410> would<00:03:40.620> say<00:03:40.830> that

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
waist length so I guess I would say that

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:50.699 
waist length so I guess I would say that
it<00:03:41.130> is<00:03:41.250> true<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.820> leave<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:48.120> ends

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
it is true to leave the ends

00:03:50.709 --> 00:04:00.350 
it is true to leave the ends
and<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.430> see<00:03:51.609> if<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:51.819> can<00:03:52.000> show<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.269> all

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
order three bundles I use all three of

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.630 
order three bundles I use all three of
the<00:04:59.200> bundles<00:04:59.590> except<00:04:59.890> for<00:05:00.040> maybe<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.310> track

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
the bundles except for maybe a track

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.450 
the bundles except for maybe a track
about<00:05:00.880> this<00:05:01.120> big<00:05:03.780> so<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.230> they<00:05:06.010> were<00:05:06.070> pretty

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
about this big so and they were pretty

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.100 
about this big so and they were pretty
big<00:05:06.760> when<00:05:07.210> they<00:05:07.300> say<00:05:07.510> that<00:05:07.660> they<00:05:07.870> said<00:05:08.080> that

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
big when they say that they said that

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.200 
big when they say that they said that
they<00:05:08.260> were<00:05:08.380> 3.8<00:05:09.070> ounces<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.700> that<00:05:09.790> it<00:05:10.030> was

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
they were 3.8 ounces and that it was

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.600 
they were 3.8 ounces and that it was
right<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:10.480> think<00:05:10.780> they<00:05:11.020> were<00:05:11.080> even<00:05:11.440> maybe<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.919> 4<00:05:12.280> 4

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
right I think they were even maybe a 4 4

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.760 
right I think they were even maybe a 4 4
ounces<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.210> some<00:05:13.330> change<00:05:13.660> they<00:05:14.410> were<00:05:14.470> really

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
ounces and some change they were really

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.830 
ounces and some change they were really
pretty<00:05:15.130> and<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:15.669> was<00:05:15.820> really<00:05:16.000> big<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.570> they

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
pretty and it was really big and they

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.920 
pretty and it was really big and they
were<00:05:16.930> all<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.260> same<00:05:17.470> size<00:05:17.710> I<00:05:17.740> mean<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:18.190> longer

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
were all the same size I mean the longer

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.350 
were all the same size I mean the longer
the<00:05:19.930> longer<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.350> bundle<00:05:20.740> was<00:05:20.919> it<00:05:21.400> did<00:05:21.910> seem

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
the longer the bundle was it did seem

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.080 
the longer the bundle was it did seem
like<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:23.020> top<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:24.010> the<00:05:24.130> bundle<00:05:24.460> was<00:05:24.580> a<00:05:24.640> little

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
like the top of the bundle was a little

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.390 
like the top of the bundle was a little
smaller<00:05:25.480> but<00:05:26.200> when<00:05:26.350> I<00:05:26.380> was<00:05:26.650> installing<00:05:27.040> it

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
smaller but when I was installing it

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.370 
smaller but when I was installing it
here<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.580> realized<00:05:28.120> that<00:05:28.390> it<00:05:28.570> wasn't<00:05:28.810> any<00:05:29.110> less

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
here I realized that it wasn't any less

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.440 
here I realized that it wasn't any less
hair<00:05:29.620> than<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.919> under<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.220> other<00:05:30.610> bundles<00:05:30.910> it

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
hair than the under the other bundles it

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.690 
hair than the under the other bundles it
wasn't<00:05:32.020> like<00:05:32.140> there<00:05:32.320> was<00:05:32.530> a<00:05:32.560> shortage<00:05:33.100> so<00:05:33.430> I

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
wasn't like there was a shortage so I

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.580 
wasn't like there was a shortage so I
say<00:05:34.030> they<00:05:34.240> were<00:05:34.330> really<00:05:34.780> generous<00:05:35.080> with<00:05:35.470> their

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
say they were really generous with their

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.250 
say they were really generous with their
