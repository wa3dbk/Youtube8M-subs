o2 sensors are 22 millimeter those are

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.810 
o2 sensors are 22 millimeter those are
pulled<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.770> front<00:01:13.770> there's<00:01:14.340> two<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.730> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820

millimeter copper nut and in e 12
inverted<00:01:27.090> torx<00:01:27.330> once<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.680> four<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
inverted torx once you have all four of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.290 
inverted torx once you have all four of
those<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:31.100> have<00:01:32.100> someone<00:01:32.910> else<00:01:33.090> either

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
if you have a Jackson your workout left

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
if you have a Jackson your workout left
once<00:01:38.760> those<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.390> down<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.960> can

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
once those are all down you can

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.960 
once those are all down you can
literally<00:01:40.470> pull<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.920> whole<00:01:41.130> system<00:01:41.610> off<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
literally pull this whole system off in

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.250 
literally pull this whole system off in
one<00:01:42.150> piece<00:01:42.590> once<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.010> exhaust<00:01:44.310> off

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
one piece once we have the exhaust off

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.690 
one piece once we have the exhaust off
going<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.350> start<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.650> up<00:01:46.710> again<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.220> I'll<00:01:47.550> show

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
going to start it up again and I'll show

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.140 
going to start it up again and I'll show
you<00:01:47.729> guys<00:01:47.940> how<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.180> tap<00:01:48.660> in<00:01:48.840> nature<00:01:49.910> all<00:01:50.910> right

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
you guys how to tap in nature all right

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150 
you guys how to tap in nature all right
you<00:01:51.330> can<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.660> we<00:01:51.810> had<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.140> stock<00:01:52.410> exhaust<00:01:52.830> off

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
having a problem is this each field

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.820 
having a problem is this each field
basically<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:07.270> want<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.600> tap<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:08.229> all

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.110 
can see it's from you know really nice
to<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.110> body<00:02:56.350> here<00:02:56.709> there's<00:02:57.610> nothing<00:02:57.790> behind

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
to the body here there's nothing behind

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.539 
to the body here there's nothing behind
so<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.630> didn't<00:02:58.840> damage<00:02:59.110> anything<00:02:59.489> you<00:03:00.489> just
