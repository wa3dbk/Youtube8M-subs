00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi girls and guys I say guys because 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.710
 I have also seen that they have already sat 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.050
 kids channels good on this occasion les 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.809
 I bring this little box that I 'm going 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.000
 to use as the watch holder but more 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.310
 nothing I feel that fits very well for 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.780
 the more men come to design for them 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.050
 It serves as a travel box 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:28.500
 see how this opens like this then 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.360
 the side in this way here 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.079
 It has a compartment to place 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.019
 rings and a little mirror 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.149
 in this place here you can place the 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.920
 watches are very easy to put on and that 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:45.250
 It is very well placed 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.640
 in this space you have below a 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.640
 cajoncito 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.660
 in which you can gain weight can do 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.880
 necklaces 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:00.180
 things that are they have worn wristbands and they 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.180

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.550
 well how nice it fits is for two 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.120
 watches a maximum of fit and serves very 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.680
 well it carries what it is for when someone 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.680

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.610

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.080

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.480

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.000

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.370

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.370
