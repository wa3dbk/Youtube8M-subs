so<00:00:10.620> Kevin<00:00:10.800> earlier<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.460> discussed<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
so Kevin earlier we discussed the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.640 
so Kevin earlier we discussed the
various<00:00:12.330> types<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.750> sliders<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.259> out<00:00:13.380> there

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
various types of sliders are out there

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.490 
various types of sliders are out there
now<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.790> things<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.179> found<00:00:15.500> sort

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
now one of the things that I found sort

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500 
now one of the things that I found sort
of<00:00:16.560> challenging<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.490> my<00:00:17.609> own<00:00:17.820> regard<00:00:18.270> when<00:00:18.420> I'm

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
of challenging in my own regard when I'm

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.910 
of challenging in my own regard when I'm
out<00:00:18.630> there<00:00:18.660> filming<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.560> sort<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
out there filming it's sort of the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.740 
out there filming it's sort of the
technique<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.850> using<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.330> slider<00:00:21.630> right

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
technique of using a slider right

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.390 
technique of using a slider right
because<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.590> sort<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.039> tendency

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
because you sort of have this tendency

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.380 
because you sort of have this tendency
to<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.640> oh<00:00:23.820> wow

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to go oh wow

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.790 
to go oh wow
slides<00:00:24.660> back<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:24.930> forth<00:00:25.140> let<00:00:25.439> me<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.680> move

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
slides back and forth let me just move

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.170 
slides back and forth let me just move
it<00:00:25.949> back<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> forth<00:00:26.310> sort<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.730> willing<00:00:26.880> nilly

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
it back and forth sort of willing nilly

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.200 
it back and forth sort of willing nilly
but<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.170> mind<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:29.099> motivates<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
but in your mind what motivates the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.389 
but in your mind what motivates the
slide<00:00:30.480> well<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.500> depends<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> mood

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
slide well it just depends on the mood

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.889 
slide well it just depends on the mood
of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> shot<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.090> mean<00:00:33.239> what<00:00:33.390> you're<00:00:33.510> trying<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
of the shot I mean what you're trying to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
of the shot I mean what you're trying to
achieve<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.739> different<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.820> different

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
achieve is different for different

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.110 
achieve is different for different
scenarios<00:00:36.350> you<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.469> some<00:00:37.800> shots<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.520> will<00:00:38.969> get

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
scenarios you know some shots I will get

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.520 
scenarios you know some shots I will get
in<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.780> will<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> straight

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
in here and I will do a straight

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.010 
in here and I will do a straight
tracking<00:00:41.160> shot<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.670> I'm<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.239> story<00:00:42.690> here

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
tracking shot so I'm on this story here

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
tracking shot so I'm on this story here
just<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.350> an<00:00:43.469> example<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.910> straight

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
just as an example and a straight

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.119 
just as an example and a straight
tracking<00:00:45.780> shot<00:00:46.110> would<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:46.860> I'm<00:00:46.950> just

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
tracking shot would be what I'm just

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.729 
tracking shot would be what I'm just
coming<00:00:47.550> right<00:00:47.820> across<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:49.110> picture<00:00:49.379> like

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
coming right across the picture like

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.670 
coming right across the picture like
this<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:51.059> tripods<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:51.870> panning<00:00:52.469> or

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
this and my tripods not panning or

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.270 
this and my tripods not panning or
tilting<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.090> coming<00:00:54.300> straight<00:00:54.719> across

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
tilting it's just coming straight across

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
tilting it's just coming straight across
so<00:00:56.280> that's<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.760> technique<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.539> these<00:00:57.989> are

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
so that's one technique and these are

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
so that's one technique and these are
good<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.890> independent<00:00:59.460> films<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.989> music

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
good that in independent films and music

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.810 
good that in independent films and music
videos<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> want<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> reveal<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.699> your

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
videos if you want to reveal one of your

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
videos if you want to reveal one of your
characters<00:01:03.329> into<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> frame<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.619> know

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
characters into the frame you know

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.640 
characters into the frame you know
instead<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.189> simply<00:01:05.640> panning<00:01:06.090> over<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:07.470> can

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
instead of simply panning over you can

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
instead of simply panning over you can
actually<00:01:07.860> dolly<00:01:08.310> over<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.939> also<00:01:09.090> adds<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.510> lot

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
actually dolly over it also adds a lot

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.380 
actually dolly over it also adds a lot
of<00:01:09.810> depth<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> picture<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.180> Kevin<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.240> lot

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
of depth to the picture so Kevin a lot

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.820 
of depth to the picture so Kevin a lot
of<00:01:12.510> times<00:01:12.689> when<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.170> looking<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.560> slider

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
of times when I'm looking at slider

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
of times when I'm looking at slider
moves<00:01:14.070> I'm<00:01:14.220> sort<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.520> thinking<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.090> like

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
moves I'm sort of thinking of that like

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.510 
moves I'm sort of thinking of that like
floating<00:01:15.869> camera<00:01:16.560> thing<00:01:16.799> where<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> cameras

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
floating camera thing where the cameras

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.060 
floating camera thing where the cameras
never<00:01:17.850> quite<00:01:18.570> at<00:01:18.840> rest<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.409> moving<00:01:19.740> back<00:01:19.890> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
never quite at rest it's moving back and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.800 
never quite at rest it's moving back and
forth<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> lot<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.330> like

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
forth you see that a lot in like

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.679 
forth you see that a lot in like
political<00:01:22.229> advertisements<00:01:23.220> interviews<00:01:24.150> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
political advertisements interviews that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.030 
political advertisements interviews that
kind<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.930> stuff<00:01:25.170> how<00:01:25.439> does<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.680> technique

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
kind of stuff how does that technique

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.920 
kind of stuff how does that technique
work<00:01:26.189> well<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:26.939> called<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.270> tracking<00:01:27.720> shot

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
work well that's called a tracking shot

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510 
work well that's called a tracking shot
and<00:01:28.200> essentially<00:01:28.680> what's<00:01:28.890> happening<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and essentially what's happening is that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.130 
and essentially what's happening is that
your<00:01:29.820> subject<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> middle<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
your subject is in the middle of the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.890 
your subject is in the middle of the
frame<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> entire<00:01:31.860> time<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.790> dolly<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
frame the entire time and the dolly is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
frame the entire time and the dolly is
panning<00:01:34.439> left<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.310> right<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.640> left

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
panning left to right or right to left

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.330 
panning left to right or right to left
and<00:01:36.210> keeping<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> subject<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> center

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and keeping that subject in the center

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.940 
and keeping that subject in the center
of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.579> frame<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.420> essentially<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.439> subject

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
of the frame so essentially the subject

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.249 
of the frame so essentially the subject
is<00:01:41.100> still<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> background<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.840> moving

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
is still but the background is moving

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.859 
is still but the background is moving
and<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.430> really<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.240> good<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.570> adding

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and it's really really good for adding

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.830 
and it's really really good for adding
depth<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> picture<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.070> easily<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:48.689> way

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
depth to a picture really easily the way

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.539 
depth to a picture really easily the way
that<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.680> lot<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.890> people<00:01:50.100> will<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
that I do it a lot of people will do it

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.670 
that I do it a lot of people will do it
with<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> tripod<00:01:51.299> pan<00:01:51.630> bar<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.409> this

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
with the tripod pan bar all like this

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.730 
with the tripod pan bar all like this
and<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.700> problem<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.570> seem<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.500> with

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and the problem that I seem to have with

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.620 
and the problem that I seem to have with
it<00:01:55.950> most<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.399> time<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.240> really

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
it most of the time is that it's really

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.630 
it most of the time is that it's really
hard<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.110> get<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.439> consistent<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.280> what<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> do

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
hard to get that consistent so what I do

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.179 
hard to get that consistent so what I do
is<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.119> will<00:02:00.180> manhandle<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> head<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.469> will<00:02:01.890> get

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
is I will manhandle the head I will get

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.530 
is I will manhandle the head I will get
in<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.610> which<00:02:02.759> gets<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.060> closer<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.509> your

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
in here which gets you closer to your

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.450 
in here which gets you closer to your
camera<00:02:03.960> which<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.200> advantageous<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
camera which is advantageous but what I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.029 
camera which is advantageous but what I
like<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.240> actually<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.630> track<00:02:07.140> just

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
like to do is actually just track just

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.150 
like to do is actually just track just
like<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.149> gently<00:02:09.629> turning<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
like that and I'm gently turning the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.990 
like that and I'm gently turning the
head

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
head

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.590 
head
as<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:13.110> move<00:02:13.320> around<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.680> subject<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.700> that

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
as I move around the subject and that

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.720 
as I move around the subject and that
gets<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.960> really<00:02:16.290> really<00:02:16.770> consistent<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.550> lot

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
gets you really really consistent a lot

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
gets you really really consistent a lot
more<00:02:17.940> consistent<00:02:18.480> than<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.720> would<00:02:18.960> if<00:02:19.410> you're

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
more consistent than you would if you're

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.500 
more consistent than you would if you're
using<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.010> pan<00:02:20.220> water<00:02:22.250> cool<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:24.180> let<00:02:24.330> me<00:02:24.390> ask

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
emotion in the shot the better way would

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.520 
emotion in the shot the better way would
be<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.790> something<00:02:54.360> subtle<00:02:54.630> okay<00:02:55.410> a

subtle<00:02:55.860> push<00:02:56.250> or<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.670> subtle<00:02:57.150> track<00:02:57.750> so

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
subtle push or a subtle track so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.560 
subtle push or a subtle track so
tracking<00:02:58.860> slowly<00:02:59.400> will<00:02:59.850> allow<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.330> add<00:03:00.540> a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
tracking slowly will allow you to add a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.330 
tracking slowly will allow you to add a
lot<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.930> depth<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.500> scene<00:03:01.770> add<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.100> lot<00:03:02.310> of

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
lot of depth to that scene add a lot of

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.340 
lot of depth to that scene add a lot of
emotion<00:03:02.940> especially<00:03:03.150> with<00:03:03.570> scenes<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.110> that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
emotion especially with scenes like that

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.930 
emotion especially with scenes like that
where<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.739> kind<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:04.980> an<00:03:05.100> emotive<00:03:05.489> scene

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
where you have kind of an emotive scene

like anything else with filming it's you
got<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> practice<00:03:11.370> right<00:03:11.610> oh<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:12.209> is

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
got a practice right oh this is

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.460 
got a practice right oh this is
something<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.840> don't<00:03:12.959> just<00:03:13.170> go<00:03:13.320> out

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
something that you don't just go out

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.110 
something that you don't just go out
with<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.650> slide<00:03:13.890> or<00:03:13.920> day<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.760> expect<00:03:15.030> to

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
with a slide or day one and expect to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.900 
with a slide or day one and expect to
get<00:03:15.270> fantastic<00:03:15.540> results<00:03:16.100> no<00:03:17.100> not<00:03:17.580> at<00:03:17.760> all

get fantastic results no not at all

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.690 
get fantastic results no not at all
practice<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.959> key<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.769> last<00:03:20.130> thing<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.489> want

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
practice is key the last thing you want
