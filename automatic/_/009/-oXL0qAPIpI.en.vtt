00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
not try to convince you that this is a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.839 
not try to convince you that this is a
glorious<00:00:27.840> opening<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:29.039> please<00:00:29.429> keep<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.820> mind

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
glorious opening but please keep in mind

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.820 
glorious opening but please keep in mind
that<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.420> actually<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.990> an<00:00:31.140> especially<00:00:31.380> bad

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that it actually is an especially bad

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.670 
that it actually is an especially bad
according<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.030> me<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.420> opening<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.110> perfect

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
according to me this opening is perfect

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.000 
according to me this opening is perfect
to<00:00:34.829> use<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.280> blitz<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.120> rapid<00:00:36.540> chess<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.800> can

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
to use in blitz or rapid chess you can

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
to use in blitz or rapid chess you can
use<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.489> games<00:00:38.910> where<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.390> more<00:00:39.750> time

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
use it in games where you have more time

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.470 
use it in games where you have more time
but<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.620> isn't<00:00:41.399> recommended<00:00:41.760> since<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
but it isn't recommended since the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.090 
but it isn't recommended since the
opponent<00:00:42.899> winners<00:00:43.200> will<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.890> an

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
opponent winners will then have an

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.979 
opponent winners will then have an
easier<00:00:44.430> time<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.969> exploit<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.570> openings

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
easier time to exploit the openings

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
easier time to exploit the openings
weaknesses<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.829> thought<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.789> today<00:00:48.120> would

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
weaknesses I thought that we today would

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
weaknesses I thought that we today would
take<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> look<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.680> most<00:00:49.860> natural

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
take a look at one of the most natural

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.970 
take a look at one of the most natural
continuations<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.510> position<00:00:51.989> namely

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
continuations in this position namely

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.569 
continuations in this position namely
pawn<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.579> e5<00:00:54.620> this<00:00:55.620> will<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> far<00:00:56.370> most

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
pawn to e5 this will be the far most

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 
pawn to e5 this will be the far most
popular<00:00:56.969> move<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.480> will<00:00:57.629> ever<00:00:57.809> play<00:00:57.960> against

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
popular move you will ever play against

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.130 
popular move you will ever play against
since<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.520> directly<00:01:00.000> threatens<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.870> for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
since it directly threatens to be for

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.490 
since it directly threatens to be for
pawn<00:01:01.699> but<00:01:02.699> remember<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.449> even<00:01:04.049> though<00:01:04.320> your

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
pawn but remember that even though your

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
pawn but remember that even though your
opponent<00:01:04.920> uses<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.430> move<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.909> doesn't<00:01:06.360> mean

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
opponent uses this move it doesn't mean

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.350 
opponent uses this move it doesn't mean
that<00:01:06.630> he<00:01:06.810> knows<00:01:07.049> theory<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.280> often<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that he knows theory it's often so that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.870 
that he knows theory it's often so that
not<00:01:09.720> only<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.260> first<00:01:10.500> move<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.610> first

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
not only the first move but the first

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
not only the first move but the first
couple<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.390> moves<00:01:12.600> might<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.409> played

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
couple of moves might be played

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
couple of moves might be played
according<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> theory<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.049> since

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
according to theory this is so since

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.010 
according to theory this is so since
they<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.590> obvious<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.850> after<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> while<00:01:18.450> black

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
they are obvious but after a while black

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
they are obvious but after a while black
begins<00:01:19.350> straight<00:01:19.799> from<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> right<00:01:20.520> road<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
begins straight from the right road and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.630 
begins straight from the right road and
begins<00:01:21.450> making<00:01:21.720> mistakes<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.430> want

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
begins making mistakes but if you want

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.310 
begins making mistakes but if you want
to<00:01:23.759> become<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> good<00:01:24.240> chess<00:01:24.479> player<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.140> should

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
to become a good chess player you should

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.859 
to become a good chess player you should
never<00:01:25.470> count<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.920> look<00:01:26.100> always<00:01:26.909> counter<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
never count a look always counter and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
never count a look always counter and
that<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.200> opponent<00:01:28.680> knows<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.340> best<00:01:29.520> moves

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that the opponent knows the best moves

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.010 
that the opponent knows the best moves
and<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.840> he<00:01:31.200> doesn't<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> bonus<00:01:33.020> many

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and if he doesn't see it as a bonus many

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.140 
and if he doesn't see it as a bonus many
mean<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.470> b4<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> bad<00:01:35.369> move<00:01:35.670> since<00:01:36.000> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
mean that b4 is a bad move since it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
mean that b4 is a bad move since it
doesn't<00:01:36.420> take<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.049> control<00:01:37.530> over<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.860> center

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
doesn't take the control over the center

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.249 
doesn't take the control over the center
or<00:01:38.729> opens<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> peak<00:01:39.780> white<00:01:40.020> pieces

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
or opens up for the peak white pieces

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.830 
or opens up for the peak white pieces
but<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.610> actually<00:01:41.790> not<00:01:42.240> quite<00:01:42.450> true

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
but that is actually not quite true

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.319 
but that is actually not quite true
because<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.740> opens<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> bishop<00:01:44.939> which

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
because it opens up for the bishop which

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.569 
because it opens up for the bishop which
after<00:01:45.659> Bishop<00:01:46.079> b2<00:01:46.229> takes<00:01:46.799> control<00:01:47.009> over<00:01:47.430> not

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
after Bishop b2 takes control over not

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.260 
after Bishop b2 takes control over not
only<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.210> center<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> board<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.710> general

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
some mean that black shouldn't take them

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.670 
some mean that black shouldn't take them
before<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.570> most<00:01:54.750> popular<00:01:55.229> move<00:01:55.470> is
