 greater pleasure 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.729
 Thank you, hello, guys. Today I'm going to give you a 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.820
 tip to you about the engine 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.550
 he had a pari zero point but this one 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.470
 tip is also for other cars 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.349
 first cylinder to play in a game 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.560
 exchange 

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:27.750
 cells exchange spike exchanges the car module 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.899
 sometimes there are people and return to the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.239
 car head and nothing resolves change 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.110
 everything and he continues to fail the first 

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:37.380
 cylinder 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.509
 So here's the tip for you guys, it 's like 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.880
 solve this problem 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.640
 we see the mangueirinha and and this majority 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.530
 connected to a part called the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.860
 that the pressure piece is here 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.140
 down here it is very difficult to solve 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.789
 this piece here but we give a 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.369
 I'll show you the way 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.959
 how to get to that part and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.729
 make her exchange 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.190
 first you have to have a key 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.009
 allen like this and start taking these 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.250
 snare screws and you have to 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.550
 remove this piece here to be able to arrive 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.580
 on the pressure regulator and you 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.709
 screw on the other side and there are still two 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.340
 screws that is located here in the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.550
 down and you continue with the same key 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.220
 in addition to the screws on the underside 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.650
 you can start on this side and on the other side 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.680
 here only it is very difficult but you can 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:39.470
 take it without relaxing under here it goes 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:42.310
 to get this way is the other way 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.870
 side also the same thing as the first 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.709
 king on the top you will use a 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.040
 Key ael 11 in order to remove 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.140
 imac screw screws apparent screw 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.349
 and signed that they also win with the same 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.360
 key 11 ending the bolt 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.280
 You remove this mangueirinha balance 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.310
 on the pressure regulator 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.680
 You can already remove this piece from above 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.680
 which is very carefully just pull in the psi 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.870
 turn off anything up there you can use 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.500
 a screwdriver in that little hole and 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.379
 which helps to choose the laac to be able to 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.950
 not damage the part block part 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:24.170
 Car down and with a key 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.269
 crack you come with start to rifle order 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.569
 on the pressure regulator 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.720
 Then you'll remove it from the place. 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:36.019
 simple just take this ring ee 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:43.069
 hold it and can already pull the regulator 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:51.290
 that he is already leaving are regulator already with 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:53.060
 is damaged when you take the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.280
 regulator sometimes fixed 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.099
 that you have to release without 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.950
 rubber pulls the toddynho down and 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.590
 and has another one that is more 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.349
 below you can not leave the 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.580
 reader to be able to replace it with a 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.950
 new 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.460
 and this pressure regulator has a 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.590
 The membrane inside is that it 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.120
 when it sometimes cuts in avoiding 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.250
 return and gasoline returns and goes there 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.470
 for candle and candle water and where not 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.020
 let the first cylinder run 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.840
 then the major causes of these defects 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.910
 of the first cylinder is can be a 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.200
 causes the pressure regulator then 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.200
 you should change the 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.810
 I'm saying this because I've already suffered 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.940
 much with this car so I already changed 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.970
 at all and did not work was when 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.300
 I changed the pressure regulator there 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.130
 solve my problem I'm 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.440
 passing this tip to you so that 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.660
 you do not suffer as I suffered 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.340
 in this car reminding you that I do not 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.250
 I'm a car mechanic. 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.160
 I just in my car 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.970
 I'm hardly able to send another person 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.850
 So I'm trying to say that you 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.390
 You can even do this type of service in 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:17.870
 Even home to you and save not 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:21.080
 have to spend a lot because sometimes 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.240
 you spend and up to over a thousand reais being 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.630
 that a piece of such inclusion in the 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.940
 60 reais more or less then it was worth 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.410
 The staff here is the tip for you. 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.480
 did you like it 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.070
 sign up for my channel and I do not like it 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.070
 It's good and until the next
