00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
up the gain switch to get a little bit

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.120 
up the gain switch to get a little bit
more<00:01:48.630> bite<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> most<00:01:49.649> part<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.100> was

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
more bite but for the most part it was

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.219 
more bite but for the most part it was
meant<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> very<00:01:50.850> open<00:01:51.360> sounding<00:01:51.869> clean

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
meant to be a very open sounding clean

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.249 
meant to be a very open sounding clean
powerful<00:01:53.159> sounding<00:01:53.520> amp<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:54.689> gonna<00:01:54.869> play

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
powerful sounding amp so I'm gonna play

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.109 
powerful sounding amp so I'm gonna play
some<00:01:55.500> examples<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.040> now<00:01:56.219> using<00:01:56.969> this

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
some examples right now using this
