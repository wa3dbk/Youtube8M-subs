00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.410
 Hello hello friends come here to one 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.620
 new murder conception around that is 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.730
 This time there is no direct ingame place 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.570
 the murder manager for the driving simulator 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:24.480
 15 when you download it you have 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.789
 this file manager 1.1 is point 23 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.970
 Just open a file and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.949
 download manager and accordingly 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.649
 double click here the descriptions 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.660
 and then just to the real thing then can 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.219
 you install and then you have this 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.110
 browser quasi so this funny nice 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.879
 overview window where you see what have 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.629
 we all so installed that goes but 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.300
 far above 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.510
 really cool actually you have something for 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.579
 march in the folder and what can we do with it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.360
 you can make here to this example 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.690
 Brooks on moor clicks you can almost see 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.340
 the description here eg 7 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.710
 the version number here you can see the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.310
 author and so on and so forth 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.310
 You may even believe that here 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.270
 pretty sure but it looks like that for me 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.040
 than you could change something here to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.619
 Price that is pretty cool 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.119
 personally want to change the price now 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.850
 It is really possible everyday 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.860
 Maintenance costs and the category in the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.210
 shop of will personally rather 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.479
 that was really cool that was 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.130
 correctly tested around 2000 fans lean 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.000
 what you can do is natural 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.299
 Clear 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.970
 quasi delete the place and activate the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.439
 disable personal right 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.680
 nice idea so basically the idea 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.210
 The manager is very very good so can 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.200
 now actually not 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.710
 complain about the idea what is there 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.450
 otherwise only installation 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.700
 So I do not think so 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.890
 tested here just the files 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.079
 but pull in my test 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.869
 friends can test it for a short time 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.509
 I now put in the inspector aha 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.729
 exactly inspector drafted Korner 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.920
 Finstertal click and then have here 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.420
 somewhere 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.410
 Inspector murder if it really where 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.120
 it has accordingly where then 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.310
 inspired inspector that's pretty 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.770
 so many personally so really goes 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.130
 extremely easy and then you can too 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.690
 to make settings as small as 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.830
 just the game settings xml file 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.180
 select and of course the file from 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:41.970
 murder folder and also of course 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.830
 accordingly, the game itself therefore 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.049
 pretty clear features this though 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.670
 pretty cool to manage 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.370
 So here you see, for example, two 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.140
 versions of jens marx it is 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.730
 not necessarily meaningful purely 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.480
 theoretical version raushauen 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.849
 So something is so well possible so can 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.650
 So the final recommended here are 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.650
 things to be and what is below lukoil 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.019
 will personally Olemotz here the 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.549
 active and inactive so it does 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.560
 certainly it useful is perhaps the 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.400
 early version but I have nothing now 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.930
 extremely negative full things with the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.810
 possibility here the prices draw the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.900
 be really horny song editor then 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.450
 you can only change the capacity zb 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.989
 and consumption and the braking power so 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.400
 I really fat thing must work so 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.940
 inconspicuous but is really right 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.579
 hot 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.910
 here it can only recommend the quasi only 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.850
 Warmly welcome and we look forward 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.450
 about yo what you say we oversee 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.130
 your feedback is about your what everyone before 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.870
 it will be really interesting 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.489
 says thank you for watching and 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.489
 hopefully to the next friends
