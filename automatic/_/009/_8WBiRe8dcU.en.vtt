different kinds of fruit bats together

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.429 
different kinds of fruit bats together
because<00:01:18.430> they<00:01:18.610> eat<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:19.000> same<00:01:19.180> thing<00:01:19.509> and

I'm gonna go in and grab one so we can

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.859 
I'm gonna go in and grab one so we can
take<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.649> look<00:01:23.770> at<00:01:23.920> one<00:01:24.040> close-up<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.689> is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
fly fox and he's from Africa and there

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.950 
fly fox and he's from Africa and there
are<00:01:32.890> bats<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.610> live<00:01:33.790> in<00:01:33.940> Africa<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:34.659> size

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
are bats that live in Africa this size

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.520 
are bats that live in Africa this size
and<00:01:35.440> this<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.100> actually<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.580> largest<00:01:36.729> in

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and this is actually the largest in

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.100 
and this is actually the largest in
Zambia<00:01:38.530> Africa<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:39.430> Kasatka<00:01:40.120> National<00:01:40.720> Park

Zambia Africa in Kasatka National Park

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.640 
Zambia Africa in Kasatka National Park
there's<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:42.090> colony<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.210> over<00:01:43.570> 8<00:01:43.780> million<00:01:44.380> of

there's a colony of over 8 million of
these<00:01:44.799> bats<00:01:45.130> in<00:01:45.430> October<00:01:45.909> November<00:01:46.060> and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
these bats in October November and

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.510 
these bats in October November and
December<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:47.020> one<00:01:47.470> of<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.650> key<00:01:47.860> things<00:01:48.190> is

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
December and one of the key things is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.850 
December and one of the key things is
that<00:01:48.760> they<00:01:48.909> migrate<00:01:49.450> across<00:01:49.600> Africa<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.470> as

that they migrate across Africa and as

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.340 
that they migrate across Africa and as
they<00:01:51.010> migrate<00:01:51.430> they<00:01:51.670> spread<00:01:52.299> seeds<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:53.260> as

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
they migrate they spread seeds so as

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.800 
they migrate they spread seeds so as
they<00:01:53.500> fly<00:01:53.740> across<00:01:54.000> Africa<00:01:55.000> they<00:01:55.180> spread<00:01:55.479> seeds

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
they fly across Africa they spread seeds

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.020 
they fly across Africa they spread seeds
into<00:01:56.140> one<00:01:56.320> of<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.470> key<00:01:56.710> animals<00:01:57.130> for<00:01:57.700> helping

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
into one of the key animals for helping

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.649
