00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.610 

now<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:32.360> wire<00:01:32.600> brush<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.020> really<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.350> great

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620

particles I can't get with the hammer

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.280 
particles I can't get with the hammer
and<00:01:37.310> chisel<00:01:37.700> helps<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.630> break<00:01:38.840> out<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.080> true

color of the abalone shell so here I'm

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.080 
color of the abalone shell so here I'm
using<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.500> chisel<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:46.040> scrape<00:01:46.370> off<00:01:46.610> all<00:01:46.880> these

tiny little white snails on the show for

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.190 
tiny little white snails on the show for
some<00:01:49.760> reason<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.120> wire<00:01:50.270> brush<00:01:50.570> doesn't<00:01:50.840> get

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
some reason the wire brush doesn't get

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.460 
some reason the wire brush doesn't get
to<00:01:51.380> them<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.550> chisel<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.300> in<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.900> second

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
those are both great tools for removing

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:20.500
