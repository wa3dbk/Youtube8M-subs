00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.090
 let's go over the goals and about all 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.330
 the actions of danger this was the 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.589
 We remember that first part 2001 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.849
 the protagonists undoubtedly sergio to 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.219
 rivas with that shot with the leg 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.049
 left that will be repeated in 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.300
 absurdities was right-handed because it has 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.310
 He left performances with both legs of 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.009
 the most beautiful bill shot this far 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.080
 far from pablo gonzálvez and the 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.970
 alexander's great mitten stop 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.279
 blacksmith let's see how he sticks there with 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.750
 the outer instep and the popcorn 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.800
 goalkeeper that is true has a little bit 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.239
 centered that leather but there it was 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.090
 another action also of danger on the part 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.699
 of Gandín leaders of the party and is 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.070
 putting the center and above all that 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.379
 missile of pablo gonzález no doubt one of 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.629
 the clearest occasions 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.699
 this little hat this play ends and it 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.980
 I think it also lines needs 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.570
 absolutely nobody and hitting hard 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.489
 with the leg 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.370
 - well there we had both health 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.980
 Sanchez Canning reads before to follow 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.719
 probably the battle has taken 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.250
 calling different to the midfielder 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.560
 real madrid the war has taken her 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.119
 the white team we see here the first 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.939
 Aitor billiards goal is carried by 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.890
 force and with that chut puts it very 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.240
 of the reach of the goalkeeper of valencia 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.979
 that at that time it was still 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.530
 compains if I'm not wrong I do not know 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.200
 you are wrong 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.600
 the fortune of collecting the rejection yes that 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.970
 it's true that he's a very good player there 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.670
 against the Valencian defender against toni 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.530
 blacksmith and that was the first one who 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.280
 opened the data billiards work the minute 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.930
 28 then aimed looking for Real Madrid 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 also the Olympic goals 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.730
 álvaro garcía álvaro martín shot with 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.390
 the left-handed very prominent like today you're going to 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.520
 tell 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.920
 not the words 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.420
 and as we say the realmadrid we will see 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.390
 sergio up with the right goes from 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.760
 one goes away from two mother mine places her in 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.770
 the same squad is brutal that we can 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.720
 saying about this play is wonderful 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.890
 the goal of sergio a rivas that celebrates 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.960
 with anger because it was a very goal 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.210
 important buried almost any 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.259
 option because of the valencià see here 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.450
 unfortunate goal because more than flavius 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.330
 is roberto gómez in his own door because 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.890
 if we see good maybe go between the three 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.810
 sticks the plagiarism shot in any 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.600
 case roberto gómez is a tad 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.660
 unfortunate and another goal this one would be 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.280
 arribas this was the fourth and we did not 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.980
 surprises this type of actions already by 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.269
 part of sergio a rivas because it is a 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.110
 authentic crack and it has shown 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.200
 throughout the championship goal of 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.200
 sergio a rivas that would not be less this one 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.420
 the stretcher in 24 all decided the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.370
 South Korean said here I am I did not want 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.890
 miss the party the player of 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.450
 wonderful valencia the execution of the 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.260
 lack I can not do anything the goalkeeper of 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.569
 real madrid- they put it 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.569
 where nobody can get good
