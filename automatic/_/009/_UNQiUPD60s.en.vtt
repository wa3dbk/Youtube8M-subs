00:00:07.784 --> 00:00:09.409
 There are people in this world ... 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.921
 ... with extraordinary abilities. We do not ask to be special ... 

00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:16.076
 ... we are only born this way 

00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:28.467
 Some of us can move objects with the mind 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.333
 -You are of the Second Generation - are you called these days? 

00:00:32.373 --> 00:00:34.492
 Others make their thoughts, yours 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.251
 Get out of my head! 

00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:38.665
 Some see the future 

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.790
 You are an Observer 

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:42.053
 Right now... 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.013
 ... our future is not so great 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.214
 But a secret government organization called Division ... 

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:52.669
 ... trained to hunt us and become weapons 

00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:56.479
 Only one person has escaped from Division 

00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:00.124
 We must find her, she is the key to defeating them 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.336
 With it we will create an army that the world has never seen 

00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:08.299
 I still did not get to the bad part ... 

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:10.975
 ... we die 

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:12.239
 Cool 

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:17.180
 Division is looking for you 

00:01:17.798 --> 00:01:18.973
 We are here to help you 

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:21.515
 You said that the future always changes 

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:22.687
 What will you do? 

00:01:22.914 --> 00:01:24.902
 -I'll try to make a better one -It sounds like a plan 

00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:26.479
 But what about the part where we die? 

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:30.855
 It is not part of the plan 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.319
 -Corre -They are here 

00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.373
 Run, Cassie! 

00:01:41.236 --> 00:01:43.486
 We want to Division outside of Hong Kong as much as you 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.300
 They 

00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:49.029
 They must conform to reality, Everyone will die ... 

00:01:49.187 --> 00:01:51.270
 ... do you know who does not die? I 

00:01:52.575 --> 00:01:54.010
 Are you trying to enter my head? 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.472
 Ahead 

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:58.082
 See if you can shoot me down before I shoot 

00:01:58.094 --> 00:01:58.846
 Your turn 

00:02:05.814 --> 00:02:06.472
 Wait wait... 

00:02:06.768 --> 00:02:07.911
 ...Does not continue 

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:24.811
 I do not know why they continue. You already know how this ends 

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:25.591
 We will change it
