00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.749
 It is a fact that guarantees of course no one pulls the truth truthfully 

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:10.850
 that today so more sensitive the heat that we are watching from intel 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.610

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.139
 from today that this afternoon being quite cities are not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.689
 the mind which we are already usually watching that it would be southward by 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.390
 example in the state of texas and not to this day we have to monitor that 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.570
 storm that we have in the Chicago area and also the one that had already 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.000
 mentioned storm that we have over the northeast of the country and that could be 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.970
 leaving therefore enough rain especially on the big apple that when the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.140
 rain now let's see a little bit of heat the current temperature at this time

 charge that dsk in 89 degrees where we are most afraid and always behind so and so high 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.360
 in Honduras for example Chilean degrees but with the humidity is going to feel a lot 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.810
 higher at temperature much better temperature in the northeast of the country by 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.380
 example in areas like nahayan 82 but we will have to deal with storms 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.420
 that are mentioning flames the humidity is going to be very very high and it is close to 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.100

 of the temperature combined with humidity 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.159
 retegui fly august every elementary student kolontar the butterfly and go 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.380
 singing the producer would change me nothing 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.620
 the idea was to work to reduce the number of birds as they are 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.420
 this Hellenic government aspect and I still feel valued

 possibility of showers during the day 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.300
