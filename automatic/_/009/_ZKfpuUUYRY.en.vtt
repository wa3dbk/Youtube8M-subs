00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
cut and I taped them together and then

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.840 
cut and I taped them together and then
after<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.050> had<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.500> long<00:00:43.680> piece<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.340> cut<00:00:44.610> them<00:00:44.760> in

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
after I had the long piece I cut them in

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.900 
after I had the long piece I cut them in
half<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.270> six<00:00:45.510> by<00:00:45.690> six<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.829> overlaps<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.760> one

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
half at six by six so it overlaps at one

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.279 
half at six by six so it overlaps at one
inch<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> bottom<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:48.989> inch<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
inch at the bottom and one inch at the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.500 
inch at the bottom and one inch at the
top<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:49.920> an<00:00:50.010> actual<00:00:50.280> four<00:00:50.610> inch<00:00:50.820> ball<00:00:51.149> I

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
top so it's an actual four inch ball I

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.600 
top so it's an actual four inch ball I
thought<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.620> darling<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.430> make

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
thought it was darling and you can make

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.889 
thought it was darling and you can make
them<00:00:53.789> bigger<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> used<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:56.850> use<00:00:57.300> glue<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
them bigger but I used my I use glue and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.299 
them bigger but I used my I use glue and
then<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> glue<00:00:58.289> dots<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.770> hold<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.129> together

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
then the glue dots to hold it together

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.880 
then the glue dots to hold it together
on<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.180> flowers<00:01:00.570> until<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> could<00:01:01.260> hot<00:01:01.469> glue<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
one of them I actually make two just

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.560 
one of them I actually make two just
like<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.439> tags<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> made

like with my tags and this one I made
about<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.049> same<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:34.619> slightly

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
about the same but you're slightly

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:35.600 
about the same but you're slightly
different

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
different

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.039 
different
I<00:01:35.640> used<00:01:36.270> silver<00:01:38.119> leaves<00:01:39.119> instead<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> thought

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
I used silver leaves instead I thought

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.170 
I used silver leaves instead I thought
it<00:01:40.140> was<00:01:40.229> cute<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.070> put<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> red<00:01:41.520> Center<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
it was cute and I put a red Center and I

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.670 
it was cute and I put a red Center and I
did<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> flowers<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> little<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.229> different

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
did the flowers a little bit different

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.789 
did the flowers a little bit different
and<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.420> roping<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and and then it's more of a roping and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.620 
and and then it's more of a roping and
then<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> red<00:01:47.280> jewel<00:01:47.460> at<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> bottom<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.570> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
then a red jewel at the bottom but I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.810 
then a red jewel at the bottom but I
started<00:01:49.049> thinking<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.409> how<00:01:49.590> cool<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.579> would

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
started thinking of how cool this would

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.300 
started thinking of how cool this would
