00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.990
 not 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.870
 hello I'm sandrine otsmane 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.000
 dog and behaviorist educator 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.850
 dogs and cats today we are going 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.250
 see how to prevent our cat from doing 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.110
 his claws on our furniture and that he 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.990
 use the gray fair that is offered to him 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.660
 the fair gates are often misplaced 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.630
 in homes and your cats 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.250
 so choose to mark or on the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.949
 bottom of the furniture on the bottom of your 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.769
 sofas that are as a rule 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.180
 placed in front of an access so be a 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.820
 window or door 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.130
 cat trees are often chosen 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.140
 far too small the ideal is therefore to 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.110
 choose a model big enough that they 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.160
 can stand in front of a window of 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.050
 way that the cat can 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.090
 to settle comfortably on the big 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.129
 plateau and that they can also there 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.710
 have poles so he can 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.559
 mark and make the claw marks 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.450
 Claws are essential for the cat 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.289
 and it's a way for him to score 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.960
 his territory 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.350
 visually also a way of 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.020
 deposit pheromones that he has under his 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.970
 legs and so it's a visual marking 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.200
 and olfactory 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.500
 therefore you should never 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.119
 punished his cat when he does sly no 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.550
 do not do this at all to annoy you 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.410
 or to damage your furniture but it's 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.940
 instinctive for him and that's a 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.569
 behavior that you will not be able to 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.800
 switch off 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.830
 that's why you have to choose 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.360
 adapted objects and place them well 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.890
 in the environment so that the cat 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.959
 can use them 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.240
 some cats will choose to make a 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:41.000
 marking horizontally or at 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.149
 vertical which it can be placed or a 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.440
 armchair you do not want anymore 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.119
 you can place next to the window 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.369
 or a doormat 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.259
 according to the tastes of your next cat 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.860
 the substrates he will choose and his 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.560
 preference 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.239
 if you can not choose a tree to 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.819
 cat but an object must be dedicated to this 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.470
 marking for your cat otherwise it will read 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.849
 do it unfortunately on your furniture 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.300
 or on your sofas 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:10.039
 now you know how to propose to 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.140
 your cat to scratch it 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.239
 pass on your furniture but on 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.709
 objects that will be dedicated to him for more 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.190
 I invite you to 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.800
 watch 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.460
 and the video of how to learn to play 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.460
 with his cat
