00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
contour I'm actually going to use my

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.560 
contour I'm actually going to use my
concealer<00:02:25.560> palette<00:02:26.220> by<00:02:26.610> makeup<00:02:26.640> forever<00:02:27.270> and

use some of the deeper shades as the
contour<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.930> make<00:02:31.110> sure<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.410> blend<00:02:31.680> because

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
contour just make sure you blend because

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.010 
contour just make sure you blend because
sometimes<00:02:32.520> creams<00:02:33.240> can<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> little<00:02:33.810> bit

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
sometimes creams can be a little bit

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.050 
sometimes creams can be a little bit
tricky<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:34.980> really<00:02:35.220> gives<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> nice

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
tricky but it really gives you a nice

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.270 
tricky but it really gives you a nice
contour<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.960> I'll<00:02:37.320> do<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.590> really<00:02:37.890> intense

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
contour and I'll do it really intense

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.000 
contour and I'll do it really intense
first<00:02:39.080> just<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.680> where<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.950> is

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
first just so you can see where it is

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.740 
first just so you can see where it is
but<00:02:41.460> we're<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.820> blend<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.210> out<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.360> don't

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
but we're going to blend it out so don't

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.030 
but we're going to blend it out so don't
worry<00:02:42.960> that's<00:02:43.140> not<00:02:43.380> how<00:02:43.530> I'm<00:02:43.650> going<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.860> leave

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
worry that's not how I'm going to leave

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.340 
worry that's not how I'm going to leave
you<00:02:44.130> looking<00:02:44.510> great<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.540> can<00:02:45.840> relax<00:02:46.110> your

you looking great you can relax your
face<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:48.150> don't<00:02:48.300> want<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.480> go<00:02:48.570> too<00:02:48.630> far<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.140> so

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
face you don't want to go too far in so

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.140 
face you don't want to go too far in so
make<00:02:49.590> sure<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.130> little<00:02:50.730> bit<00:02:50.850> further<00:02:51.060> out

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
make sure it's a little bit further out

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.180 
make sure it's a little bit further out
we<00:02:51.420> say<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.720> two-finger<00:02:52.140> role<00:02:52.500> here<00:02:53.390> okay

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
we say the two-finger role here okay

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.320 
we say the two-finger role here okay
so<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.550> know<00:02:56.580> where<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> jaw<00:02:57.120> bone

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
so now that we know where the jaw bone

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.170 
so now that we know where the jaw bone
is<00:02:57.480> I'm<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.960> blend<00:02:58.200> downwards<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.310> this

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
is I'm going to blend downwards and this

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.300 
is I'm going to blend downwards and this
is<00:03:00.360> basically<00:03:00.630> just<00:03:01.140> making<00:03:01.530> her<00:03:01.680> cheekbones

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
is basically just making her cheekbones

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
stand out a little bit more giving her

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.480 
stand out a little bit more giving her
more<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.160> pop<00:03:05.460> over<00:03:05.820> here<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:07.280> even<00:03:08.280> like

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
more of this pop over here I even like

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.160 
more of this pop over here I even like
to<00:03:08.520> concentrate<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> little<00:03:09.540> bit<00:03:09.690> more<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.080> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
to concentrate a little bit more of the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.580 
to concentrate a little bit more of the
color<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.610> outer<00:03:11.730> part<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.570> let<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.290> fade

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
color to the outer part and let it fade

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.080

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
skin here you can do the same thing and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.870 
skin here you can do the same thing and
it<00:03:36.990> just<00:03:37.230> kind<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.620> makes<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.310> look<00:03:38.490> a<00:03:38.640> little

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
it just kind of makes it look a little

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.490 
it just kind of makes it look a little
firmer

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
firmer

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.780 
firmer
here<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.830> always<00:03:41.130> make<00:03:41.400> sure<00:03:41.640> you're
