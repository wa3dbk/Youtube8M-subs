00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
it was a general color relationship

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.510 
it was a general color relationship
between<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.710> church<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:09.920> here's<00:02:10.369> another

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
between the church and here's another

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.480 
between the church and here's another
one<00:02:10.790> that<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:10.970> also

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.890 

yeah<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.880> it's<00:02:16.970> actually<00:02:17.270> made<00:02:17.450> from<00:02:17.480> some<00:02:17.810> of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
yeah and it's actually made from some of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.680 
yeah and it's actually made from some of
the<00:02:18.080> same<00:02:18.320> replan<00:02:18.980> feet<00:02:19.310> but<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.360> made<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.660> a

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
the same replan feet but I made it a

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.660 
the same replan feet but I made it a
little<00:02:20.780> shorter<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.470> put<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:21.800> little<00:02:22.220> pin

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
little shorter and I put this little pin

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.880 
little shorter and I put this little pin
restore<00:02:23.030> thing<00:02:23.930> on<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.350> bottom<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.680> it

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
restore thing on the bottom of it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.800 
restore thing on the bottom of it
and<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.610> will<00:02:25.910> wear<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.570> really

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
and so I will wear that and I really

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.900 
and so I will wear that and I really
like<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.200> combination<00:02:27.530> because<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.430> has<00:02:28.700> a

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
like that combination because this has a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.660 
like that combination because this has a
focal<00:02:29.600> point<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:30.230> shame<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.100> different

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
focal point the shame of it is different

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.660 
focal point the shame of it is different
and<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:32.840> that's<00:02:33.080> another<00:02:33.260> combination<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.550> I

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
and so that's another combination that I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.350 
and so that's another combination that I
believe<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.030> are

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
believe you are

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.490 
believe you are
so<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.540> haven't<00:02:35.780> think<00:02:35.930> about<00:02:36.140> one<00:02:36.290> with<00:02:36.470> a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
so you haven't think about one with a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.950 
so you haven't think about one with a
pendant<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.040> won<00:02:37.190> just<00:02:37.460> a<00:02:37.700> string<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.600> beads<00:02:38.750> or

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
different links to the pendant will

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.330 
different links to the pendant will
either<00:02:44.150> hang<00:02:44.510> below<00:02:44.960> or<00:02:45.350> above<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.740> other

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
personal survey and I almost look like

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.020 
personal survey and I almost look like
people<00:03:21.350> wait<00:03:21.560> with<00:03:21.770> my<00:03:21.920> Apple<00:03:22.550> is<00:03:22.670> my<00:03:22.820> house

people wait with my Apple is my house

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.180 
people wait with my Apple is my house
and<00:03:23.060> piece<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:24.020> sometimes<00:03:24.320> even<00:03:24.709> wear<00:03:24.860> with

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
and piece of sometimes even wear with

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.310 
and piece of sometimes even wear with
with<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.510> thought<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.840> quite<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.260> few

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
with that and I thought that quite a few

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.600 
with that and I thought that quite a few
different<00:03:27.709> things<00:03:27.739> but<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.400> quite<00:03:28.550> a

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
different things but this is quite a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.850 
different things but this is quite a
casual<00:03:29.150> piece<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:29.750> very<00:03:30.080> casual<00:03:30.560> yes

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
casual piece and this is very casual yes

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.680 
casual piece and this is very casual yes
and<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.280> think<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.670> that<00:03:31.940> sort<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.300> makes<00:03:32.570> it

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
and I think that that sort of makes it

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.780 
and I think that that sort of makes it
work<00:03:32.840> if<00:03:33.110> I'm<00:03:33.320> wearing<00:03:33.770> some<00:03:34.190> tropical<00:03:34.580> color

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
work if I'm wearing some tropical color

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.310 
work if I'm wearing some tropical color

previously mentioned that you wouldn't
normally<00:03:36.410> wear<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:36.860> with<00:03:36.980> this<00:03:37.100> trips<00:03:37.400> now

this<00:03:37.880> piece<00:03:38.120> has<00:03:38.420> got<00:03:38.630> some<00:03:39.230> pearls<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:40.430> some

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
this piece has got some pearls and some

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.900 
this piece has got some pearls and some
sparkly<00:03:41.750> glass<00:03:42.680> babies<00:03:43.160> yeah<00:03:43.550> it's<00:03:43.760> because

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
sparkly glass babies yeah it's because

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.090 
sparkly glass babies yeah it's because
this<00:03:44.270> is<00:03:44.480> more<00:03:44.870> juicy<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:45.739> is<00:03:45.890> way<00:03:46.070> more

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100

this is more juicy and this is way more
casual<00:03:46.790> yeah<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.390> think<00:03:47.570> he<00:03:47.810> could<00:03:48.080> wear<00:03:48.260> it

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.790 
casual yeah I think he could wear it
be<00:03:50.060> much<00:03:50.240> having<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.690> actually<00:03:50.960> works<00:03:51.200> quite

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
be much having it actually works quite

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.830 
be much having it actually works quite
well<00:03:51.830> but<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.430> does<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:53.240> wooden<00:03:53.510> beads<00:03:53.690> are

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
well but it does the wooden beads are

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.420 
well but it does the wooden beads are
probably<00:03:54.140> slightly<00:03:54.710> out<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.100> place

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
probably slightly out of place

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.330 
probably slightly out of place
yes<00:03:55.880> that's<00:03:56.210> how<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.390> feel<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.010> he's<00:03:58.310> not

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.840 
without - also one of these figure out
here<00:04:42.170> is<00:04:42.200> that<00:04:42.410> this<00:04:42.920> interface<00:04:43.280> is<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.700> little

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
here is that this interface is a little

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.160 
here is that this interface is a little
bit<00:04:43.940> chunkier<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.390> different<00:04:44.840> well<00:04:44.930> this<00:04:45.020> is

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
bit chunkier and different well this is

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.680 
bit chunkier and different well this is
finer<00:04:45.410> so<00:04:45.740> it's<00:04:45.860> about<00:04:46.490> once<00:04:47.060> chunky<00:04:47.510> one

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
finer so it's about once chunky one

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.070 
finer so it's about once chunky one
spider<00:04:48.080> go<00:04:48.830> on<00:04:49.550> shorter<00:04:50.210> yeah<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:50.990> know

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
there's some of the elements of
