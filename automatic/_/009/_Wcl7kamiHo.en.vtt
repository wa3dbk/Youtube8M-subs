00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 with a surface of more than 200 meters 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.779
 square and a ceiling height of 4 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.030
 m this purely haussmannian apartment 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.040
 offer great potential but 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.929
 had many defects that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.690
 vincent that of the architect in charge of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.630
 project had to work around this apartment 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.279
 is very dark truce is just no 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.400
 renovation work had been done 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.160
 for at least 40 years the job the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.689
 more important than we realized was about 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.599
 the restructuring of this apartment 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.550
 is the new plan 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.410
 in the first place the only piece giving 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.480
 on the street to change destination 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.360
 become a vast kitchen dining room 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 eat this space was opposite separated 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.450
 in two originally it was two pieces 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.989
 which is a reception rooms 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.039
 only dining room living room 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.610
 corresponding well an apartment 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.100
 Haussmann 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.340
 what is important for us was 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.710
 especially do not do anything 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.379
 imposing solemn 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 despite the proportions of the volumes of 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.630
 create an atmosphere really 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.460
 warm and more contemporary 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.960
 the symbols of Malian bone parquet 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.150
 fireplace moldings were 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.270
 voluntarily preserved and associated with 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.810
 very contemporary furniture 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.359
 to furnish space we drew this 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.640
 very green suspension that comes 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.860
 respond to the large surface of the plan of 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.110
 work a medium that hosts a 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.520
 LED lighting constraints of this 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.710
 apartment is that they are located at 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.299
 ground floor and so we have a 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.240
 visa issue in relation to the 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.950
 street all damn this drawback departure 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.479
 seen frosted glass come break the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.880
 vis-Ã -vis cut off the light 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.590
 but the proximity of the street impose 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.750
 the installation of specific glazing 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.789
 for the safety and comfort of 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.530
 occupants who is desolate of 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.720
 thermal is the green space that we 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.729
 optimizes because we propose a gas 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.920
 argon which is an inert gas rather than 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.110
 of air are even better and with a 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.549
 between the two windows which 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.039
 no longer aluminum who is a man 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.539
 which is a conductive material but which 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.759
 is in what is called in warm edge 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.349
 which is a composite material that him 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.420
 creates the thermal break 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.220
 Then at the sound rang 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.709
 still on a busy street 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.840
 has the advantage of having a very thick life 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.220
 and another less thick one that brings 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.440
 this weakening quality 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.639
 acoustic then third point and there 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.220
 this is especially for the ground floor 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.790
 we are on a self-timer 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.889
 burglary 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.239
 we stick between each layer of ice 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.560
 a movie but he 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.239
 and when we want the case and it does not 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.010
 not break it's still not freak 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.410
 to penetrate in any case we put time 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.120
 so it's his windows have more of 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.370
 cumulate holiday performance 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.989
 today's modern and the type of 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.250
 closing and aesthetics of windows 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.930
 to say they are beautiful windows 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.639
 Haussmanian with a system of 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.470
 closure is said to eagle sheep 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.970
 water circle sheep and eaten by the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.709
 mouth of the water so the two openers 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.310
 interlocking in their effect they have a 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.829
 better outfit 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.930
 the rest of the apartment and series 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.150
 by a huge linear corridor of 33 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.389
 meters that initially prevented the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.239
 natural light to pack so we 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:05.090
 tried to create transparencies with 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.980
 his famous lettering workshop he 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.609
 illuminates the corridor and brings a 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.609
 light second day 1b work we have 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.669
 tried to do it was to create 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:20.230
 volume effects by offsets of 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:22.820
 ceiling partitions with a diversity 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.489
 lighting to animate a little this 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.340
 space avoid seeing a big hallway 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.019
 remain dark kitchens equipped with 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.329
 LEDs alternate with low spots 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.850
 consumption and punctuates this corridor which 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.419
 dessert including an imposing his free 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.790
 this space was created by bringing together two 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:43.489
 old bathrooms and one bedroom 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.660
 and also moving a partition of 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.389
 so that all traces of 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.440
 the Haussmannian have completely disappeared 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:51.549
 and we end up in a space 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.549
 much more contemporary 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.680
 we created this great library on 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.110
 two levels at the black passageway 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.910
 so that brings contrast and 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.069
 that takes the full measure of space 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.170
 so to create a unity in his 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.900
 united pieces 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.250
 we did this false ceiling so that is 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.190
 peeled off the walls with this effect of 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.100
 bright throats but also we have 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.470
 took advantage to isolate with the 10 cm of 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.989
 glass wool that provides insulation to 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.060
 both thermal and acoustic 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.860
 gas heating and collective heating 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.630
 high-inertia steel radiators have 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.710
 replaced the old ones that was no longer 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.690
 adapted in the different rooms of 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.410
 bath tech programmable towel 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.090
 complete this installation at the bottom of 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.690
 the apartment are the rooms 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.210
 children 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.180
 here again the space was wisely 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.350
 times guy so in order to optimize the space 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:52.220
 we created this hut so covered 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:55.270
 of wood that houses a bathroom in 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.680
 which is accessed by the corridor is 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.130
 here in the room with mezzanine of 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.960
 sleeping with his stairs 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.270
 as for the parents' room she has 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.810
 been imagined as a cuckoo entirely 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.810
 our home 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.830
 after one year of studies and works 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.570
 the apartment offers a second life and 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.480
 seems to keep all its promises 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.820
 we arrive and we count on this 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.210
 apartment to create a space 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.660
 family and comfortable bright and very 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.660
 warm
