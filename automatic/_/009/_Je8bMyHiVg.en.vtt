this game takes a long time to level out
I<00:02:57.680> think<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.040> put<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.430> 20<00:02:58.609> plus<00:02:58.970> hours<00:02:59.359> just

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
I think I put like 20 plus hours just

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.599 
I think I put like 20 plus hours just
getting<00:02:59.810> max<00:03:00.049> level<00:03:00.349> in<00:03:00.560> this<00:03:00.680> game<00:03:00.889> and<00:03:01.069> its

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
getting max level in this game and its

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.069 
getting max level in this game and its
really<00:03:01.849> kind<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.180> annoying<00:03:02.450> too<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:02.989> gets

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
really kind of annoying too and it gets

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.449 
really kind of annoying too and it gets
kind<00:03:03.290> of<00:03:03.349> repetitive<00:03:03.560> just<00:03:03.889> to<00:03:03.950> try<00:03:04.129> to<00:03:04.189> do<00:03:04.340> the

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
kind of repetitive just to try to do the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.550 
kind of repetitive just to try to do the
same<00:03:04.579> thing<00:03:04.819> over<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.150> over<00:03:05.329> so<00:03:06.079> much<00:03:06.319> so<00:03:06.530> that

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
same thing over and over so much so that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.319 
same thing over and over so much so that
developers<00:03:06.859> actually<00:03:07.430> decided<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.150> put

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
developers actually decided to put

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.599 
developers actually decided to put
constant<00:03:08.930> double<00:03:09.260> XP<00:03:09.709> in<00:03:09.829> this<00:03:09.980> games<00:03:10.189> just<00:03:10.549> to

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
constant double XP in this games just to

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.399 
constant double XP in this games just to
help<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:11.000> level<00:03:11.239> up<00:03:11.420> faster<00:03:11.900> if<00:03:12.019> there<00:03:12.170> was<00:03:12.290> no

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
help you level up faster if there was no

help you level up faster if there was no
content<00:03:12.799> double<00:03:13.069> XP<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.609> probably<00:03:14.180> would<00:03:14.420> have

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
content double XP I probably would have

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.759 
content double XP I probably would have
stopped<00:03:14.720> playing<00:03:15.049> this<00:03:15.200> game<00:03:15.379> a<00:03:15.439> long<00:03:15.709> time

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
stopped playing this game a long time

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.710 
stopped playing this game a long time
ago<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:16.970> would<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.150> probably<00:03:17.299> took<00:03:17.510> me

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
ago and it would have probably took me

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.319 
ago and it would have probably took me
like<00:03:17.840> 40<00:03:18.379> hours<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:18.859> game<00:03:19.400> time<00:03:19.699> just<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.180> get

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
like 40 hours of game time just to get

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.089 
like 40 hours of game time just to get
through<00:03:20.510> one<00:03:20.720> prestige<00:03:20.959> yikes<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:21.829> can't<00:03:22.040> even

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
through one prestige yikes I can't even

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.400 
through one prestige yikes I can't even
imagine<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:23.480> patients<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.049> people

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
imagine that the patients that people

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.409 
imagine that the patients that people
have<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.650> get<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.129> max<00:03:25.370> prestige<00:03:25.849> in<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.180> game

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
have to get to max prestige in this game

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:27.970 
have to get to max prestige in this game
but<00:03:26.540> I've<00:03:26.660> seen<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> lot<00:03:27.079> of<00:03:27.109> max<00:03:27.349> procedures

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
but I've seen a lot of max procedures

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.890 
but I've seen a lot of max procedures
and<00:03:28.159> I<00:03:28.579> guess<00:03:28.790> people<00:03:28.819> played<00:03:29.329> this<00:03:29.510> game<00:03:29.720> to

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
and I guess people played this game to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.869 
and I guess people played this game to
death<00:03:30.199> literally<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.949> death<00:03:31.159> back<00:03:31.459> in<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.760> day

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
death literally to death back in the day

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.750 
death literally to death back in the day
so<00:03:32.349> that's<00:03:33.349> pretty<00:03:33.530> much<00:03:33.739> like<00:03:33.949> describing

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
so that's pretty much like describing

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.879 
so that's pretty much like describing
how<00:03:35.090> bare-bones<00:03:35.659> this<00:03:35.959> game<00:03:36.169> was<00:03:36.349> back<00:03:36.650> in<00:03:36.859> the

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
how bare-bones this game was back in the

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.640 
how bare-bones this game was back in the
day<00:03:37.099> in<00:03:37.669> terms<00:03:37.909> of<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.120> actual<00:03:38.269> gameplay<00:03:38.750> it's

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
day in terms of the actual gameplay it's

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.140 
day in terms of the actual gameplay it's
pretty<00:03:39.889> good<00:03:40.069> it's<00:03:40.250> pretty<00:03:40.489> decent<00:03:40.940> there's

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
pretty good it's pretty decent there's

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.490 
pretty good it's pretty decent there's
some<00:03:41.389> of<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.629> problems<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:42.199> the<00:03:42.290> game<00:03:42.470> that

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
some of the problems in the game that

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.960 
some of the problems in the game that
actually<00:03:43.010> occurred<00:03:43.250> just<00:03:43.310> from<00:03:43.699> the<00:03:43.819> wii

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
actually occurred just from the wii

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.219 
actually occurred just from the wii
because<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.449> the<00:03:44.510> wii's<00:03:44.690> limited<00:03:45.079> hardware

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
because of the wii's limited hardware

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.439 
because of the wii's limited hardware
and<00:03:45.709> there's<00:03:46.129> other<00:03:46.340> problems<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.209> game

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
and there's other problems in the game

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:48.969 
and there's other problems in the game
in<00:03:47.690> my<00:03:47.840> opinion<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:48.290> just<00:03:48.560> come<00:03:48.709> from<00:03:48.829> the

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 
in my opinion that just come from the

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.069 
in my opinion that just come from the
nature<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.519> game<00:03:49.669> itself<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:50.449> when<00:03:51.049> I

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
nature of the game itself so when I

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.479 
nature of the game itself so when I
talked<00:03:51.319> about<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.590> limitations<00:03:52.010> of<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.370> wii

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
talked about the limitations of the wii

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.819 
talked about the limitations of the wii
hardware<00:03:52.940> i'm<00:03:53.299> saying<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.840> gameplay<00:03:54.349> it<00:03:54.620> kind

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
hardware i'm saying the gameplay it kind

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.469

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980

as I do especially when I'm playing this
game<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.910> that's<00:04:51.090> like<00:04:51.270> one<00:04:51.600> aspect<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.230> the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
game that's really annoying also too

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.580 
game that's really annoying also too
because<00:04:54.330> it's<00:04:54.450> only<00:04:54.540> four<00:04:54.870> before<00:04:55.050> again<00:04:55.470> the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
because it's only four before again the

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.350 
because it's only four before again the
gameplay<00:04:56.040> is<00:04:56.160> really<00:04:56.190> slow<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:56.910> game<00:04:57.120> gets

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
gameplay is really slow the game gets

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.570 
gameplay is really slow the game gets
dragged<00:04:57.780> out<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.650> good<00:04:58.860> majority<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.370> the
