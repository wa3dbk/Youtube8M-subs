00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.500
 a car that 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.720
 design and design 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.330
 a car that is on the circuit just like that 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.190
 feels like home on the road once this was 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 a dream for alfa romeo 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.650
 but now there is the alpha romeo 4c 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.990
 a 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.940
 the alpha romeo 4c 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.460
 and car that for alfa romeo whole 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.290
 important of this car is on 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.519
 the start of a new alpha series 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.890
 romeos 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.260
 a car with a total were weight 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.079
 of eight 195 kilos 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.920
 roadworthy a car that is less than 4 meters 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.260
 is tall 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.820
 2 meters wide and one hundred eighteen 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.629
 centimeters high 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.629
 that is very promising 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.170
 there we are in the alpha romeo 4c 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.030
 a car that is built really up 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.130
 weight saving 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.590
 as a manufacturer you can choose to use nuts 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.330
 build with a lot of power 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.760
 but you can also choose it 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.070
 lightweight sports car and that 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.360
 is what you have already done here 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.890
 marije him 4c that roadworthy night 195 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.850
 weighs pounds 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.880
 that has a capacity of 240 hp that 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.090
 by the 1750 tbi engine 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.720
 that is a four-cylinder turbo engine 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.510
 you deliver 240 and have 350 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.240
 newton meter torque 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.980
 due to the low car weight sprint I had 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.120
 zero to one hundred and four to a half 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.600
 second 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:58.310
 and has a top speed of 258 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.119
 yes well they have that low but gone then 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.430
 to achieve 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.860
 the car is built from a carbon 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.470
 monocoque that is the basis of this car 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.119
 thereto is stuck to an aluminum 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.549
 subframe 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.640
 yes that is just nice actually everything in it 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.980
 this car is either carbon or van 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.900
 aluminum or plastic 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.670
 have that mill been placed short it 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.349
 subframe with which 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.900
 and therefore they do so simply 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.450
 the plastic that has the entire frame built in 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.299
 805 life not nice to just indicate 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.659
 how light that is well that is lighter as 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.659
 a fiat panda 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.640
 240 hp and then you have hp 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.750
 weight ratio of less than four 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.750
 kilo per hp 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.719
 the on which something it also becomes enough 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:54.540
 alfa romeo builds a lightweight 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:56.010
 sports car and that is not only full of you 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.260
 but in trains 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.780
 but you can see that it really did 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.540
 outside and inside from the start 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.550
 that car built with the idea that car 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.410
 should be as light as possible being 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.020
 from outside so I am a crazy spoilers 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.260
 on things that are not functional but 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.580
 do bring weight from 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.320
 persia 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.020
 basically not you have a piece 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.600
 another one with street flippers 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.490
 we have air conditioning and a simple one 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.370
 small radio but it also keeps 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.820
 at on it is a really a car that is 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.370
 built on the lines no more than that 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.590
 and if you have that idea that car 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.970
 You also just get a little tired and that is 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.970
 also not so crazy that this car has none 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.970
 power steering 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.750
 mother nature is actually the one 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.459
 kind of kind 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.780
 car that goes back in time 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.780
 nowadays we have electric 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.970
 systems that drive it actually 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.460
 simplify 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.950
 except tights we don't want that 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.410
 the customers of us who want cars there 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.610
 that really needs to be grabbed and 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.610
 that is this 4c 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.389
 all very nice on paper 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.489
 it leaves you too 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.249
 lightweight sports car with a fast 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.650
 engine becomes just as much performance and 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:29.490
 deliver driving pleasure like a whole car 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.259
 other eyes that is a bit heavier now 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.960
 question is of course whether that is in it 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.210
 drive from the Alfa Romeo 4C also not 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.520
 confirmed is teams that are just as sporty 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.470
 as 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.590
 I just do the original 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.009
 yes that is that this is really a spartan 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.219
 sporty car 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.219
 crazy 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.610
 are you really going like a crazy little one 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.260
 sports car 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.520
 and that is exactly what we what me you 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.520
 images and real 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:02.269
 that is hard to drive well that is 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.069
 which you definitely have to really be in the beginning 

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:05.889
 get used to it because he has one 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:09.009
 center motor with rear-wheel drive 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:12.460
 somewhat heavy on the back 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.770
 nellie weel is what you are up to 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.100
 need a row with you not the nicest 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.720
 is almost the look up 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.210
 mail 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.060
 before mussel 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.610
 and I motor 60s it lives here 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.400
 behind you really insane 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.400
 driving experience escort who just 10 points 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.030
 a 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.740
 well who buy his car well 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.120
 a gadget for customers 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.540
 who are in possession of, for example 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.850
 buy half a romeo 8c so tse 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.140
 for it nice to occasionally nice to finish 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.580
 and to ride along 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.890
 and he really is a tad 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.590
 exclusive to my half romeo 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.900
 a limited edition every year where you 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.940
 just 100 pieces a year and that is 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.700
 not because they no longer want or cannot 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.640
 sell because the question is whether there is for sure 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.950
 but that's because building that 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.130
 carbon monocoque throughout the car 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.560
 is labor intensive and saves a lot of money 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.370
 so they said 35 100 pieces per 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.270
 year 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.270
 and we have to deal with it 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.200
 Yes 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.080
 alfa romeo has put a price on it 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.689
 of just under 60 thousands 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.110
 I think that positioning is very good 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:45.409
 we have done a car that very much 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:49.580
 offers sportiness that is exclusive 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:51.620
 seemed an engine that lives and delicious 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.060
 blood really and experiences with your 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.849
 strawberries 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.939
 that from 60 million 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.939
 but 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:05.660
 I like peeing but I am still going now 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.660
 just steer with a car 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.330
 very narrow and b 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.949
 handling 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.949
 and all with that thing
