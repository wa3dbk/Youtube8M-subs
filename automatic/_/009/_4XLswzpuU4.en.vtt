00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.420
 how about election people you would notice the 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.580
 health to gilberto once again today we are going to 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.010
 talk about rhythmic illusions is when 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.719
 we are playing a rhythm and it seems that 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.630
 we are touching others then imagine 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.309
 we're at a rate of 4x4 to a 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.580
 tempo at a specific speed 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.460
 and suddenly change the way 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.980
 that we are playing the drums and gives the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.689
 feeling that the pace has changed is 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.119
 has accelerated or slowed 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.980
 but in reality we are still in four 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.230
 four or four quarters like some 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.390
 they also call 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.700
 how do we do this, let's see the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.800
 two exercises 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.600
 there are many ways to touch it but these 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.850
 are two of those that I can share 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.160
 with you for the moment 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.110
 in the first exercise we are going to say that 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.930
 we have a speed of 140 ppm 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.670
 approximately the metronome now for 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.890
 understand it 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:01.420
 we are playing a rhythm of 444 it would be 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.420
 we feel the pulse in the first place 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.500
 we carry 23 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:14.570
 youtube for youtube back to back to 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:20.180
 back to back to back to back to back 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.250
 back to back to back to back to the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.690
 impact 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.180
 you to you you to you to your grave the subject 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.490
 here is who 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.550
 what are we doing square of 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.250
 suddenly it becomes something to three 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.800
 sealed 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.810
 that is to say 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:53.330
 We are the point 23 and 23 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:57.300
 23 23 23 23 and 23 and 23 and 23 42 34 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.490
 I remember then we used in the case 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.650
 from this example we are going to use the hi 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.460
 hat as a reference to maintain that 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.610
 continuous pulse of 4x4 is going to be our 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.680
 guide for the rest of the battery of the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.470
 tips the bass drum or the box and the 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.620
 agreement dish let's go there I hope that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620
 understand it 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.680
 i 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.040
 to 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.129
 Y 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.360
 ok in the second exercise we're going to do 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.120
 something similar only that instead of 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.890
 slow it down which is the feeling of 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.360
 that the pace is slower let's give 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.040
 the feeling that the rhythm has 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.590
 accelerated but we are still in the same 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.620
 pulse according here the metronome what 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.690
 set at 112 ppm 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.750
 and it would be something like this 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:33.720
 why 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:33.720
 for this 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.970
 you 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.560
 worth this exercise a little easier 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.210
 the other at least I find it 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.060
 that way when we can apply 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.280
 this when we are in only one of 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.310
 battery or when we are in some 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.260
 progressive rock style fusion song 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.500
 in which we want to give a color 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.230
 different and good that kind of tricks 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.800
 use to give a little more life to 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.800
 our battery 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.349
 good if you liked the exercise 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:16.870
 I hope you like me down here 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:19.180
 they share the video they comment and they 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.259
 subscribe to my channel greetings to all 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.259
 thank you very much see you next
