thing<00:02:59.780> looks<00:03:00.620> like<00:03:00.859> I<00:03:01.160> might<00:03:01.519> have<00:03:01.700> used<00:03:02.120> to

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
thing looks like I might have used to

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.470 
thing looks like I might have used to
bena<00:03:02.799> if<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.920> price<00:03:04.190> tag<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.519> it's<00:03:04.819> under<00:03:05.120> this

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
bena if a price tag and it's under this

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.190 
bena if a price tag and it's under this
plastic<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:07.310> this<00:03:07.549> might<00:03:07.790> be<00:03:07.870> not<00:03:08.870> be<00:03:09.079> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
plastic so this might be not be the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.690 
plastic so this might be not be the
original<00:03:09.350> classic<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.880> was<00:03:11.030> wrapped<00:03:11.299> in<00:03:12.700> so

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
