something one of question yet and then

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.469 
something one of question yet and then
this<00:01:27.159> is<00:01:27.340> like<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.610> quiz<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:28.090> know<00:01:28.149> based<00:01:28.330> on

this is like the quiz you know based on

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.300 
this is like the quiz you know based on
the<00:01:28.539> video<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.020> let's<00:01:29.200> say<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.740> picked<00:01:30.220> the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
the video so let's say I picked the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.700 
the video so let's say I picked the
wrong<00:01:30.460> answer<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.030> see<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.240> puff<00:01:32.140> of<00:01:32.229> smoke<00:01:32.380> and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
wrong answer you see a puff of smoke and

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.960 
wrong answer you see a puff of smoke and
you<00:01:32.740> hear<00:01:32.950> an<00:01:33.070> echo<00:01:33.369> coming<00:01:33.759> from<00:01:33.850> the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
you hear an echo coming from the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.580 
you hear an echo coming from the
computer<00:01:34.360> we<00:01:34.479> all<00:01:34.600> know<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.840> answer<00:01:35.140> is<00:01:35.380> that

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
computer we all know the answer is that

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.859 
computer we all know the answer is that
it<00:01:35.799> was<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.880> jail<00:01:37.149> for<00:01:37.330> nearly<00:01:37.539> three

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
it was a in jail for nearly three

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.080 
it was a in jail for nearly three
decades<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.429> kid<00:01:39.580> wins<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.880> balloon

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
decades and so the kid wins a balloon

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.930 
decades and so the kid wins a balloon
from<00:01:40.330> that<00:01:40.569> although<00:01:41.170> he<00:01:41.350> lost<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:42.850> the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
from that although he lost one of the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.059 
from that although he lost one of the
three<00:01:43.179> stars<00:01:43.509> there<00:01:43.929> in<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.409> grading<00:01:44.649> system

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
three stars there in the grading system

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.760 
three stars there in the grading system
and<00:01:45.550> then<00:01:46.300> it<00:01:46.390> goes<00:01:46.539> on<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:46.929> you<00:01:46.990> can<00:01:47.020> develop

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
and then it goes on so you can develop

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.419 
and then it goes on so you can develop
this<00:01:47.890> content<00:01:48.429> in<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:49.659> fashion<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:51.280> this

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
this content in this fashion and this

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.100 
this content in this fashion and this
isn't<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:52.060> like<00:01:52.270> an<00:01:52.390> instructor<00:01:52.840> would<00:01:52.960> put

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
isn't that like an instructor would put

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.649 
isn't that like an instructor would put
together<00:01:53.319> for<00:01:53.470> his<00:01:53.619> or<00:01:53.800> her<00:01:53.950> own<00:01:54.100> class<00:01:54.659> but

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
together for his or her own class but

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:56.910 
together for his or her own class but
