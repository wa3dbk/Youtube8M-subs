00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.930 

stop<00:03:05.000> screw<00:03:05.420> out<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.470> get<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.579> reverse

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
stop screw out to the get the reverse

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.130 
stop screw out to the get the reverse
knob<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:12.320> whole<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.620> cam<00:03:13.070> runs<00:03:14.140> assembly

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
knob and this whole a cam runs assembly

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.890 
knob and this whole a cam runs assembly
for<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.130> feed<00:03:16.340> trip<00:03:16.700> bracket<00:03:17.239> right<00:03:17.600> over

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
for the feed trip bracket right over

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.460 
for the feed trip bracket right over
here

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
here

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.680 
here
so<00:03:19.459> this<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.030> reverse<00:03:20.420> knob<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:21.260> has<00:03:21.470> one

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
so this is the reverse knob that has one

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.640 
so this is the reverse knob that has one
two<00:03:23.690> three<00:03:24.760> places<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.349> so<00:03:27.349> this<00:03:27.440> whole

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
two three places in it so this whole

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.120 
two three places in it so this whole
thing<00:03:27.680> is

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
thing is

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.530 
thing is
