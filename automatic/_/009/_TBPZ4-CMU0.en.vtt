00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.500 
it goes on anything from in the bucket
she's<00:02:48.620> kind<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.010> retarded<00:02:49.519> but<00:02:50.000> anyway<00:02:50.299> I

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
she's kind of retarded but anyway I

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.000 
she's kind of retarded but anyway I
don't<00:02:50.900> know<00:02:51.110> why<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.260> would<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.769> for<00:02:51.890> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
don't know why I would up for the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.280 
don't know why I would up for the
hydraulic<00:02:52.580> fam<00:02:52.819> so<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.629> a<00:02:53.660> really<00:02:54.080> tough

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
hydraulic fam so this is a really tough

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.890 
hydraulic fam so this is a really tough
one<00:02:54.349> usually<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.610> fun<00:02:55.879> we<00:02:56.030> run<00:02:56.299> my<00:02:56.480> electric

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
one usually a fun we run my electric

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.589 
one usually a fun we run my electric
motor<00:02:57.110> this<00:02:57.410> one<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:58.209> hydraulic<00:02:59.209> from<00:02:59.450> the

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
motor this one is hydraulic from the

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.490 
motor this one is hydraulic from the
power<00:02:59.810> steering<00:03:00.260> pump<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
power steering pump and this is the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.400 
power steering pump and this is the
exact<00:03:03.890> reason<00:03:04.250> why<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.400> didn't<00:03:04.640> like<00:03:04.760> it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
exact reason why I didn't like it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.000 
exact reason why I didn't like it
because<00:03:06.410> if<00:03:06.620> we<00:03:06.680> have<00:03:06.769> our<00:03:06.920> problem<00:03:08.650> no<00:03:09.650> just

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
because if we have our problem no just

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.470 
because if we have our problem no just
smooth<00:03:10.430> more<00:03:10.880> problems<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.540> occur<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:13.480> that's

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
smooth more problems to occur so that's

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.530 
smooth more problems to occur so that's
what<00:03:14.660> I'll<00:03:14.720> be<00:03:14.750> working<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.230> today
