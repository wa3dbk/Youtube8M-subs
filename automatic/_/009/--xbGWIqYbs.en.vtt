people<00:02:20.760> here<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.270> gold<00:02:21.690> change<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.440> just

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
people here and gold change is just

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.650 
people here and gold change is just
happening<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.580> rapidly<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.360> think<00:02:24.569> it's

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
happening so rapidly and I think it's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.940 
happening so rapidly and I think it's
because<00:02:24.750> everyone's<00:02:25.170> becoming<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:25.769> much<00:02:25.830> more

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
because everyone's becoming so much more

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.449 
because everyone's becoming so much more
aware<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.790> conscious<00:02:27.569> about<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.500> know<00:02:28.650> that

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
aware and conscious about you know that

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.949 
aware and conscious about you know that
things<00:02:29.790> do<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:29.970> need<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.209> change<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.780> if

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
things do you need to change and that if

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.290 
things do you need to change and that if
all<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.380> us<00:02:31.769> are<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.069> part<00:02:32.459> of<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.700> has<00:02:32.940> happened
