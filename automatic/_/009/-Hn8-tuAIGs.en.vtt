00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.210
 because Jens and believe new bike for me, there are at first glance 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.619
 like a flash picture Metz 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.109
 Reason at the moment but exactly know that we spend with Dr 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.999
 Developer of this way 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.329
 our matches 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.279
 were you the changes to the stands grows 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.419
 So at first it actually looks like only the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.470
 Paint changed at second glance but you can see that is 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.070
 my whole 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.860
 It has changed a lot 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.260
 not just my time Carter the key 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.710
 In fact, one track percent that is super it is super when built as

 the tax position 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.610
 but also many adjustment options 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.600
 Who took over the Speed ​​Wax we also about the DDR updates 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.200
 the OGH and so on because the wheel yes 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.290
 really hard work for many years but that should be the selection 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.510
 ends strongly reinforced 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.520
 so that you can use another village force in the market with ner 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.500
 other translation can work 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.560
 also 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.800
 Of course this offers the possibility 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.260
 the wheelbase 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.290
 still individually to adjust so that one 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.750
 that can really vote on its alliance 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.290
 As far as material is concerned, we deliberately chose aluminum 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.160
 It does not always have to be now 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.060
 many professionals can Boonen but on the train brings no one 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.320
 decisive advantage actually

 that is father wishes

 you do not have to 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.860
 to that extent 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.499
 because the material is also very robust

 we can of course compete in the mass competitions
