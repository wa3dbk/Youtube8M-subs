00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.650 

my<00:00:05.190> inspiration<00:00:05.940> was<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.899> modern<00:00:07.859> cottage

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
my inspiration was a modern cottage

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.499 
my inspiration was a modern cottage
which<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.840> course<00:00:09.870> means<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:11.000> medium<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.210> small

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
which of course means a medium to small

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.760 
which of course means a medium to small
kitchen<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:14.059> for<00:00:15.059> me<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.330> was<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.480> natural<00:00:16.320> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
kitchen and for me it was a natural to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.260 
kitchen and for me it was a natural to
consider<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.119> use<00:00:18.859> Scandinavian<00:00:19.859> design

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
consider and use Scandinavian design

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.740 
consider and use Scandinavian design

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
because it is so such a flexible you can

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.490 
because it is so such a flexible you can
nudge<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.699> many<00:00:26.699> different<00:00:27.119> ways<00:00:27.390> toward<00:00:28.080> very

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
nudge it many different ways toward very

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.849
