above-ground hell maybe I je cache Lou
that's<00:00:20.580> me<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:21.420> man-made<00:00:21.859> follow<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.130> glow

that's me it's man-made follow the glow
stone<00:00:23.580> road<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> guys<00:00:25.730> this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.060> like<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
stone road so guys this is like a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.999 
stone road so guys this is like a
massive<00:00:28.680> massive<00:00:29.310> project<00:00:30.769> artificial<00:00:31.769> hell

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
massive massive project artificial hell

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.580 
massive massive project artificial hell
and<00:00:32.540> this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.719> proof<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.230> not<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and this is just proof it's not the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.459 
and this is just proof it's not the
actual<00:00:35.040> nether<00:00:35.399> there's<00:00:35.760> water<00:00:36.050> ice<00:00:37.050> over

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
actual nether there's water ice over

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.660 
actual nether there's water ice over
there<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:43.200> took<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.500> ver<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.219> took<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
there and so this took a ver this took a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.430 
there and so this took a ver this took a
very<00:00:44.879> long<00:00:44.969> time<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> build<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.020> still<00:00:46.289> not

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
very long time to build it's still not

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.889 
very long time to build it's still not
done<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> would<00:00:47.940> appreciate<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.690> because

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
done but I would appreciate it because

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.510 
done but I would appreciate it because
of<00:00:49.079> how<00:00:49.350> long<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> took<00:00:49.890> me<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> would

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
of how long it took me if you would

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.529 
of how long it took me if you would
leave<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> rating<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.750> comments<00:00:52.640> yeah<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
leave like a rating or comments yeah so

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:14.810 
leave like a rating or comments yeah so
let's<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.960> continue<00:00:55.140> following<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.039> road

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.630 

enjoy<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.030> scenery<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.659> mean<00:01:17.020> it<00:01:17.799> I<00:01:18.159> have<00:01:18.460> to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
enjoy the scenery I mean it I have to

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.010 
enjoy the scenery I mean it I have to
say<00:01:18.819> it's<00:01:19.000> pretty<00:01:19.299> cool<00:01:19.569> I<00:01:19.899> think<00:01:20.289> and<00:01:22.020> my

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
say it's pretty cool I think and my

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.660 
say it's pretty cool I think and my
render<00:01:23.350> distance<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.920> on<00:01:24.069> normal<00:01:24.460> it's

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
render distance is on normal it's

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.580 
render distance is on normal it's
actually<00:01:25.060> much<00:01:25.240> much<00:01:26.229> bigger<00:01:26.500> than<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
actually much much bigger than this so

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.949 
actually much much bigger than this so
there's<00:01:30.130> much<00:01:30.340> bigger<00:01:30.700> parts<00:01:31.450> of<00:01:31.569> chip<00:01:31.780> that

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
there's much bigger parts of chip that

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.830 
there's much bigger parts of chip that
my<00:01:32.200> render<00:01:32.530> distance<00:01:32.560> is<00:01:33.130> on<00:01:33.280> normal<00:01:33.729> so<00:01:34.479> not

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
my render distance is on normal so not

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
my render distance is on normal so not
far<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:36.069> that<00:01:36.250> we<00:01:36.429> can<00:01:36.670> have<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.450> pretty<00:01:38.380> fluent

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
far so that we can have a pretty fluent

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.600 
far so that we can have a pretty fluent
game<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.420> not<00:01:40.720> have<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.049> very<00:01:41.500> laggy<00:01:41.770> but<00:01:42.159> yeah

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
game and not have it very laggy but yeah

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.510 
game and not have it very laggy but yeah
so<00:01:43.209> yeah<00:01:43.599> the<00:01:43.869> ceiling<00:01:44.319> there's<00:01:45.009> just<00:01:45.189> it's

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
so yeah the ceiling there's just it's

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.419 
so yeah the ceiling there's just it's
just<00:01:45.670> some<00:01:46.060> massive<00:01:46.630> structures<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.829> nether

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
just some massive structures of nether

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.870 
just some massive structures of nether
rock<00:01:48.819> I<00:01:49.239> did<00:01:49.659> use<00:01:49.840> hacks<00:01:50.200> but<00:01:51.039> it<00:01:51.310> still<00:01:51.579> took<00:01:51.759> a

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
rock I did use hacks but it still took a

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:22.780 
rock I did use hacks but it still took a
very<00:01:52.090> long<00:01:52.209> time<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:53.799> know<00:01:53.829> place<00:01:54.819> these

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.839 

yeah<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.719> does<00:02:24.049> not<00:02:24.230> cut<00:02:24.680> off<00:02:24.860> right<00:02:25.280> over<00:02:25.400> here

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
yeah it does not cut off right over here

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.630 
yeah it does not cut off right over here
it's<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.230> my<00:02:27.709> render<00:02:28.069> distance<00:02:28.099> is

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
it's just that on my render distance is

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.309 
it's just that on my render distance is
on<00:02:28.790> my<00:02:28.909> loops<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:30.709> oh<00:02:30.769> okay<00:02:34.989> yeah<00:02:35.989> I'm<00:02:36.140> going

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
on my loops that oh okay yeah I'm going

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.990 
on my loops that oh okay yeah I'm going
I<00:02:36.590> haven't<00:02:36.920> made<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.189> path<00:02:37.430> yet<00:02:37.730> but<00:02:37.909> I'm

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
I haven't made this path yet but I'm

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.170 
I haven't made this path yet but I'm
going<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.650> there's<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.890> caverns<00:02:40.430> over<00:02:40.970> there

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
going to there's the caverns over there

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.599 
going to there's the caverns over there
it's<00:02:41.450> extend<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:42.409> much<00:02:42.560> farther<00:02:42.859> there's

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
it's extend for much farther there's

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.819 
it's extend for much farther there's
here's<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.329> lava<00:02:44.569> lake<00:02:44.840> over<00:02:45.260> there<00:02:45.439> you<00:02:45.709> know

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
here's the lava lake over there you know

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.670 
here's the lava lake over there you know
you<00:02:45.890> saw<00:02:46.189> it<00:02:46.430> earlier<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.989> yeah<00:02:48.879> so<00:02:49.879> um<00:02:50.680> tell

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
or something does this look like the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:06.629 
or something does this look like the
actual<00:02:59.090> nether<00:02:59.299> except<00:02:59.930> for<00:02:59.959> that<00:03:00.109> gravel

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.500 

just<00:03:07.639> some<00:03:07.819> cool<00:03:08.120> nether<00:03:08.389> rock<00:03:08.689> formations<00:03:09.560> in

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
just some cool nether rock formations in

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:24.960 
just some cool nether rock formations in
some<00:03:11.510> fava

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.760 

it<00:03:25.970> actually<00:03:26.240> extends<00:03:26.870> for<00:03:27.080> much<00:03:27.410> farther

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
it actually extends for much farther

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.640 
it actually extends for much farther
back<00:03:28.130> there<00:03:28.490> but<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.090> haven't<00:03:30.080> built<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.380> path

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
back there but I haven't built the path

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.740 
back there but I haven't built the path
there<00:03:30.890> yet<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.310> probably<00:03:31.700> will<00:03:31.970> know<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:32.480> video

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
there yet I probably will know the video

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.960 
there yet I probably will know the video
this<00:03:33.380> one's<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.710> going<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.220> explore<00:03:34.670> like
