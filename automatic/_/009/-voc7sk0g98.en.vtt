00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.250
 before you today for you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.080
 present three hairstyle ideas in fact 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.660
 blur bun so three bun bun 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.889
 different you'll see it's 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.210
 really very very simple you have 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.910
 just need a rubber band and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.220
 some round pliers are flat 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.539
 so we will start by taking this 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.570
 part of hair and make a tail 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.890
 very low so that can be the style of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.810
 perfect hairstyle if you want to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.970
 hiding a little bit your will include this 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.699
 you will be fine 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.880
 so you take the elastic is actually 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.290
 you do not finish to see you do not 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.059
 end up you do two rounds or 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.160
 more depending on your width 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.230
 other elastic and will not finish 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.450
 then you will take tongs and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.059
 you 're actually going to fix it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.280
 made shots and that you feel like so 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 you take the pins either flat or 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.120
 round and you set must ask this 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.730
 feel like it's okay so 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.129
 then I'll go out a little bit and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 continue to fix it you really have to 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.280
 this kind of hairstyle hold all the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.280
 day so do not hesitate 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.149
 so I decided to leave some 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.380
 wicks on the front you can very 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.570
 well if you have a frank do 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.789
 like where we pray we do not leave anything 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.810
 all so here is the first result of 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.340
 the first hairstyle bun hairy bah 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.929
 I hope you like it 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.640
 now so to the second hairstyle 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.469
 this time we will take a little bit 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.530
 will do a little this method 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:36.219
 but this time on the side so we do 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:39.970
 a tail that we do not finish and we take 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.979
 the hair that exceeds a little to in 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.319
 does somehow surround 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.819
 elastic and cash and especially so 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.759
 then take a small flat- nose pliers 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.500
 is attached this part precisely who 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.090
 will hide the elastic as usual 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.739
 loosen a little I really like them 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.780
 hairstyles that will not be too strict 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:02:00.610
 so you see it award a little 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.829
 do not hesitate it will immediately give 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.780
 at a r I would say well capped but everything 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.860
 by remaining natural we will draw you 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.860
 do it in two stages 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:19.480
 here is the result of the second hairstyle 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.280
 so a bun blurred on the side and 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.560
 finally let's go to the latest hairstyle 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.450
 so here we are going to make a fuzzy bun in 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.760
 height so we'll take the whole 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.190
 hair and we will proceed exactly 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.930
 in the same way we make a tail like 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.290
 do not finish and we take the hair that 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.050
 hangs around the elastic band 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.870
 so do that I 'll go again not 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.220
 not too scripted do not hesitate to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.900
 leave some hair tee that exceeds 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.270
 I think it's even prettier 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.270
 so take bars is attached the whole thing 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.420
 look well at them in front of two 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.870
 behind if you have a mirror like 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.870
 behind me 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.150
 and that's fine-tuning 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.280
 so I decided to put a little 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.410
 accessors so a little white flower 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.790
 in my case, it's nice to be in winter 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.670
 I still like accessory vinet me 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.380
 headdress eyes anyway we'll be soon 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.330
 in winter so here is the result of the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.310
 last hairstyle so there I just 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.500
 tied their little wick for that it's 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.540
 to it made I wanted and here are the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.530
 results 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.330
 I hope all three of these hairstyle 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.650
 we will have more than they are simple 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.900

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.450
