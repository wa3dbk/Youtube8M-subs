now going to take you through the steps
and<00:00:51.899> how<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.670> installed<00:00:53.670> our<00:00:53.850> air<00:00:54.149> hose<00:00:54.360> reel

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
and how we installed our air hose reel

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.569 
and how we installed our air hose reel
on<00:00:54.899> our<00:00:55.110> mounting<00:00:55.500> bracket<00:00:55.949> which<00:00:56.550> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
on our mounting bracket which is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.139 
on our mounting bracket which is
installed<00:00:57.090> into<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:58.050> studs<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> wall<00:00:59.149> we

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
installed into two studs in the wall we

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.580 
installed into two studs in the wall we
cut<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> mounting<00:01:00.960> template<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
cut out the mounting template and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.100 
cut out the mounting template and
centered<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> mounting<00:01:03.000> bracket<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
centered it on the mounting bracket the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.200 
centered it on the mounting bracket the
next<00:01:04.409> step<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.040> use<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> center<00:01:05.549> punch<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
next step is to use a center punch to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.100 
next step is to use a center punch to
mark<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> drill<00:01:06.780> spots

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.510 

we've<00:01:14.110> drilled<00:01:14.439> our<00:01:14.590> holes<00:01:14.799> in<00:01:15.070> our<00:01:15.189> mounting

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
we've drilled our holes in our mounting

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.039 
we've drilled our holes in our mounting
bracket<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.060> now<00:01:16.390> we're<00:01:16.570> ready<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.840> install

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
bracket and now we're ready to install

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.100 
bracket and now we're ready to install
it<00:01:17.409> on<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.649> wall<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:19.600> choosing<00:01:20.020> the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
it on the wall when choosing the

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.380 
it on the wall when choosing the
location<00:01:20.399> remember<00:01:21.399> that<00:01:21.579> the<00:01:21.670> air<00:01:21.820> hose<00:01:22.060> reel

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
location remember that the air hose reel

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.389 
location remember that the air hose reel
can<00:01:22.720> only<00:01:22.930> be<00:01:23.170> mounted<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.799> a<00:01:23.920> load-bearing

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
can only be mounted to a load-bearing

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.340 
can only be mounted to a load-bearing
structure<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.600> can<00:01:25.750> support<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.170> weight<00:01:26.320> of

structure that can support the weight of

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.919 
structure that can support the weight of
the<00:01:26.679> air<00:01:26.799> hose<00:01:27.009> reel<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:28.240> force<00:01:28.479> applied

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
the air hose reel and the force applied

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.340 
the air hose reel and the force applied
to<00:01:29.049> it<00:01:29.350> when<00:01:29.679> in<00:01:29.830> use<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:31.329> our<00:01:31.479> workshop<00:01:31.810> we

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
to it when in use for our workshop we

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.069 
to it when in use for our workshop we
have<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.250> install<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.970> air<00:01:34.090> hose<00:01:34.299> reel<00:01:34.570> into

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
have to install the air hose reel into

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.859 
have to install the air hose reel into
drywall<00:01:35.710> so<00:01:36.460> we<00:01:36.579> created<00:01:36.909> this<00:01:37.119> bracket<00:01:37.689> to

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
drywall so we created this bracket to

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.090 
drywall so we created this bracket to
span<00:01:38.860> two<00:01:39.310> studs<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.740> support<00:01:42.009> the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
span two studs so it can support the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.309 
span two studs so it can support the
weight<00:01:42.429> of<00:01:42.459> the<00:01:42.670> air<00:01:43.060> hose<00:01:43.270> reel<00:01:45.929> pre<00:01:46.929> install
