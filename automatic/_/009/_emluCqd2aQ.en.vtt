the<00:00:22.090> current<00:00:22.300> camera<00:00:22.689> state<00:00:23.109> so<00:00:24.070> I<00:00:24.490> figured

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
the current camera state so I figured

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.820 
the current camera state so I figured
out<00:00:25.359> how<00:00:25.449> to<00:00:25.509> change<00:00:25.839> something<00:00:26.050> right<00:00:26.349> so<00:00:26.589> I

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
so basically give you a two point three

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.280 
so basically give you a two point three
megabyte<00:01:35.710> file<00:01:36.100> approximately<00:01:37.170> normal<00:01:38.170> will

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
megabyte file approximately normal will

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.170 
megabyte file approximately normal will
give<00:01:38.409> you<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.530> four<00:01:38.770> point<00:01:39.040> seven<00:01:39.340> megabyte<00:01:39.909> and

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
give you a four point seven megabyte and

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.120 
give you a four point seven megabyte and
then<00:01:40.360> fine<00:01:40.689> which<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.079> what<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.259> usually<00:01:41.470> use<00:01:41.829> is

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
then fine which is what I usually use is

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.480 
then fine which is what I usually use is
a<00:01:42.189> nine<00:01:42.759> point<00:01:42.969> three<00:01:43.090> megabytes<00:01:43.829> anyway<00:01:44.829> hit

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
a nine point three megabytes anyway hit

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.819 
a nine point three megabytes anyway hit
the<00:01:45.520> middle<00:01:45.820> button<00:01:46.060> then<00:01:46.390> there<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.380> then

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
the middle button then there and then

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.440 
the middle button then there and then
you'll<00:01:48.009> get<00:01:48.430> back<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.820> menu<00:01:49.119> so<00:01:49.270> that

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
you'll get back to the menu so that

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.219 
you'll get back to the menu so that
one's<00:01:49.630> okay<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.380> still<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.850> cannot<00:01:52.659> get<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:53.079> my

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
one's okay and still I cannot get to my

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:01.529 
one's okay and still I cannot get to my
HDR<00:01:54.219> setting<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:57.490> still<00:01:57.909> oh<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.909> can<00:02:01.329> no

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
HDR setting it's still oh I can no

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.359 
HDR setting it's still oh I can no
because<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.289> didn't<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.680> didn't<00:02:02.950> set<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.219> other

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
because I didn't I didn't set the other

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.730 
because I didn't I didn't set the other
one<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.420> other<00:02:04.630> thing<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.049> might<00:02:05.320> affect

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
one so the other thing that might affect

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.210 
one so the other thing that might affect
you<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.320> have<00:02:09.240> bracketing<00:02:10.240> on

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you is if you have bracketing on

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.950 
you is if you have bracketing on
so<00:02:12.220> here's<00:02:12.550> bracketing<00:02:13.240> down<00:02:13.420> in<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.690> lower

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
so here's bracketing down in the lower

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.460 
so here's bracketing down in the lower
right<00:02:14.140> corner<00:02:16.590> CB<00:02:17.590> Katie<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.610> off<00:02:19.080> if<00:02:20.080> it's

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
right corner CB Katie it's off if it's

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.780 
right corner CB Katie it's off if it's
on<00:02:20.770> like<00:02:21.130> if<00:02:21.280> you're<00:02:21.460> bracketing<00:02:21.970> plus<00:02:22.290> 0.5

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
on like if you're bracketing plus 0.5

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.500 
on like if you're bracketing plus 0.5
exposures<00:02:24.790> or<00:02:25.410> 1.5<00:02:26.410> or<00:02:27.130> whatever<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.300> if

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
exposures or 1.5 or whatever it is if

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.050 
exposures or 1.5 or whatever it is if
you're<00:02:28.660> choosing<00:02:28.840> anything<00:02:29.500> but<00:02:29.680> off<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.790> will

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
you're choosing anything but off it will

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.650 
you're choosing anything but off it will
not<00:02:31.270> work<00:02:31.480> for<00:02:31.510> HDR<00:02:32.130> see<00:02:33.130> there<00:02:33.310> i<00:02:33.340> chose<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.700> 1.0

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
not work for HDR see there i chose a 1.0

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.140 
not work for HDR see there i chose a 1.0
so<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.500> will<00:02:35.680> shoot<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.950> regular<00:02:36.340> image<00:02:36.550> for<00:02:36.970> me

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
so it will shoot a regular image for me

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.990 
so it will shoot a regular image for me
and<00:02:37.360> then<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:37.690> will<00:02:37.840> shoot<00:02:38.080> 1<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.470> +1<00:02:39.000> exposure

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
and then it will shoot 1 and +1 exposure

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.410 
and then it will shoot 1 and +1 exposure
and<00:02:40.330> minus<00:02:40.690> 1<00:02:40.900> exposure<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.820> doesn't<00:02:43.300> work

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
and minus 1 exposure that doesn't work

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.250 
and minus 1 exposure that doesn't work
for<00:02:43.630> HDR<00:02:44.050> watch<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:46.120> i<00:02:46.150> cannot<00:02:46.630> it's<00:02:46.930> grayed

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
choose one of these settings and they're

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.970 
choose one of these settings and they're
they're<00:03:22.240> so<00:03:22.450> close<00:03:22.690> together<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.170> noticed

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
they're so close together I noticed

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.650 
they're so close together I noticed
hardly<00:03:24.310> any<00:03:24.520> difference<00:03:25.000> at<00:03:25.180> all<00:03:25.300> with<00:03:25.510> my

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
hardly any difference at all with my

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.410 
hardly any difference at all with my
images<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.860> can<00:03:27.670> experiment<00:03:28.090> with<00:03:28.300> that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
images so you can experiment with that

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.570 
images so you can experiment with that
maybe<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.960> helps<00:03:29.230> some<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.770> certain<00:03:30.220> lighting

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
maybe it helps some in certain lighting

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.120 
maybe it helps some in certain lighting
conditions<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.680> shooting<00:03:32.680> here<00:03:32.860> from<00:03:33.010> my

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
conditions but shooting here from my

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.190 
conditions but shooting here from my
house<00:03:33.310> across<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.790> street<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.510> condos

house across the street to the condos
across<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> street<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.370> other<00:03:36.550> things

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
across the street and to other things

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.360 
across the street and to other things
I<00:03:37.150> just<00:03:37.660> noticed<00:03:38.020> very<00:03:38.410> little<00:03:38.800> difference<00:03:39.220> at

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
I just noticed very little difference at

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.460 
I just noticed very little difference at
all<00:03:39.520> so<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.000> me<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.570> didn't<00:03:40.810> even<00:03:40.930> matter<00:03:41.140> what

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
all so to me it didn't even matter what

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.540 
all so to me it didn't even matter what
what<00:03:41.770> settings<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.370> had<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:42.670> on<00:03:44.250> when<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.340> take

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
what settings I had it on when you take

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.730 
what settings I had it on when you take
a<00:03:45.580> picture<00:03:45.820> it<00:03:46.210> will<00:03:46.300> shoot<00:03:46.660> two<00:03:46.960> shots<00:03:47.290> really

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740

a picture it will shoot two shots really
quick<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.460> it<00:03:49.300> will<00:03:49.450> combine<00:03:49.780> those<00:03:50.140> shots<00:03:50.470> to

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
quick and it will combine those shots to
