the GED Zeno Mina Mina kiedy was another

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.910 
the GED Zeno Mina Mina kiedy was another
really<00:00:42.329> clever<00:00:42.719> idea<00:00:42.840> for<00:00:43.260> special<00:00:43.710> raid

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
really clever idea for special raid

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920 
really clever idea for special raid
literally<00:00:44.460> anything<00:00:44.610> was<00:00:45.090> possible<00:00:45.270> ministry

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
literally anything was possible ministry

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
throne from explosions to pack up and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.260 
throne from explosions to pack up and
stops<00:00:48.420> two<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:48.930> zombie<00:00:49.260> spawning

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
stops two more zombie spawning

unfortunately<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.420> ability<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:51.960> also

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
unfortunately this ability was also

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.200 
unfortunately this ability was also
starting<00:00:52.500> full<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.370> really<00:00:53.730> rely<00:00:54.090> on

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
starting full as you can really rely on

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.209 
starting full as you can really rely on
emergency<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.320> whenever<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.739> had<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
emergency so whenever you had them you

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.709 
emergency so whenever you had them you
get<00:00:56.399> three<00:00:56.610> them<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.480> get

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
get three them going to see if you get

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.479 
get three them going to see if you get
anything<00:00:57.960> useful<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:58.500> them<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.280> gets

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
anything useful from them and gets

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
anything useful from them and gets
carried<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.030> normal<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.600> mean<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.050> they

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
carried on I was normal I mean that they

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.170 
carried on I was normal I mean that they
didn't<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.710> much<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.129> use<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:03.120> once

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
didn't really have much for use but once

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.939 
didn't really have much for use but once
again<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> idea<00:01:03.809> behind<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.680> very

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
again the idea behind them was very

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.640 
again the idea behind them was very
clever<00:01:05.630> number<00:01:06.630> three<00:01:06.840> did<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.350> strike

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
clever number three did you strike

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.010 
clever number three did you strike
beacon<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:09.060> beacons<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.510> origins<00:01:09.900> are

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
beacon the beacons and origins are

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.510 
beacon the beacons and origins are
perfect<00:01:10.350> example<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.799> how<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.040> integrate<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
perfect example of how to integrate a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
perfect example of how to integrate a
weapon<00:01:11.909> into<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> map<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.780> earn<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.110> have

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
weapon into the map to earn it you have

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
weapon into the map to earn it you have
to<00:01:13.470> complete<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> quest<00:01:14.159> rather<00:01:14.430> than<00:01:14.549> guest
