00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.800

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.360

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.010
 with normal eating look because 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.300

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.970
 that if he does not play a full game without 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.250
 and we appealed to see if he came out he could not get out 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.840
 that by the way I want to send a greeting 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.150

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.430

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.489
