with<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.720> other<00:00:48.809> emblems<00:00:49.820> just<00:00:50.820> pause<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
with my other emblems just pause the

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.670 
with my other emblems just pause the
video<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.510> want<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.870> know<00:00:52.019> where<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> little

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
video if you want to know where a little

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.859 
video if you want to know where a little
piece<00:00:53.190> goes<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.000> would<00:00:54.180> definitely<00:00:54.839> use

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:54.869 
piece goes it's I would definitely use

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:57.680 
piece goes it's I would definitely use
though<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.589> little<00:00:55.920> guide<00:00:56.760> grid<00:00:57.269> I<00:00:57.330> guess

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
though the little guide grid I guess

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.479 
though the little guide grid I guess
that<00:00:58.290> comes<00:00:58.470> with<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.710> emblem<00:00:58.949> editor<00:00:59.280> for

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that comes with the emblem editor for

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.369 
that comes with the emblem editor for
this<00:00:59.670> because<00:01:00.089> it's<00:01:00.479> very<00:01:00.720> precise<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this because it's very precise and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
this because it's very precise and
mine's<00:01:01.619> still<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.100> perfect<00:01:02.369> because<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> was

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
mine's still not perfect because I was

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.260 
mine's still not perfect because I was
still<00:01:03.869> limited<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.470> 32<00:01:04.860> layers<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.700> think

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
still limited with 32 layers but I think

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.060 
still limited with 32 layers but I think
it<00:01:06.360> came<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:06.930> nice<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.740> hope<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
it came out really nice and I hope you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
it came out really nice and I hope you
guys<00:01:08.280> create<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.270> yourselves<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> see

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it why I love this emblem this is the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.390 
it why I love this emblem this is the
one<00:01:12.930> I've<00:01:13.080> been<00:01:13.110> using<00:01:13.409> console<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
one I've been using console and at the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.980 
one I've been using console and at the
end<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.729> coming<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.659> some<00:01:15.810> clips

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
end here coming up I have some clips

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.260 
end here coming up I have some clips
with<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.310> weapons<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.790> believe<00:01:18.119> that

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
with it on some weapons I believe that

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.140 
with it on some weapons I believe that
MSMC<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> an-94<00:01:19.740> because<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.549> think<00:01:21.060> they

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
MSMC in the an-94 because I think they

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.149 
MSMC in the an-94 because I think they
show<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.450> emblems<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> best<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:23.009> know

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
show up emblems the best or you know

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.029 
show up emblems the best or you know
it's<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.580> clearest<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.689> guess<00:01:24.899> some<00:01:25.679> weapons<00:01:25.979> I

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
it's the clearest I guess some weapons I

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.340 
it's the clearest I guess some weapons I
don't<00:01:26.249> like<00:01:26.429> like<00:01:26.609> they<00:01:26.759> vector<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:28.109> can

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
don't like like they vector I can I can

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.959 
don't like like they vector I can I can
barely<00:01:28.649> see<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> emblem<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
barely see the emblem on it

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.919 
barely see the emblem on it
I<00:01:30.530> just<00:01:31.530> wish<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.100> guess<00:01:32.999> was<00:01:33.210> easily<00:01:33.659> shown

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
I just wish it I guess was easily shown

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.559 
I just wish it I guess was easily shown
on<00:01:34.409> every<00:01:34.679> weapon<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.159> physican<00:01:36.090> sits<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.420> my

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
on every weapon but physican sits on my

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.929 
on every weapon but physican sits on my
diamond<00:01:36.929> MSMC<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.249> looks<00:01:38.399> really<00:01:38.579> nice

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
diamond MSMC and it looks really nice

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.380 
diamond MSMC and it looks really nice
the<00:01:39.450> a94<00:01:39.929> is<00:01:40.079> pretty<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:41.069> it<00:01:41.159> has<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the a94 is pretty I think it has that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.100 
the a94 is pretty I think it has that
position<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.830> not<00:01:44.010> Diamond<00:01:44.610> dog<00:01:44.790> sadly<00:01:45.240> I'm
