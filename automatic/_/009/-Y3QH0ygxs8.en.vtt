game rationally has been single player

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.240 
game rationally has been single player
only<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:32.809> it's<00:00:33.019> it's<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.680> pretty<00:00:33.890> good<00:00:34.040> fit

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.880 
only and it's it's a pretty good fit
yeah<00:00:34.670> it's<00:00:35.030> it's<00:00:35.690> totally<00:00:36.140> separate<00:00:36.590> from<00:00:36.649> the

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
yeah it's it's totally separate from the

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.260 
yeah it's it's totally separate from the
single<00:00:37.190> player<00:00:37.280> which<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:37.760> kind<00:00:38.239> of

into<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.760> single<00:00:44.090> player<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:44.450> I<00:00:44.870> really<00:00:45.110> want

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
into the single player and I really want

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.209 
into the single player and I really want
that<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:45.590> know<00:00:45.680> they're<00:00:45.860> they're<00:00:46.070> two

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
different experience it seems like for

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.090 
different experience it seems like for
access<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.110> treading<00:00:48.320> really<00:00:48.620> carefully

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
access is treading really carefully

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.049 
access is treading really carefully
because<00:00:49.250> they<00:00:49.460> know<00:00:49.579> they've<00:00:49.760> got<00:00:49.820> a<00:00:49.879> lot<00:00:50.030> of

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
because they know they've got a lot of

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.610 
because they know they've got a lot of
older<00:00:50.300> hardcore<00:00:50.690> fans<00:00:50.930> who<00:00:51.110> probably<00:00:51.350> don't

older hardcore fans who probably don't

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.260 
older hardcore fans who probably don't
want<00:00:51.890> multiplayer<00:00:52.430> integration<00:00:53.000> with<00:00:53.149> their

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
so the way it works is basically they're

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.980 
so the way it works is basically they're
kind<00:01:16.010> of<00:01:16.070> two<00:01:16.610> main<00:01:16.850> parameters<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:17.750> set

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
kind of two main parameters that you set

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.840 
kind of two main parameters that you set
when<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.229> go<00:01:18.350> into<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.590> game<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.340> the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
when you go into a game and that is the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.210 
when you go into a game and that is the
turn<00:01:20.210> time<00:01:20.600> which<00:01:21.080> is<00:01:21.110> how<00:01:21.470> long<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:21.860> have<00:01:22.040> to

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
turn time which is how long you have to

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.859 
turn time which is how long you have to
make<00:01:22.340> all<00:01:22.490> your<00:01:22.610> moves<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.210> then<00:01:23.659> how<00:01:23.810> many

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
make all your moves and then how many

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.480 
make all your moves and then how many
points<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:24.500> have<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.070> way<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.280> point

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
points you have and the way the point

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.490 
points you have and the way the point
system<00:01:25.640> works<00:01:26.000> is<00:01:26.210> essentially<00:01:27.200> like<00:01:27.229> you're

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
system works is essentially like you're

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.690 
system works is essentially like you're
saying<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.799> have<00:01:27.890> six<00:01:28.130> slots<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:28.580> can

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
saying you have six slots that you can

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.880 
saying you have six slots that you can
fill<00:01:28.939> up<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.020> can<00:01:30.259> pick<00:01:30.470> from<00:01:30.530> either

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
fill up and so you can pick from either

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.350 
fill up and so you can pick from either
a<00:01:31.009> soldier<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.790> different<00:01:32.090> soldier

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
a soldier and a different soldier

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.240 
a soldier and a different soldier
specialization<00:01:33.110> or<00:01:33.259> several<00:01:33.979> different

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
specialization or several different

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.830 
specialization or several different
types<00:01:34.369> of<00:01:34.520> aliens<00:01:34.909> each<00:01:35.119> have<00:01:35.630> their<00:01:35.780> own

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
types of aliens each have their own

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.690 
types of aliens each have their own
ability<00:01:36.350> there's<00:01:36.829> a<00:01:36.890> lot<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:37.040> strategy<00:01:37.520> there

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
ability there's a lot of strategy there

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.039 
ability there's a lot of strategy there
because<00:01:37.939> we<00:01:38.090> played<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.570> couple<00:01:38.630> different

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
because we played a couple different

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.359 
because we played a couple different
games<00:01:39.170> we<00:01:39.320> played<00:01:39.530> one<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.890> had<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.070> highest

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
games we played one that had the highest

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.580 
games we played one that had the highest
point<00:01:40.820> threshold<00:01:41.000> which<00:01:41.630> was<00:01:41.810> 20,000

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
point threshold which was 20,000

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.140 
point threshold which was 20,000
basically<00:01:43.009> budgeted<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.549> these<00:01:43.729> points

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
basically budgeted this these points

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.929 
basically budgeted this these points
right<00:01:44.409> for<00:01:45.409> 4x<00:01:45.920> cooperative<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:46.549> basically

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
right for 4x cooperative you basically

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.210 
right for 4x cooperative you basically
pick<00:01:47.240> like<00:01:47.479> soldier<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.560> then<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:48.950> go<00:01:49.070> down

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
pick like soldier and then you go down

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.569 
pick like soldier and then you go down
to<00:01:49.430> their<00:01:49.640> class<00:01:49.909> which<00:01:50.299> is<00:01:50.420> like<00:01:50.540> sniper<00:01:51.579> also

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
to their class which is like sniper also

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.819 
to their class which is like sniper also
and<00:01:52.850> heavy<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.600> then<00:01:54.079> in<00:01:54.259> each<00:01:54.439> one<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.680> those

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
and heavy and then in each one of those

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.350 
and heavy and then in each one of those
there's<00:01:55.100> like<00:01:55.220> separate<00:01:55.640> separate<00:01:55.970> perks<00:01:56.210> so

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
there's like separate separate perks so

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.420 
there's like separate separate perks so
it<00:01:56.570> becomes<00:01:56.810> like<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.079> very<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.920> specialize

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
it becomes like a very you specialize

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.590 
it becomes like a very you specialize
your<00:01:58.640> do<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:58.909> everything<00:01:59.060> costs<00:01:59.390> like<00:01:59.540> a

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
your do and everything costs like a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.819 
your do and everything costs like a
little<00:01:59.750> bit<00:01:59.869> more<00:01:59.990> it's<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.710> know<00:02:00.799> it's

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
little bit more it's like you know it's

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.300 
little bit more it's like you know it's
like<00:02:00.950> customizing<00:02:01.549> a<00:02:01.640> come
