hi everybody this is Tina from F sonica
and<00:00:10.320> today<00:00:10.710> we're<00:00:10.860> talking<00:00:10.980> about<00:00:11.309> ball

and today we're talking about ball

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.570 
and today we're talking about ball
pythons<00:00:11.880> ball<00:00:12.719> pythons<00:00:13.200> are<00:00:13.440> probably<00:00:13.889> the

pythons ball pythons are probably the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.250 
pythons ball pythons are probably the

most popular snake kept in captivity
right<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:17.570> mostly<00:00:18.570> because<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.930> their<00:00:19.170> docile

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
right now mostly because of their docile

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.970 
right now mostly because of their docile
personalities<00:00:20.460> they're<00:00:21.380> relatively<00:00:22.380> small

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
probably more realistic ball pythons do

length<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.100> babies<00:00:59.550> obviously<00:01:00.059> smaller<00:01:00.420> they

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
length and babies obviously smaller they

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.360 
length and babies obviously smaller they
need<00:01:01.140> enough<00:01:01.379> room<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.070> they<00:01:02.219> could

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
need enough room so that they could

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
need enough room so that they could
stretch<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.850> their<00:01:03.030> bodies<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.140> this

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
stretch out their bodies it's so in this

animal to soak in and you might want to
add<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> branch<00:01:20.340> or<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> decoration<00:01:22.100> although<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
add a branch or a decoration although it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
add a branch or a decoration although it
looks<00:01:24.240> good<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.780> also<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.259> help<00:01:25.409> them<00:01:25.740> with

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
looks good it also will help them with

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
looks good it also will help them with
shedding<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> shed<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.200> they

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
shedding when they go to shed and they

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.090 
shedding when they go to shed and they
need<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> find<00:01:28.770> something<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.159> rub<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:30.590> here<00:01:31.590> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
need to find something to rub on here we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.480 
need to find something to rub on here we
use<00:01:32.340> cypress<00:01:32.790> mulch<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.360> substrate<00:01:34.490> cypress

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
use cypress mulch as a substrate cypress

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.910 
use cypress mulch as a substrate cypress
mulch<00:01:35.670> holds<00:01:36.240> humidity<00:01:36.689> very<00:01:36.900> well<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
mulch holds humidity very well and the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.870 
mulch holds humidity very well and the
snakes<00:01:38.220> seem<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:38.759> enjoy<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:40.640> now<00:01:41.640> for

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
snakes seem to really enjoy it now for

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.499 
snakes seem to really enjoy it now for
the<00:01:41.939> hard<00:01:42.150> part

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the hard part

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.109 
the hard part
we<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> maintain<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.650> hot<00:01:43.950> spot<00:01:44.250> around<00:01:44.460> 86

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
we want to maintain a hot spot around 86

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.600 
we want to maintain a hot spot around 86
to<00:01:45.270> 87<00:01:45.509> degrees<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.530> an<00:01:46.770> ambient<00:01:47.220> temperature

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to 87 degrees and an ambient temperature

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
to 87 degrees and an ambient temperature
in<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> low<00:01:48.000> 80s<00:01:48.420> both<00:01:49.049> pythons<00:01:49.560> require

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
in the low 80s both pythons require

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.639 
in the low 80s both pythons require
belly<00:01:50.310> Heat<00:01:50.659> so<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.780> order<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.049> do<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.409> we're

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
belly Heat so in order to do this we're

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.880 
belly Heat so in order to do this we're
going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> use<00:01:53.040> an<00:01:53.310> under<00:01:53.520> tank<00:01:53.759> heater<00:01:54.890> see

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
going to use an under tank heater see

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.630 
going to use an under tank heater see
here<00:01:56.159> here's<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.790> zoom<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.149> makes

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
here here's one that zoom that makes

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.399 
here here's one that zoom that makes
hopefully<00:01:59.640> using<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.630> under<00:02:00.930> tank<00:02:01.170> heater

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
hopefully using this under tank heater

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.850 
hopefully using this under tank heater
will<00:02:02.009> give<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.549> temperature<00:02:03.619> both<00:02:04.619> in

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
will give you the temperature both in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.010 
will give you the temperature both in
the<00:02:04.950> hot<00:02:05.100> spot<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.090> ambient<00:02:06.899> temperature

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the hot spot and the ambient temperature

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.199 
the hot spot and the ambient temperature
that<00:02:07.530> you're<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> need<00:02:08.100> keep<00:02:08.850> your<00:02:09.030> ball

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209

snakes we do recommend taking the snake
out<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:58.710> their<00:03:58.830> enclosure<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.550> putting<00:03:59.760> them

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
out of their enclosure and putting them

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.700 
out of their enclosure and putting them
in<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.030> separate<00:04:00.360> feeding<00:04:00.600> bin<00:04:00.900> when<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.530> comes

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
in a separate feeding bin when it comes

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.010 
in a separate feeding bin when it comes
to<00:04:01.860> ball<00:04:02.040> pythons<00:04:02.490> they<00:04:03.150> can<00:04:03.420> be<00:04:03.600> more<00:04:03.780> picky

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
to ball pythons they can be more picky

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.950 
to ball pythons they can be more picky
so<00:04:04.620> with<00:04:05.280> full<00:04:05.460> pythons<00:04:05.940> we<00:04:06.150> do<00:04:06.330> leave<00:04:06.540> them<00:04:06.750> in

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
so with full pythons we do leave them in

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.780 
so with full pythons we do leave them in
their<00:04:07.170> enclosures<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.980> they<00:04:08.250> tend<00:04:08.520> to<00:04:08.610> be

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
their enclosures and they tend to be

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:17.650 
their enclosures and they tend to be
much<00:04:08.910> better<00:04:09.150> feeders<00:04:09.600> here

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:30.060
