00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.910
 hi to all of you guys and here we are 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.679
 found yourself with another very way test 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.349
 fast with another kick 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.339
 here to present you the fortune found 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.800
 from the official website of fame simulator 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.900
 2015 the one present because it appeared 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.170
 be the two axes a cart 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.150
 quiet the 3,000 liter trend it 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.120
 I present for the textures that know why 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.880
 exactly as you can see from the bar 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.090
 for example below you see that a 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.380
 little labels like ruined 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.320
 francs headlights however are well 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.060
 detailed in fact also well 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.760
 wheels are not bad at all 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.330
 labels around even here on the front 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.540
 the rudder was inserted so a little wear 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.150
 where it could go to right 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.270
 so we have beautiful tubes on the left 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.950
 plumbers a nice grouping the pipes and 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.630
 however, overall textures in other words, mi 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.300
 like it pretty nice and so I have 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.910
 thus decided to introduce him because 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.250
 however it could be convenient a 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.210
 average cart for those who maybe start a 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.670
 do something like that in plain company 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.860
 practically a bit so original and 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.140
 we had some details there is a bit of 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.979
 rust here so for example on the edge 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.750
 high on the top corner and so I have 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.860
 saw this nice load but you know i 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.650
 present amelium 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.150
 even if someone has never seen it 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.330
 maybe not all but always believe 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.310
 the eye 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.780
 the official website I had the headlights 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.970
 done reverse braking lights up 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.910
 the others put the arrows though 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.990
 unfortunately there is no space but no space 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.790
 the headlights are reversing a crisis already 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.930
 that they could put very well without 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.300
 without so many exhaust problems and yes 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:16.950
 then the hooks are opened 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.210
 start unloading our piston 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.880
 up here quite quickly 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:27.160
 maybe a little too much respect marie 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.350
 actually some time to decrease by 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.770
 beautiful animations also on the hooks vi 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.290
 here below closes this then yes 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.380
 he closes the door a little too much 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.620
 quickly then you hang up here 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.230
 perhaps slower movements to add 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.099
 in reaching the given reverse light 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.440
 that the lights have left the seats 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.930
 then i think it may be okay either 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.900
 I didn't see any legal burden, I don't know 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.140
 of which zones zones until my part 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.319
 we do n't say I haven't seen anyway from 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.739
 It had also done well and when 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 unhook then decide on also turns the 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.739
 but then I deny myself in the inferno square 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.140
 sick on wheels one up and put on 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.129
 race d was on the other hand when he was 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:21.910
 advanced on but denied pulls on the neck 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:25.580
 and away the irons and also to say a beautiful one 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.200
 so I leave the link in the description 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.660
 commented subscribe and leave a beautiful 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.700
 like 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.680
 nothing I say I leave you the wagon is 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.680
 good bye to everyone next time
