00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
iron and just poke through the fabric so

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.449 
iron and just poke through the fabric so
so<00:03:16.260> when<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.440> put<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.800> screw<00:03:17.040> in<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.280> won't

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
so when I put the screw in it won't

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.400 
so when I put the screw in it won't
twist<00:03:17.730> fabric<00:03:18.360> it'll<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.720> go<00:03:18.840> through

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410
