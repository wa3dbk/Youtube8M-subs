00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.210
 here's back in the mess of a 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.269
 bet and wanted they installed a 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.880
 from the very first ds and I have it between 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.900
 my hands 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.450
 the book I'm working on 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.090
 for months I am very moved because 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.920
 that book instincts I present a 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.359
 little clumsily 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.279
 it's a book as much to see as to read 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.599
 it's usually beautiful book 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.349
 look at them but we do not elect so we have 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.610
 all my challenge was to try to 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.590
 do it be interesting that novel 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.790
 hard story launch of the ds had 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.170
 it did not happen overnight 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.600
 all a part starting with a lot 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.980
 historical photos and after we return 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.390
 in the design secrets of the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.890
 car there is airlock was still there at 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 his three cuts and I do not like that the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.270
 ds 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.360
 we have a lot of pictures of drawings 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.010
 unique 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.030
 about the different prototypes that have had 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.020
 place do it a taboo is a 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.489
 forty people and who 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.680
 have all told me these two years because 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:10.210
 that I had at the time the designers 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.119
 pretty classic project manager they 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.860
 have all explained the difficulties that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.320
 were wearing all the innovations that 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.110
 had in the organization both of 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.119
 the chain of the car but to see 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.000
 play on the grounds which prepares the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.119
 piece it's a fact nothing i'm very 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.300
 proud i very proud thanks to editions 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.800
 stone winter yarmulke Julian 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.630
 lambert 2 who did the direction 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.880
 artistic here it happens leads to 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.640
 China too, you want to learn 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.630
 lots of stuff because a lot of 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 people are going to tell things that 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.649
 some of the others 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.310
 did not know some people said well 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.009
 knew things that one recrosses years 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.380
 infos this is a novel a novel this 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.860
 history during this world 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.479
 here we go to see you soon and in paris 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.530
 the ds3 ds4 and the ds5 the people 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.759
 do not know the story it's a 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.979
 story that goes back ten years ago which 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.019
 starts in 2004 and at the time it takes 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.179
 to know that we are not allowed to speak 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.860
 ds at citroën it's like a father too 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.180
 present which would have enormously succeeded 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.290
 the child who did not succeed and 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.780
 every time the devil daddy is 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.280
 great it irritates them citroen so 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.480
 he did not want to talk about it 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.370
 and little by little in the early years 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.730
 2000 the brand regains confidence and in 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.989
 2004 we have the idea to replace the c2 which 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.760
 is the small 3-door sedan by a 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.290
 model a bit more expensive it starts there 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.900
 but even says we will try to sell a 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.060
 next model that would be sold 10 or 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.310
 15% more expensive even that in god or if we 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.959
 will get there and it starts like this and 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.239
 the teams of the style it is loose 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.290
 very quickly led by jean pierre cheated 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.540
 have desires to make cars 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.709
 more daring striking there is a 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.230
 title that is to the products that 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.640
 is called vincent besson who understands there 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.350
 the interest of trying to push 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.269
 the sliders a little further but we 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.700
 not talk about aces at the time and 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.890
 so they have two projects of which 7.7 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.200
 it's cutting and 7 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.730
 cut his four who will become after 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.840
 of the three goddesses 4 but that's 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.819
 just the arrival of christian 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.980
 streiff the new president of psa in 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.690
 2007 which he very quickly said to himself but 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.730
 citroën peugeot is going to be eaten 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.440
 by the low cost brands down and 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.850
 premium above we must have the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.620
 cars with more value and idy at 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.240
 citroën i want premium cars 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.360
 what did you read world these 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.530
 two projects la la the small ds3 end which 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.050
 is not called like that at the time is there 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.340
 and ds4 and ai said but it's very 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.420
 good but put me more value I 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.790
 wanted to sell more expensive it has to be 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.830
 either more and finally during 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.510
 early years of the project had fought 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.040
 to try to gain value on 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.830
 the car and there they are told open 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.110
 so much more so it has jostled everything and 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.250
 and vincent besson who was at the products 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.510
 explained to christian the one we 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.950
 could not sell citroen at the price 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.209
 deodic was not going too much too 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.040
 far he had to stay fair compared 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.170
 to the mark but that's how it is 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.060
 starts up and so they push these projects 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.380
 there and then to a third 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.250
 car that will arrive in the lot which 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.790
 will be the ds5 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.670
 a third project and and seeing the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.739
 three cars the streif will say it must 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.380
 a name for this range and nobody 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.549
 dares get the word ds ds is the name 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.110
 just after eight months of 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.250
 thinking that the director advertising 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.840
 he reminds jean-marc his mini who says 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.420
 but why not put back but 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.739
 they will go there propose sastre is done 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.269
 to the citizen president at the time 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.620
 was called jean michel who they are 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.109
 recent in the company that says yes 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.979
 it is a very good idea but full of 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.620
 people in the company they are not going 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.150
 ds out we will laugh at us we 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.919
 will tell us we're crazy we're 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.940
 pretentious autin and the whole book 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.860
 tell you everything 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.570
 this awareness and how 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.450
 little by little the company find again 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.520
 trust is in itself the market 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.419
 priority for seven deaths tired of a 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.610
 feed 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.430
 is that what we understand you 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.280
 why she is so good in China too 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:49.419
 well I think that China is very 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.580
 simple ds surfing on the image of france 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.380
 and in particularity of paris that's it 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.880
 which is all the more paradoxical all to 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.580
 fact accepted in France 2 talks about our 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.229
 luxury brands be it 8 on hermès 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.840
 dior guerlain 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.460
 it does not bother anyone the roads cost the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.240
 haute couture who is French and who 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.700
 is Parisian and well ds is associated 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.210
 spontaneously by the Chinese at this 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.400
 world there 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.320
 while for a Parisian it's going to be a 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.910
 cliche if you show the eiffel tower and 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.640
 a couture dress in a car 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.810
 but a Chinese him who has a little 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.940
 money that wants to be different 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.500
 he bought that so it helps 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.010
 wonderfully in this top market 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.360
 of range 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.700
 we have cars with a strong 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.419
 personality who have this aura of this 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.280
 image of paris that accelerate their 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.870
 notoriety abroad good to know it's 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.659
 still very small ds 1 compared to 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.039
 men and german gold but it starts 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.479
 and that for me the people who 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.500
 are interested in ds in china these people 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.580
 much younger than in France 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.260
 people compare to thirty years 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.970
 and who are often people who want 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.849
 stand out from the young architects of 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.229
 rails in the high tech in the web etc 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.880
 who want cars like that 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.159
 imprint of two strong personalities 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.750
 who already want to break the standards 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.960
 that can be the mercedes the audi 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.240
 etc but still a long way 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.500
 byetta codis and built in 20 years ds a 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.099
 does that three years of which we will see where they 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.099
 are at the same time
