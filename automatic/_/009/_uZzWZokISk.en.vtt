building a foundation of buttercream and
he's<00:00:49.680> smoothing<00:00:50.070> off<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> edges<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.760> then

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
he's smoothing off the edges and then

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.779 
he's smoothing off the edges and then
he's<00:00:51.390> leaving<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.960> nice<00:00:52.440> flat<00:00:52.920> top<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
cupcake so that our little cake topper

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.740 
cupcake so that our little cake topper
can<00:00:56.489> fit<00:00:56.850> perfectly<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.500> top<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> that's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
can fit perfectly on the top so that's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.060 
can fit perfectly on the top so that's
basically<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.350> you'll<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> end

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
basically what you'll have at the end

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
basically what you'll have at the end
that's<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.910> nice<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.510> flat<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> top<00:01:03.989> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that's so nice and flat on the top so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
that's so nice and flat on the top so
first<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.070> put<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> little<00:01:05.460> bit<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.900> corn

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
first of all we put a little bit of corn

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500 
first of all we put a little bit of corn
flour<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.280> roll<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.790> some<00:01:09.390> of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
flour down and then we roll out some of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.969 
flour down and then we roll out some of
our<00:01:09.600> green<00:01:09.900> fondant<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
our green fondant and this is going to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.880 
our green fondant and this is going to
make<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.430> base<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.270> our<00:01:12.540> Kermit<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.740> use

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
make the base of our Kermit so we use

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.859 
make the base of our Kermit so we use
the<00:01:14.040> glass<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> nice<00:01:14.880> circle<00:01:15.270> shape<00:01:15.689> out

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the glass to get a nice circle shape out

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.539 
the glass to get a nice circle shape out
of<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.890> we're<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.400> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of there and then we're just going to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.570 
of there and then we're just going to
cut<00:01:17.880> spikes<00:01:18.330> into<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.470> Kermit's<00:01:20.280> little

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
cut spikes into it like Kermit's little

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.179 
cut spikes into it like Kermit's little
neck<00:01:20.790> piece<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.259> went<00:01:22.409> at<00:01:22.590> random<00:01:23.009> here

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
neck piece so I just went at random here

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.340 
neck piece so I just went at random here
I<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.610> cut<00:01:23.909> random<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:24.810> triangles<00:01:25.229> out

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
I just cut random little triangles out

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.710 
I just cut random little triangles out
you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:26.240> mathematical<00:01:27.240> about<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.630> you

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you can be mathematical about it if you

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.289 
you can be mathematical about it if you
would<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.619> symmetry<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.060> just

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
would like and get symmetry but I just

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.730 
would like and get symmetry but I just
went<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.509> random<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> they<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.500> pull<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
went for random and they just pull the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
went for random and they just pull the
pieces<00:01:31.860> out<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.430> yeah<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
pieces out and yeah there you have it

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.870 
pieces out and yeah there you have it
nicely<00:01:34.619> done<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:35.159> give<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.430> rub<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> make

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
nicely done just give it a rub to make

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210 
nicely done just give it a rub to make
all<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> edges<00:01:36.509> nice<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.930> clean<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.470> there

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
all the edges nice and clean and there

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.420 
and then I just tried to cut a circular
motion<00:02:47.689> that<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.109> knew<00:02:48.319> would<00:02:48.470> fit<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.799> mouth

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
