00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:18.029
 exercise lifting barbell with us 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:22.040
 nevertheless already exercise is good 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.579
 as it allows use 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:30.290
 times more weight than say when lifting 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.820
 cost already and acting more concentrated 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.230
 exercise works well 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.390
 upper and middle part of the biceps 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.180
 weight can be taken more precisely by 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.050
 smaller amplitude of movement i.e. 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.070
 standing up 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.760
 slab and the movement is greater and the load 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.300
 It was a little to look for precisely by 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.750
 using a smaller amplitude can 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.750
 to tell 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.860
 if you will replenish on the stool i'm from 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.210
 my experience I will say that with a large 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.460
 bend back 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.460
 the stool can let you down as 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.810
 offset your center of gravity 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.810
 together with pants can knock over so 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.350
 develops so diagonally along with 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.119
 by and from your pants 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.700
 but there are several ways if you 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.409
 the back is straight or almost straight that is with 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.220
 a slight slope can be done 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.940
 exercise support with the back rest and 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.720
 the back of the bench can be performed without support 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.720
 sitting up straight 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:59.299
 both methods are used well there their 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:03.399
 nuances of back disease there injuries and 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:09.920
 sprains aspen and feathers load back 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:16.209
 but perform as squeeze it is done 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.209
 noticeable down 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:30.260
 more weight will not allow you to perform 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:39.470
 exercise on the exhale raise 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:39.470
 exhale inhale 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.680
 as an option can be performed with support 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:06.720
 back and back of the bench a little bit 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.910
 another load falls but with this 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:16.140
 do not try to lift 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.760
 you are your hands this part of your hand from 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.370
 shoulder to elbow should be well 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.000
 more or less parallel to the ground 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.630
 opportunities understandable pants imposes 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.169
 some restrictions on 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:36.599
 here here is this phase it is superfluous already 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:37.340
 here on Russian biceps carries here there 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.239
 such a nuance 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.579
 here such lifts biceps rollback arm 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.299
 maximum bent is obtained biceps 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:52.019
 here is the shortest possible state 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.109
 but the minimum load is therefore this 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.319
 phase she just superfluous her can not 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.319
 perform 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.439
 exhale 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.439
 inhale 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:35.080
 unnecessarily this phase which is not necessary 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:40.210
 do not need this elbows served 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:46.630
 go ahead and you understand Russian 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:49.980
 lost ie the effect of doing 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.980
 exercises are also shared 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.120
 so do not do here about 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:14.330
 keep your elbows still 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.330
 fix
