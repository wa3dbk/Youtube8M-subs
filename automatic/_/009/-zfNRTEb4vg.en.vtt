00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.640
 that there are guys maybe from a new 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.730
 review of a map for minecraft 0.12 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.530
 point 1 any audience so this 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.590
 map is for any version of 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.260
 hereinafter minecraft 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.110
 do not try the 0.11 power that has 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.270
 all that is logical, no, but good 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.500
 as always, the download link goes to 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.320
 be in the description next to the link 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.090
 how to install more if you do not know is not 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.270
 the procedure because it really is very 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.160
 simple and most in time and really 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.470
 anyone knows how to install a map in 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.570
 minecraft and good meaning after 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.570
 I visited the pelas you're going to have to see 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.000
 the video and learn but good we 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.790
 we stop blowjobs the creator is to be 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.670
 more the skier is temporary sebas 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.280
 why then good if it is the man who 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.230
 I had already done previous review a 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.230
 map then he got another map 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.680
 the map I liked because it has a 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.560
 particular that right now he 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.140
 itself is a survival has nothing else 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.580
 does not have more of the other world 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.580
 they are simply solvents and chingo 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.590
 well let's go 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.159
 let's just look here in 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.810
 madness I want to put you creative I do not expect 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.790
 that does not bother him and that always occurs 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.820
 day out is a review you 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.890
 can leave the selected lots 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.080
 well I put it in the day because right now 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.270
 I was at night and I spit it out 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.729
 it was very bad because the mavs were 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.080
 generating too many mobs ok 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.300
 I'm not sucking with the graphics 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.280
 always in the cav or always I have the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.280
 graphics to his fucking mother 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.420
 so nothing good that we have at 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.979
 principal we appear here 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.240
 obviously in survival please 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.490
 apart from the games in front 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.200
 good that the games of hunger I'm 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.189
 hoping to have more people or more 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.660
 followers so that all do not know all 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.520
 someday we can play all the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.340
 subscribers that is to enter a game 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.020
 pure subscribers always now do not fear 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.840
 me pinches wheat fields there were not 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.680
 viewed 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.260
 they like it huge and we're going to end up with 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.269
 good hunger nothing to do with the one 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.709
 is saying is waiting for more 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.580
 people follow me on my twitter in my 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.569
 facebook to notify them when they play 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.549
 so that being a guy of people or of 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.230
 world of subscribers and fill a 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.760
 split by the subscribers so 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.069
 I would be extra chinon really if I 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.080
 I would love it, but I'm waiting 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.390
 That so because if you want to play 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.430
 with me in the hunger games roses 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.500
 craft from time to time is nothing but 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.200
 Every Friday I say no 829 meters 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.730
 soft to talk or to get into 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.950
 play games because I suddenly 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.380
 talk to people say hello 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.739

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.650
 mother good time of that good them 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.780
 I teach the house this normality has 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.840
 a basic design that really does 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.200
 like it because it has glasses and it gets 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.420
 sad 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.890
 but the particular what I liked 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.760
 to see is good I wanted to see that it was 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.900
 this to me is a bitch 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.189
 that experience wants to see this because 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.260
 this is why I uploaded the map 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:31.010

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:37.239
