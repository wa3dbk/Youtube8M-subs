00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
liked the NRG version of all the ninjas

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.740 
liked the NRG version of all the ninjas
it<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.280> unique<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.000> time<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it was kind of unique at the time and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.890 
it was kind of unique at the time and
just<00:01:07.140> seemed<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.950> awesome<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.900> then

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
just seemed really awesome and then

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.030 
just seemed really awesome and then
afterwards<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:11.220> went<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> elemental<00:01:12.479> robe

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
afterwards we went to the elemental robe

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.420 
afterwards we went to the elemental robe
some<00:01:14.040> people<00:01:14.310> call<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.390> kimono<00:01:15.810> version

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
some people call it a the kimono version

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.730 
some people call it a the kimono version
so<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.479> call<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.840> either<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.350> but

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
so you can call it either one but

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.340 
so you can call it either one but
basically<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> next<00:01:21.570> version<00:01:21.750> after

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
basically this is the next version after

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.070 
basically this is the next version after
that<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.090> then<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.240> went<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> techno

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that and then they went to the techno

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.469 
that and then they went to the techno
robes<00:01:25.409> which<00:01:26.310> some<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> other<00:01:27.000> ninjas

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479

version

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.080 
version
which<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.590> me<00:02:06.770> really<00:02:07.250> kind<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.580> looks<00:02:07.820> like<00:02:07.940> a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
which to me really kind of looks like a

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.980 
which to me really kind of looks like a
almost<00:02:09.080> like<00:02:09.200> an<00:02:09.320> updated<00:02:09.979> NRG<00:02:10.640> version<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:11.780> I

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
almost like an updated NRG version but I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.380 
almost like an updated NRG version but I
still<00:02:12.290> think<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.590> cool<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:13.100> like<00:02:13.700> those<00:02:14.060> type

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
still think it's cool I like those type

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.230 
still think it's cool I like those type
and<00:02:15.350> then<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.680> one<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.310> most<00:02:16.700> recent<00:02:17.180> one

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
and then this one is the most recent one

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.400 
and then this one is the most recent one
is<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.530> deep<00:02:18.800> stone<00:02:19.310> armor<00:02:20.030> or<00:02:20.840> outfit

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
is the deep stone armor or outfit

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.810

whatever<00:02:21.920> you'd<00:02:22.070> like<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.250> call<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.610> but<00:02:22.790> I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
whatever you'd like to call it but I

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.550 
whatever you'd like to call it but I
think<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.300> really<00:02:23.570> cool<00:02:23.750> version<00:02:23.990> I<00:02:24.290> like
