the primest elementary game and we have

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.809 
the primest elementary game and we have
the<00:02:39.230> more<00:02:39.349> traditional<00:02:39.560> style<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.459> Metroid

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.850 
the more traditional style of Metroid
game<00:02:41.000> we<00:02:41.330> feel<00:02:41.599> that<00:02:41.629> we<00:02:41.959> do<00:02:42.230> need<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.560> take

it around two and a half years of

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.749 
it around two and a half years of
developments<00:05:12.500> if<00:05:12.620> retro<00:05:13.160> has<00:05:13.310> been<00:05:13.430> working

on<00:05:13.849> a<00:05:13.880> new<00:05:14.030> metroid<00:05:14.419> game<00:05:14.630> since<00:05:14.930> early<00:05:15.380> 2014

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
on a new metroid game since early 2014

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.240 
on a new metroid game since early 2014
then<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.580> holiday<00:05:17.120> Willy<00:05:17.389> is<00:05:17.509> in<00:05:17.690> 2016<00:05:18.680> would<00:05:19.099> be

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
then a holiday Willy is in 2016 would be

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.899 
then a holiday Willy is in 2016 would be
in<00:05:19.370> order<00:05:19.520> but<00:05:19.820> why<00:05:20.270> 2016<00:05:21.139> you<00:05:21.320> ask<00:05:21.500> well<00:05:21.919> 2016

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
in order but why 2016 you ask well 2016

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.640 
in order but why 2016 you ask well 2016
just<00:05:23.330> so<00:05:23.479> happens<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.110> be<00:05:24.139> the<00:05:24.320> 30th

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
just so happens to be the 30th

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.890 
just so happens to be the 30th
anniversary<00:05:25.310> of<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.490> Metroid<00:05:25.880> series<00:05:25.909> if<00:05:26.509> any

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
anniversary of the Metroid series if any

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.779 
anniversary of the Metroid series if any
year<00:05:27.199> seems<00:05:27.500> likely<00:05:27.889> to<00:05:28.009> have<00:05:28.130> a<00:05:28.159> Metroid<00:05:28.580> game

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
year seems likely to have a Metroid game

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.719 
year seems likely to have a Metroid game
than<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:29.120> is<00:05:29.270> 2016<00:05:30.229> however<00:05:30.830> what<00:05:31.130> about<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.370> 3ds

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
than it is 2016 however what about a 3ds

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.939 
than it is 2016 however what about a 3ds
game<00:05:32.120> I<00:05:32.330> can't<00:05:32.599> imagine<00:05:32.690> 3ds<00:05:33.349> game<00:05:33.680> will<00:05:33.860> be

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
game I can't imagine 3ds game will be

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.070 
game I can't imagine 3ds game will be
completed<00:05:34.460> earlier<00:05:34.849> and<00:05:35.120> that<00:05:35.389> being<00:05:35.659> said<00:05:35.900> it

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
completed earlier and that being said it

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.810 
completed earlier and that being said it
could<00:05:36.229> be<00:05:36.349> likely<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.830> a<00:05:36.889> new<00:05:37.039> Metroid<00:05:37.460> 3gs

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
could be likely that a new Metroid 3gs

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.460 
could be likely that a new Metroid 3gs
game<00:05:38.060> could<00:05:38.360> be<00:05:38.479> released<00:05:38.840> after<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.320> release

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
game could be released after the release

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.980 
game could be released after the release
of<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:40.009> new<00:05:40.190> Nintendo<00:05:40.820> tu<00:05:41.000> es<00:05:41.330> so<00:05:41.810> in<00:05:41.960> summary

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
of the new Nintendo tu es so in summary

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.140 
of the new Nintendo tu es so in summary
I<00:05:42.380> believe<00:05:42.830> in<00:05:42.979> Metro<00:05:43.250> dds<00:05:43.639> game<00:05:43.880> will<00:05:44.060> be

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
I believe in Metro dds game will be

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.999 
I believe in Metro dds game will be
developed<00:05:44.539> under<00:05:44.659> Takahashi<00:05:45.349> and<00:05:45.740> be

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
developed under Takahashi and be

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.999 
developed under Takahashi and be
released<00:05:46.340> in<00:05:46.550> late<00:05:46.759> 2015<00:05:47.599> or<00:05:47.840> early<00:05:48.199> 2016

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
released in late 2015 or early 2016

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.709 
released in late 2015 or early 2016
while<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.550> met<00:05:49.789> with<00:05:49.969> Wii<00:05:50.150> U<00:05:50.270> game<00:05:50.479> will<00:05:50.630> be

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
while I met with Wii U game will be

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.450 
while I met with Wii U game will be
developed<00:05:51.080> by<00:05:51.169> retro<00:05:51.650> and<00:05:51.860> released<00:05:52.130> in<00:05:52.310> late

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
developed by retro and released in late

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.939 
developed by retro and released in late
2016<00:05:53.270> along<00:05:53.630> with<00:05:53.659> the<00:05:53.900> 30th<00:05:54.259> anniversary<00:05:54.380> of

2016 along with the 30th anniversary of
the<00:05:55.190> Metroid<00:05:55.610> series<00:05:55.639> at<00:05:56.360> least<00:05:56.780> this<00:05:56.990> is<00:05:57.139> the

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
the Metroid series at least this is the

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.899 
the Metroid series at least this is the
inferences<00:05:57.680> that<00:05:57.740> strike<00:05:58.130> me<00:05:58.340> as<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.580> most

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
inferences that strike me as the most

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.969 
inferences that strike me as the most
likely<00:05:59.060> there<00:05:59.840> are<00:06:00.020> multiple<00:06:00.409> variables<00:06:00.800> to

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
likely there are multiple variables to

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.709 
likely there are multiple variables to
consider<00:06:01.009> however<00:06:01.789> suggest<00:06:02.120> Kenji<00:06:02.539> Yamamoto

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
consider however suggest Kenji Yamamoto

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.990 
consider however suggest Kenji Yamamoto
I<00:06:03.440> find<00:06:03.800> it<00:06:03.919> likely<00:06:04.219> that<00:06:04.250> he'll<00:06:04.490> be<00:06:04.639> composing

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
I find it likely that he'll be composing

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.610 
I find it likely that he'll be composing
music<00:06:05.270> for<00:06:05.479> either<00:06:05.750> or<00:06:06.080> both<00:06:06.259> games

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
music for either or both games

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.290 
music for either or both games
considering<00:06:07.159> he<00:06:07.400> has<00:06:07.490> composed<00:06:07.789> music<00:06:08.060> for

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
considering he has composed music for

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.540 
considering he has composed music for
Super<00:06:08.719> Metroid<00:06:08.870> and<00:06:09.229> the<00:06:09.380> prime<00:06:09.620> trilogy<00:06:09.860> so
