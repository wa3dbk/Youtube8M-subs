well yesterday marked the last day of my
homemade<00:00:05.250> straight<00:00:05.640> piping<00:00:06.060> on<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:06.330> vehicle

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
homemade straight piping on this vehicle

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.530 
homemade straight piping on this vehicle
and<00:00:08.610> now<00:00:10.190> it's<00:00:11.190> been<00:00:11.340> replaced<00:00:11.670> with<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.969> 5-inch

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
and now it's been replaced with a 5-inch

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.300 
and now it's been replaced with a 5-inch
silver<00:00:12.990> line<00:00:15.139> back<00:00:16.139> there<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.949> Garrett

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
silver line back there is the Garrett

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.310 
silver line back there is the Garrett
turbo<00:00:17.900> where<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.230> remove<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.029> clamp<00:00:21.029> from<00:00:21.320> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
turbo where we remove the clamp from the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.490 
turbo where we remove the clamp from the
exhaust<00:00:22.680> side<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:26.240> drop<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.539> silver<00:00:28.320> line

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
exhaust side and drop the silver line

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.589 
exhaust side and drop the silver line
piece<00:00:28.769> up<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.670> use<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.029> same<00:00:30.240> clamp

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
piece up here and you use the same clamp

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.780 
piece up here and you use the same clamp
again<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.769> open<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.489> little<00:00:32.520> bit

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
again just open it up a little bit

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.770 
again just open it up a little bit
bigger<00:00:33.059> go<00:00:33.600> around<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> four-inch<00:00:35.570> then<00:00:36.570> that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
bigger go around the four-inch then that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.500 
bigger go around the four-inch then that
down<00:00:37.079> piece<00:00:38.510> comes<00:00:39.510> down<00:00:40.940> right<00:00:41.940> there

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
down piece comes down right there

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.319 
down piece comes down right there
this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.200> pipe<00:00:43.460> lunges<00:00:44.460> second<00:00:44.850> let<00:00:44.969> me<00:00:45.090> just

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
this is pipe lunges second let me just

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.760 
this is pipe lunges second let me just
make<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.780> read<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:48.170> right<00:00:49.170> here's<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> pipe

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
make it read there right here's the pipe

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.950 
make it read there right here's the pipe
where<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.039> comes<00:00:50.250> down<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.670> is

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
where it comes down and then this is

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.750 
where it comes down and then this is
this<00:00:54.960> crossmember<00:00:55.350> piece<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> transfer

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
this crossmember piece for the transfer

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.959 
this crossmember piece for the transfer
case<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:58.109> transmission<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.699> was

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
case and the transmission this was

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.990 
case and the transmission this was
probably<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.989> biggest<00:01:01.230> deal<00:01:01.699> because<00:01:02.699> in

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
probably the biggest deal because in

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.149 
probably the biggest deal because in
order<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.660> piece<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.530> we

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
order to get that piece up in there we

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.640 
order to get that piece up in there we
had<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.729> take<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:09.090> piece<00:01:09.330> off<00:01:09.540> here

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
had to take that this piece off here

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.400 
had to take that this piece off here
when<00:01:12.280> we<00:01:12.400> did<00:01:12.580> that<00:01:12.790> we<00:01:13.030> had<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.420> support<00:01:13.900> the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
when we did that we had to support the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.200 
when we did that we had to support the
transfer<00:01:14.890> case<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.580> transmission

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
transfer case and the transmission

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.600 
transfer case and the transmission
because<00:01:17.110> this<00:01:17.290> crossmember<00:01:17.590> piece<00:01:18.130> was<00:01:18.370> being

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
because this crossmember piece was being

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.090 
because this crossmember piece was being
taken<00:01:19.060> off<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.500> was<00:01:20.650> probably<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.010> most

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
taken off that was probably the most

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.500 
taken off that was probably the most
difficult<00:01:21.460> part<00:01:22.710> after<00:01:23.710> we<00:01:23.980> got<00:01:24.160> that<00:01:24.370> on

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
difficult part after we got that on

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.870 
difficult part after we got that on
installed<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.660> rest<00:01:25.870> of<00:01:26.050> pipe<00:01:26.580> runs<00:01:27.580> out<00:01:27.730> to

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
installed the rest of pipe runs out to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.460 
installed the rest of pipe runs out to
the<00:01:27.970> back<00:01:28.180> there<00:01:28.450> into<00:01:28.660> that<00:01:28.840> Silver<00:01:29.290> Line

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
the back there into that Silver Line

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.180 
the back there into that Silver Line
muffler<00:01:30.330> it's<00:01:31.330> not<00:01:31.570> much<00:01:31.870> but<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.710> can't

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
muffler it's not much but I can't

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.890 
muffler it's not much but I can't
believe<00:01:33.520> how<00:01:33.700> much<00:01:33.820> quieter<00:01:34.300> it<00:01:34.420> makes<00:01:34.660> it

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
believe how much quieter it makes it

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.800 
believe how much quieter it makes it
that's<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:36.010> bummer<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.790> that's<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.420> good<00:01:37.600> thing

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
that's a bummer and that's a good thing

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.340 
that's a bummer and that's a good thing
in<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.960> way<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.890> comes<00:01:42.100> out<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.430> back<00:01:42.460> here

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
in a way and it comes out the back here

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.840 
in a way and it comes out the back here
it's<00:01:44.350> nice<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.830> big<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:50.140> there<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.500> have<00:01:50.530> it

kind<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:51.910> comes<00:01:52.090> out<00:01:52.270> at<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.480> slight<00:01:52.930> angle<00:01:56.370> but

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
kind of comes out at a slight angle but

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.290 
kind of comes out at a slight angle but
it<00:01:57.520> looks<00:01:57.730> good<00:01:59.220> all<00:02:00.220> right<00:02:00.580> let's<00:02:00.880> start<00:02:01.180> it
