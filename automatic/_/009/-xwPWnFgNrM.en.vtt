00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.710
 cover powerful vice alan candidate as 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.140

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.960
 rematch against magnus carlsen and the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.019
 report on candidates occupies a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.609
 good part of the magazine that without 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.409
 However good to fix as you see with the 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.630
 style or a very renewed design we have 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:34.490
 a double-page summary that we 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.150
 allows to give us an idea very 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.650
 Fast and highlight content 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.130
