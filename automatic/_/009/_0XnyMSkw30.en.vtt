vehicle is not much parts value and go
straight<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.600> crushing<00:01:01.899> process<00:01:02.640> there's

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
straight to the crushing process there's

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.120 
straight to the crushing process there's
the<00:01:03.820> car<00:01:04.030> over<00:01:04.300> there

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
the car over there

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
with the next hundred million cars that

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.499 
with the next hundred million cars that
are<00:01:44.890> heading<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.310> grave<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:46.180> decade

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
are heading to the grave this decade

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.819 
are heading to the grave this decade
there's<00:01:49.509> one<00:01:49.750> less<00:01:49.990> polluters<00:01:50.409> on<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.680> road

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
there's one less polluters on the road

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.980 
there's one less polluters on the road
that's<00:01:51.220> right<00:01:51.460> replace<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.630> with<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:52.750> newer

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
that's right replace it with a newer

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.350 
that's right replace it with a newer
more<00:01:53.259> fuel-efficient<00:01:53.950> vehicle<00:01:54.280> so<00:01:55.149> what's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
more fuel-efficient vehicle so what's

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.060 
more fuel-efficient vehicle so what's
going<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.539> happen<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.929> my<00:01:56.080> photograph<00:01:56.590> your
