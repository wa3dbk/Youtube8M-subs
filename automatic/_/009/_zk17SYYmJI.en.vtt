 half were for the whole 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.100
 zaragocista 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.530

 some appearance in attack of málaga in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.640

 in the second half something else has started 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.890

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.560
 with the goal that gave him the victory 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.770

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.960
 to the box 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.909

 of the final stretch of the match 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.780
