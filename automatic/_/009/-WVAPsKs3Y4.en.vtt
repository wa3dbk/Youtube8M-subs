00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.340
 or the one that we have tuberos and welcome to 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.520
 this new good video are 5 and 44 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.189
 exactly and well then today we are going to see 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.700
 let's do the rest good today I'm going to 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.550
 explain what is 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.110
 the encryption of bitlocker is the encryption is 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.890
 to be able to protect our files 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.840
 important in case of loss or in case 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.790
 they just want to make sure 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.210
 that nobody enters our archives 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.390
 not in this case we 're going to do we 're going to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.400
 exemplify by encrypting this partition that 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.250
 is the partition ok ok let's encrypt 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.130
 this partition with bitlocker very well 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.200
 at the time of us figures what is going 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.410
 to encrypt only the disk is all 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.180
 other documents sorry 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.520
 all the other partitions are going to be 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.220
 free totally free of any 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.850
 encryption very well then to be able 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.930
 encrypt what we're going to do is good I'm going 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.750
 to explain a little 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.430
 the compatibilities and other good 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.080
 bitlocker is only compatible I want 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.140
 narrow this down before they start 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.479
 code 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.820
 it is only compatible for windows 8 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.550
 windows 7 good basically from 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.820
 windows 7 to higher versions no 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.610
 windows 8 about 8.1 and the other versions 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.520
 that will come supposedly should 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.650
 also have the bitlocker encryption in 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.350
 this case is only compatible with these 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.720
 versions with these with these with these 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.330
 versions of operating systems not very 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.300
 Well, I'm talking half asshole 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.890
 but well let's go to ours, yes 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.509
 they also will not be able to open with windows 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.430
 shakespeare so have it very in 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.800
 I'm not sure if it's 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.810
 compatible with windows vista but good 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.410
 and who uses windows nowadays 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:02.259
 not good view to see what it is to see what 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.210
 more also do not try to encrypt what 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.380
 are 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.349
 what is your name 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.340
 your memory cats can be encrypted from power 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:17.450
 you can but in case you get 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.970
 or basically introduce to your phone 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.769
 mobile will not recognize them no no no no 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.080
 to be able to operate your device 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.750
 so be very careful in that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.160
 aspect this simply at the moment of 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.750
 we for example lose our 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.430
 device and have the weak encryption 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.040
 locker is not your files are going to be 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.379
 totally safe no one will be able to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.659
 enter I do not know to access our 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.519
 files just that simple so very 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.000
 ok let's start with this leads 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.120
 very much what is it let's go to 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.909
 what control panel panel 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.879
 control here and then we're going to go to 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.939
 what is bitlocker unit encryption ok 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.400
 very well here we will find all 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.109
 our partitions currently in 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.989
 our gestures and if we have a 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.359
 external storage device 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.000
 as one sees a memory card 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.680
 What we do is not going to look like 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.959
 also not the same appears here in this 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.439
 section and well what are we going in 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.720
 this case is this the partition to encrypt 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.920
 and let's activate let's click here 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.590
 where vito and doctor are activated 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.180
 and here we will see three options 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.800
 that would be to be able to decipher what 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.020
 is to be able to open to encryption what 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.450
 would use a password to join for 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.880
 the unit or use a smart card 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.490
 do not 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.860
 just as simple a smart card or 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.560
 one leads or we can also choose 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.090
 both of us in this case we're just going to use 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.290
 what is the password currently I 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.120
 this half media troll is interesting but 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.230
 well it's that simple it 's simple it's not 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.360
 almost the same steps very well to see what 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.990
 what we are going to do is introduce a 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.790
 password 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.360
 in this case I'm going to put the title 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.360
 okay 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.630
 oh my mother 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.519
 that's how it should be 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.519
 forgiveness is that sea 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.490
 ready and so we're going to put next and 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.710
 Well, in this case, what are we going 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.150
 to do is waiting for this to work 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.240
 basically the encryption is going to take a 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.310
 little bit that follows if they already have a 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.789
 big file let's say a partition 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.030
 super gigantic 100 200 300 gigas and 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:45.699
 who encrypt it will take a long time 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.229
 but if they have a disk more or less than 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.319
 is empty and there are not many files 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.819
 It will quickly encrypt them, not from 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.249
 fastest way then we're going to 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.309
 save 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:58.469
 the recovery key let's save from 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:01.289
 she in a file in this case I do not have 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.119
 no memory right now available 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.959
 let's save on documents we're going to 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:09.509
 save and ready is saved we will give 

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:12.320
 in next and well now we can 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.540
 start encryption 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.620
 and we finish we started forgiveness the encryption 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.790
 and then 1% is probably going to 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.790
 have to cut this 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.990
 good if you look at our unit 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.270
 which is being encrypted let's give us 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.560
 mind that it has occupied almost all 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.290
 space then do not be scared this is 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.230
 normal is basically normal already after 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.390
 of the encryption all that occupied space is 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.550
 is going to 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.340
 of encrypts or will be vacated 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.220
 basically hello how about friends and then 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.080
 good ya 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.170
 about 6 pm and then we 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.070
 restart my computer and I did the tutorial in 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:59.460
 an hour almost but good here as you can 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.770
 see the bitlocker encryption is already 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.080
 with your candadito if you want 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.350
 access this disk what will happen 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.600
 is that he will ask us what would be the 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.060
 password not in this case and if 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.130
 you forgot your password, you're going to ask for the 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.760
 recovery key that we keep in 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:20.850
 this case in what would be as it is called 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.650
 in documents I think and well it's like that 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.990
 easy to also recover the password if 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.110
 is that we forget so that yes no 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.000
 we must forget what this is not 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.070
 what is your name 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.830
 our recovery key in case of 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.580
 let's forget the password 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.099
 we unlock 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.750
 and we can just access our 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:48.169
 ok device so it's that simple already 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.910
 we return to we can save 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.100
 anything 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.550
 we can paste whatever it was not for 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.040
 example is not the gigantic map of 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.920
 what it is 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.970
 what is this called for lack what 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.970
 hit and now 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.680
 that yes no longer need a figure or not because 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.350
 at the moment of us copying and pasting 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.320
 you are not encrypting in this part not like this 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:18.890
 that at the time of us what is 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.840
 called restarting our computer this 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.300
 again it's going to be blocked again 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.730
 that simple, so remember 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.190
 also so that to be able to return to 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:31.910
 disable in this case what is the bit 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.470
 locker if you do not like or want 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.900
 remove that partition only 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.120
 off and eliminate that simple 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.890
 very well that has been all for today I hope 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.860
 that this tutorial has been of 

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.670
 utility of some utility and then until 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.440
 the next 

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.370
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel and 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:53.040
 visit the one in 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:53.040
 basically on the web of this tv I think
