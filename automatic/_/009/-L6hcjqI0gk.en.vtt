good<00:00:12.360> works<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> west<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.469> unless<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.799> get

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
good works on the west so unless you get

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.250 
good works on the west so unless you get
in<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> nutrients<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.790> I'm<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.570> nutrition

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
in the nutrients and I'm the nutrition

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.650 
in the nutrients and I'm the nutrition
that<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.470> need<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.980> gone<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> West<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.699> think

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
that you need it's gone the West I think

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.760 
that you need it's gone the West I think
it's<00:00:18.779> going<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.020> what<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.320> call<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.650> an

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
it's going to be what we call it an

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.529 
it's going to be what we call it an
holistic<00:00:19.980> approach<00:00:20.400> first<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.270> train

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
holistic approach first of all you train

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.929 
holistic approach first of all you train
hard<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.990> get<00:00:22.500> plenty<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.830> rest<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.519> eat<00:00:23.699> very

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
hard you get plenty of rest you eat very

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.700 
hard you get plenty of rest you eat very
well<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.900> take<00:00:25.170> supplements<00:00:25.439> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
well and then you take supplements on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.740 
well and then you take supplements on
top<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.189> take<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.460> Connecticut<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.570> sort

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
top to take in Connecticut and that sort

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.570 
top to take in Connecticut and that sort
of<00:00:27.779> regime<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.320> are<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.470> well<00:00:28.800> hydrated<00:00:29.189> and

of regime we are very well hydrated and
you<00:00:29.789> will<00:00:29.939> get<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> benefits<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.140> does

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you will get the benefits what it does

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
you will get the benefits what it does
is<00:00:31.500> allows<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> recover<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.180> when

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
is allows you to recover so then when

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
is allows you to recover so then when
you<00:00:33.329> come<00:00:33.450> back<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> tree<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:33.930> again<00:00:34.140> you

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
you come back the tree and again you

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.440 
you come back the tree and again you
more<00:00:34.440> energy<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.920> also<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.940> repairs<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
more energy but also it repairs the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.910 
more energy but also it repairs the
damage<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.809> takes<00:00:37.170> place<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.680> session

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
damage that takes place in that session

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.500 
damage that takes place in that session
so<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.340> you're<00:00:38.489> lifting<00:00:38.610> weights<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.360> get

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
so when you're lifting weights you get

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.330 
so when you're lifting weights you get
small<00:00:39.780> micro<00:00:40.140> tears<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.530> muscles<00:00:40.800> by
