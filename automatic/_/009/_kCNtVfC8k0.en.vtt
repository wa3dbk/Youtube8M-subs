00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.569
 after having seen this we will have all of us one 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.289
 conviction that the rosary is a model of prayer 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:09.189
 why 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.619
 it is sustained as we said in the Lord's Prayer 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.609
 because it is the fulfillment of our Lord's nsa adventure of those who 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.230
 they hear the word of God and keep it 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.720
 because its duration inspired by the most holy trinity by the spirit 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.999
 holy 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.499
 because they are fine 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.899
 model of community prayer of prayer 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.800
 family 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.789
 look at what St. Paul tells us about that prayer in the letter to the Ephesians 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.170
 there he tells us 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.090
 speaking precisely of your community prayer 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.190
 they recite among you psalms hymns and inspired songs 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.470
 Almunia songs in your heart to the Lord 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
 that is the holy rosary 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.329
 now the holy rosary is a repetitive prayer 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.250
 if it is a repetitive sentence 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.840
 but it is a repetitive prayer 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.170
 because it is a single lettative sentence is a psalmody that is sung 'let us come from 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.740
 there he had come elected of joy of joy 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.360
 and that's why it's repetitive. 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.890
 some of the psalms 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.390
 they always say because their love is eternal because their mercy is eternal 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.950
 Psalm 135 136 repeated badly must 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.910
 twenty times that prayer because his love is eternal 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.670
 that's the repetitive way, that's the joy 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 that's the pain 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 repetitive and small salt processing 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.920
 There are many who do not mind that anger but it bothers them because they do not pray 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.090
 with the heart 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.280
 there they have that old virus song 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.820
 if the progress or says the quintile 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.460
 yes the 2011 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.680
 if I do it well 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.640
 if the environment was seen 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.060
 it separates us is the repetition 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.690
 young people are not listening 150 times and with the song over and over again 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.899
 why 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
 this year 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.629
 this you are in love 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.529

 our most holy mother the rosary sexy 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.789
 a song with the heart of the most holy 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.819
 our bet mind and our heart is going 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.769
 to the contemplation of its mysteries of repetitive use that is the function of 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:33.649
 repeat 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.719
 precisely to distract us 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.469
 and that our mind and our heart goes away the contemplation of the 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.889
 mysteries 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.559
 then in rosary is such a sentence if it keeps what you say 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.739
