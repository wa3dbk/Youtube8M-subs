00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
well our philosophy is anyway that's on

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.290 
well our philosophy is anyway that's on
the<00:00:54.920> field<00:00:55.190> they've<00:00:55.850> been<00:00:55.940> in<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.120> program

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
the field they've been in the program

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.000 
the field they've been in the program
long<00:00:56.660> enough<00:00:56.900> we<00:00:57.230> expect<00:00:57.590> them<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:57.800> get<00:00:57.890> the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
long enough we expect them to get the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.970 
long enough we expect them to get the
job<00:00:58.190> though<00:01:02.440> approach<00:01:03.440> has<00:01:03.620> always<00:01:03.680> been<00:01:03.920> the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
job though approach has always been the

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.249 
job though approach has always been the
same<00:01:04.250> as<00:01:04.759> far<00:01:05.089> as<00:01:05.360> don't<00:01:05.750> take<00:01:05.899> a<00:01:05.930> looking<00:01:06.170> at

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
same as far as don't take a looking at

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.920 
same as far as don't take a looking at
what<00:01:06.380> we're<00:01:06.500> doing<00:01:06.640> take<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.759> looking<00:01:08.720> at<00:01:08.810> what

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
what we're doing take it looking at what

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.300 
what we're doing take it looking at what
we're<00:01:09.080> doing<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.470> see<00:01:09.710> now<00:01:09.830> would<00:01:10.009> get<00:01:10.130> better

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
we're doing and see now would get better

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.600 
we're doing and see now would get better
at<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:10.970> then<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:12.830> know<00:01:12.920> seeing<00:01:13.399> what

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
at that and then you know seeing what

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.690 
at that and then you know seeing what
our<00:01:13.729> strengths<00:01:14.090> are<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.740> try<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.800> use<00:01:16.220> those

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
our strengths are and try to use those

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.730 
our strengths are and try to use those
strengths<00:01:17.119> within<00:01:17.420> our<00:01:17.570> system<00:01:17.780> we're

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
strengths within our system we're

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.930 
strengths within our system we're
looking<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.040> be<00:01:19.160> a<00:01:19.190> little<00:01:19.280> bit<00:01:19.369> more<00:01:19.520> balanced

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
looking to be a little bit more balanced

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.030 
looking to be a little bit more balanced
compared<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.570> last<00:01:20.720> last<00:01:21.380> year<00:01:21.590> we<00:01:21.740> kind<00:01:21.950> of

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
compared to last last year we kind of

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.029 
compared to last last year we kind of
had<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:23.110> featured<00:01:24.110> back<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.619> this<00:01:24.710> year<00:01:24.890> we're

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
had a featured back and this year we're

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.090 
had a featured back and this year we're
looking<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.340> year<00:01:26.680> I'm<00:01:27.680> gonna<00:01:27.830> do<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> little

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
looking this year I'm gonna do a little

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.070 
looking this year I'm gonna do a little
some<00:01:28.280> things<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.550> little<00:01:28.640> bit<00:01:28.759> different

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.140 

far<00:01:33.650> as<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.130> skill<00:01:34.430> goes<00:01:34.640> we're<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.910> little<00:01:35.000> bit

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
far as the skill goes we're a little bit

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.740 
far as the skill goes we're a little bit
more<00:01:35.270> balanced<00:01:35.750> we're<00:01:35.980> feel<00:01:36.980> comfortable

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
more balanced we're feel comfortable

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.970 
more balanced we're feel comfortable
putting<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.900> ball<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.110> bunch<00:01:39.620> of<00:01:39.710> different

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
putting the ball and bunch of different

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.220 
putting the ball and bunch of different
kids<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:42.620> then<00:01:43.130> I<00:01:43.490> just<00:01:43.700> think<00:01:43.940> as<00:01:44.930> far<00:01:44.960> as

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
kids and and then I just think as far as

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.020 
kids and and then I just think as far as
technique<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.770> concerned<00:01:46.190> we're<00:01:46.460> we're<00:01:47.000> a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
technique is concerned we're we're a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.520 
technique is concerned we're we're a
little<00:01:47.300> bit<00:01:47.480> ahead<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.720> where<00:01:48.050> we<00:01:48.080> usually<00:01:48.320> are

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
little bit ahead of where we usually are

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.250 
little bit ahead of where we usually are
at<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.890> time<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.600> we're<00:01:50.600> excited<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.990> see<00:01:51.140> how

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
at this time so we're excited to see how

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.780 
at this time so we're excited to see how
it<00:01:51.410> looks<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:52.100> real<00:01:52.640> game<00:01:53.030> situation<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:58.580> kids

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
it looks a real game situation the kids

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.280 
it looks a real game situation the kids
came<00:01:59.000> up<00:01:59.120> with<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.420> goal<00:01:59.600> do<00:01:59.870> you<00:01:59.960> make<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
came up with the goal do you make the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.480 
came up with the goal do you make the
