00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.190
 another trend on the eurobike in 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.630
 friedrichshafen are disc brakes am 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.310
 road bike there are some manufacturers 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.070
 are there very soon one 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.710
 I found prototypes with me ida 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.439
 namely the discreet that is a full 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.899
 However, the carbon framework is not up 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.349
 racing is aligned as well 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.579
 tours variants allows sayings 28 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.829
 Tires can be mounted 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.690
 Aprons can be grown and 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.850
 the big advantage of disc brakes am 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.370
 renntag is certainly in this 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.440
 the perfect braking effect in 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.690
 all life or weather conditions 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.730
 no night flights anymore the lead 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.339
 needs until it really slows down but 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.510
 a braking force from front to back too 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.969
 100 percent 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.859
 in the pension sector also not yet 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.359
 admittedly because the ut then has 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.239
 no release granted completely different than 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.280
 in cross sport and basically that is 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.380
 Of course, then an announcement to the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.670
 rim manufacturer speak one needs 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.010
 no brakes franken more on carbon 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.140
 If you are in racing times 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.230
 arrived is the reduction of the mass 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.580
 it shifts from the outside as well 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.650
 a bit more inside so 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.010
 basically a very interesting one 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.900
 things and many things that are still to be clarified 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.580
 may have to be in the moment 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.290
 Carbon range also the heat dissipation 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.450
 because you can imagine such a 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.789
 the disc will be very hot and carbon 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.350
 then sure he'll heat up in heat but 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.360
 Here you have my wheels already 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.060
 some thoughts made where else 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.799
 Of course, and yes I am 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.420
 curious to what extent the trend also 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.420
 then times will prevail in racing 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.679
 it will depend on the world association but 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.060
 always brake safely even with 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.420
 Wet for professionals is certainly 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.420
 a theme
