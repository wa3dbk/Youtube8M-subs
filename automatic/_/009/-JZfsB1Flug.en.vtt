buffed<00:00:20.250> considerably<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.119> recent<00:00:21.150> patches<00:00:21.900> so

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
buffed considerably in recent patches so

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
buffed considerably in recent patches so
considering<00:00:22.680> these<00:00:22.769> guns<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.279> two<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.519> my

considering these guns are two of my

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
considering these guns are two of my
most<00:00:23.970> used<00:00:24.240> weapons<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.869> thought<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> would<00:00:25.470> be

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
most used weapons I thought it would be

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.170 
most used weapons I thought it would be
a<00:00:25.650> good<00:00:25.830> idea<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.250> run<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.490> through<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.970> how

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
a good idea to run you through just how

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.689 
a good idea to run you through just how
they've<00:00:27.390> changed<00:00:27.769> both<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.830> these<00:00:29.099> weapons<00:00:29.519> do

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
they've changed both of these weapons do

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.160 
they've changed both of these weapons do
quite<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> bit<00:00:30.119> more<00:00:30.300> damage<00:00:30.689> than<00:00:30.990> they

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
quite a bit more damage than they

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
quite a bit more damage than they
originally<00:00:31.289> did<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.099> they<00:00:32.279> both<00:00:32.520> are<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> fair

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
originally did and they both are a fair

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.110 
originally did and they both are a fair
bit<00:00:33.239> more<00:00:33.450> accurate<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.590> m39<00:00:35.070> EMR<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:35.910> does

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
bit more accurate the m39 EMR now does

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.660 
bit more accurate the m39 EMR now does
45<00:00:36.510> damage<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.410> 15<00:00:37.770> meters<00:00:38.160> which<00:00:38.370> drops

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
45 damage out to 15 meters which drops

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
45 damage out to 15 meters which drops
off<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> its<00:00:39.090> minimum<00:00:39.420> damage<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.989> 38<00:00:40.440> at<00:00:40.680> 80

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
off to its minimum damage of 38 at 80

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.240 
off to its minimum damage of 38 at 80
meters<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:42.030> SKS<00:00:42.510> now<00:00:42.690> does<00:00:42.930> 43<00:00:43.260> damage<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
meters the SKS now does 43 damage out to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
meters the SKS now does 43 damage out to
8<00:00:44.399> meters<00:00:44.789> which<00:00:44.940> drops<00:00:45.210> off<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> its<00:00:45.690> minimum

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
damage of 34 at 60 meters what this

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.650 
damage of 34 at 60 meters what this
means<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.530> both<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.129> m39<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> SKS

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
means is that both the m39 and the SKS

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
means is that both the m39 and the SKS
now<00:00:52.079> only<00:00:52.350> need<00:00:52.620> three<00:00:52.949> bullets<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.340> kill<00:00:53.640> at

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
all ranges the exception to this is when

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.799 
all ranges the exception to this is when

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
your target is running the defensive

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.660 
your target is running the defensive

kill<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:12.180> isn't<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> huge<00:01:12.990> problem<00:01:13.470> if

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
kill this isn't really a huge problem if

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
kill this isn't really a huge problem if
you<00:01:13.740> use<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.070> SKS<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.700> close<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> mid<00:01:15.299> ranges

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you use the SKS at close to mid ranges

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.240 
you use the SKS at close to mid ranges
but<00:01:16.140> when<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.350> try<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.680> reach<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.040> those

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
but when you try and reach out to those

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.010 
but when you try and reach out to those
longer<00:01:17.610> ranges<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.150> can't<00:01:18.330> expect<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.750> drop

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
longer ranges you can't expect to drop

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.100 
longer ranges you can't expect to drop
every<00:01:19.350> target<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> shoot<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.400> the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.680 
has improved more than the SKS though
because<00:02:11.099> accuracy<00:02:11.760> was<00:02:11.910> always<00:02:12.239> its<00:02:12.480> biggest

it<00:03:03.750> did<00:03:03.900> for<00:03:04.080> me<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.410> battlefield<00:03:04.920> 3<00:03:05.010> which<00:03:05.610> is

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
it did for me in battlefield 3 which is

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.520 
it did for me in battlefield 3 which is
that<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.240> stealthy<00:03:06.630> flanking<00:03:07.050> weapon<00:03:07.380> as

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
that of a stealthy flanking weapon as

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.170 
that of a stealthy flanking weapon as
long<00:03:08.040> as<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.400> have<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.640> element<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.030> surprise

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
long as you have the element of surprise

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.540 
long as you have the element of surprise
on<00:03:09.450> your<00:03:09.750> side<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.230> SKS<00:03:10.740> can<00:03:10.920> easily<00:03:11.370> go

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
on your side the SKS can easily go

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.190 
on your side the SKS can easily go
toe-to-toe<00:03:11.820> with<00:03:12.090> automatic<00:03:12.750> weapons<00:03:13.050> in

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
toe-to-toe with automatic weapons in

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200 
toe-to-toe with automatic weapons in
close<00:03:13.470> quarters<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.430> my<00:03:14.580> opinion<00:03:15.000> you're

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
close quarters so in my opinion you're

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.090 
close quarters so in my opinion you're
much<00:03:15.360> better<00:03:15.630> off<00:03:15.690> using<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.260> SKS<00:03:16.740> in<00:03:16.920> close

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
much better off using the SKS in close

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.800 
much better off using the SKS in close
quarters<00:03:17.490> situations<00:03:18.120> which<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.390> what<00:03:18.690> it's

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
quarters situations which is what it's

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.440 
quarters situations which is what it's
better<00:03:18.960> at<00:03:19.520> so<00:03:20.520> what<00:03:20.820> attachments<00:03:21.300> would<00:03:21.420> I

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
better at so what attachments would I

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.360 
better at so what attachments would I
suggest<00:03:21.750> for<00:03:22.080> these<00:03:22.320> weapons<00:03:22.770> post<00:03:23.040> patch

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
suggest for these weapons post patch

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.880 
suggest for these weapons post patch
well<00:03:24.240> like<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.660> said<00:03:24.720> earlier<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.470> still<00:03:25.680> like<00:03:25.860> to

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
well like I said earlier I still like to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.370 
well like I said earlier I still like to
run<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> stubby<00:03:26.580> grip<00:03:26.640> with<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:26.970> m39<00:03:27.510> Amr<00:03:28.110> and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
run the stubby grip with the m39 Amr and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.050 
run the stubby grip with the m39 Amr and
I<00:03:28.560> probably<00:03:28.770> still<00:03:29.040> would<00:03:29.430> recommend<00:03:29.910> running

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
I probably still would recommend running

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.820 
I probably still would recommend running
with<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.360> one<00:03:30.540> time<00:03:30.810> sight<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.350> magnifier

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
with a one time sight and a magnifier

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.620 
with a one time sight and a magnifier
for<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> barrel<00:03:33.090> attachment

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
for a barrel attachment

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.090 
for a barrel attachment
I'd<00:03:33.690> probably<00:03:33.900> edge<00:03:34.320> towards<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.920> flash

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
I'd probably edge towards the flash

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.710 
I'd probably edge towards the flash
hider<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:35.880> if<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.090> still<00:03:36.330> were<00:03:36.420> having

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
hider but if you still were having

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.240 
hider but if you still were having
issues<00:03:36.870> controlling<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> kick<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.070> gun

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
issues controlling the kick of the gun

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.920 
issues controlling the kick of the gun
the<00:03:38.670> muzzle<00:03:38.970> break<00:03:39.120> isn't<00:03:39.450> going<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.630> hurt<00:03:39.750> you

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
the muzzle break isn't going to hurt you

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.210 
the muzzle break isn't going to hurt you
quite<00:03:40.140> as<00:03:40.260> much<00:03:40.410> as<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.800> used<00:03:40.830> to

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
quite as much as it used to

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.100 
quite as much as it used to
you'll<00:03:41.820> still<00:03:42.090> get<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.390> accuracy<00:03:42.960> penalty

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
you'll still get the accuracy penalty

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.170 
you'll still get the accuracy penalty
when<00:03:43.500> firing<00:03:43.770> fast<00:03:44.160> but<00:03:44.670> if<00:03:44.760> you're<00:03:44.880> taking

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
when firing fast but if you're taking

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.610 
when firing fast but if you're taking
longer<00:03:45.390> range<00:03:45.630> shots<00:03:45.960> and<00:03:46.200> you're<00:03:46.380> letting

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
longer range shots and you're letting

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.080 
longer range shots and you're letting
your<00:03:46.710> gun<00:03:46.890> settle<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.430> shouldn't<00:03:47.760> affect<00:03:47.940> your

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
your gun settle it shouldn't affect your

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.410 
your gun settle it shouldn't affect your
accuracy<00:03:48.600> at<00:03:48.720> all<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:50.130> SKS<00:03:50.610> like<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:51.000> mentioned

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
accuracy at all the SKS like I mentioned

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.150 
accuracy at all the SKS like I mentioned
is<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.600> great<00:03:51.870> weapon<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.440> stealth<00:03:52.680> loadout

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
is a great weapon for a stealth loadout

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.650 
is a great weapon for a stealth loadout
and<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.460> works<00:03:53.610> pretty<00:03:53.820> well<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.300> conjunction

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
and it works pretty well in conjunction

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.330 
and it works pretty well in conjunction
with<00:03:54.870> an<00:03:55.050> aggressive<00:03:55.260> recon<00:03:55.620> play<00:03:56.010> style

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
with an aggressive recon play style

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.790 
with an aggressive recon play style
using<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.790> motion<00:03:56.970> balls<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:58.200> suppressor<00:03:58.650> is

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
using the motion balls the suppressor is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.470 
using the motion balls the suppressor is
my<00:03:58.950> preferred<00:03:59.340> barrel<00:03:59.760> attachment<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.390> I

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
my preferred barrel attachment and I

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.000 
my preferred barrel attachment and I
usually<00:04:00.660> run<00:04:00.960> this<00:04:01.170> gun<00:04:01.350> with<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.560> one<00:04:01.770> time

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
usually run this gun with a one time

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.100 
usually run this gun with a one time
sight<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.910> laser<00:04:03.120> sight<00:04:03.390> works<00:04:03.690> well<00:04:03.900> in

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
sight the laser sight works well in

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.050 
sight the laser sight works well in
conjunction<00:04:04.440> with<00:04:04.620> an<00:04:04.830> Ergo<00:04:05.130> grip<00:04:05.160> for<00:04:05.760> really

in your face running gun tactics but the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.770 
in your face running gun tactics but the
magnifier<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.850> stubby<00:04:09.210> grip<00:04:09.240> will<00:04:09.510> help<00:04:09.690> you

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
magnifier and stubby grip will help you

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.270 
magnifier and stubby grip will help you
be<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.930> little<00:04:10.110> more<00:04:10.350> accurate<00:04:10.830> if<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.100> play

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
be a little more accurate if you play

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.310 
be a little more accurate if you play
more<00:04:11.460> passively<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.690> heavy<00:04:12.870> barrel<00:04:13.050> will

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
more passively the heavy barrel will

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.140 
more passively the heavy barrel will
make<00:04:13.470> this<00:04:13.590> gun<00:04:13.830> very<00:04:14.040> deadly<00:04:14.370> out<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.850> forty

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
make this gun very deadly out to forty

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.700 
make this gun very deadly out to forty
or<00:04:15.240> fifty<00:04:15.330> meters<00:04:15.840> but<00:04:16.109> like<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.380> said<00:04:16.560> before

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:16.710 
or fifty meters but like I said before

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.830 
or fifty meters but like I said before
if<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.250> want<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.460> DMR<00:04:17.850> for<00:04:18.060> longer<00:04:18.299> range<00:04:18.420> shots

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
if you want a DMR for longer range shots

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.390 
if you want a DMR for longer range shots
there<00:04:19.260> are<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.500> whole<00:04:19.799> heap<00:04:20.040> of<00:04:20.070> better

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
there are a whole heap of better

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.750 
there are a whole heap of better
alternatives<00:04:21.380> so<00:04:22.380> last<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:22.800> not<00:04:23.070> least<00:04:23.370> have

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
alternatives so last but not least have

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.700 
alternatives so last but not least have
my<00:04:24.060> tactics<00:04:24.570> changed<00:04:24.960> for<00:04:25.140> these<00:04:25.260> weapons

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
my tactics changed for these weapons

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.860 
my tactics changed for these weapons
well<00:04:26.640> not<00:04:27.060> really<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.660> M

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
well not really the M

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.020 
well not really the M
39<00:04:28.199> is<00:04:28.470> still<00:04:28.740> better<00:04:28.979> suited<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.370> larger<00:04:29.820> maps

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
39 is still better suited to larger maps

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.909 
39 is still better suited to larger maps
and<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.360> find<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.720> works<00:04:30.870> best<00:04:31.169> in<00:04:31.440> obliteration

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
and I find it works best in obliteration
