00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
of and dunking wrong some of the maps we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
of and dunking wrong some of the maps we
do<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.070> level<00:01:32.490> design<00:01:32.630> different

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
do have good level design different

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.219 
do have good level design different
level<00:01:33.900> design<00:01:34.110> which<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.470> good<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.340> my<00:01:35.460> eyes

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
level design which is good in my eyes

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.010 
level design which is good in my eyes
it's<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.619> linear<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.850> no<00:01:39.210> call<00:01:39.509> GT<00:01:39.780> map

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it's not as linear as a no call GT map

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.520 
it's not as linear as a no call GT map
oh<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.509> some<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> best<00:01:43.140> level

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
oh I see I think some of the best level

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.149 
oh I see I think some of the best level
design<00:01:43.740> came<00:01:44.040> from<00:01:44.070> halo<00:01:44.990> which<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.710> obviously

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
design came from halo which is obviously

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.780 
design came from halo which is obviously
a<00:01:47.430> brilliant<00:01:48.299> front<00:01:48.540> chest<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:49.579> is<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
a brilliant front chest see is the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.850 
a brilliant front chest see is the
reason<00:01:51.090> why<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.570> sounds<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.439> bear<00:01:52.680> in

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
reason why I think sounds it's bear in

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.310 
reason why I think sounds it's bear in
this<00:01:52.979> game<00:01:53.220> than<00:01:53.430> any<00:01:53.670> other<00:01:54.090> game<00:01:54.360> versus

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
this game than any other game versus

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.160 
this game than any other game versus
doesn't<00:01:55.530> put<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.799> weight<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.130> obvious<00:01:57.170> but

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
doesn't put on weight out obvious but

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.350 
doesn't put on weight out obvious but
also<00:01:59.090> you<00:02:00.090> can't<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.810> bullets<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.740> game

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
also you can't see bullets in this game

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.399 
also you can't see bullets in this game
yeah

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
yeah

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.330 
yeah
and<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.880> comes<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.420> handy<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:07.499> if<00:02:08.190> you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and that comes in handy because if you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.680 
and that comes in handy because if you
