00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
obviously uninfected is a much easier to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.900 
obviously uninfected is a much easier to
get<00:00:20.340> MOA<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:21.090> there<00:00:21.359> no<00:00:21.600> more<00:00:21.890> Dom<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:23.189> or

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
get MOA be there no more Dom or or

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.359 
get MOA be there no more Dom or or
whatever<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.830> uninfected<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.130> much<00:00:26.340> easier

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
whatever but uninfected is much easier

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.960 
whatever but uninfected is much easier
