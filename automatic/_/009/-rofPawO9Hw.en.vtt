00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 strike 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.779
 a lot because I don't like a nice bow tie 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.699
 and in a while and of course I die 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.349
 after that I did something special 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.759
 and campsites and will just see you 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.540
 as the game plus continues 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.280
 previous 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.870
 and use the set bowl in this game play 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.760
 I also use the trend here and me 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.739
 use the level here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.879
 level it is a new type 8 goes 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.050
 shopping thinner 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.280
 but I want to be there with you today too 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.690
 about i have use the zakat 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.730
 tell the story with its numbers 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.200
 it insists and we purse set up 'that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.270
 you have to pay attention now because it really is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.010
 broken bad but 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.690
 and so also use the heel pilot and me 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.489
 personally find the score in strips 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.710
 call of duty ghosts really pure the pure 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.370
 current but have the esl strike package 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.500
 for example you the de gardon de gardon 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.479
 is dealt you to use for that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 defends you a little he is going to growl 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.030
 if there is an emmy that says about it 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.890
 have seen the head 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 he had payback there every time 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.460
 for you but if you web it yourself is one 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.810
 chill 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.580
 there is something against it that is real 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.560
 complete complete bullshit because I have one 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.600
 very often so much stupid nation 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.979
 and then, for example, I fill someone and that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.960
 comes just suddenly dog comes 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.670
 jump back or someone chilly and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.829
 then that 100 literal comes from the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.900
 other side of the folder to me 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.909
 to make that payback and me 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.200
 find it personally so seems annoying 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.150
 at the gardon 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.130
 but he is not really strong in mine 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.170
 eyes the goat by the prim that smokers 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.850
 there is of course 3 fun even he is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.890
 in one it's kind of haelst to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.210
 along with the predator miss oh and even this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.110
 but also to use large movie 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.450
 not really 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.670
 7 score piece worth then I continue to 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.170
 the super high the paddle hain't ordinary 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.930
 normal helicopter 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.030
 that thing is chill, but in my eyes it's cold 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.710
 in little too little to just a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.409
 to exist all the time that you are also 9 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.030
 need kills for it so you make it like 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.360
 the more you call it his 9 kills make it 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.399
 roughly i think 2 3 kills me like that 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.420
 just stay in the mold all the time so you 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.370
 just not that much of it 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.599
 then you gonna get them by watching you 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.420
 so already had a lot and he through 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.010
 viewer 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.569
 Mr Arrow is it anyway right away 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.770
 sense that I manage that 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.840
 you also don't get that many kills 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.819
 in domination as your example 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.920
 You don't really have spans either 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.000
 as you also had in bollendorf 3 was in 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.760
 call of duty ghosts again a ghost 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.349
 protect of about 12 seconds 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.459
 just a spawned 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.290
 so there you really have again 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.940
 nothing at all about the only thing you do then 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.200
 so if you are up to date here it will get it 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.220
 and you try someone 's child's net 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.750
 spawned 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.030
 so you only get this markers 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.769
 that also shoots is nice on none yet 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.560
 crazy by watching the other score strip 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.459
 like that you have the highest the 18th point 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.630
 needed for that 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.580
 I also just don't like film too 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.260
 so I use the essence white papers 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.060
 use it as i found when got stuff 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.080
 but stupid this 10 and this free especially 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.340
 Use on this with only to hair 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.739
 specialist because I bypass the IJssel 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.000
 ron is really pure because there is not really 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.000
 more chilling things are in it 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.769
 worth twelve points for 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.269
 to pick up so then you go again 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.920
 watch the site presses swipe ex 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.810
 I never actually use it in Willendorf 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.100
 I've never used three of them 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.000
 and now just never use it again 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.040
 because the only thing you do with that 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.930
 actually doing is supporting your team 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.110
 so the support battle quest is nothing for it 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.610
 me 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.650
 I do like the team sometimes one 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.540
 little support but mostly speak 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.700
 I am solo and I don't want to just be 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.709
 random people I don't know suddenly become one 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.060
 giving river to give an oracle 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.430
 to his place 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.060
 neighborhood or plastic bottles for the facade 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.440
 ever 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.400
 So which do I actually never so 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.320
 eating is left over 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.609
 especially since pass list is natural 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.280
 what you have to use if you can 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.620
 real and completely in parts to you 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.530
 your own inspiration you are a bit more and more 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.450
 a player who plays on sound and therefore 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.400
 I may sound perth to BSV that the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.049
 card on rest then you put it anyway 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.239
 is your edge unity et cetera along and 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.100
 player who likes both things 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.070
 use your agility together with 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.590
 for example dead silence and you can do it 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.390
 so really enter to your own taste with 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.160
 the special is it is also because the 35 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.250
 pucks in it and of course there are 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.500
 also 35 perth in because every problem now 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.450
 has become a separate park in blackops 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.650
 two you also just had a certain one 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.430
 fair but I could not get them pro 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.230
 and now what you get in morpher 3 it 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.060
 pro purge system and of course you had 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.609
 you could still get a pro from the per 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.650
 additional items there and the are clean 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.450
 u classified into two different perths 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.310
 because I think it's pretty chill he saw that 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.659
 i got the kem strike from my graphics 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.530
 and I also think that is a bit younger 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.310
 psychology the coast 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.650
 you ca n't 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.810
 There are more pitch bets this way 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.700
 pick up every airpix by sorting it out 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.610
 and that keeps is a you get 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.200
 for example a kill while you are on the 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.120
 Ground you had the kill while you were on it 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.620
 you squat down you need a jumpsuit 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.750
 make a headshot you have to 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.520
 someone who mediate you with someone nodding 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.380
 and so you are perfect pick and so not 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.480
 really more method to get your perfect 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.380
 by means of a struct a so that 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.520
 I think it's a pity 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.440
 the game is over here because I call her 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.660
 cam ' fight in and clean up the 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.980
 contest comes first its a lot 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.240
 the that the 15 choice that I still know her 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.230
 once a win because i got him out of church 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.610
 press 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.139
 deaf look people don't forget to like 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.580
 and until the next time try late 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.280
 both we also share your opinion behind what you 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.280
 finds of the score street at
