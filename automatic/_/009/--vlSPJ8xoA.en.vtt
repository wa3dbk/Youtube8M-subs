the different options that are available

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.029 
the different options that are available
for<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:40.030> same<00:00:40.239> diameter<00:00:40.780> fan<00:00:41.019> so<00:00:41.710> these<00:00:41.890> are

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
for the same diameter fan so these are

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.549 
for the same diameter fan so these are
all<00:00:42.159> 16<00:00:42.789> inch<00:00:42.969> fan<00:00:43.210> blade<00:00:43.449> assemblies<00:00:43.989> this<00:00:44.350> is

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
all 16 inch fan blade assemblies this is

all 16 inch fan blade assemblies this is
a<00:00:44.589> straight<00:00:44.949> bladed<00:00:45.190> fan<00:00:45.309> and<00:00:45.760> this<00:00:45.969> is<00:00:46.089> an<00:00:46.210> S

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
a straight bladed fan and this is an S

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.689 
a straight bladed fan and this is an S
bladed<00:00:46.719> fan<00:00:46.749> so<00:00:47.589> this<00:00:47.769> straight<00:00:48.100> blade<00:00:48.370> fan

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
bladed fan so this straight blade fan

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.849 
bladed fan so this straight blade fan
you<00:00:49.120> can<00:00:49.239> see<00:00:49.449> how<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.659> shroud<00:00:50.079> is<00:00:50.109> flatter

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
you can see how the shroud is flatter

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.309 
you can see how the shroud is flatter
right<00:00:51.129> here<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:52.149> this<00:00:52.329> dimension<00:00:52.539> right<00:00:53.019> here

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
right here so this dimension right here

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.349 
right here so this dimension right here
is<00:00:53.409> about<00:00:53.649> one<00:00:53.799> and<00:00:53.949> a<00:00:54.010> quarter<00:00:54.370> inches<00:00:54.729> up<00:00:55.030> at

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
is about one and a quarter inches up at

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.759 
is about one and a quarter inches up at
the<00:00:55.449> motor<00:00:55.690> right<00:00:55.929> here<00:00:55.989> it's<00:00:56.409> three<00:00:56.649> and

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
the motor right here it's three and

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.099 
the motor right here it's three and
three<00:00:56.920> sixteenths<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:57.670> next<00:00:58.420> step<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:58.780> B<00:00:58.899> the

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
three sixteenths the next step is B the

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.799 
three sixteenths the next step is B the
cyclone<00:00:59.589> fan<00:00:59.859> here<00:01:00.249> now<00:01:00.699> this<00:01:00.850> is<00:01:00.909> an<00:01:01.209> S<00:01:01.359> bladed

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
cyclone fan here now this is an S bladed

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.599 
cyclone fan here now this is an S bladed
fan<00:01:01.839> so<00:01:02.350> it<00:01:02.469> is<00:01:02.589> going<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:02.829> have<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.219> little<00:01:03.399> bit

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
fan so it is going to have a little bit

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.880 
fan so it is going to have a little bit
quieter<00:01:04.089> fan<00:01:04.330> operation<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.470> other<00:01:05.619> thing

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
quieter fan operation the other thing

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.920 
quieter fan operation the other thing
that<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.130> ring<00:01:06.400> around<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.909> fan<00:01:07.180> does<00:01:07.479> is<00:01:07.750> it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
that the ring around the fan does is it

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.630 
that the ring around the fan does is it
helps<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.229> support<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.740> blade<00:01:09.040> in<00:01:09.280> case<00:01:09.460> of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
helps to support the blade in case of

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.460 
helps to support the blade in case of
you<00:01:09.760> mud<00:01:10.120> or<00:01:10.390> rocks<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:10.900> can<00:01:11.050> get<00:01:11.200> up<00:01:11.320> in

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
you mud or rocks that can get up in

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.740 
you mud or rocks that can get up in
there<00:01:11.590> for<00:01:11.800> off-road<00:01:12.250> applications<00:01:12.570> now<00:01:13.570> this

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
there for off-road applications now this

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.630 
there for off-road applications now this
fan<00:01:14.020> moves<00:01:14.260> twenty-five<00:01:14.740> hundred<00:01:15.040> CFM<00:01:15.280> which

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
fan moves twenty-five hundred CFM which

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.190 
fan moves twenty-five hundred CFM which
is<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.880> minimum<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:16.240> we<00:01:16.450> recommend<00:01:16.930> for<00:01:17.170> a

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
is the minimum that we recommend for a

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.570 
is the minimum that we recommend for a
v8<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.880> next<00:01:19.270> step<00:01:19.540> is<00:01:19.810> this<00:01:20.320> 180<00:01:20.740> fan<00:01:21.010> here<00:01:21.370> so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
v8 the next step is this 180 fan here so

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.480 
v8 the next step is this 180 fan here so
this<00:01:21.730> is<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.000> 16<00:01:22.480> inch<00:01:22.690> fan<00:01:23.170> blade<00:01:23.890> with<00:01:24.460> a

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
this is a 16 inch fan blade with a

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.820 
this is a 16 inch fan blade with a
shroud<00:01:24.850> combination<00:01:25.690> you<00:01:26.140> can<00:01:26.260> see<00:01:26.470> how<00:01:26.680> much

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
shroud combination you can see how much

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.980 
shroud combination you can see how much
more<00:01:27.040> core<00:01:27.400> surface<00:01:27.820> recovering<00:01:28.450> it's

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
more core surface recovering it's

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.440 
more core surface recovering it's
important<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.680> cover<00:01:29.890> at<00:01:30.100> least<00:01:30.310> 70%<00:01:30.970> of

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
important that you cover at least 70% of

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.330 
important that you cover at least 70% of
your<00:01:31.690> radiator<00:01:32.020> core<00:01:32.440> ideally<00:01:33.160> you're

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
your radiator core ideally you're

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.850 
your radiator core ideally you're
covering<00:01:33.670> 100%<00:01:34.360> but<00:01:35.050> see<00:01:35.260> we've<00:01:35.440> pulled<00:01:35.710> the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
covering 100% but see we've pulled the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.580 
covering 100% but see we've pulled the
the<00:01:36.250> blade<00:01:37.030> assembly<00:01:37.570> away<00:01:37.720> from<00:01:37.870> the<00:01:38.110> surface

on<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.330> cyclone<00:01:40.570> here<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.460> going<00:01:42.640> to

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
on the cyclone here this is going to

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.160 
on the cyclone here this is going to
move<00:01:42.820> air<00:01:43.090> like<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.300> donut<00:01:43.810> you're<00:01:43.990> going<00:01:44.110> to

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
move air like a donut you're going to

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.080 
move air like a donut you're going to
have<00:01:44.290> a<00:01:44.320> dead<00:01:44.560> spot<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.100> middle<00:01:45.400> this

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
have a dead spot in the middle this

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.940 
have a dead spot in the middle this
configuration<00:01:46.960> is<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.350> move<00:01:47.530> airflow

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
configuration is going to move airflow

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.040 
configuration is going to move airflow
through<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.250> entire<00:01:48.730> radiator<00:01:49.330> surface<00:01:49.840> I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
through the entire radiator surface I

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.399 
through the entire radiator surface I
actually<00:01:50.260> get<00:01:50.560> 40%<00:01:51.310> more<00:01:51.610> BTU<00:01:52.600> output<00:01:52.630> out<00:01:53.290> of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
actually get 40% more BTU output out of

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.620 
actually get 40% more BTU output out of
this<00:01:53.530> configuration<00:01:53.920> versus<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.790> one<00:01:54.970> so

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
this configuration versus that one so

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.300 
this configuration versus that one so
especially<00:01:56.020> if<00:01:56.320> you've<00:01:56.470> got<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.680> 5<00:01:56.920> liter<00:01:57.190> or

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
especially if you've got a 5 liter or

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.310 
especially if you've got a 5 liter or
above<00:01:57.730> we<00:01:58.060> recommend<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.659> you<00:01:58.780> go<00:01:58.930> up<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.290> a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
above we recommend that you go up to a

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.500 
above we recommend that you go up to a
shrouded<00:01:59.830> assembly<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.940> other<00:02:01.060> thing<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.330> want

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
shrouded assembly the other thing I want

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.180 
shrouded assembly the other thing I want
to<00:02:01.600> point<00:02:01.750> out<00:02:01.930> on<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.290> shroud<00:02:02.590> see<00:02:03.070> how

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
to point out on the shroud see how

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.560 
to point out on the shroud see how
there's<00:02:03.370> a<00:02:03.430> bulb<00:02:03.700> seal<00:02:03.940> that<00:02:04.120> goes<00:02:04.180> all<00:02:04.540> the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
there's a bulb seal that goes all the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.990 
there's a bulb seal that goes all the
way<00:02:04.780> around<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.800> way<00:02:06.040> I<00:02:06.070> make<00:02:06.400> sure<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.790> all

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
way around that way I make sure that all

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.520 
way around that way I make sure that all
of<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> airflow<00:02:07.659> is<00:02:07.840> coming<00:02:08.229> through<00:02:08.379> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
of the airflow is coming through the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.499 
of the airflow is coming through the
radiator<00:02:08.950> core<00:02:09.280> rather<00:02:09.759> than<00:02:10.000> robbing<00:02:10.360> it

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
radiator core rather than robbing it

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.140 
radiator core rather than robbing it
from<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.810> engine<00:02:10.959> compartment<00:02:11.999> the<00:02:12.999> other

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
from the engine compartment the other

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.149 
from the engine compartment the other
thing<00:02:13.389> that<00:02:13.420> bulb<00:02:13.719> seal<00:02:13.930> does<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.439> makes<00:02:14.950> up

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
thing that bulb seal does is makes up

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.129 
thing that bulb seal does is makes up
the<00:02:15.280> gap<00:02:15.519> if<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:15.969> actually<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.599> fan<00:02:16.900> that's

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:17.139 
the gap if I actually have a fan that's

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:17.680 
the gap if I actually have a fan that's
hanging<00:02:17.349> over

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
hanging over

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.780 
hanging over
my<00:02:17.870> core<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:18.770> can<00:02:19.040> see<00:02:19.220> here<00:02:19.460> I'm<00:02:19.580> showing

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
my core so you can see here I'm showing

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.400 
my core so you can see here I'm showing
you<00:02:19.940> how<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.240> shroud<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:20.780> actually<00:02:21.170> coming

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
you how the shroud is actually coming

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.860 
you how the shroud is actually coming
over<00:02:21.590> past<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.340> core<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.790> my<00:02:22.910> radiator<00:02:23.330> so

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
over past the core of my radiator so

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.150 
over past the core of my radiator so
I've<00:02:23.960> got<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.260> gap<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.740> make<00:02:24.770> up<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
I've got this gap to make up the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.560 
I've got this gap to make up the
difference<00:02:25.310> here<00:02:25.730> well<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:25.940> bulb<00:02:26.270> seal<00:02:26.480> is

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
difference here well that bulb seal is

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.150 
difference here well that bulb seal is
doing<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:27.020> me<00:02:27.200> once<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:27.560> compressed<00:02:27.980> on

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
doing it for me once it's compressed on

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.630 
doing it for me once it's compressed on
there<00:02:29.530> choosing<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> right<00:02:30.770> electric<00:02:31.250> fan<00:02:31.430> is

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
there choosing the right electric fan is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.030 
there choosing the right electric fan is
a<00:02:31.670> good<00:02:31.910> performance<00:02:32.360> upgrade<00:02:32.840> however<00:02:33.680> we

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
a good performance upgrade however we

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.470 
a good performance upgrade however we
don't<00:02:34.160> recommend<00:02:34.520> you<00:02:34.760> use<00:02:34.790> an<00:02:35.000> electric<00:02:35.030> fan

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
don't recommend you use an electric fan

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.420 
don't recommend you use an electric fan
