00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
 we start with contingencies 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.780
 very happy and these days 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.210
 revolutionized we lost the accent 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.490
 Argentine you see and for now that we 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.490

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.590
 t 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.240
 but there are many decisions of a day 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.820
 for another coming out of the reality you 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.920
 You were some Argentine day with your friend 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.390
 or we can tell you by lolo there is no longer 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.910
 my friend is still your friend 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:44.600
 special cee with a great advantage but 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:47.239
 a friend does not understand anything else 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.070
 modern that has more modern not because 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.559

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.740
 I left there has been much talk has been said 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.630
 They have a lot of opinions and I try to 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.900
 leave aside all that you have 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.460
 said and focus on my life that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.680
 leave again from a reality show and you 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.880
 come out of reality come out there are many 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.880
 lights but get out of zero 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.750
