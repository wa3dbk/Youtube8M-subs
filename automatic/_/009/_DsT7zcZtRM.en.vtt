00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.590
 fly a few rounds 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.870
 the beginner mode makes itself through it 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.089
 recognizable that the rash relative 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.130
 low is that means for smaller spaces 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.900
 or very early for the first hours of flight 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.630
 recommend you see the thing weighs 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 Potty turns almost close 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.460
 I'll try one for now 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.970
 let you get a little run 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.380
 Fly easy 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:37.440
 severin piece to prevent the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.270
 Camera or later so now distracts the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.040
 very hard to the right this is the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.010
 complete rash to the right after 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.579
 left behind forward into your own 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.579
 Turn axis 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.719
 for small rooms like this one here or 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.370
 if I still have the experience 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.570
 very easy indeed the country is 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.360
 No problem at all now 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.910
 Fuller you can see what kind of power 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.100
 the little one has that is already quite 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.000
 start nicely 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.479
 good now with a pressure on the right 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.580
 Stick 1 we are in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.580
 expert mode the led flashes 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.680
 Yes 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.350
 our little fox ax4 is now whole 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.040
 nice bitch the bar you talk to 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.900
 ausschlag is already with the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.520
 more aggressive if I enjoy it 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.110
 The helicopter would go through 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.060
 Immediately give a hand because of that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.770
 but we also swim here 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.770
 No problem at all 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.980
 Now I'm just a little bit 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.050
 for you that no problem now I talk 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.110
 just want to show in the picture that 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.560
 you are here in this place easy 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.080
 can restore 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.580
 although he is currently folks some banks 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.460
 percent is now flying right in 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.900
 continue in expert mode because if 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.910
 now we have sneak light 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.320
 Meets right I just think 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.320
 change the trim here 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.630
 20 again balanced 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.630
 romy a bit around 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.270
 the country on an alliance with such a 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.270
 little joke the no problem at all 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.859
 Here is the mosquito really has 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.329
 power that makes a lot of fun too 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.530
 a small space you could 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.109
 Maybe a chair think about that 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.950
 or something similar just set it up 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.930
 to bend through under the chair legs 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.150
 yes, you have even clapped yourself 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.150
 It should be super survive 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.150
 round
