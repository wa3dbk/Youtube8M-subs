00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
can go here and this is your cloning

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.740 
can go here and this is your cloning
tool<00:01:40.290> or<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.560> heal<00:01:40.829> tool<00:01:41.990> make<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.170> bigger

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and all this is is knocking the shadow

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.899 
and all this is is knocking the shadow
out<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.770> picture<00:01:50.009> will<00:01:50.369> look<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.729> little

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
out so this picture will look a little

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.440 
out so this picture will look a little
bit<00:01:51.030> better<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.820> may<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.270> may<00:01:54.420> not

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
bit better and it's it may or may not

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.090 
bit better and it's it may or may not
knock<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> completely<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.740> that's<00:01:55.860> not

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
knock it completely out but that's not

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
knock it completely out but that's not

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
bit more

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.199

all this is is simply I mean most you
guys<00:02:16.329> have<00:02:16.540> used<00:02:16.720> Photoshop<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.500> all<00:02:18.129> it<00:02:18.280> is

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
guys have used Photoshop and all it is

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.580 
guys have used Photoshop and all it is
is<00:02:18.610> part<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.239> it's<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> cloning<00:02:20.379> tool

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
is part of the it's like a cloning tool

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.390 
is part of the it's like a cloning tool
it<00:02:21.579> actually<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> cloning<00:02:22.689> tool<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:24.129> I'm

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
it actually is a cloning tool and I'm

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.649 
it actually is a cloning tool and I'm
going<00:02:24.579> to<00:02:24.610> go<00:02:24.730> ahead<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.060> knock<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.329> exposure

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
going to go ahead and knock the exposure

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.119 
going to go ahead and knock the exposure
down<00:02:25.930> even<00:02:26.319> though<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.799> keep<00:02:26.980> my

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
down even though I like to keep my

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.289 
down even though I like to keep my
pictures<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.489> little<00:02:27.700> bit<00:02:27.790> brighter<00:02:28.120> because

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
pictures a little bit brighter because

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.319 
pictures a little bit brighter because
when<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:28.659> send<00:02:28.900> them<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.140> printer<00:02:29.260> they<00:02:30.329> it

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
when I send them to the printer they it

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.649 
when I send them to the printer they it
just<00:02:31.780> makes<00:02:31.989> them<00:02:32.109> look<00:02:32.319> better<00:02:33.569> but<00:02:34.569> that's

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
just makes them look better but that's

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.349 
just makes them look better but that's
because<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.989> know<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.409> printer<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
because I know the printer that the

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.360 
because I know the printer that the
place<00:02:37.359> where<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.599> go<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.930> uses<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.010> know<00:02:39.069> how

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
place where I go to uses and I know how

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.500 
place where I go to uses and I know how
it<00:02:39.430> prints<00:02:39.989> so<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.609> even<00:02:42.609> this<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.269> bad

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
it prints so and even this is not a bad

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.420 
it prints so and even this is not a bad
picture<00:02:43.810> but<00:02:44.409> watch<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.829> just<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.189> little
