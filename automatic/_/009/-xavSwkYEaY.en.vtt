00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.890
 the girls I have a trick for you 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.460
 they grow long strong fingernails and 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.760
 very healthy first of all they are going to 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.760
 need a little wind like this garlic 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:45.090
 and they are going to cut them more or less like this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.270
 way to fit in the varnish 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.420
 they are going to look for a base in clear varnish or 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.809
 either a varnish that they have to no longer 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.300
 use and be clear they will serve you very 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.690
 all right 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.780
 to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.750
 here I have an example this is mine 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.479
 I've been using it for months now, mine 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.350
 is super concentrated for the same reason 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.950
 that I always use it and then as you see 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.509
 is already yellow 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.649
 because she has a good see what I 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:25.759
 My nails have grown a lot 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.679
 pretty pretty and always apply this 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.780
 before you as you paint nails 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.689
 say me before I put this 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.299
 color I put this base and this you're going 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.829
 to do every 23 days every time you change 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.219
 the varnish 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.130
 but one thing the smell will be 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.869
 very strong that I suggest is to wash your 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.780
 hands after they have dried 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.759
 completely varnish nails 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.549
 that you have used and you will feel strange 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.579
 with the smell on top of garlic but you 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.039
 you will accustom me I have been 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.920
 using many months and it has accustomed me 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.039
 I have no problem but they saw that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.890
 you are going to give good results I hope they 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:13.730
 I liked it and something else 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.990
 if they want to have nice soft hands 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.230
 without drying the cuticles there 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.319
 ointments as to say this is from bayer 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.690
 they are especially for cuticles are 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.750
 ointments special leads is 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.520
 using also a good would have to 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.160
 I quite like looking down already 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.290
 you can use creams like 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.950
 idea can use this that is special 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.530
 for sally hansen manicure or this 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.740
 is auster and they sell it in 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.370
 any pharmacy or same sell to 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.610
 Sometimes this is like special oil 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.670
 for the cuticle in also anÃ­bal equal 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.060
