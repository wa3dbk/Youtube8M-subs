00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.270
 plus 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.100
 how do animals classify 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.320
 in the world there are more than one million 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.630
 species of animals among them there are 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.880
 big differences for example about 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.160
 they have a microscopic size like 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.560
 Water fleas and others are very large 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.480
 as the whales are so many 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.540
 animals that exist in the middle that 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.100
 in order to study them it is necessary 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.020
 classify them the first classification 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.330
 that is made of the animals and that is 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.580
 they use most often is the one 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.180
 divide all the animals the two 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.479
 large groups the vertebrate animals 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.490
 and the invertebrate animals in this 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.210
 video we will learn what are the 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.210
 Vertebrate animals 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.690
 the vertebrate animals are those 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.420
 that they have a skeleton inside their 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.250
 body that is made up of bones a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.950
 part of his skeleton is the column 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.259
 vertebral to her other parts are joined 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.850
 of the skeleton 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.770
 what are the groups of the hit 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.330
 vertebrate animals are classified 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:56.189
 in five large groups amphibian fish 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:58.350
 reptiles birds and mammals the fish are 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.630
 oviparous vertebrate animals that live 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.000
 in the water they have fins and their body 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.610
 It is covered with scales your 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.179
 limbs are the fins for example 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.280
 a hake is a fish the amphibians are 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.739
 oviparous and live in the water and in the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.470
 earth and her skin is naked when 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.510
 they are born they live in the water and they have a tail 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.330
 when they are adults they can live in the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.810
 earth and have four legs for example 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.850
 an amphibian is the branch the reptiles are 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.340
 oviparous and have the body covered 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.230
 scales almost all are terrestrial their 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.900
 limbs are legs although the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.860
 snakes have no other example can 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.450
 be the iguana the birds are terrestrial 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.180
 oviparous and have the body covered 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.470
 feathers their limbs are wings and legs 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.280
 and they also have a peak 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.160
 a bird is a wo 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.140
 mammals are viviparous live in the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.450
 land and in the water and your body usually 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.970
 to be covered with hair his extremities 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.940
 they are the legs and the young are fed 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.040
 of your mother's milk for example 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.200
 mammal is the grid all these groups 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.000
 in the background vertebrates you can see them 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.160
 in a much more extended way in the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:17.850
 different videos in the eduteca for 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:19.739
 each of the groups as are the 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.430
 body of vertebrates is formed 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.410
 by the head the trunk and tail of 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.380
 trunk the limbs that are 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.600
 legs to the fins the skin covers and 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.330
 protects the body and is different from ones 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.790
 groups of vertebrates to others can 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.489
 be covered with feathered hair or 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.000
 scales remember that others have the 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.000
 naked skin 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.090
 do not
