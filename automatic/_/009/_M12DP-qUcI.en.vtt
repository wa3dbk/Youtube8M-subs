00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
of the custom silicon that we designed

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.719 
of the custom silicon that we designed
for<00:06:19.569> this<00:06:19.659> product<00:06:20.050> that<00:06:20.409> silicon<00:06:21.310> is<00:06:21.430> called

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
for this product that silicon is called

a fool

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.930 
a fool
and<00:06:23.350> it's<00:06:23.530> really<00:06:23.650> built<00:06:24.160> by<00:06:24.370> our<00:06:24.520> hardware

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
and it's really built by our hardware

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.200 
and it's really built by our hardware
team<00:06:25.180> in<00:06:25.390> concert<00:06:25.810> with<00:06:25.840> software

team in concert with software

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.879 
team in concert with software
and<00:06:27.300> what<00:06:27.750> that<00:06:27.780> gives<00:06:28.110> you<00:06:28.319> as<00:06:28.440> a<00:06:28.470> level<00:06:28.740> of

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
and what that gives you as a level of

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.559
