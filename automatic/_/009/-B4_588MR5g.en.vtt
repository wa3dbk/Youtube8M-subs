00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
now let's see what it goes over to so it

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.190 
now let's see what it goes over to so it
says<00:02:51.750> add<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:54.590> these<00:02:55.590> strings<00:02:56.489> to

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.340 
it quite complicated and all that stuff
or<00:07:29.090> you<00:07:29.240> can't<00:07:29.450> find<00:07:29.660> the<00:07:29.750> right<00:07:29.870> files<00:07:30.140> and

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.350 
or you can't find the right files and

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.400 
or you can't find the right files and
stuff<00:07:30.500> yep<00:07:31.430> so<00:07:31.760> you<00:07:32.270> just<00:07:32.480> download<00:07:32.930> then<00:07:33.140> and

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.410 
stuff yep so you just download then and

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.350 
stuff yep so you just download then and
place<00:07:33.590> into<00:07:33.860> that<00:07:34.310> and<00:07:34.580> then<00:07:34.940> you've<00:07:35.090> done

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
place into that and then you've done

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.420 
place into that and then you've done
basically<00:07:35.750> reboot<00:07:36.260> it<00:07:36.470> so<00:07:36.920> that's<00:07:37.190> a<00:07:37.250> lot

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.430 
basically reboot it so that's a lot

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.060 
basically reboot it so that's a lot
easier<00:07:37.460> than<00:07:37.960> this<00:07:38.960> way<00:07:39.200> but<00:07:39.710> you<00:07:39.830> have<00:07:39.950> to

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.070 
easier than this way but you have to

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:47.530 
easier than this way but you have to
become<00:07:40.220> a<00:07:40.430> VIP<00:07:40.940> member<00:07:42.730> alright<00:07:44.470> see<00:07:45.470> ya
