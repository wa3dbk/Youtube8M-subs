 recently from the bathroom because I know how 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.280
 it's a wet look but I'm going to 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.670
 teach how to achieve this effect so 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.470
 balloon the whole thing in the hair does not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.170
 managed to explain in the video not what 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.030
 I showed it's just water and mousse like that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 how good is only water and mousse and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.040
 they do it by squeezing their hair very very 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.379
 very well and then nothing more I send them a 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.059
 kiss and a very warm greeting to all 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.799
 the ones that follow me on my social networks 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.449
 but especially it is special to 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.060
 regions that follow us in Instagram that 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.250
 I know that there are many and I really 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.990
 love having more girls out there 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.159
 that follow on facebook on twitter and the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.950
 that are still on my blog too 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.950
 and let's go to the demonstration here as 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.940
 for this look let's start 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.010
 cleaning our face with a 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.570
 wet wipe then we will apply a 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.090
 1st 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.479
 and we distribute it well all over the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.479
 face 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.600
 then I will be using two tones 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.490
 of base a little bit darker written no 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.060
 of my skin because I want to give that tone 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.060
 Sun tanning 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.250
 he mixed it with a little bit with his finger 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.689
 obviously the hands have to be 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.689
 super clean to do this 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.790
 and with a brush we distribute all the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.790
 base 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:07.670
 then we apply a little bit of concealer 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:12.140
 to highlight the area of ​​the cheekbones 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.010
 a little bit the forehead the bone of the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.010
 nose and chin 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.040
 let's continue with powders 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.270
 also the powder in a darker shade 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.270
 that the tone of my skin 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:33.300
 and then we turn with bronzer 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.460
 the loop has to be very tan 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.240
 so let's apply the bronzer 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.880
 on the forehead the cheekbones the neck for 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.180
 that the part of the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.460
 chest with the one on the face then I'm 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.280
 using this beneficial illuminator that 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.790
 it's called alumina these are very very good 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.040
 illuminates instantly 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.010
 we applied in the nose bone 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.810
 cheekbone forehead and chin then I go 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.980
 to be using a second bronzer 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.739
 an old golden tone and I'm going to 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.910
 apply a little bit for these areas 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:14.390
 I want to do it very very very 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.920
 gilding the face look glowing 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.830
 for the eyes you may be using 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.720
 These beautiful crayons from Milan and 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.590
 I recommend them a lot because 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.220
 they have long duration are 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.450
 They are water resistant 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.720
 first he applied a golden tone then a 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.310
 bronze tone in the corners 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.140
 As you can see it does not have to be 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.830
 perfect because then we fix it with 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.700
 the fingers 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.910
 we do not need brushes yet a tone 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.160
 more beige for the area of ​​the lacrimal 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.130
 and the outside line list of the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.440
 eyelashes then with are with a shadow 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.440
 beige stamp these cream shadows 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.010
 and I reaffirm the colors a little 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.830
 of depth 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.050
 as to blur a little better this 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.960
 part 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.420
 we outlined with a black pencil 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.840
 we blur the line a little bit then the 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.680
 water line we are going to apply this pencil 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.680
 beige of Milan 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.170
 step on and apply mascara 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.140
 to create this effect on the eyelashes 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.080
 bottom only with the tip of the 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.800
 mascara brush 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.000
 let's join the tabs 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.000
 to speak our eyebrows 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.460
 and for the color of the lips I'm going to 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.180
 be using eye shadows I take out a 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.100
 little bit of the shadows I apply gloss and 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.680
 then with a brush applied the shadow in 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.410
 my lips and that's it 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.900
 another option is to apply yellow crayon 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.030
 Eye on the lips of me 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.090
 and another option is to mix the colors 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.150
 I'm here mixing an orange and the 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.570
 yellow first the orange and then the 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.570
 yellow 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.360
 and with this last light I remain 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.690
 a kiss and I hope you liked the 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.690
 look of jennifer lópez books weights 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.930
 7 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.929
 but not 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.929
 I do not think so
