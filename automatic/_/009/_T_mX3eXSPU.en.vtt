agus as much as possible make sure it's

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
dark shade so it misses often keep

dark shade so it misses often keep
myself<00:02:48.319> concealed<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.430> I'm<00:02:49.910> less<00:02:50.150> likely<00:02:50.180> to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
myself concealed so I'm less likely to

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.860 
myself concealed so I'm less likely to

get hit and every opportunity they can I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.170 
get hit and every opportunity they can I
mollify<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.829> make<00:02:55.459> sure<00:02:55.610> its<00:02:55.760> defense

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
mollify to make sure its defense

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.720 
mollify to make sure its defense
decreases<00:02:57.079> so<00:02:57.650> my<00:02:57.769> night<00:02:57.980> has<00:02:58.010> an<00:02:58.310> easier<00:02:58.549> time

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
decreases so my night has an easier time

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.199 
decreases so my night has an easier time
taking<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.829> also<00:03:00.829> I<00:03:00.980> slow<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.280> down<00:03:01.430> to

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
taking it and also I slow it down to

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.479 
taking it and also I slow it down to

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
make sure it tax less ultimately doing

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.699

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
less damage to meet all the night so in

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.470 
less damage to meet all the night so in

if it does less damage to me all the
night<00:03:08.630> then<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.959> means<00:03:09.079> I<00:03:09.350> am<00:03:09.549> obviously<00:03:10.549> one
