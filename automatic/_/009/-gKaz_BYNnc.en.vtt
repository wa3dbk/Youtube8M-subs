this<00:00:24.170> example<00:00:25.170> will<00:00:25.740> make<00:00:25.920> use<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.160> dominant

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
this example will make use of dominant

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240 
this example will make use of dominant
chords<00:00:27.240> which<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> staple<00:00:28.320> across<00:00:28.949> many

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
chords which are a staple across many

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.150 
chords which are a staple across many
blues<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.179> jazz<00:00:30.510> styles<00:00:31.080> let's<00:00:31.859> take<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
blues and jazz styles let's take a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.729 
blues and jazz styles let's take a
moment<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.759> review<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.480> spelling<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.350> basic

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
moment to review the spelling of a basic

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.869 
moment to review the spelling of a basic
dominant<00:00:35.250> 7th<00:00:35.579> chord<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.329> example<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:37.020> d7

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
dominant 7th chord for example a d7

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.360 
dominant 7th chord for example a d7
consists<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> notes<00:00:42.649> if<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.920> spell<00:00:44.160> that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
consists of the notes if we spell that

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.430 
consists of the notes if we spell that
chord<00:00:44.640> using<00:00:44.820> intervals<00:00:45.539> up<00:00:45.809> from<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> root

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
chord using intervals up from the root

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:57.439 
chord using intervals up from the root
here's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> review<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> intervals<00:00:56.420> okay

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
here's a review of the intervals okay

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.400 
here's a review of the intervals okay
now<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:59.340> many<00:00:59.609> blues<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.329> jazz<00:01:00.510> styles<00:01:01.020> it's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
now in many blues and jazz styles it's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.640 
now in many blues and jazz styles it's
very<00:01:01.649> effective<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.190> simply<00:01:03.000> isolate<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.989> 3rd

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
very effective to simply isolate the 3rd

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190 
very effective to simply isolate the 3rd
and<00:01:05.010> 7th<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.729> court<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.600> example<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.080> I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and 7th of this court for example if I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.760 
and 7th of this court for example if I
play<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.590> root<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> chord<00:01:08.280> e<00:01:08.580> down<00:01:08.880> here

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
play the root of the chord e down here

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.710 
play the root of the chord e down here
simply<00:01:10.770> play<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.340> 3rd<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> 7th

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.110 

fairly<00:01:17.080> sparse<00:01:17.530> sound<00:01:17.920> but<00:01:18.190> it<00:01:18.310> still<00:01:18.580> defines

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
fairly sparse sound but it still defines

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.970 
fairly sparse sound but it still defines
the<00:01:19.420> quality<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.170> domino<00:01:20.560> cord<00:01:20.830> very

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
the quality of the domino cord very

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.210 
the quality of the domino cord very
effectively<00:01:21.930> another<00:01:22.930> interesting<00:01:23.530> thing<00:01:23.560> we

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
effectively another interesting thing we

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.910 
effectively another interesting thing we
can<00:01:24.400> notice<00:01:24.760> is<00:01:24.880> that<00:01:24.940> these<00:01:25.210> notes<00:01:25.480> here<00:01:25.920> but

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
can notice is that these notes here but

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.170 
can notice is that these notes here but
also<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.400> 7/3<00:01:27.910> of<00:01:28.240> this<00:01:28.480> a<00:01:28.630> flat<00:01:29.080> seven<00:01:30.180> it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
also the 7/3 of this a flat seven it's

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.700 
also the 7/3 of this a flat seven it's
like<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.480> seven<00:01:31.780> threes<00:01:32.020> got<00:01:32.230> flips<00:01:32.530> around

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
like the seven threes got flips around

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:41.760 
like the seven threes got flips around
on<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.220> d7<00:01:35.160> put<00:01:36.160> on<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.370> a<00:01:36.400> flat<00:01:36.820> seven<00:01:40.770> that

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
on the d7 put on the a flat seven that

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.710 
on the d7 put on the a flat seven that
gives<00:01:42.100> rise<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.910> technique<00:01:43.480> known<00:01:43.510> as

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
gives rise to a technique known as

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.230 
gives rise to a technique known as
tritone<00:01:44.380> substitutions<00:01:45.250> where<00:01:45.760> instead<00:01:46.180> of

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
tritone substitutions where instead of

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.580 
tritone substitutions where instead of
using<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:48.610> flat<00:01:48.940> serve<00:01:49.210> in<00:01:49.780> some<00:01:50.020> context

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
using a flat serve in some context

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.340 
using a flat serve in some context
that's<00:01:51.430> very<00:01:51.820> typical<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.390> jazz<00:01:52.720> harmony<00:01:53.080> for

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
that's very typical of jazz harmony for

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.480 
that's very typical of jazz harmony for
example<00:01:53.850> okay<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.720> I'm<00:01:56.410> going<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.740> construct<00:01:57.220> a

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
example okay so I'm going to construct a

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.790 
example okay so I'm going to construct a
simple<00:01:57.700> progression<00:01:58.180> using<00:01:58.870> dominant<00:01:59.470> chords

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
simple progression using dominant chords

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.490 
simple progression using dominant chords
and<00:02:00.390> isolating<00:02:01.390> just<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.690> sevens<00:02:02.050> and<00:02:02.229> thirds

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
and isolating just the sevens and thirds

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.630 
and isolating just the sevens and thirds
in<00:02:02.830> this<00:02:03.220> way

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
in this way

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.700 
in this way
and<00:02:03.790> during<00:02:04.660> this<00:02:04.780> progression<00:02:05.140> we'll<00:02:05.470> see

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
and during this progression we'll see

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.219 
and during this progression we'll see
that<00:02:05.979> some<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.670> these<00:02:06.880> plurality<00:02:07.660> issues<00:02:07.990> will

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
that some of these plurality issues will

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.200 
that some of these plurality issues will
come<00:02:08.470> up<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.130> say<00:02:09.310> we'll<00:02:09.729> find<00:02:10.060> that

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
come up that is to say we'll find that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.340 
come up that is to say we'll find that
certain<00:02:11.110> 7/3<00:02:11.860> voicings<00:02:12.370> are<00:02:12.760> shared<00:02:13.350> between

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
certain 7/3 voicings are shared between

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.950 
certain 7/3 voicings are shared between
courts<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.730> also<00:02:16.060> we'll<00:02:16.300> get<00:02:16.480> into<00:02:16.630> some<00:02:16.750> of

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
courts and also we'll get into some of

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.410 
courts and also we'll get into some of
the<00:02:17.170> rhythmical<00:02:18.160> issues<00:02:18.550> after<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.090> as<00:02:19.240> well

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the rhythmical issues after that as well

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.820 
the rhythmical issues after that as well
as<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.780> how<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.050> might<00:02:20.080> work<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.620> a

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
as to how it might work in a

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.520 
as to how it might work in a
contemporary<00:02:21.220> jazz<00:02:21.610> group<00:02:21.910> okay<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:23.350> let's

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
contemporary jazz group okay so let's

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.320 
contemporary jazz group okay so let's
say<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.709> build<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.070> progression<00:02:24.400> starting<00:02:25.180> off

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
say I build a progression starting off

00:02:25.330 --> 00:03:14.710 
say I build a progression starting off
with<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.570> d7

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.520 

and<00:03:15.720> then<00:03:15.870> finally<00:03:16.290> moving<00:03:16.590> back<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:18.410> c7<00:03:21.530> so

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and then finally moving back to a c7 so

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.270 
and then finally moving back to a c7 so
I'm<00:03:22.770> going<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:22.980> try<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.430> construct<00:03:25.280> phrase

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
I'm going to try and construct phrase

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.820 
I'm going to try and construct phrase
using<00:03:27.060> each<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.900> these<00:03:28.020> quotes<00:03:28.320> for<00:03:28.500> two<00:03:28.620> beats

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
using each of these quotes for two beats

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.190 
using each of these quotes for two beats
each<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.400> just<00:03:29.820> finishing<00:03:30.240> off<00:03:30.360> with<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.660> c7

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
each and just finishing off with the c7

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.730 
each and just finishing off with the c7
or<00:03:31.380> four<00:03:31.770> beats<00:03:31.980> at<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.280> end<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:33.380> let's<00:03:34.380> see

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
or four beats at the end and let's see

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:49.020 
or four beats at the end and let's see
how<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:34.890> would<00:03:35.130> sound<00:03:35.190> here<00:03:35.580> we<00:03:35.670> go

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:04:04.960 

d<00:03:51.370> 7c<00:03:52.450> summer<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:55.569> flat<00:04:02.500> all<00:04:03.500> right<00:04:03.620> now<00:04:04.519> those

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
d 7c summer a flat all right now those

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.759 
d 7c summer a flat all right now those
rhythms<00:04:05.239> were<00:04:05.569> pretty<00:04:05.810> straight<00:04:06.200> obviously

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
rhythms were pretty straight obviously

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.069 
rhythms were pretty straight obviously
so<00:04:07.310> one<00:04:07.519> thing<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:07.790> can<00:04:07.970> do<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.359> kind<00:04:08.689> of<00:04:08.810> spice

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
so one thing I can do to kind of spice

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.050 
so one thing I can do to kind of spice
that<00:04:09.109> up<00:04:09.439> in<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.680> contemporary<00:04:10.129> jazz<00:04:10.430> context

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
that up in a contemporary jazz context

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.240 
that up in a contemporary jazz context
is<00:04:11.480> just<00:04:11.540> sort<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.049> play<00:04:12.500> around<00:04:12.650> with<00:04:12.890> beat

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
is just sort of play around with beat

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.649 
is just sort of play around with beat

and<00:04:30.320> do<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.590> again<00:04:30.800> with<00:04:31.130> these<00:04:31.250> same

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
and do that again with these same

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.010 
and do that again with these same
voicings<00:04:32.000> in<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.300> same<00:04:32.510> progression

starting<00:04:33.500> with<00:04:33.650> our<00:04:33.770> d7<00:04:34.370> let's<00:04:34.729> give<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:34.910> a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
starting with our d7 let's give it a

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:49.250 
starting with our d7 let's give it a
shot

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.100 

okay<00:04:51.030> now<00:04:52.030> we're<00:04:52.210> gonna<00:04:52.300> move<00:04:52.600> on<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.810> another

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
okay now we're gonna move on to another

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.140 
okay now we're gonna move on to another
technique<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.860> discuss<00:04:54.490> in<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.790> contemporary

jazz<00:04:55.570> book<00:04:55.840> where<00:04:56.530> we<00:04:56.740> extend<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.790> 7/3

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
jazz book where we extend the 7/3

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.660 
jazz book where we extend the 7/3
voicing<00:04:58.810> by<00:04:59.260> adding<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.770> third<00:05:00.070> node<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.580> the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670

the 7/3 extended now the third node is

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.280 
the 7/3 extended now the third node is
typically<00:05:06.700> played<00:05:07.090> with<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:07.720> pinky<00:05:08.050> of<00:05:08.170> the
