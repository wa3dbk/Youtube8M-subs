pinch to zoom to a pull-up leap we've

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.750 
pinch to zoom to a pull-up leap we've
seen<00:04:25.930> that<00:04:26.080> in<00:04:26.200> other<00:04:26.229> videos<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:27.430> we'll<00:04:27.610> just

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
seen that in other videos so we'll just

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.250 
seen that in other videos so we'll just
kill<00:04:27.940> that<00:04:28.150> out<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.479> now<00:04:28.570> you<00:04:28.750> start<00:04:29.050> seeing

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
kill that out and now you start seeing

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.850 
kill that out and now you start seeing
some<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.590> your<00:04:29.680> icons<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.880> see<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.180> little

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
some of your icons you see the little

some of your icons you see the little
Refresh<00:04:32.860> circle<00:04:33.790> thingy<00:04:34.000> up<00:04:34.180> at<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.330> top<00:04:34.510> that

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
Refresh circle thingy up at the top that

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.930 
Refresh circle thingy up at the top that
means<00:04:34.780> it's<00:04:34.990> loading<00:04:35.410> Gmail<00:04:36.250> data<00:04:36.520> right<00:04:36.760> now

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
means it's loading Gmail data right now

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.640 
means it's loading Gmail data right now
so<00:04:38.880> it'll<00:04:39.880> take<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.150> second<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:40.840> see<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.500> don't
