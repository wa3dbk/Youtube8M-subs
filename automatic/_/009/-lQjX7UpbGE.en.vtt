00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
obviously it's going to become worn and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.960 
obviously it's going to become worn and
rotten<00:01:42.480> and<00:01:43.380> yeah<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.580> we<00:01:44.730> know

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
rotten and yeah because we know

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.630 
rotten and yeah because we know
apparently<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:46.800> it's<00:01:47.370> been

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
apparently that it was and it's been

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.150 
apparently that it was and it's been
here<00:01:47.940> for<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> very<00:01:48.540> very<00:01:49.050> long<00:01:49.290> time<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:50.990> yeah

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
here for a very very long time so yeah

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.890 
here for a very very long time so yeah
but<00:01:53.160> basically<00:01:53.760> what<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:53.970> trying<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.390> say<00:01:54.600> is

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
but basically what I'm trying to say is

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.070 
but basically what I'm trying to say is
there<00:01:55.350> seems<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.220> some<00:01:56.840> similarity<00:01:57.840> with

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
there seems to be some similarity with

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.520 
there seems to be some similarity with
this<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.370> marionette<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:01.230> haven't

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
this and the marionette so we haven't

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
this and the marionette so we haven't
seen<00:02:01.740> anything<00:02:02.430> really<00:02:02.909> about<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
seen anything really about the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.390 
seen anything really about the
marionette<00:02:04.140> returning<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:04.740> five<00:02:04.950> nights<00:02:05.159> at

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
marionette returning to five nights at

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.670 
marionette returning to five nights at
Freddy's<00:02:05.670> free<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.150> think<00:02:06.240> Scott's<00:02:07.080> wants<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
Freddy's free I think Scott's wants to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.279 
Freddy's free I think Scott's wants to
make<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.129> seems<00:02:08.399> very<00:02:08.670> secretive<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:10.110> he's

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
make it seems very secretive that he's

atmosphere for this attraction so again

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.900 
atmosphere for this attraction so again
we<00:02:43.830> still<00:02:44.040> don't<00:02:44.250> even<00:02:44.340> know<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
we still don't even know that the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.190 
we still don't even know that the
marionettes<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.690> come<00:02:45.840> back<00:02:45.959> or<00:02:46.170> not

marionettes going to come back or not

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.949 
marionettes going to come back or not
but<00:02:46.620> looking<00:02:46.950> at<00:02:47.069> this<00:02:47.160> picture<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:48.090> does<00:02:48.690> seem

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
but looking at this picture it does seem

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.780 
but looking at this picture it does seem
very<00:02:48.989> strange<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.799> me<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.129> it<00:02:50.250> looks<00:02:50.430> very

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
very strange to me that it looks very

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.770 
very strange to me that it looks very
similar<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:52.560> marionette<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.510> don't

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
similar to the marionette and I don't

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.900 
similar to the marionette and I don't
know<00:02:54.870> why<00:02:55.019> it's<00:02:55.230> there<00:02:55.470> for<00:02:55.799> maybe<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.670> just

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
know why it's there for maybe it's just

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.569 
know why it's there for maybe it's just
for<00:02:57.060> decoration<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:58.349> can't<00:02:58.650> see<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.160> ceiling

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
for decoration you can't see the ceiling

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.319 
for decoration you can't see the ceiling
of<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.239> wall<00:03:00.480> guys<00:03:00.900> em<00:03:01.349> outside<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:03.060> maybe

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
of the wall guys em outside so maybe

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.390 
of the wall guys em outside so maybe
it's<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.780> hanging<00:03:04.500> off<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.829> wall<00:03:05.040> the

wall to make it a more scary atmosphere

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.809 
wall to make it a more scary atmosphere
so<00:03:28.260> what<00:03:28.410> do<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.620> guys<00:03:28.769> think<00:03:29.160> about<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.609> it

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
so what do you guys think about this it

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.390 
so what do you guys think about this it
seems<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.269> some<00:03:30.599> similarity<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.980> could

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
seems to be some similarity it could

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.659 
seems to be some similarity it could
possibly<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.329> withered<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.669> marionette

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
possibly be a withered and marionette

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.220 
possibly be a withered and marionette
which<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.120> lot<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.299> people<00:03:36.510> have<00:03:36.810> been<00:03:36.959> thinking

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
which a lot of people have been thinking

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.949 
which a lot of people have been thinking
about<00:03:37.790> but<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.910> doesn't<00:03:39.150> look<00:03:39.239> very<00:03:39.419> similar

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
about but it doesn't look very similar

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.740 
about but it doesn't look very similar
so<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.590> sum<00:03:41.190> up<00:03:41.220> guys<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.910> think<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.569> is<00:03:42.690> very

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
so to sum up guys I think this is very

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.589 
so to sum up guys I think this is very
similar<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.680> marionette<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.459> if<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.299> is

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
similar to the marionette and if it is

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.110 
similar to the marionette and if it is
the<00:03:45.840> marionette<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.889> looks<00:03:47.310> like<00:03:47.579> he<00:03:47.940> has<00:03:48.090> been

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
the marionette it looks like he has been

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.569 
the marionette it looks like he has been
attached<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.440> ceiling<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
attached to the ceiling of the

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.440 
attached to the ceiling of the
attraction<00:03:51.359> to<00:03:51.569> make<00:03:52.169> it<00:03:52.440> more<00:03:52.620> scary<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.700> I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
attraction to make it more scary and I

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.819 
attraction to make it more scary and I
don't<00:03:54.660> know<00:03:54.840> whether<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.139> guys<00:03:55.169> have<00:03:55.530> been<00:03:55.650> to

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
don't know whether you guys have been to
