from<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.980> zombie<00:00:05.370> Jeep<00:00:05.580> so<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:05.850> figured<00:00:06.210> out<00:00:06.390> go

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
from the zombie Jeep so I figured out go

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.680 
from the zombie Jeep so I figured out go
ahead<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.839> make<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.109> video<00:00:07.500> on<00:00:07.710> how<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.690> remove

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
ahead and make a video on how to remove

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.220 
ahead and make a video on how to remove
your<00:00:10.050> your<00:00:10.910> sending<00:00:11.910> unit<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.420> your<00:00:12.780> fuel

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
your your sending unit and your fuel

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.670 
your your sending unit and your fuel
pump<00:00:14.480> you<00:00:15.480> don't<00:00:15.630> actually<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.199> remove

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
pump you don't actually have to remove

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.310 
pump you don't actually have to remove
the<00:00:16.920> tank<00:00:17.160> from<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> vehicle<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.539> but

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
the tank from the vehicle to do this but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.810 
the tank from the vehicle to do this but
it<00:00:19.439> does<00:00:19.619> make<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.250> harder<00:00:20.460> when<00:00:20.789> it's

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
it does make it a lot harder when it's

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.439 
it does make it a lot harder when it's
in<00:00:21.090> there<00:00:21.270> because<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.630> kind<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.930> cracked<00:00:22.340> so

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
in there because it's kind of cracked so

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.820 
in there because it's kind of cracked so
I've<00:00:24.449> done<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> lot<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> end

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
I've done it a lot with it in the end

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.070 
I've done it a lot with it in the end
the<00:00:26.189> vehicle<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:27.300> probably<00:00:27.599> easier<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> do

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the vehicle it's probably easier to do

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.390 
the vehicle it's probably easier to do
it<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.320> way<00:00:28.500> because<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.920> don't<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
it that way because you don't have to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.240 
it that way because you don't have to
deal<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.699> removing<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.240> tank<00:00:30.510> but<00:00:31.099> for<00:00:32.099> this

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
deal with removing the tank but for this

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.440 
deal with removing the tank but for this

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
outside of the tank because I've already

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
earlier model has the the sending unit

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
earlier model has the the sending unit
on<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> front<00:01:19.590> right<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.570> other

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
on the front right here and the other

ones have the sending it on the top and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.460 
ones have the sending it on the top and
in<00:01:24.210> which<00:01:24.390> case<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.780> would<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> remove

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
in which case you would have to remove

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.590 
in which case you would have to remove
the<00:01:25.710> fuel<00:01:25.830> tank<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.390> they're<00:01:27.390> probably

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the fuel tank but they're probably

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.270 
the fuel tank but they're probably
pretty<00:01:27.869> similar<00:01:28.200> I've<00:01:28.500> never<00:01:28.710> done<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> later

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
pretty similar I've never done the later

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.539 
pretty similar I've never done the later
model<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.650> let<00:01:31.650> me<00:01:31.740> show<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.340> this

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
model but let me show you how to do this

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.749

right<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.060> let<00:01:48.210> me<00:01:48.240> zoom<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:50.329> alright<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.479> I'm

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
right here let me zoom in alright so I'm

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.929 
right here let me zoom in alright so I'm
going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> find<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.140> piece<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:52.939> and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
going to find this piece right here and

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.020 
going to find this piece right here and
we're<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.540> hammer<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.909> what<00:01:56.909> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
we're just going to hammer it what is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:08.389 
we're just going to hammer it what is
that<00:01:57.149> counter<00:01:57.750> clockwise<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.439> guess

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.910 

and<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:10.569> not<00:02:10.750> quite<00:02:11.020> there<00:02:11.230> yet<00:02:11.290> when<00:02:11.739> this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and it's not quite there yet when this

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
and it's not quite there yet when this
gets<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.239> tab<00:02:13.540> we'll<00:02:13.870> be<00:02:14.020> there<00:02:17.700> yes<00:02:18.700> I

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
gets to that tab we'll be there yes I

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.600 
gets to that tab we'll be there yes I
just<00:02:21.940> take<00:02:22.269> that<00:02:22.300> off<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.769> you<00:02:24.069> can<00:02:24.220> pull<00:02:24.430> your

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
just take that off and you can pull your

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.120 
just take that off and you can pull your
whole<00:02:25.349> sending<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.650> out<00:02:28.050> now<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.830> earlier

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
whole sending it out now on the earlier

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.430 
whole sending it out now on the earlier
models<00:02:30.550> like<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.000> one<00:02:31.269> you've<00:02:32.140> got<00:02:32.319> your

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
models like this one you've got your

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.110 
models like this one you've got your
fuel<00:02:32.739> pump<00:02:34.769> inside<00:02:35.769> here<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.519> fuel

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
fuel pump inside here and the fuel

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.850 
fuel pump inside here and the fuel
filter<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> outside<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.680> later

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
filter is on the outside on the later

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.620 
filter is on the outside on the later
models<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.370> fuel<00:02:39.580> filter<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.000> also<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
models the fuel filter is also on the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.979 
models the fuel filter is also on the
inside<00:02:40.720> here<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.160> your<00:02:48.660> your<00:02:49.660> fuel

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
inside here so this is your your fuel

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.710 
inside here so this is your your fuel
pump<00:02:50.200> right<00:02:50.530> here<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.180> little<00:02:52.360> float

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
pump right here this is the little float

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.920 
pump right here this is the little float
that<00:02:52.989> tells<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.319> how<00:02:53.440> much<00:02:53.620> gas<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.340> and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
that tells you how much gas you have and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.650 
that tells you how much gas you have and
there<00:02:55.930> should<00:02:56.200> be<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.590> foot<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.330> here<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.390> little

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
there should be a foot on here a little

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.350 
there should be a foot on here a little
filter<00:02:58.959> with<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> foot<00:02:59.860> on<00:03:00.040> here<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.489> was<00:03:01.060> having

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
filter with a foot on here I was having

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.789 
filter with a foot on here I was having
some<00:03:01.540> problems<00:03:01.870> with<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.650> is

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
some problems with this and that is

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.819 
some problems with this and that is
probably<00:03:03.269> why<00:03:04.269> because<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.870> little<00:03:05.320> foot<00:03:05.560> is

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
probably why because that little foot is

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:15.800 
probably why because that little foot is
not<00:03:06.040> on<00:03:06.220> there<00:03:06.489> let's<00:03:07.299> see<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.630> can<00:03:07.750> find<00:03:07.900> it

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.720 

there<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:18.489> is<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.790> little<00:03:19.209> foot

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
there it is that is the little foot

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.080 
there it is that is the little foot
that's<00:03:21.730> supposed<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.269> be<00:03:24.329> right<00:03:25.329> here<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:28.060> that

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
that's supposed to be right here so that

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.140 
that's supposed to be right here so that
foot<00:03:28.480> should<00:03:28.690> be<00:03:28.870> like<00:03:29.109> that<00:03:29.910> remember<00:03:30.910> if

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
foot should be like that remember if

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.789 
foot should be like that remember if
anything<00:03:31.359> goes<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:31.900> there<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.380> might<00:03:32.530> be<00:03:32.560> the

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
anything goes on there that might be the

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.750 
anything goes on there that might be the
vent<00:03:33.010> tube<00:03:33.660> but<00:03:35.040> that's<00:03:36.040> what<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.340> looks<00:03:36.370> like

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
vent tube but that's what it looks like

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.759 
vent tube but that's what it looks like
inside<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:39.660> if<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.840> need<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.019> replace<00:03:41.380> the

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
inside so if you need to replace the

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.009 
inside so if you need to replace the
fuel<00:03:42.370> pump<00:03:42.640> you<00:03:43.299> can<00:03:43.450> actually<00:03:43.600> buy<00:03:43.959> this

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
fuel pump you can actually buy this

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.129 
fuel pump you can actually buy this
entire<00:03:44.680> assembly<00:03:45.130> right<00:03:45.579> here<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.930> only

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
entire assembly right here it's only

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.930 
entire assembly right here it's only
like<00:03:47.380> thirty<00:03:47.650> dollars<00:03:48.040> more<00:03:48.310> than<00:03:48.549> just<00:03:48.790> the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
like thirty dollars more than just the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.520 
like thirty dollars more than just the
fuel<00:03:49.180> pump<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.600> think<00:03:49.810> when<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:49.989> checked<00:03:50.319> the

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
fuel pump I think when I checked the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.789 
fuel pump I think when I checked the
fuel<00:03:51.100> pump<00:03:51.310> alone<00:03:51.579> was<00:03:52.319> $70<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.650> whole

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
fuel pump alone was $70 and the whole

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.550 
fuel pump alone was $70 and the whole
assembly<00:03:54.340> was<00:03:54.519> like<00:03:54.760> 100<00:03:55.420> or<00:03:55.540> 110<00:03:56.139> something

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
assembly was like 100 or 110 something

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.900 
assembly was like 100 or 110 something
like<00:03:56.650> that<00:03:56.889> and<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:59.799> can<00:04:00.040> just<00:04:00.069> replace<00:04:00.700> the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
like that and you can just replace the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.430 
like that and you can just replace the
fuel<00:04:01.180> pump<00:04:01.450> but<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.780> might<00:04:01.959> as<00:04:02.049> well<00:04:02.109> get<00:04:02.380> all

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
fuel pump but you might as well get all

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.710 
fuel pump but you might as well get all
new<00:04:02.739> parts<00:04:03.730> if<00:04:03.880> you're<00:04:04.030> going<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.269> go<00:04:04.480> that

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
new parts if you're going to go that

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.520 
new parts if you're going to go that
route<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:07.450> put<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:07.750> back<00:04:07.870> together<00:04:08.079> is

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
route so to put it back together is

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.469 
route so to put it back together is
pretty<00:04:08.949> much<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.340> same<00:04:09.519> as<00:04:09.760> we<00:04:09.910> took<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.209> apart

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:10.479 
pretty much the same as we took it apart

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.390 
pretty much the same as we took it apart
here

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
here

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.680 
here
I'm<00:04:11.610> not<00:04:11.819> going<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.000> go<00:04:12.150> over<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.480> because

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
I'm not going to go over that because

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.530 
I'm not going to go over that because
actually<00:04:13.110> what<00:04:13.470> I'm<00:04:13.560> going<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.709> do<00:04:13.860> next<00:04:14.069> is

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
actually what I'm going to do next is

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.930 
actually what I'm going to do next is
put<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.599> larger<00:04:16.139> fuel<00:04:16.919> tank<00:04:17.250> in<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.579> zombie

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
put a larger fuel tank in the zombie

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.009 
put a larger fuel tank in the zombie
Jeep<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:19.709> is<00:04:19.979> all<00:04:20.190> going<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.459> go<00:04:20.900> into<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
Jeep so this is all going to go into the

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.850 
Jeep so this is all going to go into the
zombie<00:04:22.199> Jeep<00:04:25.040> part<00:04:26.040> of<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.280> anyway<00:04:27.830> but<00:04:28.830> anyway

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
zombie Jeep part of it anyway but anyway

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.310 
zombie Jeep part of it anyway but anyway
when<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.430> put<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.760> back<00:04:29.970> on<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:31.050> want<00:04:31.260> to

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
when you put that back on you want to

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.510 
when you put that back on you want to
get<00:04:31.440> one<00:04:31.620> new<00:04:31.800> one<00:04:32.010> of<00:04:32.100> these<00:04:32.250> this<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:33.260> seal

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
get one new one of these this is a seal

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.580 
get one new one of these this is a seal
now<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.699> is<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.510> hardest<00:04:36.870> part<00:04:37.169> is<00:04:37.410> to

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
now this is the the hardest part is to

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.219 
now this is the the hardest part is to
get<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.949> seal<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.550> there<00:04:39.449> especially<00:04:40.080> when

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
get that seal in there especially when

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.420 
get that seal in there especially when
you<00:04:40.320> have<00:04:40.500> this<00:04:40.710> in<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.160> vehicle<00:04:43.220> right<00:04:44.220> now<00:04:44.400> I

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
you have this in the vehicle right now I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.279 
you have this in the vehicle right now I
could<00:04:44.729> tilt<00:04:44.970> this<00:04:45.150> up<00:04:45.360> if<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.630> wanted<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.080> so

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
could tilt this up if I wanted to so

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.439 
could tilt this up if I wanted to so
that<00:04:46.440> gravity<00:04:46.860> would<00:04:46.979> hold<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.400> down<00:04:47.610> but

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
that gravity would hold that down but

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.340 
that gravity would hold that down but
like<00:04:51.449> I<00:04:51.630> said<00:04:53.510> when<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.600> go<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.750> put<00:04:54.960> that<00:04:55.139> back

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
like I said when you go to put that back

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.420 
like I said when you go to put that back
in<00:04:55.560> there<00:04:56.840> you're<00:04:57.840> going<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.050> have<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.370> try<00:04:59.370> and

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
in there you're going to have to try and

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.770 
in there you're going to have to try and
keep<00:04:59.610> from<00:04:59.820> pinching<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:00.419> what<00:05:00.630> usually

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
keep from pinching that what usually

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.870 
keep from pinching that what usually
happens<00:05:01.350> is<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.680> seal<00:05:02.039> will<00:05:02.250> get<00:05:02.400> pinched

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
happens is that seal will get pinched

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.029 
happens is that seal will get pinched
when<00:05:03.539> you<00:05:03.630> go<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.810> put<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.080> back<00:05:04.169> in<00:05:04.530> it'll<00:05:04.830> end

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
when you go to put it back in it'll end

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.730 
when you go to put it back in it'll end
up<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:06.030> will<00:05:06.150> end<00:05:06.270> up<00:05:06.389> like<00:05:06.570> that<00:05:06.900> or<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.650> will

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
up it will end up like that or it will

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.270 
up it will end up like that or it will
even<00:05:07.889> end<00:05:08.130> up<00:05:08.250> on<00:05:08.460> outside<00:05:09.030> like<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:10.160> so<00:05:11.160> if

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
even end up on outside like that so if

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.760 
even end up on outside like that so if
you're<00:05:11.490> if<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.449> get<00:05:12.600> this<00:05:12.780> all<00:05:12.990> buttoned<00:05:13.650> up

and your gas tank starts leaking from

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.980 
and your gas tank starts leaking from
