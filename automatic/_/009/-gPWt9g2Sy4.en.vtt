and<00:02:27.940> now<00:02:28.060> let's<00:02:28.630> say<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.930> we<00:02:29.140> want<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.500> zoom

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
and now let's say that we want to zoom

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.540 
and now let's say that we want to zoom
in<00:02:29.920> on<00:02:30.070> this<00:02:30.280> new<00:02:30.820> phones<00:02:31.180> widget<00:02:31.900> here<00:02:32.140> that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
in on this new phones widget here that

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.880 
in on this new phones widget here that
we<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:33.850> on<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> website<00:02:34.630> double<00:02:35.410> tap<00:02:35.590> on<00:02:35.740> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
we have on the website double tap on the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.480 
we have on the website double tap on the
Nexus<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.460> this<00:02:37.180> time<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:38.710> is<00:02:39.010> very

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
Nexus and this time it it is very

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.510 
Nexus and this time it it is very
accurate<00:02:39.760> it's<00:02:40.330> something<00:02:40.840> exactly<00:02:41.740> on<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
accurate it's something exactly on the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.240 
accurate it's something exactly on the
area<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:42.910> we<00:02:43.240> wanted<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.440> let's<00:02:44.890> try<00:02:45.190> it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
area that we wanted it and let's try it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.360 
area that we wanted it and let's try it
on<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.840> diaphragm<00:02:46.840> for<00:02:47.140> us<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.620> time<00:02:47.920> it

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
on the diaphragm for us this time it

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.300 
on the diaphragm for us this time it
didn't<00:02:48.820> work<00:02:49.030> exactly<00:02:49.750> as<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.410> should<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
didn't work exactly as it should on the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.700 
didn't work exactly as it should on the
iphone<00:02:51.670> 4s<00:02:52.030> let's<00:02:52.300> try<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.810> again<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.470> time

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
iphone 4s let's try that again this time

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.140 
iphone 4s let's try that again this time
it<00:02:53.920> works<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:56.050> get<00:02:56.230> home<00:02:57.220> variable

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
it works so you can get home variable

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.710 
it works so you can get home variable
results<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.840> both<00:02:59.440> devices<00:02:59.830> let's<00:03:00.790> try<00:03:01.060> one

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
results on both devices let's try one

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.980 
results on both devices let's try one
more<00:03:01.990> for<00:03:02.770> example<00:03:03.340> we<00:03:03.640> want<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.120> zoom<00:03:04.600> in<00:03:04.840> on

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
more for example we want to zoom in on

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.490 
more for example we want to zoom in on

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
this holiday gift guide editor pic that

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.180 
this holiday gift guide editor pic that
we<00:03:08.560> have<00:03:08.890> here<00:03:09.160> on<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.850> Nexus<00:03:10.890> here<00:03:11.890> actually

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
we have here on the Nexus here actually

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.380 
we have here on the Nexus here actually
is<00:03:12.700> very<00:03:13.440> inaccurate<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.280> case<00:03:15.550> we<00:03:16.180> don't

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
is very inaccurate in this case we don't

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.290 
is very inaccurate in this case we don't
know<00:03:16.600> why<00:03:16.840> again<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:18.010> goes<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.820> somewhere<00:03:19.239> else

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
know why again it goes to somewhere else

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.070 
know why again it goes to somewhere else
and<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.140> iphone<00:03:20.470> 4s<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.730> zooms<00:03:22.120> in<00:03:22.360> exactly

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
and on the iphone 4s it zooms in exactly

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.710 
and on the iphone 4s it zooms in exactly
where<00:03:23.770> we<00:03:24.190> want<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:27.640> as<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.000> can<00:03:28.360> see<00:03:28.570> we

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
where we want it to so as you can see we

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.040 
where we want it to so as you can see we
are<00:03:28.900> both<00:03:29.320> handsets<00:03:29.950> work<00:03:30.910> with<00:03:31.300> that

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
are both handsets work with that

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.280 
are both handsets work with that
observing<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.280> but<00:03:34.150> probably<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.720> better

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
observing and but probably the better

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.229 
observing and but probably the better
experience<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.100> still<00:03:36.310> found<00:03:36.550> on<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.880> iphone

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
experience is still found on the iphone

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.199 
experience is still found on the iphone
4s<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.590> one<00:03:38.770> area<00:03:38.950> where<00:03:39.160> we<00:03:39.670> would

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
4s so this is one area where we would

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.180 
4s so this is one area where we would
like<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.630> see<00:03:40.840> Google<00:03:41.290> make<00:03:41.530> some<00:03:41.860> progress

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
like to see Google make some progress

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.990 
like to see Google make some progress

double tap zooming in the web browser as

double tap zooming in the web browser as

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
of right now both handsets do not

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.040 
of right now both handsets do not
support<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.500> Flash<00:03:50.860> plugin<00:03:51.540> because<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.870> is

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
support the Flash plugin because it is

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.100 
support the Flash plugin because it is
still<00:03:53.140> not<00:03:54.330> optimized<00:03:55.330> for<00:03:55.480> ice<00:03:55.870> cream

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110

sandwich<00:03:56.709> which<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.010> running<00:03:57.519> on<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.880> Samsung

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
sandwich which is running on the Samsung

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.250 
sandwich which is running on the Samsung
Galaxy<00:03:58.900> Nexus<00:03:59.620> and<00:04:00.390> of<00:04:01.390> course<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:02.050> lack<00:04:02.230> of

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
Galaxy Nexus and of course the lack of

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.430 
Galaxy Nexus and of course the lack of
flash<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:03.040> probably<00:04:03.760> what<00:04:04.000> allows<00:04:04.840> us<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.230> have

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
flash is probably what allows us to have

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.040 
flash is probably what allows us to have
this<00:04:05.470> incredibly<00:04:06.190> smooth<00:04:06.580> experience<00:04:07.390> on<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
this incredibly smooth experience on the

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.320 
this incredibly smooth experience on the
iphone<00:04:08.560> 4s<00:04:09.300> browser<00:04:10.300> and<00:04:12.090> probably<00:04:13.090> that's

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
iphone 4s browser and probably that's

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.900 
iphone 4s browser and probably that's
what<00:04:13.810> makes<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:14.830> good<00:04:14.860> on<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.459> Galaxy

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
what makes it so good on the Galaxy

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.190 
what makes it so good on the Galaxy
Nexus<00:04:16.060> as<00:04:16.450> well<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:18.700> flash<00:04:19.600> will<00:04:19.989> be

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
Nexus as well so but flash will be

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.800 
Nexus as well so but flash will be
ported<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.859> ice<00:04:21.580> cream<00:04:21.940> sandwich<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:22.810> soon

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
ported to ice cream sandwich so soon

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.920 
ported to ice cream sandwich so soon
hopefully<00:04:24.200> sooner<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.240> we<00:04:26.240> expect<00:04:26.480> this<00:04:26.690> to

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
hopefully sooner and we expect this to

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.700 
hopefully sooner and we expect this to
make<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.260> framerate<00:04:27.530> drop<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.550> little<00:04:29.030> but

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
make the framerate drop a little but

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.010 
make the framerate drop a little but
probably<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.889> experience<00:04:31.400> will<00:04:31.580> stay

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
probably the experience will stay

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.960 
probably the experience will stay
tolerable<00:04:33.020> because<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.830> Galaxy<00:04:34.310> Nexus<00:04:34.430> after

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
tolerable because the Galaxy Nexus after

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.600 
tolerable because the Galaxy Nexus after
all<00:04:35.120> has<00:04:35.389> a<00:04:35.600> dual<00:04:36.110> core<00:04:36.440> chipset<00:04:36.950> which<00:04:37.310> should

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
all has a dual core chipset which should

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.250 
all has a dual core chipset which should
allow<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:39.430> pretty<00:04:40.430> decent<00:04:40.940> flash<00:04:41.540> performance

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
allow a pretty decent flash performance

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.360 
allow a pretty decent flash performance
in<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.250> browser<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.930> now<00:04:45.380> let's<00:04:45.770> see<00:04:46.010> how

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
in the browser and now let's see how

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.250 
in the browser and now let's see how
working<00:04:47.150> with<00:04:47.570> multiple<00:04:47.900> pages<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:50.260> executed

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
working with multiple pages is executed

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.340 
working with multiple pages is executed
on<00:04:51.440> both<00:04:51.800> devices<00:04:52.220> on<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.880> Galaxy<00:04:53.360> Nexus<00:04:53.510> when

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
on both devices on the Galaxy Nexus when

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.730 
on both devices on the Galaxy Nexus when
