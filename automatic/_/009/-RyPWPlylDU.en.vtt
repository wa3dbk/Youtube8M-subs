mother motherboard sometimes some phones
get<00:02:28.890> stuck<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.700> CTE<00:02:30.060> level<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.780> doesn't

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
get stuck on the CTE level it doesn't

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.360 
get stuck on the CTE level it doesn't
fully<00:02:31.500> power<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.620> process<00:02:34.620> will

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
fully power on so this process will

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.600

information data using volume down like

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.980 
information data using volume down like
that<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.380> power<00:03:43.860> key<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.340> enter<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.660> at<00:03:45.840> that

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
that and power key to enter and at that

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.330 
that and power key to enter and at that
point<00:03:46.260> all<00:03:46.650> information<00:03:47.370> will<00:03:47.850> be<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:49.050> leader

and<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.550> last<00:03:50.760> step<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.690> remotely<00:03:52.020> detect

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
and the last step is a remotely detect

know<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.760> settings<00:04:15.180> up<00:04:15.870> here<00:04:16.489> zone<00:04:17.489> just<00:04:17.970> a

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
know the settings up here zone just a

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.789 
know the settings up here zone just a
way<00:04:18.299> for<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.630> front<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.140> or<00:04:19.350> we're<00:04:19.530> fully
