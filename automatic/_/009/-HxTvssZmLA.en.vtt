then<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.480> can<00:03:10.689> tell<00:03:10.870> them<00:03:11.609> one<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.969> two<00:03:13.329> so

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
then you can tell them one and two so

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.339 
then you can tell them one and two so
there<00:03:14.769> are<00:03:15.040> two<00:03:15.549> digits<00:03:16.209> in<00:03:16.389> decimal<00:03:16.900> part<00:03:17.169> of

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
there are two digits in decimal part of

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.379 
there are two digits in decimal part of
this<00:03:17.500> number<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:17.889> we<00:03:18.219> shall<00:03:18.400> write<00:03:18.639> 2<00:03:18.939> zeros

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
this number so we shall write 2 zeros

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.559 
this number so we shall write 2 zeros
here<00:03:19.719> and<00:03:20.290> they<00:03:20.530> both<00:03:20.709> this<00:03:20.919> decimal<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.359> the

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
here and they both this decimal so the

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.330 
here and they both this decimal so the
number<00:03:22.840> will<00:03:23.049> be<00:03:23.079> seven<00:03:23.709> thousand<00:03:24.099> and

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
number will be seven thousand and

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.149

sixteen and here in denominator is

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.199 
sixteen and here in denominator is
hundred<00:03:27.810> now<00:03:28.810> we<00:03:28.870> can<00:03:29.109> cancel<00:03:29.379> out<00:03:30.209> this

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
hundred now we can cancel out this

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.929 
hundred now we can cancel out this
hundred<00:03:31.720> by<00:03:31.900> two<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.530> get<00:03:33.299> 50<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.919> this<00:03:35.939> seven

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
hundred by two to get 50 and this seven

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.229

1754 over 25 so this is P by Q form of

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.879 
1754 over 25 so this is P by Q form of
this<00:04:02.979> decimal<00:04:03.659> number<00:04:04.659> so<00:04:05.109> this<00:04:05.319> is<00:04:05.530> all<00:04:05.739> about

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
this decimal number so this is all about

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.759 
this decimal number so this is all about
how<00:04:06.579> we<00:04:06.639> can<00:04:07.030> convert<00:04:07.359> terminating<00:04:08.319> decimal

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
how we can convert terminating decimal

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.890 
how we can convert terminating decimal
expansion<00:04:09.400> into<00:04:09.609> P<00:04:09.970> by<00:04:10.180> Q<00:04:10.239> form
