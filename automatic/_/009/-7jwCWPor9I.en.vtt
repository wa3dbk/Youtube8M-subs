00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
problems now my big question was once I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.819 
problems now my big question was once I
imported<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.370> file<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.480> normally<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.319> like

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
imported a file now normally I like

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.360 
imported a file now normally I like
transfer<00:02:39.430> my<00:02:39.579> files<00:02:39.819> on<00:02:40.180> my<00:02:40.810> old<00:02:40.989> Everio<00:02:41.500> I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
transfer my files on my old Everio I

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.509 
transfer my files on my old Everio I
would<00:02:43.470> transfer<00:02:44.470> my<00:02:45.220> files<00:02:45.519> into<00:02:47.519> video

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
would transfer my files into video

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.319 
would transfer my files into video
Vangelis<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:50.230> transcode<00:02:51.099> them<00:02:51.430> into<00:02:52.299> a

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
Vangelis and and transcode them into a

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.140 
Vangelis and and transcode them into a
format<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.920> Final<00:02:53.920> Cut<00:02:54.040> Express<00:02:54.150> could

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
format that Final Cut Express could

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.280 
format that Final Cut Express could
recognize<00:02:55.900> which<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.349> usually<00:02:56.680> DB<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.930> then

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
recognize which is usually DB and then

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.229 
recognize which is usually DB and then
import<00:02:59.769> them<00:02:59.920> into<00:03:00.099> Final<00:03:00.519> Cut<00:03:00.640> Express<00:03:00.700> and

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
import them into Final Cut Express and

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.649 
import them into Final Cut Express and
the<00:03:02.019> part<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.500> liked<00:03:02.829> about<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.760> that

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.250 
in my final cut this is one of my older
projects<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:24.609> did<00:03:24.880> earlier<00:03:25.090> today<00:03:25.690> with

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
projects that I did earlier today with

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.050 
projects that I did earlier today with
my<00:03:26.590> everio<00:03:27.310> which<00:03:27.549> does<00:03:27.880> not<00:03:28.030> do<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.480> encoding

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060

doing the log and import you guys if you
guys<00:03:56.290> understand<00:03:56.829> how<00:03:56.919> that<00:03:57.129> function<00:03:57.489> works

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
guys understand how that function works

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.979 
guys understand how that function works
then<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.000> already<00:03:58.269> know<00:03:58.389> all<00:03:58.510> about<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.900> if

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
then you already know all about it if

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.349 
then you already know all about it if
you<00:03:59.079> don't<00:03:59.379> then<00:04:00.069> that's<00:04:00.730> what<00:04:01.090> you're<00:04:01.239> gonna

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
you don't then that's what you're gonna

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.059 
you don't then that's what you're gonna
use<00:04:01.449> to<00:04:01.750> get<00:04:01.840> your<00:04:02.049> footage<00:04:02.349> actually<00:04:02.739> into

use to get your footage actually into
the<00:04:03.099> software<00:04:03.549> so<00:04:04.030> okay<00:04:04.720> once<00:04:04.959> your<00:04:05.109> footage

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
the software so okay once your footage

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.099 
the software so okay once your footage
is<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.769> you<00:04:06.400> can<00:04:06.549> drag<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.940> down<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.389> your<00:04:07.569> your

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.129 
editing right away so a lot of people
have<00:04:12.699> been<00:04:12.849> confused<00:04:13.329> about<00:04:13.449> this<00:04:13.690> had<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.959> lot

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
have been confused about this had a lot

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.560 
have been confused about this had a lot
of<00:04:14.230> problems<00:04:14.590> with<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.949> whatever<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:16.239> there's

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
of problems with it whatever so there's

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.770 
of problems with it whatever so there's
the<00:04:16.750> solution<00:04:17.199> for<00:04:17.349> that<00:04:17.440> now<00:04:18.039> let's<00:04:18.880> let's

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the solution for that now let's let's

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.980 
the solution for that now let's let's
move<00:04:19.900> ahead<00:04:20.049> here<00:04:20.349> my<00:04:20.680> next<00:04:20.979> question<00:04:21.400> was

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:21.990 
move ahead here my next question was

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.890 
move ahead here my next question was
where's<00:04:22.990> my<00:04:23.229> footage<00:04:23.710> being<00:04:23.950> saved<00:04:24.370> okay<00:04:25.210> you

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
where's my footage being saved okay you

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
where's my footage being saved okay you
know<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.050> like<00:04:26.469> to<00:04:26.620> create

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
know I like to create

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.230 
know I like to create
my<00:04:27.040> own<00:04:27.190> fold<00:04:27.460> we're<00:04:27.640> putting<00:04:27.880> in<00:04:27.970> my<00:04:28.090> own

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
my own fold we're putting in my own

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.420 
my own fold we're putting in my own
project<00:04:28.750> folder<00:04:29.170> and<00:04:29.320> dump<00:04:29.950> all<00:04:30.070> my<00:04:30.220> raw

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
project folder and dump all my raw

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.100 
project folder and dump all my raw
footage<00:04:30.490> there<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.120> do<00:04:31.210> my<00:04:31.330> editing<00:04:31.480> and<00:04:31.900> save

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
footage there and do my editing and save

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.800 
footage there and do my editing and save
it<00:04:32.230> all<00:04:32.320> under<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:32.650> name<00:04:32.860> so<00:04:33.640> I<00:04:34.000> started<00:04:34.720> getting

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
it all under a name so I started getting

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.260 
it all under a name so I started getting
a<00:04:34.930> little<00:04:35.080> bit<00:04:35.290> curious<00:04:35.620> about<00:04:35.920> that<00:04:36.310> so<00:04:36.700> let's

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
a little bit curious about that so let's

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.720 
a little bit curious about that so let's
go<00:04:37.450> item<00:04:37.990> properties<00:04:38.230> and<00:04:39.540> oh<00:04:41.130> wait<00:04:42.130> I'm<00:04:42.430> sorry

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
go item properties and oh wait I'm sorry

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:52.950 
go item properties and oh wait I'm sorry
that's<00:04:43.690> not<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:44.940> let's<00:04:45.940> say<00:04:47.160> let's<00:04:48.160> try<00:04:51.960> no

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
that's not it let's say let's try no

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.750 
that's not it let's say let's try no
because<00:04:53.350> I've<00:04:53.470> already<00:04:53.590> saved<00:04:53.890> it<00:04:54.100> off<00:04:56.760> okay

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
because I've already saved it off okay

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.460 
because I've already saved it off okay
so<00:04:57.820> that's<00:04:58.420> that's<00:04:58.720> trying<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.140> go<00:04:59.320> into

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
so that's that's trying to go into

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.270 
so that's that's trying to go into
documents<00:05:00.010> obviously<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:02.200> thing<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:02.980> want

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
suggestion and for me what I would do is

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.220 
suggestion and for me what I would do is

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
and put it in my project folder rename

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.740 
and put it in my project folder rename
it<00:05:46.390> and<00:05:46.510> then<00:05:47.140> continue<00:05:47.410> editing<00:05:47.860> with<00:05:48.310> it<00:05:48.490> so

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
it and then continue editing with it so

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.450 
it and then continue editing with it so
I<00:05:49.750> don't<00:05:50.020> know<00:05:50.230> if<00:05:50.320> there's<00:05:50.530> a<00:05:50.620> sad<00:05:51.190> haven't
