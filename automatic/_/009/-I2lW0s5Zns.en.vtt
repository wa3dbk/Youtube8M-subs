Britain if you were to say fanny it
would<00:02:25.780> mean<00:02:26.080> two<00:02:26.740> things<00:02:26.770> really<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.640> was<00:02:27.910> one

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
would mean two things really it was one

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.610 
would mean two things really it was one
mean<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:29.440> vagina<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.270> pussy<00:02:31.620> or

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
mean the vagina or the pussy or

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.460 
mean the vagina or the pussy or
sometimes<00:02:33.610> if<00:02:33.970> someone<00:02:34.630> says<00:02:34.750> oh<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.930> fanny

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
sometimes if someone says oh you fanny

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.100 
sometimes if someone says oh you fanny
it<00:02:35.770> pretty<00:02:36.070> much<00:02:36.160> means<00:02:36.489> you're<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.780> bit<00:02:37.989> of<00:02:38.020> a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
it pretty much means you're a bit of a

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.830 
it pretty much means you're a bit of a
wimp<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.400> you're<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> bit<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.150> pussy<00:02:40.450> pretty

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
wimp but you're a bit of a pussy pretty

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.740 
wimp but you're a bit of a pussy pretty
much<00:02:41.050> it's<00:02:41.410> self-explanatory<00:02:42.360> whereas<00:02:43.360> again

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
much it's self-explanatory whereas again

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.560 
much it's self-explanatory whereas again
in<00:02:44.020> America<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.920> fanny<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.420> flipped<00:02:46.420> around

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
in America the fanny is flipped around

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.510 
in America the fanny is flipped around
and<00:02:47.110> becomes<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.770> bum<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.830> be<00:02:51.010> quite

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
and becomes the bum so it can be quite

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.460 
and becomes the bum so it can be quite
awkward<00:02:53.070> using<00:02:54.070> that<00:02:54.160> word<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.700> America<00:02:55.470> so

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
awkward using that word in America so

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.820 
awkward using that word in America so
again<00:02:57.040> be<00:02:57.580> very<00:02:57.610> careful<00:02:57.940> how<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:59.050> use<00:02:59.230> that

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
again be very careful how you use that

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.039 
again be very careful how you use that
word<00:03:00.100> okay<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.060> next<00:03:01.120> one<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.480> where<00:03:01.750> shit

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
word okay so this next one is where shit

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.370 
word okay so this next one is where shit

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
going commando and that would just be a

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.230 
going commando and that would just be a
little<00:04:09.320> bit<00:04:09.470> strange<00:04:09.770> okay<00:04:10.520> so<00:04:10.580> this<00:04:10.790> next<00:04:10.850> one

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
little bit strange okay so this next one

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.450 
little bit strange okay so this next one
is<00:04:11.270> slightly<00:04:11.690> frustrating<00:04:12.650> as<00:04:12.860> well<00:04:13.100> because

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
is slightly frustrating as well because

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.510 
is slightly frustrating as well because
they<00:04:13.610> are<00:04:13.670> similar<00:04:14.150> sounding<00:04:14.630> words<00:04:14.960> but<00:04:15.770> have

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
they are similar sounding words but have

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.870 
they are similar sounding words but have
slightly<00:04:17.120> different<00:04:17.300> meanings<00:04:18.170> so<00:04:18.850> over<00:04:19.850> here

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
slightly different meanings so over here

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.210 
slightly different meanings so over here
if<00:04:20.360> you<00:04:20.900> all<00:04:21.050> the<00:04:21.200> fish<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.620> chips<00:04:21.860> you<00:04:22.190> would

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
if you all the fish and chips you would

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.390 
if you all the fish and chips you would
get<00:04:22.520> this<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.930> chips<00:04:24.170> would<00:04:24.380> be<00:04:24.590> like<00:04:25.160> the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
get this and the chips would be like the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.320 
get this and the chips would be like the
tato<00:04:25.730> fried<00:04:26.180> potato<00:04:27.250> whereas<00:04:28.250> in<00:04:28.520> America<00:04:29.120> if

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
tato fried potato whereas in America if

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.320 
tato fried potato whereas in America if
you<00:04:29.720> ask<00:04:30.410> for<00:04:30.770> chips<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:31.430> get<00:04:31.670> something<00:04:31.880> like

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
you ask for chips you get something like

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.320 
you ask for chips you get something like
this<00:04:32.810> which<00:04:33.470> again<00:04:33.800> is<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:34.310> slightly<00:04:34.940> different

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
this which again is a slightly different

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.250 
this which again is a slightly different

different things in England and America

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.120 
different things in England and America
and<00:05:23.110> I<00:05:24.110> think<00:05:24.320> America<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.830> don't<00:05:24.980> know<00:05:25.040> what
