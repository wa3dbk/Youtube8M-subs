I<00:01:00.660> rinsed<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.809> rather<00:01:03.809> than<00:01:04.080> waiting

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
I rinsed it out and rather than waiting

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.350

for<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> dry<00:01:05.159> as<00:01:05.220> instructions<00:01:06.180> say<00:01:08.360> tried

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
for it to dry as instructions say tried

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.280 
for it to dry as instructions say tried
to<00:01:09.390> figure<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.900> way<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.200> dry<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.950> without

to figure out a way to dry it without

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.649 
to figure out a way to dry it without

anything<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:17.820> realize<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.570> if

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
anything like that and I realize that if

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.620 
anything like that and I realize that if
I<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.580> if<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.360> um

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.830 

put<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.560> back<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:27.330> air<00:01:27.479> cleaner

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
put the thing back in the air cleaner

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.530 
put the thing back in the air cleaner
housing<00:01:32.240> if<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.360> woman<00:01:33.720> involved

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.540 

the<00:01:37.170> air<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.650> through<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.250> dry<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
the air going through it with dry it

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.000 
the air going through it with dry it
along<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.840> Indian<00:01:40.440> heat<00:01:40.650> from<00:01:40.860> the

along with the Indian heat from the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.250 
along with the Indian heat from the
engine<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> that's<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:42.780> I'm<00:01:42.900> doing<00:01:43.110> right

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
engine so that's what I'm doing right

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.680 
engine so that's what I'm doing right
now<00:01:44.510> been<00:01:45.510> in<00:01:45.660> there<00:01:45.900> for<00:01:46.170> about<00:01:47.180> well<00:01:48.180> long

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
now been in there for about well long

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.900 
now been in there for about well long
enough<00:01:48.870> for<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.260> engine<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.620> warm<00:01:50.130> up<00:01:52.910> get

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
enough for the engine to warm up get

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.460 
enough for the engine to warm up get
ready<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> pull<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> out<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:54.870> now<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.260> see

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
ready to pull it out right now and see

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:09.859 
ready to pull it out right now and see
what<00:01:55.650> kind<00:01:55.830> of<00:01:55.920> condition<00:01:56.070> we're<00:01:56.490> in<00:02:08.869> now

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
what kind of condition we're in now

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.830 
what kind of condition we're in now
probably<00:02:10.110> should<00:02:10.790> this<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.150> video<00:02:12.360> was<00:02:12.720> an

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
afterthought I'm gonna take it off and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.940
