00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.220
 love is like they are welcome once 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.710
 Again, today is not a recipe 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.440
 just an idea of ​​how you can 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.870
 remember your fruits and well this is about 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.029
 to make a fruit pizza with fruits 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.100
 the more you provoke the more you like in 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.220
 this case I chose banana freixas 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.080
 tangerine mangoes grapes kiwi and for 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.320
 of course the antilles to make 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.599
 note that a pizza is left and pacheco 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.840
 I'm going to start doing this for 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.579
 example I will cut very well what is 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 my watermelon 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.050
 this can be done with a lot 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
 Be careful, you know they can be cut and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.670
 then I'm going to cut it into four parts 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.320
 depending on the size of watermelon if 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.420
 they had a much bigger outlet 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.820
 Well, I think you can go out more 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.640
 partecitas 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.400
 and let's decorate our watermelon girls 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.079
 so I'm for the right hand and 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.820
 such and for the left the always here 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.730
 helping me and you can do it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.920
 girls like that very dynamically with help 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 of your children really is a very idea 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.600
 pretty that you can 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.540
 used for example for 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.160
 meeting for your guests same fancés 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.400
 for your goods 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.560
 it really looks very nice and if it is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.890
 with the help of the family as it is 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.289
 much prettier with this so I would 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.300
 I'm doing this way and how it 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.580
 You know davis girls always walk me 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.009
 Adam in everything so he is the fastest 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.280
 I only tell them to wash themselves very 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.960
 ok your little hands before doing this 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.729
 you have to have a lot of hygiene girls and 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.470
 as well as I am not this way 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.000
 like at the beginning you see something 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.830
 messy but you 're going to see the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.830
 result when serving 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.380
 and well here girls I'm going to serve 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.090
 very carefully on a plate and not 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.070
 necessarily it has to be this fruit 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.759
 you can add the fruits that you 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.610
 more want 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.619
 I cook grated coconut or if you are dry what 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.509
 that you like in this case too 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.369
 I know, as you know, I love the 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.649

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.110
 milk started then pacific and I was 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.549

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.470
