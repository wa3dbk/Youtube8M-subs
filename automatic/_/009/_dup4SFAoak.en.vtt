to<00:00:06.870> set<00:00:07.080> up<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.379> use<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.680> spindle<00:00:08.069> molder<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
to set up and use the spindle molder the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.700 
to set up and use the spindle molder the
first<00:00:09.059> thing<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.360> need<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.660> do<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.170> lock<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
first thing we need to do is lock the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.350 
first thing we need to do is lock the
spindle<00:00:10.950> into<00:00:11.250> position<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> cannot<00:00:12.179> move

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
spindle into position so it cannot move

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.289 
spindle into position so it cannot move
whilst<00:00:12.690> making<00:00:12.929> adjustments<00:00:13.670> to<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.059> we

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
whilst making adjustments to do that we

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.900 
whilst making adjustments to do that we
take<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.690> lever<00:00:15.929> here<00:00:16.350> pushing<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.460> forward

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
take this lever here pushing it forward

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.630 
take this lever here pushing it forward
and<00:00:18.090> then<00:00:19.020> lifting<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.619> will<00:00:20.250> lock<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and then lifting it up will lock the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.009 
and then lifting it up will lock the
spindle<00:00:20.850> into<00:00:21.119> place<00:00:21.920> like<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:26.630> next<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.869> can

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
spindle into place like so next we can

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.169 
spindle into place like so next we can
put<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.890> appropriate<00:00:29.070> cutting<00:00:29.699> block<00:00:29.910> into

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
put the appropriate cutting block into

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.049 
put the appropriate cutting block into
the<00:00:30.269> spindle<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:32.180> then<00:00:33.180> use<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> spacers<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
the spindle and then use the spacers to

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.569 
the spindle and then use the spacers to
ensure<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:37.200> thread<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.129> nut<00:00:38.340> is

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
ensure that the thread on the nut is

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:49.270 
ensure that the thread on the nut is
covered<00:00:38.969> completely

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.670 

ensure<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:49.940> tight<00:00:50.180> enough<00:00:50.360> but<00:00:51.290> not<00:00:51.410> over

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
ensure is tight enough but not over

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.760 
ensure is tight enough but not over
tight

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.350 

we<00:00:58.310> can<00:00:58.460> then<00:00:58.610> adjust<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.090> fences<00:01:01.150> so<00:01:02.150> they

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
we can then adjust the fences so they

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.180 
we can then adjust the fences so they
are<00:01:02.540> as<00:01:02.660> close<00:01:02.840> as<00:01:03.110> reasonably<00:01:03.590> possible<00:01:03.830> to

and<00:01:22.790> we<00:01:23.150> should<00:01:23.330> adjust<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.990> speed<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.890> the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
and we should adjust the speed of the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.560 
and we should adjust the speed of the
machine<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.520> suit<00:01:25.730> that<00:01:25.880> particular<00:01:26.150> block

type on the front of this machine we

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.360 
type on the front of this machine we
have<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> diagram<00:01:29.750> showing<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.590> belt<00:01:30.890> position

have a diagram showing the belt position

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
have a diagram showing the belt position
on<00:01:31.490> these<00:01:31.640> pulleys<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.610> we<00:01:34.700> can<00:01:34.820> adjust<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.240> to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
on these pulleys so we can adjust it to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.109 
on these pulleys so we can adjust it to
the<00:01:35.450> right<00:01:35.660> speed<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.369> do<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.580> we<00:01:37.729> loosen<00:01:38.030> it

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
the right speed to do that we loosen it

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.450 
the right speed to do that we loosen it
off<00:01:38.500> move<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.650> belt<00:01:39.860> down<00:01:40.040> onto<00:01:40.369> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
off move the belt down onto the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.969 
off move the belt down onto the
appropriate<00:01:40.550> pulleys<00:01:47.710> tighten<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.800> back<00:01:48.920> up

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
appropriate pulleys tighten it back up

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.190 
appropriate pulleys tighten it back up
again<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.610> then<00:01:50.210> check<00:01:50.540> to<00:01:50.660> make<00:01:50.780> sure<00:01:50.840> that

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
again and then check to make sure that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:02.850 
again and then check to make sure that
the<00:01:51.440> pulley<00:01:52.160> runs<00:01:52.460> free

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.710 

now<00:02:03.430> we're<00:02:03.610> going<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.760> set<00:02:04.000> up<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.330> position

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
now we're going to set up the position

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.550 
now we're going to set up the position
of<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.900> fences<00:02:07.050> into<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.140> desired<00:02:08.470> position

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
of the fences into the desired position

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.230 
of the fences into the desired position
depending<00:02:09.280> on<00:02:09.399> what<00:02:09.580> type<00:02:09.790> of<00:02:09.820> cut<00:02:10.119> we're

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
depending on what type of cut we're

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.170 
depending on what type of cut we're
going<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.390> make<00:02:14.580> make<00:02:15.580> sure<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:15.970> both<00:02:16.120> the
