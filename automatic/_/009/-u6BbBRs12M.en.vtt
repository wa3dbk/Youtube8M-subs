flowers you can make them it kind of
shows<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.809> extra<00:00:13.110> effort<00:00:13.280> but<00:00:14.280> actually<00:00:14.580> it's

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
shows the extra effort but actually it's

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.430 
shows the extra effort but actually it's
not<00:00:14.759> completely<00:00:15.570> simple<00:00:16.049> there<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.199> one

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
not completely simple there is one

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.990 
not completely simple there is one
difficult<00:00:16.949> fold<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:17.460> we'll<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.850> in

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
difficult fold but we'll get to that in

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.590 
difficult fold but we'll get to that in
a<00:00:18.119> minute

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
a minute

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.779 
a minute
so<00:00:19.560> we're<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.800> gonna<00:00:19.890> start<00:00:20.160> off<00:00:20.279> making<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
so we're just gonna start off making the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.470 
so we're just gonna start off making the
square<00:00:21.830> pretty<00:00:22.830> basic<00:00:23.010> move<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.580> origami<00:00:26.480> you

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
square pretty basic move and origami you

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.210 
square pretty basic move and origami you
just<00:00:27.660> fold<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.080> over<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.500> then<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.830> fold<00:00:29.070> it

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
just fold it over and then you fold it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.410 
just fold it over and then you fold it
over<00:00:29.340> again<00:00:29.429> right<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.269> see

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
over again right here as you can see

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
over again right here as you can see

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
make sure to get that crease nice and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.610 
make sure to get that crease nice and
good<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> use<00:00:37.110> saliva<00:00:37.469> but

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
good you don't have to use saliva but

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.869 
good you don't have to use saliva but
you<00:00:37.710> could<00:00:37.890> use<00:00:38.040> scissors<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
you could use scissors you know that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.160 
you could use scissors you know that
depends<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.239> how<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.450> feel<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.750> those

things
this<00:00:41.550> flavor<00:00:41.820> works<00:00:42.030> pretty<00:00:42.300> well<00:00:42.420> though<00:00:43.340> so

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
this flavor works pretty well though so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.260 
this flavor works pretty well though so
here's<00:00:44.520> our<00:00:44.610> basic<00:00:44.820> square<00:00:47.030> actually<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
here's our basic square actually the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.430 
here's our basic square actually the
basic<00:00:48.600> basic<00:00:48.989> move<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> lot<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.280> origami

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
basic basic move for a lot of origami

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
basic basic move for a lot of origami
I'm<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.739> Frog<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.280> example<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.730> made<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
I'm the Frog for example is made with a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.540 
I'm the Frog for example is made with a
square<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.649> fold<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.039> over<00:00:56.070> point<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
square so you just fold it over point to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.740 
square so you just fold it over point to
point<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.270> sure<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.570> these

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
point you want to be sure to get these

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.950 
point you want to be sure to get these
first<00:00:58.050> creases<00:00:58.590> pretty<00:00:58.829> good<00:00:59.539> because<00:01:00.539> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
first creases pretty good because this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.219 
first creases pretty good because this
is<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> base<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> whole<00:01:02.340> thing

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
is kind of the base if the whole thing

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.679 
is kind of the base if the whole thing
now<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.470> tuck<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.390> squish<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.540> down

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
now we just tuck this in squish it down

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.890 
now we just tuck this in squish it down
I'm<00:01:07.650> sure<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.159> point<00:01:08.400> nice

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.850 

and<00:01:15.500> I<00:01:15.560> fold<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:15.980> over<00:01:16.070> like<00:01:16.280> this<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.740> we're

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
and I fold it over like this and we're

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.490 
and I fold it over like this and we're
kind<00:01:19.010> of<00:01:19.040> squish<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.460> down<00:01:19.550> again<00:01:19.910> I<00:01:20.410> try<00:01:21.410> to

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
kind of squish it down again I try to

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.610 
kind of squish it down again I try to
make<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.710> like<00:01:21.860> right<00:01:22.070> down<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.400> middle<00:01:23.620> you

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
make it like right down the middle you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.980 
make it like right down the middle you
can<00:01:24.710> see<00:01:25.000> crease<00:01:26.000> that<00:01:26.210> over

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.249 

now<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> next<00:01:31.619> slide<00:01:33.259> squish

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
now you just go to the next slide squish

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.289 
now you just go to the next slide squish
that<00:01:34.439> down<00:01:34.500> again<00:01:35.009> same<00:01:35.549> thing<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.240> do

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
that down again same thing you can do

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.850 
that down again same thing you can do
the<00:01:36.390> same<00:01:36.570> thing<00:01:36.840> four<00:01:37.110> times<00:01:37.140> pretty<00:01:37.770> much

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the same thing four times pretty much

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.100 
the same thing four times pretty much
everything<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:39.329> doing<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.899> it's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
everything you're doing on this it's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.279 
everything you're doing on this it's
gonna<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.380> done<00:01:40.500> four<00:01:40.770> times<00:01:41.039> over<00:01:42.200> it's<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
gonna be done four times over it's a

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.910 
gonna be done four times over it's a
four<00:01:43.500> sided<00:01:43.679> flower

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.080 

another<00:01:49.580> crease<00:01:49.850> here<00:01:51.670> right<00:01:52.670> now<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.850> should

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
another crease here right now you should

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.350 
another crease here right now you should
be<00:01:53.120> cruising<00:01:54.110> along

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.679 

and<00:01:59.900> one<00:02:00.110> more

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.210 

right<00:02:04.380> there<00:02:04.679> right<00:02:05.189> there<00:02:06.920> okay<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.129> is

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
right there right there okay this is

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.040 
right there right there okay this is
actually<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.670> most<00:02:08.819> difficult<00:02:08.970> fold<00:02:09.599> because

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
actually the most difficult fold because

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.860 
actually the most difficult fold because
you're<00:02:10.170> working<00:02:10.349> without<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.009> crease<00:02:11.940> you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
you're working without a crease you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.460 
you're working without a crease you
gotta<00:02:12.989> kind<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.260> tuck<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.799> like<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.310> and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
gotta kind of tuck it in like this and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.869 
gotta kind of tuck it in like this and
kind<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.860> over<00:02:17.040> halfway<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.670> top

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
kind of get it over halfway on the top

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.809 
kind of get it over halfway on the top
like<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:19.010> it'll<00:02:20.010> make<00:02:20.160> more<00:02:20.310> sense<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.760> a

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
like that it'll make more sense in a

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.449 
like that it'll make more sense in a
second<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:24.049> get<00:02:25.049> that<00:02:25.170> nice<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.470> nice<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.280> good

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
second I get that nice and nice and good

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.979 
second I get that nice and nice and good
though<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.269> actually<00:02:27.599> gonna<00:02:27.690> be<00:02:27.810> part<00:02:27.959> of

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
though this is actually gonna be part of

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.920 
though this is actually gonna be part of
your<00:02:28.110> pedal<00:02:28.879> then<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:30.000> pull<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.780> other

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
your pedal then you pull in the other

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.509 
your pedal then you pull in the other
side<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.590> said<00:02:32.099> you're<00:02:32.220> kind<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.400> working

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
side you said you're kind of working

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.240 
side you said you're kind of working
without<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.879> safety<00:02:33.180> net<00:02:33.330> here<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.769> you'll

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
without a safety net here but you'll

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.680 
without a safety net here but you'll
know<00:02:35.370> when<00:02:35.519> it's<00:02:35.640> done<00:02:35.790> right<00:02:36.060> because<00:02:36.209> it'll

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
know when it's done right because it'll

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.119 
know when it's done right because it'll
match<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:37.079> for<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> middle<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.799> can<00:02:37.920> see

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
match up for the middle as you can see

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.490 
match up for the middle as you can see
right<00:02:38.310> here<00:02:41.209> it's<00:02:42.209> gonna<00:02:42.329> fold<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:42.780> back<00:02:42.930> down

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
right here it's gonna fold it back down

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.809 
right here it's gonna fold it back down
I<00:02:45.680> get<00:02:46.680> nice<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:46.860> good<00:02:47.220> because<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:47.760> said

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
I get nice and good because like I said

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.559 
I get nice and good because like I said
is<00:02:48.090> your<00:02:48.299> pedals

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.720 

you're<00:02:54.170> gonna<00:02:54.290> do<00:02:54.439> it<00:02:54.470> again<00:02:54.620> four<00:02:55.310> times<00:02:57.730> pull

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
you're gonna do it again four times pull

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.480 
you're gonna do it again four times pull
it<00:02:58.879> in

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.600 

right<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.070> gotta<00:03:05.250> kind<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.460> just

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
right there so you gotta kind of just

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.950 
right there so you gotta kind of just
fold<00:03:05.820> or<00:03:06.030> every<00:03:06.240> kind<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.450> almost<00:03:06.720> kind<00:03:06.900> of

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
fold or every kind of almost kind of

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.930 
fold or every kind of almost kind of
squish<00:03:07.200> your<00:03:07.380> fingers<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.580> almost<00:03:08.700> want

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
squish your fingers and you almost want

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.240 
squish your fingers and you almost want
to<00:03:08.970> kind<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.210> pull<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.050> don't<00:03:10.950> make<00:03:11.070> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
to kind of pull it in and don't make the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.800 
to kind of pull it in and don't make the
hard<00:03:11.460> crease<00:03:11.760> yet<00:03:12.030> until<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.390> got<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.630> lined

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
hard crease yet until you got it lined

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.600 
hard crease yet until you got it lined
up<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.080> kind<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.470> like<00:03:13.650> smoothly<00:03:14.040> folded

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
up just kind of like smoothly folded

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.000 
up just kind of like smoothly folded
over<00:03:14.870> as<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.020> can<00:03:16.140> see<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:16.440> gonna<00:03:16.530> round<00:03:16.830> it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
over as you can see it's gonna round it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.180 
over as you can see it's gonna round it
up<00:03:17.130> there<00:03:18.290> then<00:03:19.290> once<00:03:19.500> I've<00:03:19.680> got<00:03:19.710> it<00:03:19.980> right

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
up there then once I've got it right

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.160 
up there then once I've got it right
here<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:21.420> what<00:03:21.600> I'm<00:03:21.690> gonna<00:03:21.810> squeeze<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.440> in

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
here that's what I'm gonna squeeze it in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.260 
here that's what I'm gonna squeeze it in
crease<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.320> up

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:37.339 

just<00:03:29.870> two<00:03:30.050> more<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.350> go

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.699 

slide<00:03:37.920> number<00:03:38.129> three

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
slide number three

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.380 
slide number three
squish<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.549> in<00:03:40.670> right<00:03:40.909> now<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.060> should<00:03:41.360> be

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
squish it in right now you should be

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.580 
squish it in right now you should be
getting<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.629> little<00:03:41.720> better<00:03:41.870> at<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.230> but<00:03:42.319> it's

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
getting a little better at it but it's

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.080 
getting a little better at it but it's
still<00:03:42.799> like<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.040> said<00:03:43.340> it's<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.579> hard<00:03:43.760> crease

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
still like I said it's a hard crease

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.539 
still like I said it's a hard crease
it's<00:03:44.620> kind<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.650> makes<00:03:45.799> this<00:03:45.920> an<00:03:46.040> intermediate

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
it's kind of makes this an intermediate

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.759 
it's kind of makes this an intermediate
flower<00:03:46.819> I<00:03:46.970> believe<00:03:47.299> but<00:03:47.659> it's<00:03:48.049> it's<00:03:48.439> gently

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
flower I believe but it's it's gently

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.990 
flower I believe but it's it's gently
worth<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.069> effort<00:03:52.930> there<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.019> go

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
worth the effort there you go

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.119 
worth the effort there you go
squish<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.239> in<00:03:56.500> as<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.590> can<00:03:57.739> see<00:03:57.859> if<00:03:57.980> you

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
squish that in as you can see if you

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.890 
squish that in as you can see if you
kind<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:58.790> keep<00:03:58.909> it<00:03:59.060> loose<00:03:59.239> in<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.450> beginning

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
kind of keep it loose in the beginning

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.630 
kind of keep it loose in the beginning
you<00:03:59.989> can<00:04:00.019> you<00:04:00.349> can<00:04:00.500> kind<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.040> move<00:04:01.189> it<00:04:01.310> back<00:04:01.489> and

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
you can you can kind of move it back and

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.780 
you can you can kind of move it back and
forth<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.299> then<00:04:03.290> when<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.069> got<00:04:04.220> it<00:04:04.340> lined<00:04:04.670> up

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
forth and then when you got it lined up

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.339 
forth and then when you got it lined up
nice<00:04:05.000> that's<00:04:05.540> when<00:04:05.689> you<00:04:05.780> bring<00:04:05.930> in<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.140> hard

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
nice that's when you bring in the hard

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.050 
nice that's when you bring in the hard
crease

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.640 

we're<00:04:12.600> gonna<00:04:12.690> make<00:04:12.870> sure<00:04:12.930> your<00:04:13.140> backs<00:04:13.350> are

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
we're gonna make sure your backs are

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.830 
we're gonna make sure your backs are
flat<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.280> kind<00:04:14.490> of<00:04:14.520> bring<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.820> around<00:04:14.910> if

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
flat so you kind of bring it around if

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.810 
flat so you kind of bring it around if
it's<00:04:15.960> lopsided<00:04:16.170> in<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.709> back<00:04:16.890> that's<00:04:17.730> just

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
it's lopsided in the back that's just

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.180 
it's lopsided in the back that's just
kind<00:04:18.090> of<00:04:18.120> more<00:04:18.269> of<00:04:18.360> it<00:04:18.450> makes<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.590> easy<00:04:19.799> it's

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
kind of more of it makes it easy it's

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.610 
kind of more of it makes it easy it's
not<00:04:20.310> necessary<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.410> know<00:04:22.410> kind<00:04:22.590> of

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
not necessary but you know kind of

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.040 
not necessary but you know kind of
figured<00:04:22.950> out<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.340> if<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:24.300> all<00:04:24.450> upside<00:04:24.900> it

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
figured out it if it's all upside it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.360 
figured out it if it's all upside it
back<00:04:25.170> there<00:04:25.380> it's<00:04:25.500> better<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.800> fold<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.130> over<00:04:26.220> a

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
back there it's better to fold it over a

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.430 
back there it's better to fold it over a
couple<00:04:26.580> times<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.660> get<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.900> nice<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.050> flat

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
couple times to to get it nice and flat

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.250 
couple times to to get it nice and flat
and<00:04:28.710> here<00:04:28.860> comes<00:04:29.040> our<00:04:29.160> final<00:04:29.520> fold<00:04:30.170> and<00:04:31.170> at

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
and here comes our final fold and at

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.630 
and here comes our final fold and at
this<00:04:31.410> point<00:04:31.680> we're<00:04:31.890> almost<00:04:32.040> through<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.460> hard

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
this point we're almost through the hard

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.420 
this point we're almost through the hard
part<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.030> after<00:04:33.390> this<00:04:33.630> it's<00:04:33.840> easy<00:04:34.020> street

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
part and after this it's easy street

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.980 
part and after this it's easy street
almost<00:04:35.430> there

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.730 

sometimes<00:04:41.990> it's<00:04:42.080> gonna<00:04:42.199> just<00:04:42.379> keep<00:04:42.530> flipping

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
sometimes it's gonna just keep flipping

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.040 
sometimes it's gonna just keep flipping
over<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.220> flattening<00:04:43.610> out<00:04:43.759> a<00:04:43.819> little<00:04:44.000> bit<00:04:44.240> and

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
over and flattening out a little bit and

just<00:05:08.760> two<00:05:09.000> sides<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.540> go

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.590 

this<00:05:14.640> is<00:05:14.760> actually<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.120> point<00:05:15.240> a<00:05:15.390> lot<00:05:15.480> of

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
this is actually the point a lot of

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.170 
this is actually the point a lot of
times<00:05:15.780> where<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.020> get<00:05:16.170> excited<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:17.180> might

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
times where I get excited and I might

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.640 
times where I get excited and I might
even<00:05:18.330> have<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.140> slow<00:05:19.320> down<00:05:19.350> occasionally<00:05:21.650> I'm

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
even have to slow down occasionally I'm

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.900 
even have to slow down occasionally I'm
gonna<00:05:22.800> make<00:05:22.950> sure<00:05:23.040> these<00:05:23.190> last<00:05:23.400> creases<00:05:23.790> are

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
gonna make sure these last creases are

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.370 
gonna make sure these last creases are
good<00:05:24.060> of<00:05:24.180> course<00:05:24.360> because<00:05:24.660> there's<00:05:24.840> we're

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
good of course because there's we're

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.600 
good of course because there's we're
dealing<00:05:25.560> with<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.710> actual<00:05:25.980> outside<00:05:26.130> right

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
dealing with the actual outside right

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.600 
dealing with the actual outside right
now<00:05:26.730> these<00:05:26.820> are<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.060> finishing<00:05:27.450> touches<00:05:28.610> and

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
like a petal and a rounded shape but you

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.600 
like a petal and a rounded shape but you
couldn't<00:05:52.440> really<00:05:52.560> get<00:05:52.740> with<00:05:52.860> a<00:05:52.890> fold<00:05:53.250> you<00:05:53.460> need
