00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.770
 Hello everyone guys with you I am with 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.049
 rachinsky this channel led mania 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.610
 and today we will repair with you 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:22.060
 here this bike brought him to us 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.640
 under warranty he had trouble did not 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.490
 rear stars work or rather not 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.600
 scroll when you pedal it 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.539
 have we pedal forward wheel y 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:39.399
 we do not rotate showing clearly then 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:41.469
 have when we rotate our rods and we 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.870
 the star rotates but the wheel does not rotate 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:49.809
 and now here now say was a hook in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.120
 the wheels started spinning again but if 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.039
 we now spin them back and 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.219
 forward scroll is not a fact that she 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.670
 hooked now catches and now 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.019
 necid 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.150
 shorter say the problems we have inside 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.320
 The problem is that dogs so 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.180
 called 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.360
 do not cling to the slots and do not rotate the wheels 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.420
 I will not be tricky here, I will probably change 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.150
 completely star but to change 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.190
 the star needs to know how to do it for 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.840
 order to remove this 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.900
 we need an elementary set 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.130
 tools namely slotted puller 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.030
 Here is a form that is inserted 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.670
 directly into the star and the key which 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.620
 Fits under this puller with enough 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.310
 big lever specifically so you can 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.090
 there was a twist star with wheels 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 a little effort 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:22.090
 insert the puller directly 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:25.510
 star put our key on the puller 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.640
 and then a sharp movement is needed against 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.640
 clockwise unscrew our star 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.459
 all and then he goes easy enough 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:48.970
 unscrew the star at the same time we take 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.970
 new star 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.510
 and just wind it on home thread 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.700
 here there is a thread on which 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.959
 wind the second star on the cut we 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.730
 wrap a new star 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:13.420
 cheat her hands without any 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:16.760
 pullers just clockwise 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.700
 it is not necessary to clamp strongly because well 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.730
 anyway do not pinch yes and sense in it 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.840
 no because we have a star yes yes 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.090
 will clamp 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.480
 circuit itself when you start 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.849
 direct ride on 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:38.500
 set this wheel on the bike and 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.500
 customize perekidka under the new star 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.640
 now we have a new star on 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:06.550
 the wheel and it allows us how to twist 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.460
 wheel forward and skips the same 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.800
 wheel forward so that we had on to after 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.020
 As we set a new star on 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.570
 I recommend to revise our wheel 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.030
 rear switch settings so as 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.700
 old settings may not match 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.860
 new star 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.210
 And finally, the recommendation personally from 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.980
 don't forget to wash your bike 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.740
 the dirt just kills it especially 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.260
 switching system and system 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.740
 braking so love it and torment 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.700
 often and do not forget to lubricate 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.680
 specialized lubricants which 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.470
 can be bought at any bicycle shop 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.810
 well, on this we have with you ivan ivan 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.540
 Sochi this channel led mania see you soon 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.540
 meetings and remember it will be more interesting 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:11.580
 in order to shoot this star to us 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:22.710
 need and allows you to skip 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:22.710
 star star miss another want 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.849
 after new
