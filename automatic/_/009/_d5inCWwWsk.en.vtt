it<00:01:09.470> really<00:01:09.620> tight<00:01:09.740> near<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.370> scalp<00:01:10.750> not<00:01:11.750> too

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.220 
it really tight near the scalp not too
tight<00:01:12.380> it<00:01:12.560> doesn't<00:01:12.800> cause<00:01:12.950> any<00:01:12.980> pain<00:01:13.520> but<00:01:14.230> just

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
tight it doesn't cause any pain but just

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.950 
tight it doesn't cause any pain but just
so<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:15.470> won't<00:01:15.650> be<00:01:15.770> poofy<00:01:16.190> right<00:01:16.400> here<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:16.960> then

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so it won't be poofy right here and then

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.850 
so it won't be poofy right here and then
I<00:01:18.080> twist<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:20.500> it's<00:01:21.500> still<00:01:21.770> really<00:01:21.980> wet

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.610 

if<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.640> let<00:01:26.910> it<00:01:27.120> if<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.450> take<00:01:27.660> a<00:01:27.690> loose<00:01:28.050> at<00:01:28.290> while

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
if I let it if I take a loose at while

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.500 
if I let it if I take a loose at while
it's<00:01:28.830> damp<00:01:29.160> and<00:01:29.370> then<00:01:29.730> just<00:01:29.940> let<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> air<00:01:30.480> dry

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
it's damp and then just let it air dry

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.700 
it's damp and then just let it air dry
it's<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.620> to<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.830> really<00:01:31.890> thick<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:34.110> poofy

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it's going to get really thick and poofy

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.790 
it's going to get really thick and poofy
so<00:01:35.370> if<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:35.670> leave<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.120> twist<00:01:36.510> it<00:01:36.750> until<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.890> dries

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
so if I leave it twist it until it dries

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.570 
so if I leave it twist it until it dries
in<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:41.070> drive<00:01:41.370> with<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.270> more

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:03.970 

could<00:01:56.030> effectively<00:01:56.450> right<00:01:56.750> back

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980
