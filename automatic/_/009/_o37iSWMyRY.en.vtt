an<00:03:40.310> iguana<00:03:40.700> perhaps<00:03:41.510> even<00:03:41.660> more<00:03:42.049> um<00:03:42.320> it's<00:03:43.160> it's

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
an iguana perhaps even more um it's it's

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.840 
an iguana perhaps even more um it's it's
just<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:43.970> sad<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.600> me<00:03:44.750> because<00:03:45.850> there's

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
just so sad to me because there's

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.960 
just so sad to me because there's
there's<00:03:47.299> a<00:03:47.360> rule<00:03:47.660> year<00:03:48.019> for<00:03:48.680> every<00:03:49.130> inch<00:03:49.430> of

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
there's a rule year for every inch of

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.940 
there's a rule year for every inch of
space<00:03:50.180> on<00:03:50.630> your<00:03:50.660> turtle<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.410> needs<00:03:51.650> ten

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
space on your turtle it needs ten

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.910 
space on your turtle it needs ten
gallons<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.209> other<00:03:53.360> twelve<00:03:53.840> twelve<00:03:54.739> inch

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
gallons so the other twelve twelve inch

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.650 
gallons so the other twelve twelve inch
turtle<00:03:55.370> you're<00:03:55.519> well<00:03:55.820> over<00:03:56.239> a<00:03:56.450> hundred

turtle you're well over a hundred

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.680 
turtle you're well over a hundred
gallons<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.650> that's<00:03:58.010> just<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.310> minimum<00:03:58.880> so

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
gallons and that's just the minimum so

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.750
