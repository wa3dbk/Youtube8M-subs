released in about the same time is the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.120 
released in about the same time is the
intel<00:01:05.430> ivy<00:01:05.909> bridge<00:01:06.180> processor<00:01:06.960> which<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
intel ivy bridge processor which is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.899 
intel ivy bridge processor which is
intel's<00:01:08.760> new<00:01:09.740> going<00:01:10.740> even<00:01:10.950> intel's<00:01:11.400> newest<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
intel's new going even intel's newest a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.039 
intel's new going even intel's newest a
processor<00:01:12.750> line<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:14.659> it's<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.960> like

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
processor line so it's going to be like

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.410 
processor line so it's going to be like
in<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> new<00:01:16.560> addition<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.950> beer<00:01:17.250> i<00:01:17.490> five<00:01:18.390> by

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
in a new addition to beer i five by

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.039 
in a new addition to beer i five by
seven<00:01:19.369> all<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.490> stuff<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> basically

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
seven all that stuff so basically

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
seven all that stuff so basically
third-generation<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.430> 5i<00:01:24.390> 3i<00:01:24.960> seven<00:01:25.380> um<00:01:26.240> it

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
third-generation I 5i 3i seven um it

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.140 
third-generation I 5i 3i seven um it
goes<00:01:27.420> from<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.840> 32<00:01:28.320> nanometer<00:01:29.150> architecture

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
goes from a 32 nanometer architecture

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.469 
goes from a 32 nanometer architecture
down<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> 22<00:01:31.380> nanometer<00:01:32.220> architecture<00:01:32.790> with

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
down to a 22 nanometer architecture with

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.560 
down to a 22 nanometer architecture with
again<00:01:33.780> great<00:01:34.710> power<00:01:35.009> improvements<00:01:35.610> what's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
again great power improvements what's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.200 
again great power improvements what's
different<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> intel<00:01:38.070> Ivy<00:01:38.250> ivy<00:01:39.000> bridge

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
different with the intel Ivy ivy bridge

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.160 
different with the intel Ivy ivy bridge
processor<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.790> it<00:01:41.790> uses<00:01:42.000> something<00:01:42.930> they

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
processor is that it uses something they

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.899 
processor is that it uses something they
called<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> tri-gate<00:01:44.939> technology<00:01:46.909> which

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
called like a tri-gate technology which

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.569 
called like a tri-gate technology which
basically<00:01:48.270> allows<00:01:49.790> you<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.939> use<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:52.350> 3d<00:01:52.710> realm

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
basically allows you to use the 3d realm

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.429 
basically allows you to use the 3d realm
from<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.560> believe<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> crossing<00:01:56.399> power<00:01:56.610> because

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
from I believe a crossing power because

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.220 
from I believe a crossing power because
you're<00:01:58.439> above<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.130> picture<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.939> now

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.150 

this<00:02:04.230> might<00:02:04.410> take<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> bit<00:02:05.540> tri-gate<00:02:06.920> okay<00:02:07.920> here

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
this might take a bit tri-gate okay here

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.800 
this might take a bit tri-gate okay here
we<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:12.530> okay<00:02:13.530> um<00:02:13.770> let's<00:02:14.070> see<00:02:14.460> what<00:02:14.640> big<00:02:14.820> to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
we go okay um let's see what big to

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.810 
we go okay um let's see what big to
basically<00:02:16.110> ate<00:02:16.380> last<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.800> use<00:02:17.010> some<00:02:17.280> three

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
basically ate last you use some three

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.560 
basically ate last you use some three
sides<00:02:18.320> three<00:02:19.320> surfaces<00:02:19.770> instead<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.400> one<00:02:20.610> I'm

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
sides three surfaces instead of one I'm

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.840 
sides three surfaces instead of one I'm
trying<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.930> find<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.530> good<00:02:22.620> picture<00:02:22.950> well

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
trying to find a good picture well

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.710 
trying to find a good picture well
basically<00:02:24.000> they<00:02:24.240> said<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:24.480> looks<00:02:24.660> like

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
basically they said what looks like

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.600 
basically they said what looks like
supposedly<00:02:25.730> um<00:02:29.570> yeah<00:02:30.570> okay<00:02:30.750> hang<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.610> being

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
supposedly um yeah okay hang on being

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:42.670 
supposedly um yeah okay hang on being
really<00:02:32.820> silly<00:02:33.770> okay<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.780> basically<00:02:39.560> these

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.390 

those<00:02:43.680> um<00:02:44.040> lenox<00:02:44.910> won't<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:46.310> send<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
those um lenox won't like that send the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
those um lenox won't like that send the
signals<00:02:47.760> across<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:49.680> uses<00:02:50.120> three<00:02:51.120> sides

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
signals across and it uses three sides

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.850 
signals across and it uses three sides
of<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.580> these<00:02:53.580> are<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> gates<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.740> beast<00:02:55.740> are

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
of it these are the gates a beast are

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.780 
of it these are the gates a beast are
the<00:02:55.950> gates<00:02:56.160> right<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:57.270> uses<00:02:57.420> three

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
the gates right here and it uses three

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.270 
the gates right here and it uses three
the<00:02:59.790> gates<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.380> cover<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.530> purpose<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:02.040> three

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
the gates of cover this purpose of three

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.710 
the gates of cover this purpose of three
different<00:03:02.430> sides<00:03:02.790> allowing<00:03:03.180> them<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.600> use

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
different sides allowing them to use

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.710 
different sides allowing them to use
three<00:03:04.080> sides<00:03:04.500> instead<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.520> on<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.850> 2d

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
three sides instead of just one on a 2d

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.860 
three sides instead of just one on a 2d
plane<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:11.510> basically<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.540> allows<00:03:12.989> for<00:03:13.320> a

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
plane and so basically that allows for a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.220 
plane and so basically that allows for a
zoom<00:03:15.870> out<00:03:16.019> okay<00:03:16.640> allows<00:03:17.640> for<00:03:18.230> faster

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
zoom out okay allows for faster

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.390 
zoom out okay allows for faster
processing<00:03:19.950> supposedly<00:03:20.820> I'm<00:03:21.540> not<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
processing supposedly I'm not like the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.190 
processing supposedly I'm not like the
biggest<00:03:23.430> computer<00:03:23.970> technician<00:03:24.870> out<00:03:24.959> there

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
biggest computer technician out there

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.410 
biggest computer technician out there
but<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.620> know<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.640> little<00:03:26.880> bit<00:03:27.030> about<00:03:27.269> um<00:03:27.920> then

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
but I know a little bit about um then

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.500 
but I know a little bit about um then
the<00:03:30.420> release<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.959> Windows<00:03:31.500> 8<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:32.070> fall<00:03:32.640> 2012

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
the release of Windows 8 in fall 2012

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.340 
the release of Windows 8 in fall 2012
I'm<00:03:34.170> guessing<00:03:34.860> fall<00:03:35.100> because<00:03:35.459> that's<00:03:35.700> what<00:03:35.880> my

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
I'm guessing fall because that's what my

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.870 
I'm guessing fall because that's what my
guess<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.530> good<00:03:37.590> as<00:03:37.739> anyone's<00:03:38.160> guess<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:38.430> fall

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
guess is good as anyone's guess but fall

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.900 
guess is good as anyone's guess but fall
2012<00:03:39.390> which<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:39.989> bit<00:03:40.170> later<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.910> newly

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
2012 which is a little bit later I newly

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.430 
2012 which is a little bit later I newly
it<00:03:42.000> should<00:03:42.150> have<00:03:42.239> been<00:03:42.299> released<00:03:42.690> along<00:03:43.410> with

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
it should have been released along with

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.550 
it should have been released along with
the<00:03:44.340> nvidia<00:03:44.670> kepler<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.989> intel<00:03:46.260> Ivy

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
the nvidia kepler and the intel Ivy

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.539 
the nvidia kepler and the intel Ivy
Bridge<00:03:46.799> bub<00:03:47.070> sadly<00:03:48.060> no<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:49.549> personally

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
Bridge bub sadly no but I personally

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.580 
Bridge bub sadly no but I personally
don't<00:03:50.730> have<00:03:50.880> my<00:03:51.000> hopes<00:03:51.209> set<00:03:52.110> very<00:03:52.350> high<00:03:52.410> for

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
don't have my hopes set very high for

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.180 
don't have my hopes set very high for
Windows<00:03:53.220> 8<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.640> might<00:03:54.390> not<00:03:54.540> get<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.190> simply

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
Windows 8 I might not get it simply

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.740 
Windows 8 I might not get it simply
because<00:03:56.330> they<00:03:57.330> say<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:59.720> optimized<00:04:00.720> for

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
because they say it is optimized for

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.520 
because they say it is optimized for
tablets<00:04:01.459> which<00:04:02.540> I'm<00:04:03.540> not<00:04:03.870> really<00:04:04.170> going<00:04:04.410> to
