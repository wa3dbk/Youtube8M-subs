00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone here what in doman hd in 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.180
 a new video and before I start my 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.069
 task I prefer to leave them with a good 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.380
 story that I found a few days ago 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.480
 and that I had not been able to publish due to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.910
 that my internet is not working very 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.279
 okay lately but here I am from 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.220
 again this time with a story titled 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.230
 the cat without eyes what happened is so 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.330
 bizarre paranormal and illogical that no 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.060
 I could imagine that many people believe what 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.490
 I'm about to tell I'm a writer 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.929
 a very demanding editorial just had 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.239
 finished a good book of 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.980
 self-improvement but I had mistakes and I 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.579
 had forced to correct them for 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.200
 deliver it again a week later 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.510
 I was always a lover of animals and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.430
 I'm not in my hometown I came because 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 in this city is the main campus 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.899
 from the publisher, I'm just traveling and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.270
 I come from afar I could not bring my 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.760
 pets throughout the trip I'm in 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.739
 a small apartment with no company 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 direct to a pet store for 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.120
 get a temporary partner and not 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.770
 feel alone while I was locked 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.870
 fixing the small errors of the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.820
 book on the way to the place I came across 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.400
 a cat that did not have eyes 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.370
 strangely it did not scare me even 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.979
 pity so I decided to take it just 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.479
 now I regret having done it 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.000
 I took a check with a veterinarian 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.920
 to see that he did not have something serious just 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 I had a small infection in my leg 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.960
 but I was just emerging so 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.910
 it was easy to eradicate it in the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.470
 veterinarian it was easy to notice that I was 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.810
 the only one who did not give her disgust 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.030
 cat's situation I never named him 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.070
 so much because he did not give me time like that 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.860
 I still did not want to be so fond of 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.259
 he once at home I let him play 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.479
 free for the apartment despite 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.430
 being blind seemed to know exactly 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.070
 where he was and how to get around the place 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.810
 it did not seem strange to me I just thought about what 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.660
 arrogant that he would feel the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.399
 poor animal while he played me 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.399
 I started to correct the first mistakes 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.860
 of the book on my laptop immediately I 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.800
 I went to sleep everything was normal in the morning 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.220
 next when everything started believe me or 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.110
 do not 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.060
 when I woke up there was facing me 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.250
 flipping directly to the ceiling a 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.470
 man looking me in the eyes standing to a 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.569
 side of my bed or that I thought I was doing 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.900
 because that man had no eyes with what 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.700
 I just saw a couple of empty basins I screamed 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.099
 like any normal person would 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.170
 I was paralyzed in that man 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.840
 drops to the floor to walk four 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.639
 legs curls up in a corner pulls out of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.609
 your bag a notebook with a pen and 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.409
 begins to write I had the strength to 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.329
 raise your head the man does not 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.549
 reacted little by little I got up 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.769
 taking advantage of how concentrated he was 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.409
 he in his notebook I went to the door 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.109
 and I tried to open it had something down that 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.849
 I adored him try to take it out every time with 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.939
 more desperation and without any effect 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.280
 positive I went to the window I was 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.900
 upholstered with a lot of notepad paper was 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.419
 the base on which I had started 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.730
 write my book just few rays of 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:59.219
 light came in enough to illuminate 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.590
 the room I tried to remove them but 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.239
 They seemed to be perfectly attached to 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.329
 knock window without good 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.829
 result flips and from its corner the 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.620
 man was staring at me 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.870
 with the strong internal darkness of their 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.150
 eyes with a lot of fear and trembling 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.810
 I tried too hard to ask him 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.530
 who are you what do you want from me I received a 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.930
 strong 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.330
 in return it made me think a little and look 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.850
 a little in the room still shaking and with 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.400
 his gaze non-existent fixed and penetrating 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.800
 above me I did not see the blind cat in 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.230
 no side then I noticed what 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.730
 I was so observant my cat was noticing 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.250
 that I had realized what 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.530
 it happened he approached me desperate 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.690
 I tried to get away from him in vain and 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.480
 cooing with me purring these 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.340
 I was about to cry 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.530
 when I saw that he fell asleep I tried to think 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.690
 some solution at that time I could not 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.850
 do anything because if I moved, he sure 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.940
 I would wake up without knowing how or why 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.800
 I fell asleep I woke up and he was 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.940
 new in your corner writing in your 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.130
 small notebook 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.140
 this time turning to me several times 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.800
 to then continue writing in his 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.900
 notebook 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.209
 I got up this time with more confidence 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.300
 because I noticed that he did not plan to make me 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.400
 medium environmental damage made us panic 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.829
 again I was locked in my own 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.380
 room could not go out to the kitchen 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.359
 I had to eat while I thought this 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.490
 I heard a little crunch was the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.920
 stomach of the cat we both turn to the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.680
 same point his belly then he 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.510
 and with nothing to do and I with the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.760
 nerves tipped by his dark gaze 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.310
 so penetrating I said a little stuttering 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.470
 I can not go to the kitchen only if I 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.630
 you let out we can eat when you hear this 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.820
 I watch for two more seconds and came back 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.610
 to his notebook I thought and look for solutions 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.940
 there was none was and I'm still locked 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.070
 here with him I could only think of one thing 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.170
 in a single plan that will rescue me in 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.510
 less than a week the publisher would notice 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.000
 that does not appear would try to contact me 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.160
 he would not answer they would talk to the police and 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.530
 break in and have here if the cat could 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.540
 become human or humanoid or what 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.670
 whatever that may be, you can go back to what 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.070
 before it was then it will seem that 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.050
 I just locked myself in here and the 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.690
 cat will be innocent and will catch 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.910
 someone else at this time I start to 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.040
 write this so that when they enter 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.010
 here and see me starved lean 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.870
 this and take care of the damn cat have 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.060
 after three days of the last 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.370
 I wrote starving and it seems that 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.100
 but he also does nothing follows 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.710
 writing keeps watching me look like 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.289
 that analyzes me I'm your experiment I'm your 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.479

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.549
 because he does this, I was not the only one 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.129
 he has done it I want to get out of here 

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:43.049
 I want that cat away from me not you 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.599
 I can do nothing I would not change anything 

00:05:43.049 --> 00:05:47.429
 I will remain trapped here if I kill him I should 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.949
 follow your game finish your test 

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:51.869

 let him finish do not worry and 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.610
 keep calm I'm on the edge of the 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:02.549
 madness help please help help me not 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.589
 I want to follow here help text 

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:07.019
 found next to a body inside the 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:09.449
 department the body was found in the 

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:12.149
 bed over him a black cat without eyes 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.369
 the body was missing parts of its skin 

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:16.919
 under the hands there were remains of 

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:19.709
 meat and the most spooky it seemed that 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.929
 someone had ripped out the eyes 

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:23.789
 policemen before reading this they believed that 

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:25.919
 the stress had led the writer to 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.959
 edge of madness to lock himself 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.219
 alone and feed his cat and himself 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:31.169
 with his own flesh 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:33.599
 the diary found next to the 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.549
 corpse hinted at something else in 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.409
 how much the cops entered the room 

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:39.700
 the cat turned and looked at them with 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:42.010
 deep darkness of their empty sockets 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.170
 He stared at one of the cops there 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.540
 present and strangely that was the 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.740
 only the panic did not possess took the 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.800
 cat in his arms while 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.570
 they recorded the place when everyone left and 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.910
 before someone could read the 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.250
 daily that police went straight to his 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.260
 house with the feline for four 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.110
 days there is no news of him or of 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.940
 your family good this was all I hope 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.310
 that they liked another creepy pasta and 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:11.130
 remember give it to like or the killer of 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.130
 the spoon will go for you goodbye
