00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.679
 and there personal beauty in the eighth in 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.599
 fashion when the macedo channel is today 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.149
 as he had spoken the year before 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.189
 I'll do an analysis of darksiders 2 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.599
 this magnificent game that for me was so 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.339
 good as the first 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.100
 the pain of pain he was released the 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:39.079
 first prex box and playstation 3 in 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.010
 shortly afterwards it was released to 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.500
 the computer 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.110
 IUC is the new the new console from Nintendo 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.089
 also has its guaranteed version 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.480
 only with no date to launch a 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.480
 dividend of the year we got there, huh? 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.460
 the status was good 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.140
 this time we control death 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.850
 of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.520
 the game he does not get the first one today 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.740
 ended and it was when war proved to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.930
 his innocence and summoned his three 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.020
 siblings if you do not remember the one 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.020
 look 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:36.649
 I saw the dance and once good did not 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.649
 do not go our honeymoon 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.570
 the story of darksiders 2 takes place 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.550
 parallel with the first while 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.630
 war will do everything to prove the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.300
 his innocence 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.430
 death is looking for other solutions and 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.980
 one of the solutions he found was 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.230
 to relive all humans to 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.750
 restore the balance and also save the 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 brother's skin and that's where the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:24.150
 story begins if it is not sick china 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.340
 the dax up to 12 is practically another 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.680
 game when you pick up the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.170
 his game and compares with the first by 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.240
 example the first darksiders it me 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.300
 I remembered a lot of god of war and devil may 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.200
 cry with the own I spoke in the previous blog 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.240
 already dax to 2m he reminds me a lot to 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.459
 Main series mainly play 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.410
 the one that was released in 2008 that 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.170
 that the main character wore a 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.360
 claw and one of the hands the darksiders 2 you 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.730
 It runs much rests on the wall 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.370
 several pieces of wood used from 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.570
 several acrobatics just as it is in the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.160
 party brush 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.590
 I think it was cool because it shows 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.320
 that every horseman of the apocalypse has the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.390
 your style of playing for example the war 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.760
 he was very crude with those can 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.640
 name and everything slow in the blows 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.020
 already the death is not already much more 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.480
 fast and already has a style of 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.940
 Murder I found it very cool. 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.590
 this differentiation that has of a car 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.590
 from the year of the apocalypse to the other 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.110
 the game continued on the slash barbecue but 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.720
 of the age of 12 now also has a lot of 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.520
 rpg for example as you go 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.770
 killing enemies do not feel good is going 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.120
 evolving and the film girl and tailor 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.190
 What are you evolving? 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.950
 you will power with you will buying 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.120
 new skills and as you 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.100
 also evolves 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.930
 You'll see more strength but the armor. 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.640
 more resistance and so on. 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.980
 the game is much more customizable than 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.959
 in the former, for example, as 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.570
 You're going to play, you'll find 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.730
 new armor and these new 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.169
 armours appear are little characters 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.630
 You get a new schin in the 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.030
 character you get a new strength 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.800
 then a new armor something else 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.900
 who also did not have the first game 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.730
 edson the secondary streets then by 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.090
 death beyond the force that the 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.440
 uses she can use swords hammers and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.440
 even fight gloves 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.389
 talking about game curiosity the dax to 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:54.399
 of 12 it has its design made by 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.319
 uncle in madureira a comic strip 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:57.430
 American who also works in the 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.139
 marvel comics 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.449
 so if you found a very long stroke 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.680
 family was not for nothing 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.710
 Now one thing I was wanting 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.249
 talk to you and you did not find one to 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.039
 death very much like raziel then 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:14.680
 rafael then reysol of uf6 gas 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:18.089
 river I found it very similar since the 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.089
 moment I started playing the game 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.530
 making a summary of everything that was good 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.110
 the dax to the sun the 2nd pour and very well 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.230
 the bad commands in the story control 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.750
 very good gameplay is magnificent aaa 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.540
 the freedom you have to visit the 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.040
 worlds to walk the world is incredible is 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.190
 as good as the first better signal 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.410
 and the soundtrack is flawless 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.420
 so if you were afraid that dax 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.270
 the one of two was not as good as the 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.760
 first then failed to take the 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.100
 the first to get to the dinho 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.790
 that the dax of two was able to be 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.790
 better than the first 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.970
 so this is personal 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.220
 the e7 ongoing gets here and 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.740
 liked the video so we forgot about it 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.770
 young and you have not signed up yet 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.020
 on the channel the chance now because it's doubt 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.970
 I say suggestion you can comment here 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.180
