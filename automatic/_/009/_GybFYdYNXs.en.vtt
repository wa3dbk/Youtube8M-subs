00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.990
 3 3 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.900
 we bidart me I was called by 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.440
 a lady who found me in the room 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.500
 of commerce 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.809
 of the Basque country as an entrepreneur 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.199
 forest and pullover tank 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.839
 animal 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.239
 so me with two horses with a 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.809
 Ardennes left there is a male 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.230
 castrated and a Breton mare on the right 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.269
 the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.370
 the blonde is called for him 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.280
 cut an oak tree that fell down just 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.479
 only this winter to cheat him and for 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.430
 back to him because it's a construction site 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.930
 still particular due to the at the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.399
 slope and the difficulty of going up 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.440
 all the wood up there is no 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.149
 the possibility of removing the wood by 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.039
 down so it still takes more than 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.320
 time these horses there need on average 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.940
 800 kg there is bigger than that in the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.710
 draft horses but we are in a 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.569
 hillside area it's not worth it 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.490
 to have huge chauveau we could 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.380
 not necessarily go everywhere either 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.460
 already have their mass to move their 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.800
 abilities she's still pretty 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.539
 high because they can pull their 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.479
 weight and so to two they can shoot 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.850
 a conne 6 which already represents no 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.100
 wood mass hurt because a meter 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.490
 cube is about 8 900 kg where a 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.020
 Oak 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.940
 it's still a good diameter 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:02:10.320
 on a 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:02:11.730
 length quite important enough 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.170
 even though they answer the voice and 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.090
 next to that there are still some 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.890
 operating techniques of way of 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.810
 take out the wood already to hang the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.460
 chains there are several techniques of 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.810
 safe work depending on where 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.340
 we are when we are in the forest there is 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.460
 several stages in the business of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.140
 lumberjack and longshoremen me there already 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.270
 cutting but after exit 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.860
 take out the wood the first step is 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.540
 in fact it is the skidding we speak of 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.970
 skidding in animal traction but one 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.130
 mostly skidding and starting 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.870
 to hide the first step of 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.030
 take the wood where it was cut 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.980
 finally pull the wood where it was cut 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.500
 and bring it to a place where on a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.590
 way where it will be taken over by a 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.350
 motorized craft or animal traction 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.400
 also with a grapple after here we are 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.200
 con and particular feyzin so 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:26.930
 we're all from beginning to end 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:30.109
 what not the grid is good it's still 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.000
 a very well known activity here I am 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.859
 in the department I am at my 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.209
 knowledge the only game takes over the 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.639
 following a tank top that had in the 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.209
 I have the chance to subcontract 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:42.470
 for another longshoremen who is recognized 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.060
 at the national level which has a lot of 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.799
 yards and so for which I 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.659
 would also wish here we start to 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.760
 in any case be contacted by the forests 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.439
 peri-urban areas and in municipalities 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.639
 general it is he too are interested 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.470
 by animal traction because precisely 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.409
 there is little impact on the tracks already 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.120
 created and on the on the environment on 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.680
 the forest floor the people when they 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.410
 saw the work of the horses and everything 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.390
 that while walking they are 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.070
 in very very surprised and very interested 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.900
 it pleases them a lot it creates the link 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.950
 there is a really good side to 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.140
 promote this activity 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.870
 the ground is not damaged at all by 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.019
 the passage of the horses do not know if you 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.780
 have seen how hard it is to see 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.870
 exactly where they went 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.450
 no noise no step of diesel on the 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.690
 lawn just a little dung for them 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.690
 geraniums 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.380
 I 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.340
 soon I will be equipped with a 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.840
 ball back to the ground it will be pulled by 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.520
 one or two horses seven balls to both 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.320
 will make bales of one 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.330
 sterile like hay balls but this 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.160
 will be pieces of wood cut into 1 m ready 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.290
 to incinerate whether they can be 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.930
 intersect in 50 his own like 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.090
 conditioning that's it that orange sas 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.290
 well this is an activity I would like 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.090
 develop in line with the communes or 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.090
 for private projects 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.029
 light 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.000
 he
