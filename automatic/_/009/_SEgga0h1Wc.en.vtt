for adjusting the stitch length it's got

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
for adjusting the stitch length it's got
a<00:00:57.690> little<00:00:58.100> screw<00:00:59.100> right<00:00:59.129> there<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.879> turn

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
a little screw right there that you turn

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.549 
a little screw right there that you turn
and<00:01:01.280> adjust<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.760> good<00:01:03.030> idea<00:01:03.149> every<00:01:03.899> time

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and adjust it's good idea every time

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469

of<00:01:06.659> scrap<00:01:06.900> leather<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:08.299> check<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.479> stitch

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
of scrap leather and check your stitch

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.920 
of scrap leather and check your stitch
length<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.560> make<00:01:10.740> sure<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.909> tension<00:01:12.510> is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
length and make sure that the tension is

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
length and make sure that the tension is
right<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.250> good<00:01:14.490> thing<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
right that's one good thing about a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.140 
right that's one good thing about a
machine<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.970> don't

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
machine like this that you really don't

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.289 
machine like this that you really don't
have<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.540> adjust<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.200> tension<00:01:20.030> every<00:01:21.030> time

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
have to adjust the tension every time

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140 
have to adjust the tension every time
it's<00:01:22.140> pretty<00:01:22.770> consistent<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.580> pulls<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.119> right

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
it's pretty consistent it pulls it right

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.880 
it's pretty consistent it pulls it right
in<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> center<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.470> needs<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
in the center like it needs to be and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.810 
in the center like it needs to be and
I've<00:01:28.890> got<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> fresh<00:01:30.590> blank<00:01:31.590> bobbin<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.400> that

I've got a fresh blank bobbin here that
this<00:01:33.390> will<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:33.780> wind<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.920> bobbing<00:01:35.460> as

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
this will actually wind this bobbing as

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
this will actually wind this bobbing as
I'm<00:01:36.090> sewing<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.840> lever<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:40.409> that's<00:01:40.710> the

I<00:03:17.840> like<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:18.680> servo<00:03:19.160> motor<00:03:19.490> because<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.210> can

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
I like this servo motor because you can

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.530 
I like this servo motor because you can
just<00:03:21.710> really<00:03:22.100> slow<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.820> down<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.330> make

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540

when<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.470> get<00:03:36.590> close<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.370> end<00:03:37.910> right<00:03:38.270> here

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
when I get close to the end right here

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.860 
when I get close to the end right here
I'll<00:03:39.250> really<00:03:40.250> slow<00:03:40.610> down<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:41.060> make<00:03:41.209> sure<00:03:41.270> that

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
I get the point of the needle right in

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.340 
I get the point of the needle right in
like<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.590> very<00:03:45.830> thing<00:03:46.670> in<00:03:47.510> there<00:03:48.020> where<00:03:48.260> it

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350

looks<00:03:48.640> real<00:03:49.640> good<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.980> I've<00:03:52.070> got<00:03:52.220> room<00:03:52.430> for<00:03:52.459> one

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
looks real good so I've got room for one

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.560 
looks real good so I've got room for one
more<00:03:52.880> stitch<00:03:53.510> here<00:03:54.550> no<00:03:55.550> I<00:03:55.580> don't<00:03:55.970> actually

as<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.280> can<00:04:13.400> see<00:04:13.580> this<00:04:13.760> machine<00:04:14.150> has<00:04:14.390> plenty

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
as you can see this machine has plenty

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.510 
okay now I'm going to stop right here
and<00:04:44.139> take<00:04:44.500> in<00:04:46.620> see<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:47.680> can<00:04:47.860> pull<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.220> stitch

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
and take in see I can pull that stitch

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.490 
and take in see I can pull that stitch
up<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:48.910> there's<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.360> loop<00:04:49.660> there<00:04:49.960> what<00:04:50.200> I<00:04:50.230> want

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
up and there's a loop there what I want

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.520 
up and there's a loop there what I want
to<00:04:50.620> do<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:51.010> like<00:04:51.190> pull<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.790> loop<00:04:52.169> like<00:04:53.169> right

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
to do is like pull that loop like right

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.260 
to do is like pull that loop like right
in<00:04:53.889> the<00:04:54.070> center<00:04:54.460> of<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.639> leather<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:55.120> that

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
in the center of the leather and that

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:12.930 
in the center of the leather and that
hole<00:04:55.510> fit<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.320> it<00:04:56.410> won't<00:04:56.620> unravel<00:05:11.700> one<00:05:12.700> more

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
hole fit so it won't unravel one more

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.940 
hole fit so it won't unravel one more
stitch<00:05:13.330> there<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:14.050> then<00:05:14.169> I'll<00:05:14.290> raise<00:05:14.500> my<00:05:14.710> foot

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
stitch there and then I'll raise my foot

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.030 
stitch there and then I'll raise my foot
up<00:05:15.130> yep<00:05:15.610> okay<00:05:16.120> on<00:05:16.300> raise<00:05:17.139> the<00:05:17.320> foot<00:05:17.530> up<00:05:17.680> turn<00:05:18.010> it

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
up yep okay on raise the foot up turn it

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.620 
up yep okay on raise the foot up turn it
like<00:05:18.340> that<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:20.050> usually<00:05:20.500> I<00:05:20.850> overlap<00:05:21.850> like<00:05:22.240> one

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
like that and usually I overlap like one

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.560 
like that and usually I overlap like one
or<00:05:22.840> two<00:05:22.870> stitches
