there has been a jar like that for eight
years<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.030> think<00:02:19.270> when<00:02:19.420> we<00:02:19.510> buy<00:02:19.690> here<00:02:19.959> I've

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
years that I think when we buy here I've

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.990 
years that I think when we buy here I've
only<00:02:20.739> sucked<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.130> was<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.310> little<00:02:21.550> area<00:02:21.760> every
