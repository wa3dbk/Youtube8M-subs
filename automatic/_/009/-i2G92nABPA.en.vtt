eight however all this stuff down here

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.990 
eight however all this stuff down here
at<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.830> bottom<00:04:05.890> is<00:04:06.280> town<00:04:06.489> at<00:04:06.610> level<00:04:06.819> nine<00:04:06.970> I

at the bottom is town at level nine I

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.610 
at the bottom is town at level nine I

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
think because you get 25 walls when you

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.460 
think because you get 25 walls when you
upgrade<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.910> get<00:04:13.030> 25<00:04:13.330> extra<00:04:13.360> walls<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:14.019> i'll

awesome<00:04:16.449> base<00:04:16.930> layout<00:04:17.169> i<00:04:17.350> think<00:04:17.530> it's<00:04:17.650> really

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
awesome base layout i think it's really

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.890 
awesome base layout i think it's really
really<00:04:18.160> good<00:04:18.190> your<00:04:19.120> storages<00:04:19.570> are<00:04:19.720> pretty

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
really good your storages are pretty

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.509 
really good your storages are pretty
protected<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.620> one<00:04:20.799> thing<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.070> really<00:04:21.220> love

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
protected the one thing I really love

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.550 
protected the one thing I really love
about<00:04:21.579> this<00:04:21.940> base<00:04:22.150> is<00:04:22.389> the<00:04:22.720> mortar<00:04:23.050> layout<00:04:23.380> I

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
about this base is the mortar layout I

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.780 
about this base is the mortar layout I
mean<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.800> mortars<00:04:24.130> stretch<00:04:24.400> all<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.669> way

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
mean the mortars stretch all the way

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.670 
mean the mortars stretch all the way
around<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.150> base<00:04:25.300> your<00:04:25.990> wizard<00:04:26.290> towers<00:04:26.560> have

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
around the base your wizard towers have

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.469 
around the base your wizard towers have
pretty<00:04:26.919> good<00:04:27.100> coverage<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.940> only<00:04:28.120> sad<00:04:28.270> that's

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
pretty good coverage the only sad that's

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.879 
pretty good coverage the only sad that's
really<00:04:28.690> lacking<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.290> left<00:04:29.500> side<00:04:29.680> but

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
really lacking is that left side but

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:30.990 
really lacking is that left side but
you're<00:04:30.070> still<00:04:30.220> going<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.430> have<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.639> bunch<00:04:30.820> of

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
you're still going to have a bunch of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.460 
you're still going to have a bunch of
traps<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.479> everything<00:04:31.810> for<00:04:31.960> them<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.380> get

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
traps and everything for them to get

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.560 
traps and everything for them to get
through<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:32.950> really<00:04:33.910> solid<00:04:34.090> down<00:04:34.389> a<00:04:34.419> level

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
through so really solid down a level

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.050 
through so really solid down a level
eight<00:04:34.810> days<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.430> clan<00:04:36.430> castle<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.790> don't<00:04:36.970> like

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
eight days the clan castle I don't like

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.210 
eight days the clan castle I don't like
the<00:04:37.180> location<00:04:37.510> of<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.560> air<00:04:38.710> defense<00:04:39.040> is

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
the location of the air defense is

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.690 
the location of the air defense is
pretty<00:04:39.460> good<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:39.940> might<00:04:40.570> need<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.840> shift<00:04:41.080> some

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
pretty good I might need to shift some

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.890 
pretty good I might need to shift some
or<00:04:42.700> you<00:04:42.880> might<00:04:43.030> want<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.330> shift<00:04:43.510> some<00:04:43.690> air

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
or you might want to shift some air

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.540 
or you might want to shift some air
bottoms<00:04:44.229> up<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.650> top<00:04:44.830> if<00:04:45.070> you're<00:04:45.310> using

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
bottoms up to the top if you're using

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.790 
bottoms up to the top if you're using
this<00:04:45.760> space<00:04:45.970> just<00:04:46.900> because<00:04:47.260> your<00:04:47.530> air

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
this space just because your air

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.860 
this space just because your air
defenses<00:04:48.340> aren't<00:04:48.550> reaching<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:49.210> all<00:04:49.510> corners

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
defenses aren't reaching to all corners

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.689 
defenses aren't reaching to all corners
so<00:04:50.260> some<00:04:50.800> mayor<00:04:50.949> bombs<00:04:51.190> up<00:04:51.370> here<00:04:51.550> would

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
so some mayor bombs up here would

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.900 
so some mayor bombs up here would
probably<00:04:52.120> be<00:04:52.449> best<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:53.340> yeah<00:04:54.340> pretty<00:04:54.639> strong

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
probably be best and yeah pretty strong

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.730 
probably be best and yeah pretty strong
