00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
see I've got a nice nice pile of crap

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.979 
see I've got a nice nice pile of crap
there<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:30.439> same<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> other<00:00:31.740> side

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
there and same on the other side

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.229 

I<00:00:34.100> suppose<00:00:35.100> here's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> good<00:00:35.579> spot<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.090> see

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
I suppose here's a good spot you can see

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.270 
I suppose here's a good spot you can see
just<00:00:36.510> see<00:00:36.660> how<00:00:36.780> thick<00:00:37.460> that<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.700> stuff<00:00:38.969> was

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
just see how thick that this stuff was

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.510 
just see how thick that this stuff was
and<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.489> involved<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.910> same<00:00:43.340> all<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> way

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and it was involved the same all the way

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.979 
and it was involved the same all the way
back<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> transmission<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.719> I'm<00:00:45.809> just

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
back on the transmission so I'm just

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:46.970 
back on the transmission so I'm just
going<00:00:46.170> through<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.710> getting<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
going through and kind of getting the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.660 
going through and kind of getting the
really<00:00:47.100> big<00:00:47.390> chunks<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.539> crap<00:00:48.840> off<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:50.550> up

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
really big chunks of crap off and up

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.229 
really big chunks of crap off and up
here<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:52.070> on<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> valve<00:00:53.340> cover<00:00:53.520> there's<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
here on the on the valve cover there's a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.900 
here on the on the valve cover there's a
bunch<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.110> I'm<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> do<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.789> then

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
bunch so I'm going to do that and then

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.660 
bunch so I'm going to do that and then
maybe<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.199> over<00:00:58.670> pressure

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
maybe see if I can get over pressure

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.170 
maybe see if I can get over pressure
washer<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:00.270> something<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.870> clean<00:01:01.079> off<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:02.180> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
washer or something to clean off the the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.580 
washer or something to clean off the the
rest<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.600> after<00:01:03.840> I've<00:01:03.930> got<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.170> scraped<00:01:06.590> one

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
rest of it after I've got it scraped one

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.230 
rest of it after I've got it scraped one
thing<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.890> did<00:01:08.130> notice<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.850> looking<00:01:09.119> at

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
thing I did notice as I was looking at

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.830 
thing I did notice as I was looking at
it<00:01:09.390> um<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.159> oil<00:01:11.790> leak<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> found<00:01:12.659> when

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it um is that oil leak that I found when

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.630 
it um is that oil leak that I found when
I<00:01:12.930> pulled<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.290> out<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.680> notice<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
I pulled it out I notice there was a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.090 
I pulled it out I notice there was a
bunch<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.909> oil<00:01:15.170> coming<00:01:16.170> down<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.650> well<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
bunch of oil coming down here well that

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.469 
bunch of oil coming down here well that
actually<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.460> coming<00:01:17.880> from<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> coil<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
actually is coming from the coil I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.310 
actually is coming from the coil I
believe<00:01:18.689> must<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.810> crack<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.080> or

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
believe must have a crack in it or

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.950 
believe must have a crack in it or
something<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:22.740> these<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.659> oil<00:01:24.659> filled

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
something because these are oil filled

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.859 
something because these are oil filled
so<00:01:25.700> my<00:01:26.700> wealthy<00:01:27.090> brother's<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so my wealthy brother's gonna have to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.530 
so my wealthy brother's gonna have to
buy<00:01:27.990> another<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.470> these<00:01:28.530> before<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.540> throw

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
buy another one of these before we throw

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.069 
buy another one of these before we throw
it<00:01:30.630> back<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:32.659> that'll<00:01:33.659> probably<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
it back in and that'll probably be a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.130 
it back in and that'll probably be a
while<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.710> he<00:01:34.860> wants<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.750> do<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:36.930> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
while because he wants to do all this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.819 
while because he wants to do all this
clean<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.829> paint<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.280> whatnot<00:01:39.680> he's<00:01:40.680> gonna

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
clean it up paint it whatnot he's gonna

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.210 
clean it up paint it whatnot he's gonna
have<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:42.320> fair<00:01:43.320> bit<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.590> cleaning<00:01:43.799> mostly

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
working I'll die of old age before it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
working I'll die of old age before it
gets<00:01:55.079> done<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.320> I'm<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.399> gonna<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:56.670> ahead

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
gets done so I'm just gonna go ahead

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.539 
gets done so I'm just gonna go ahead
spend<00:01:57.530> spend<00:01:58.530> some<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:58.799> cleaning<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
spend spend some time cleaning it up and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.069 
spend spend some time cleaning it up and
then<00:02:00.200> when<00:02:01.200> he<00:02:01.320> comes<00:02:01.439> over<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.159> maybe

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
then when he comes over we can maybe

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.600 
then when he comes over we can maybe
split<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.350> engine<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.740> transmission<00:02:04.950> or

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
split the engine and transmission or

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.050 
split the engine and transmission or
maybe<00:02:06.149> I'll<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.659> my<00:02:06.780> own<00:02:06.810> too

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
maybe I'll do that on my own too

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.440 
maybe I'll do that on my own too
replace<00:02:09.929> some<00:02:10.110> gaskets<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.679> whatnot<00:02:11.069> but

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
replace some gaskets and whatnot but

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.190 
replace some gaskets and whatnot but
that's<00:02:12.450> where<00:02:12.600> we're<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:12.840> now<00:02:12.870> with<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
that's where we're at now with it

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.500 
that's where we're at now with it
well<00:02:16.200> for<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.560> most<00:02:16.709> part<00:02:16.860> I've<00:02:17.670> got<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> it's

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
well for the most part I've got a it's

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.360 
well for the most part I've got a it's
scraped<00:02:18.750> off<00:02:19.020> pretty<00:02:19.260> well<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.500> got<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.860> really

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
scraped off pretty well I got the really

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.690 
scraped off pretty well I got the really
big<00:02:20.580> chunks<00:02:21.000> off<00:02:21.150> anyway<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.530> see<00:02:22.800> why

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
big chunks off anyway if you can see why

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.270 
big chunks off anyway if you can see why
that<00:02:23.880> file<00:02:24.240> all<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.050> came<00:02:25.590> off<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.950> engine

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that file all that came off the engine

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.820 
that file all that came off the engine
from<00:02:26.520> transmission<00:02:27.410> still<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> little<00:02:28.620> bit<00:02:28.709> of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
from transmission still a little bit of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.820 
from transmission still a little bit of
scraping<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.670> do<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:30.060> mean<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.450> thing's

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
scraping to do I mean this thing's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.280 
scraping to do I mean this thing's
pretty<00:02:31.830> filthy<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.780> I'll<00:02:33.780> keep<00:02:33.900> chipping<00:02:34.110> away

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
pretty filthy so I'll keep chipping away

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.070 
pretty filthy so I'll keep chipping away
at<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:34.980> pretty<00:02:35.550> much<00:02:35.790> ready<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.840> find

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
at it but pretty much ready to find

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.780 
at it but pretty much ready to find
myself<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.680> fresh<00:02:37.890> watch<00:02:38.160> or<00:02:38.400> somewhere<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
myself a fresh watch or somewhere and

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.930 
myself a fresh watch or somewhere and
borrow<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:40.190> see<00:02:41.190> how<00:02:41.310> much<00:02:41.430> I'll<00:02:41.640> take

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
borrow one and see how much I'll take

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.180 
borrow one and see how much I'll take
off<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.510> think<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> meantime<00:02:43.470> we'll<00:02:44.010> just

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
off I think in the meantime we'll just

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.710 
off I think in the meantime we'll just
keep<00:02:45.120> trying<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.540> get<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:45.959> off<00:02:46.080> manually<00:02:47.720> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
keep trying to get it off manually the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.479 
keep trying to get it off manually the
one<00:02:48.900> thing<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.170> did<00:02:49.380> notice<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.130> was<00:02:50.280> cleaning

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
one thing I did notice as I was cleaning

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.509 
one thing I did notice as I was cleaning
this<00:02:50.820> something<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.810> thought<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.170> saw<00:02:52.560> when

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
this something that I thought I saw when

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.210 
this something that I thought I saw when
we<00:02:53.550> first<00:02:53.940> got<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.500> as<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.769> was<00:02:55.860> playing<00:02:56.100> with

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
we first got it as I was playing with

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.630 
we first got it as I was playing with
the<00:02:56.370> starter<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.860> freeze<00:02:59.160> plug<00:02:59.459> right

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
the starter is that freeze plug right

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.809 
the starter is that freeze plug right
there<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.780> leaking

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
there is leaking

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.300 
there is leaking
we've<00:03:02.819> got<00:03:03.030> coolant<00:03:03.360> coming<00:03:03.510> out<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.310> which

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
we've got coolant coming out of it which

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.420 
we've got coolant coming out of it which
I<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:06.209> thought<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.870> saw<00:03:07.260> when<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:07.980> was<00:03:08.160> under<00:03:08.340> here

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
I I thought I saw when I was under here

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.170 
I I thought I saw when I was under here
working<00:03:08.760> on<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
working on it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.750 
working on it
but<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.600> wasn't<00:03:09.810> 100%<00:03:10.350> sure<00:03:10.860> now<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.519> I've<00:03:11.610> got

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
but I wasn't 100% sure now that I've got

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.900 
but I wasn't 100% sure now that I've got
it<00:03:11.790> out<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:13.160> I've<00:03:14.160> got<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> good<00:03:14.519> look<00:03:14.700> at<00:03:14.850> it

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
it out and I've got a good look at it

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.440 
it out and I've got a good look at it
now<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:15.329> know<00:03:15.769> that<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:16.950> leaking<00:03:17.820> for<00:03:18.000> sure<00:03:18.209> so

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
now I know that it's leaking for sure so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.030 
now I know that it's leaking for sure so
it's<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.660> good<00:03:18.750> thing<00:03:18.930> we<00:03:19.019> pulled<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> motor<00:03:19.530> so

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
it's a good thing we pulled the motor so

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.360 
it's a good thing we pulled the motor so
it'll<00:03:20.220> be<00:03:20.280> easy<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:21.260> replace<00:03:22.260> all<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.620> freeze

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
it'll be easy to replace all the freeze

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.140 
it'll be easy to replace all the freeze
plugs<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.370> yeah<00:03:26.579> I'll<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:26.760> keep<00:03:27.030> chipping

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
plugs so yeah I'll just keep chipping

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.569 
plugs so yeah I'll just keep chipping
away<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:28.130> hopefully<00:03:29.130> we'll<00:03:29.250> be<00:03:29.280> able<00:03:29.400> to

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
away and hopefully we'll be able to

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.150 
away and hopefully we'll be able to
clean<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.480> up<00:03:30.600> real<00:03:30.900> nice<00:03:31.140> especially<00:03:31.950> if<00:03:32.100> we

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
clean it up real nice especially if we

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.600 
clean it up real nice especially if we
get<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.340> fresher<00:03:32.970> water

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.460 

well<00:03:36.610> I've<00:03:36.820> gone<00:03:37.330> ahead<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.630> I've<00:03:37.870> scraped

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
well I've gone ahead and I've scraped

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.890 
well I've gone ahead and I've scraped
off<00:03:38.710> all<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.070> heavy<00:03:39.940> stuff<00:03:40.240> or<00:03:40.450> at<00:03:40.510> least<00:03:40.630> most

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
off all the heavy stuff or at least most

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.530 
off all the heavy stuff or at least most
of<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.170> then<00:03:41.380> I<00:03:42.000> went<00:03:43.000> ahead<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.210> I<00:03:43.330> grabbed

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
of it then I went ahead and I grabbed

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.870 
of it then I went ahead and I grabbed
some<00:03:43.780> diesel<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.890> basically<00:03:45.070> put<00:03:45.760> it

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
some diesel and I basically put it

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.240 
some diesel and I basically put it
everywhere<00:03:46.300> because<00:03:46.750> there's<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:48.160> know

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
everywhere because there's you know

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.730 
everywhere because there's you know
still<00:03:48.520> a<00:03:48.550> lot<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.700> little<00:03:48.970> chunks<00:03:49.600> left<00:03:50.350> on<00:03:50.560> it

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
still a lot of little chunks left on it

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.920 
still a lot of little chunks left on it
you<00:03:50.980> know<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.430> put<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.240> diesel<00:03:52.630> on<00:03:52.690> there

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
you know I put the diesel on there

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.530 
you know I put the diesel on there
hoping<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:54.370> know<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.610> would<00:03:54.760> loosen<00:03:55.240> it

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
hoping that you know it would loosen it

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.090 
hoping that you know it would loosen it
up<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.560> when<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.710> hit<00:03:56.830> it<00:03:56.890> with<00:03:57.010> the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
up so that when I hit it with the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.230 
up so that when I hit it with the
pressure<00:03:57.340> washer<00:03:57.580> it'll<00:03:58.150> come<00:03:58.330> off<00:04:00.240> I'll

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
pressure washer it'll come off I'll

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.960 
pressure washer it'll come off I'll
probably<00:04:02.040> not<00:04:03.040> have<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.280> pressure<00:04:03.550> washer<00:04:03.730> for

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
probably not have a pressure washer for

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.180 
probably not have a pressure washer for
a<00:04:04.150> while<00:04:04.330> so<00:04:04.630> I'll<00:04:04.750> come<00:04:04.960> back<00:04:05.110> every<00:04:05.410> day<00:04:05.980> or

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
a while so I'll come back every day or

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.730 
a while so I'll come back every day or
so<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.610> soak<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:07.780> down<00:04:07.930> again<00:04:08.260> really<00:04:08.470> get<00:04:08.650> it

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
so and soak it down again really get it

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.510 
so and soak it down again really get it
in<00:04:08.860> there<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:10.080> then<00:04:11.080> hopefully<00:04:11.520> that

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
in there and then hopefully that

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.860 
in there and then hopefully that
pressure<00:04:12.790> washer<00:04:13.210> I'll<00:04:13.300> just<00:04:13.480> take<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.690> right

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
pressure washer I'll just take it right

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.080 
pressure washer I'll just take it right
off<00:04:14.050> after<00:04:14.410> it's<00:04:14.500> soaked<00:04:14.710> in<00:04:14.950> you<00:04:15.850> know<00:04:15.910> this

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
off after it's soaked in you know this

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.570 
off after it's soaked in you know this
oil<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:17.350> grease<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.739> dirt<00:04:17.890> has<00:04:18.160> been<00:04:18.370> sitting

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
oil and grease and dirt has been sitting

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.090 
oil and grease and dirt has been sitting
on<00:04:18.730> this<00:04:18.910> engine<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.390> transmission<00:04:19.750> for<00:04:20.230> 50

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
on this engine and transmission for 50

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.820 
on this engine and transmission for 50
years<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.489> its<00:04:21.760> really<00:04:22.050> it's<00:04:23.050> really<00:04:23.440> stuck

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
years and its really it's really stuck

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.310 
years and its really it's really stuck
on<00:04:24.010> there<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.850> don't<00:04:25.330> think<00:04:25.840> it'll<00:04:26.080> come<00:04:26.260> off

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
on there so I don't think it'll come off

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.550 
on there so I don't think it'll come off
very<00:04:26.710> easy<00:04:26.950> if<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.280> just<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:28.030> just<00:04:28.630> sprayed<00:04:29.200> it<00:04:29.350> I

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
very easy if I just I just sprayed it I

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.730 
very easy if I just I just sprayed it I
mean<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:30.270> have<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.330> hard<00:04:31.480> time<00:04:31.570> scraping<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.590> off

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
mean I have a hard time scraping it off

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.400 
mean I have a hard time scraping it off
so<00:04:33.270> I'm<00:04:34.270> hoping<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:34.750> if<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.960> soaked<00:04:35.230> it<00:04:35.350> in

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
so I'm hoping that if I soaked it in

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.970 
so I'm hoping that if I soaked it in
diesel<00:04:36.210> that'll<00:04:37.210> loosen<00:04:37.390> it<00:04:37.660> all<00:04:37.810> up<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:38.530> I

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
diesel that'll loosen it all up but I

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.590 
diesel that'll loosen it all up but I
went<00:04:39.580> ahead<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:39.850> work<00:04:40.030> on<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.300> valve<00:04:40.480> cover

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
went ahead and I work on the valve cover

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.080 
went ahead and I work on the valve cover
a<00:04:40.840> little<00:04:40.930> bit<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.550> don't<00:04:42.550> know<00:04:42.640> well<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.850> can

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
a little bit I don't know well you can

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.220 
a little bit I don't know well you can
see<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.420> but<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.630> can<00:04:43.780> actually<00:04:43.930> read

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
see that but I can actually read

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.520 
see that but I can actually read
Cadillac<00:04:44.740> again<00:04:45.070> on<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.400> so<00:04:46.110> it's<00:04:47.110> coming<00:04:47.470> I

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
Cadillac again on it so it's coming I

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.260 
Cadillac again on it so it's coming I
couldn't<00:04:47.800> see<00:04:47.920> that<00:04:48.070> before<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.730> was<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:49.000> caked

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
couldn't see that before it was so caked

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.660 
couldn't see that before it was so caked
with<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.480> crap<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.770> that<00:04:50.830> was<00:04:51.010> on<00:04:51.130> top<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.490> the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
with the crap and that was on top of the

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.120 
with the crap and that was on top of the
engine<00:04:52.140> so<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.260> bottom<00:04:53.560> was<00:04:53.680> really<00:04:53.950> nasty

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
engine so the bottom was really nasty

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.040 
engine so the bottom was really nasty
but<00:04:56.640> hopefully<00:04:57.640> I<00:04:58.000> don't<00:04:58.660> know<00:04:58.720> when<00:04:58.930> I'm

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
but hopefully I don't know when I'm

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.900 
but hopefully I don't know when I'm
gonna<00:04:59.200> get<00:04:59.410> around<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.160> finding<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.610> parts

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
gonna get around to finding a parts

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.480 
gonna get around to finding a parts
washer<00:05:01.090> but<00:05:01.450> hopefully<00:05:01.810> I'll<00:05:01.900> be<00:05:01.930> able<00:05:02.110> to

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
washer but hopefully I'll be able to

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.770 
washer but hopefully I'll be able to
find<00:05:03.490> one<00:05:03.700> fairly<00:05:04.090> soon

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
find one fairly soon

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.630 
find one fairly soon
I'll<00:05:05.230> let<00:05:05.440> this<00:05:05.590> diesel<00:05:05.830> soak<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.490> then

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
I'll let this diesel soak and then

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.420 
I'll let this diesel soak and then
though<00:05:07.050> should<00:05:08.050> be<00:05:08.140> all<00:05:08.320> clean<00:05:08.620> ready<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.310> come

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
though should be all clean ready to come

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.800 
though should be all clean ready to come
apart<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:10.030> replace<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.990> gaskets<00:05:11.770> and

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
apart and replace the gaskets and

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.480 
apart and replace the gaskets and
whatever<00:05:13.810> else<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.200> find<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.860> coils<00:05:15.280> got<00:05:15.460> a

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
whatever else I find that coils got a

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.820 
whatever else I find that coils got a
goal<00:05:15.730> freeze<00:05:16.000> bugs<00:05:16.270> got<00:05:16.480> to<00:05:16.510> go<00:05:16.800> take<00:05:17.800> the

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
goal freeze bugs got to go take the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.710 
goal freeze bugs got to go take the
transmission<00:05:18.250> I'll<00:05:18.550> fix<00:05:18.850> that<00:05:19.060> leak<00:05:19.300> clean<00:05:19.600> it

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
transmission I'll fix that leak clean it

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.270 
transmission I'll fix that leak clean it
up<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:20.280> then<00:05:21.280> start<00:05:22.060> painting<00:05:22.330> stuff<00:05:23.250> still<00:05:24.250> a

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
up and then start painting stuff still a

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.660 
up and then start painting stuff still a
ways<00:05:24.490> out<00:05:24.700> but<00:05:25.000> it's<00:05:25.360> coming

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
ways out but it's coming

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.550 
ways out but it's coming
I've<00:05:27.670> been<00:05:27.850> waiting<00:05:28.150> quite<00:05:28.600> a<00:05:29.110> while<00:05:29.200> to

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
I've been waiting quite a while to

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.260 
I've been waiting quite a while to
finish<00:05:29.680> this<00:05:29.890> video<00:05:30.190> up<00:05:30.310> but<00:05:30.550> I<00:05:30.580> finally<00:05:31.000> got<00:05:31.150> a

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
finish this video up but I finally got a

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.710 
finish this video up but I finally got a
hold<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.650> pressure<00:05:32.650> washer<00:05:33.190> here<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.580> I

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
hold of a pressure washer here and I

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.010 
hold of a pressure washer here and I
went<00:05:34.720> ahead<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:34.900> sprayed<00:05:35.140> down<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.560> engine

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
went ahead and sprayed down the engine

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.810 
went ahead and sprayed down the engine
it<00:05:38.020> got<00:05:38.230> quite<00:05:38.800> a<00:05:38.830> bit<00:05:39.070> of<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:39.280> off<00:05:39.430> but<00:05:39.730> of

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
it got quite a bit of it off but of

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.420 
it got quite a bit of it off but of
course<00:05:40.440> you<00:05:41.440> know<00:05:41.530> some<00:05:41.800> of<00:05:41.890> this<00:05:41.980> stuff<00:05:42.250> is

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
course you know some of this stuff is

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.969 
course you know some of this stuff is
just<00:05:42.460> so<00:05:42.850> caked<00:05:43.270> on<00:05:43.540> that<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:44.740> pressure

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
just so caked on that the pressure

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.490 
just so caked on that the pressure
washer<00:05:45.280> won't

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.090 

it's<00:05:49.500> just<00:05:49.770> on<00:05:50.190> there<00:05:50.490> like<00:05:51.270> glue<00:05:51.920> so<00:05:52.920> I<00:05:52.950> think

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
it's just on there like glue so I think

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.440 
it's just on there like glue so I think
I<00:05:54.680> think<00:05:55.680> you<00:05:56.310> know<00:05:56.400> anything<00:05:56.760> that's<00:05:56.880> left<00:05:57.210> on

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
I think you know anything that's left on

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.740 
I think you know anything that's left on
it<00:05:57.600> is<00:05:57.720> going<00:05:57.900> to<00:05:57.960> have<00:05:58.140> to<00:05:58.230> get<00:05:58.380> scraped<00:05:59.750> gone

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
it is going to have to get scraped gone

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.820 
it is going to have to get scraped gone
over<00:06:01.020> it<00:06:01.110> pretty<00:06:01.320> good<00:06:02.060> all<00:06:03.060> over<00:06:03.120> but<00:06:03.830> it's
