the drone of Z was destroyed and I was
left<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.299> see<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.409> see<00:01:55.740> well

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
left with this see they can see well

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.160 
left with this see they can see well
could<00:01:56.729> make<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.180> earth<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.659> sunflower

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
or supposed to be sunflower and because

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.069 
or supposed to be sunflower and because
you<00:02:01.320> can't<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.299> actual<00:02:03.299> character<00:02:03.930> and

you can't see the actual character and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.550 
you can't see the actual character and
zombie<00:02:04.590> over<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.200> can<00:02:07.469> only

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
zombie over there and so I can only

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.109 
zombie over there and so I can only
really<00:02:07.860> say

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
really say

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.320 
really say
is<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:10.349> careful<00:02:11.069> when<00:02:11.989> using<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.409> drone<00:02:14.330> when

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330
