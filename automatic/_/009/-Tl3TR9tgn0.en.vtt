seeing from Microsoft where we've let

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.050 
seeing from Microsoft where we've let
these<00:01:54.680> dumb<00:01:54.950> people<00:01:55.189> hold<00:01:55.520> these<00:01:55.640> positions

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
these dumb people hold these positions

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.060 
these dumb people hold these positions
of<00:01:56.210> power<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:56.719> have<00:01:57.140> these<00:01:57.259> stupid<00:01:57.680> opinions

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
of power and have these stupid opinions

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.679 
of power and have these stupid opinions
that<00:01:58.159> have<00:01:58.219> gotten<00:01:58.460> Microsoft<00:01:59.060> into<00:01:59.270> like<00:01:59.509> hot

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
water with gamers and with the public in

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.340 
water with gamers and with the public in

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
features in Windows 8.1 or maybe

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.690

there'll<00:02:06.500> be<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.679> Windows<00:02:07.009> 8<00:02:07.159> point<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.549> that

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
there'll be a Windows 8 point to that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.400 
there'll be a Windows 8 point to that
