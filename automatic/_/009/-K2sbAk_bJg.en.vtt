00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.309
 hello gamer today we get 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.950
 found for a little special video 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.080
 since this is a tip for xp 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.880
 quickly as scouts this 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.650
 class that still asks a little bit of 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.470
 what it is good here I give you the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.490
 tips for getting on in this 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.340
 easily class 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.140
 first of all I go on a map 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.760
 match men to death like this these 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.820
 parallel storms and I'm going 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.230
 then explain the different 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.610
 the different accessories that I have 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.140
 need 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.790
 first of all you have to know that this 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.040
 tutorial is based on the fact that 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.989
 scout scout little that is to say he 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.600
 can identify the enemies for that 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.519
 you will need several 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.589
 accessories like for example the microphone 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.680
 golden rhone that you see here but 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.900
 also will take the drone the mini 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.400
 drones so that fly and that allows 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.440
 also scouts so to identify the 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.330
 enemies you'll see it's pretty proud 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.369
 to that can generate a lot of weight 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.700
 over a short period of time you are 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.680
 necessarily without destroying your ratio 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.299
 the first thing to do is to 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.930
 take out your drones from you 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.850
 somewhere you take him out with 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.220
 bos that makes you right click and you in 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.720
 take control then as you 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.540
 certainly know you can spot 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.220
 enemies through the key to and via 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.230
 this touch to you to you to spa but in 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.930
 targeting enemy spawn or zones 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.220
 enemies like here it's a map of 64 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.190
 players and that's pretty tight was 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.840
 well I can easily get referred 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.940
 the fact is that to succeed in having 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.930
 weight you have to go 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.460
 succeed in killing the enemies you 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.470
 have spotted but you will see that 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.100
 it's still pretty easy 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.290
 despite lag assets and as a result you 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.509
 can generate a lot of weight there 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.570
 This is naturally a technique that 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.440
 is not lived a year that will us 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.330
 but that allow heresy times this 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.530
 then we have the right this one 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.180
 based on the same principle since 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.340
 when you launched it I take you 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.920
 control of this old ethics drone 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.320
 camera and spamming the at what it takes 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.940
 naturally cabinet because it takes 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.190
 control the pending flight for 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.290
 identify potential enemies 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.760
 now it's up to you but 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.870
 as you see there is a small part 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.269
 of battery what you do not allow to 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.430
 the pay of the mini drones to stay in flight 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.720
 for a very long time it applies 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.120
 also the fact that you can 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.799
 unblocking ribbons and by 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.959
 following the medal tracking that we 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.070
 will also give xp what can 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.070
 prove very practical 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.800
 another option is to come back from the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.870
 beacon radio france as well as the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.370
 bezel mlpc two accessories you 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.230
 will initially allow thanks 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.930
 at the beacon to reappear your 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.540
 ally of your squad nearby and 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.150
 mlp will allow him to identify jealous 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.130
 because you will see it's the same glasses 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.800
 that on stage with stress you have 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.030
 always beautiful and the enemies angers and 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.380
 caen subscribe you want everything from 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.459
 next put your tag otherwise you 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.220
 can also expectations for the 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.530
 position in a situation 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.060
 strategic in a well hidden place 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.130
 necessarily because you were not going 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.080
 will definitely not be happy to 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.640
 come back and respawn and next to 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.290
 enemy 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.319
 as for the bezel and well it takes 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.489
 first select it and then a 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.940
 hacker saw will go straight 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.560
 see despite the taste of lag look 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.610
 like these will be able to try by 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.970
 the enemies who think that you 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.799
 just press a for others 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.930
 pillars of the markers above the 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.549
 head like these is 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.480
 shoot it unfortunately if he goes out 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:45.489
 more admirable finally another 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.530
 opportunity is to bring you all 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.359
 allows the identification of enemies this is at 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.700
 say the das and the motion sensor 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.650
 knowing das must ask the your 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.060
 only they remain fixed to the lodging 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.340
 a small ball of sensors of 10 dead 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.719
 in haiti york like these is then 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.459
 will no longer allow to target an area 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.319
 says members of this even launched 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.840
 in the economic and if you go 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.540
 gets to kill an enemy in the 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.760
 perimeter of your motion sensor 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.099
 and although this will give you the xp 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.569
 also naturally it's more 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.069
 limited than the other accessories 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.859
 since here you will have him 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.389
 possibility of you and the das to 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.539
 proximity to me to get you into the 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.539
 battle 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.690
 another tip lies in the fact 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.660
 to use the mlp bezel in mode 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.699
 conquest large shop door and 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.139
 target the vehicles so like this to 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.229
 whenever you will succeed at 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.389
 spinning laser with them that will generate 25 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.280
 once we can do it several times 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.039
 in a row mekhissi generous game 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.930
 lower abdomen cassar etc and then that 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.090
 will have more of what mostly 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.349
 if the vehicle is destroyed by an ally 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.509
 it generates 100 more points 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:57.130
 however there is a limit to the number of 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.130
 points that you can it's sorting 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.159
 I hope this video will have you 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.749
 more and you will eventually help me 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.009
 see you soon on my channel and 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.550
 Do not hesitate to subscribe 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.550
