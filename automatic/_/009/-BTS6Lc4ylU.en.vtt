00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
now this kind of reminds me of what

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.490 
now this kind of reminds me of what
they're<00:01:39.450> saying<00:01:39.660> about<00:01:39.720> Arnold's<00:01:40.350> new

they're saying about Arnold's new
character<00:01:40.920> now<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.490> sake<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
character now just for the sake of

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.310 
character now just for the sake of
argument<00:01:42.090> let's<00:01:42.420> pretend<00:01:42.690> that<00:01:42.750> Arnold<00:01:43.200> is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
argument let's pretend that Arnold is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.690 
argument let's pretend that Arnold is
actually<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.980> be<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.190> this<00:01:44.250> movie<00:01:44.400> as<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
actually going to be in this movie as a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.580 
actually going to be in this movie as a
humanized<00:01:45.210> villainous<00:01:45.630> bad<00:01:45.870> guy<00:01:46.080> general

humanized villainous bad guy general
okay<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.070> here's<00:01:47.340> my<00:01:47.400> theory<00:01:47.910> here's<00:01:48.330> where<00:01:48.540> I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
okay but here's my theory here's where I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.430 
okay but here's my theory here's where I
think<00:01:48.600> they're<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.080> to<00:01:49.140> go<00:01:49.230> with<00:01:49.320> this

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
think they're going to go with this

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.620 
think they're going to go with this
story<00:01:49.740> now<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.400> speculation<00:01:50.910> for<00:01:51.480> my

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
story now this is all speculation for my

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660 
story now this is all speculation for my
brain<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.260> here<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.560> goes<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.010> you<00:01:53.190> let's<00:01:53.550> say

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
brain but here it goes to you let's say

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.160 
brain but here it goes to you let's say
all<00:01:53.820> those<00:01:54.030> things<00:01:54.300> are<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
all those things are actually going to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.900 
all those things are actually going to
happen<00:01:55.350> Arnold<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:56.220> Steven<00:01:56.730> Lang's

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
happen Arnold and Steven Lang's

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.610 
happen Arnold and Steven Lang's
character<00:01:57.300> might<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.720> friends<00:01:58.260> or<00:01:58.380> brothers

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
character might be friends or brothers

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.220 
character might be friends or brothers
or<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.340> way<00:01:59.910> closely<00:02:00.570> connected<00:02:00.870> and

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
or some way closely connected and

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.750 
or some way closely connected and
Arnold's<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.160> what<00:02:02.340> we're<00:02:02.550> going

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
Arnold's like you know what we're going

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.670 
Arnold's like you know what we're going
back<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:03.030> Pandora<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.630> kick<00:02:03.870> those<00:02:04.110> tall<00:02:04.409> blue

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
back to Pandora to kick those tall blue

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.620 
back to Pandora to kick those tall blue
alien<00:02:05.100> asses<00:02:05.670> okay<00:02:05.970> so<00:02:06.030> that's<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.450> direction

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
alien asses okay so that's the direction

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.149 
alien asses okay so that's the direction
I'd<00:02:06.900> like<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.320> his<00:02:07.409> character<00:02:07.620> go<00:02:07.950> which

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
I'd like to see his character go which

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.249 
I'd like to see his character go which
is<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.429> think<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.970> obvious<00:02:09.149> thing<00:02:09.690> okay<00:02:10.019> but

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
is I think the obvious thing okay but

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.780 
is I think the obvious thing okay but
here's<00:02:10.440> where<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.679> gets<00:02:10.830> crazy<00:02:10.890> here's<00:02:11.610> where

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
here's where it gets crazy here's where

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.670 
here's where it gets crazy here's where
I<00:02:11.849> want<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.450> go<00:02:12.599> Arnold<00:02:13.110> wants<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.500> fight

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I want it to go Arnold wants to fight

he<00:02:14.909> knows<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.269> he<00:02:15.450> can't<00:02:15.659> go<00:02:15.810> one-on-one<00:02:16.349> in

his humanized body against these avatars

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.660 
his humanized body against these avatars
and<00:02:19.409> we<00:02:19.560> already<00:02:19.769> did<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.040> robot<00:02:20.190> thing<00:02:20.580> in
