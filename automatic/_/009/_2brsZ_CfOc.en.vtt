00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.300
 still running in Japan 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.429
 so the tools will have it there we must 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 among others the king of brambles the eye of 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.850
 wolf or born cotten 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.980
 personally I discovered it with 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.450
 bee mentions so I'm going 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.309
 speak for those who saw it in my 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.629
 video of chichis from ki oon 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.489
 you said it was a 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.300
 pure killing definitely needed that I 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.770
 you talk about it 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.570
 so for the little story I do not 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.129
 absolutely did not want to start this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.570
 manga despite having very good 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.800
 Notes 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.629
 it's just that I read an excerpt in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.260
 bookstore and it frankly 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.710
 convinced to get me the manga so 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.629
 I speak to you very quickly about the history 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.899
 the story takes place in 2072 where 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.070
 school kinds of small coils 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.140
 electromagnetic have replaced everything 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.080
 who is by trip he and these are 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 inexhaustible sources of energy and so 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.700
 who in mas is actually a recuperator 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.220
 So a kind of bounty hunters 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.619
 who is responsible for retrieving the codes 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.479
 illegal ones that have been used have 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.580
 used by traffickers or 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.490
 mafia and who are diverted from their 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.610
 initial use and which they use 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.770
 like souls and so during one of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 his recovery missions he's going 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.299
 meet the miracle embarrassment that is 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.549
 trapped in khoy traffickers so 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.009
 it's absolutely not meant to 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.930
 help him but that's their destiny or be 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.640
 more or less related thereafter and she 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.549
 will join him to recover 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.740
 illegal passes short story is about 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.600
 not much was not great 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.850
 original but it has the merit of being 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.630
 extremely involved right from the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.159
 first pages 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.729
 here I think it's super important 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.100
 that a first tons is really you 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.600
 get caught up in the story begins 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.170
 want to devour the following and that's 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.009
 totally the case with this volume 1 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.899
 the author tells us about a lot of 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.670
 characters then of course puts in 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.950
 before the two main characters 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.500
 which I just spoke to you knowing that 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.209
 mast keel has the distinction of being 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.680
 passionate about everything old 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.530
 technologies here it totally rejects 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.480
 elected school use still use a 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.280
 gas car is an old 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.340
 cell phone which he makes a small 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.200
 little has been compared to others and the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.580
 character of mira that is presented to 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.280
 all start as a girl a 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.940
 little bit fragile naive etc but who 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.739
 proves extremely formidable 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.019
 in addition to this a pact a panel 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.690
 other characters that are part of 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.519
 the organization of keel on the mast and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.459
 some bad guys are also 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.319
 presented but brief here it is really 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.970
 very endearing characters 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.470
 the story is really very fascinating 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.180
 repeat me a little bit but it's 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.519
 really the effect that this manga has made me 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.049
 so you quickly show the cover 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.970
 you can see from elsewhere the new 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.940
 logo havas who as you showed 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.620
 for animal kingdom have a very beautiful 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.660
 cover a very very beautiful edition 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.040
 tour of who are there so you watch 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.980
 very early you have color pages 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 you can also sounded place of 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.799
 the work tour of a very good bill 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.250
 and so here I show a little to my 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.320
 drawings are exposed anything 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.049
 so here's how you can see this 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.640
 are very sober designs that are 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.549
 very beautiful but that's it 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.130
 now in the simple sense the pages 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.150
 are not overloaded 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.430
 they are sometimes a little white 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.019
 but it's my very refined style that 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.130
 I like a lot and who gets married very 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.959
 very well to history 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.010
 so here is a work that I will 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.090
 advise for those who still have 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.579
 not started yet 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.140
 so ends this manga discovery 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.859
 I hope you liked it and I 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.859
 say after quickly
