link so you can check that one out and
the<00:02:51.000> last<00:02:51.210> thing<00:02:51.330> we<00:02:51.480> had<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.600> do<00:02:51.780> was<00:02:51.959> pick<00:02:52.170> up

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
the last thing we had to do was pick up

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.960 
the last thing we had to do was pick up
a<00:02:52.380> manager<00:02:52.770> because<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.070> think<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.520> few<00:02:53.700> players

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
a manager because I think a few players

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.820 
a manager because I think a few players
were<00:02:54.270> low<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.780> chemistry<00:02:55.200> i<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.500> her<00:02:55.590> nana

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
were low in chemistry i think her nana

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.890 
were low in chemistry i think her nana
san<00:02:56.100> fernando<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.120> i<00:02:57.150> decided<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.570> pick<00:02:57.720> up<00:02:57.840> a

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
san fernando so i decided to pick up a

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.690 
san fernando so i decided to pick up a
brazilian<00:02:58.410> manager<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.040> tee<00:02:59.100> at<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.400> dutch

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
brazilian manager and a tee at the dutch

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.850 
brazilian manager and a tee at the dutch
league<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.690> pie<00:03:00.870> would<00:03:00.930> also<00:03:01.230> be<00:03:01.470> on<00:03:01.620> full

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
league so the pie would also be on full

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.500 
league so the pie would also be on full
chemistry<00:03:02.400> because<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.940> didn't<00:03:03.330> have<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
chemistry because I didn't have the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.390 
chemistry because I didn't have the
coins<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.900> pilots<00:03:04.230> position<00:03:04.620> modifiers<00:03:05.040> but

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
coins to pilots position modifiers but

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.520 
coins to pilots position modifiers but
anyway<00:03:05.820> we<00:03:06.330> are<00:03:06.360> we<00:03:06.630> move<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:06.990> into<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.290> first

sure<00:04:47.949> what<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.460> do<00:04:48.580> because<00:04:48.789> as<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.090> can<00:04:49.210> see<00:04:49.419> i

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
sure what to do because as you can see i

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.179

amazing and you will see it from her
from<00:07:00.130> the<00:07:00.250> stats<00:07:00.520> as<00:07:00.670> well<00:07:00.850> we<00:07:01.330> only<00:07:01.570> had<00:07:01.810> two

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
from the stats as well we only had two

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.960 
from the stats as well we only had two
shots<00:07:02.350> on<00:07:02.500> target<00:07:02.530> which<00:07:03.250> were<00:07:03.430> the<00:07:03.550> shots<00:07:03.730> we

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
shots on target which were the shots we

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.430 
shots on target which were the shots we
actually<00:07:04.330> put<00:07:04.540> it<00:07:04.630> into<00:07:04.810> the<00:07:04.840> back<00:07:05.080> of<00:07:05.110> the<00:07:05.320> net

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
actually put it into the back of the net

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.590 
actually put it into the back of the net
and<00:07:05.590> my<00:07:05.680> opponents<00:07:06.220> I<00:07:06.340> think<00:07:06.850> it<00:07:07.000> like<00:07:07.180> 60

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
and my opponents I think it like 60

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.030 
and my opponents I think it like 60
shots<00:07:07.870> or<00:07:08.080> something<00:07:08.110> that<00:07:08.620> you<00:07:08.770> can<00:07:08.890> actually

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
shots or something that you can actually

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.860 
shots or something that you can actually
see<00:07:09.220> it<00:07:09.430> yourselves<00:07:09.820> right<00:07:10.000> there<00:07:10.210> we<00:07:10.720> had<00:07:10.840> a

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
see it yourselves right there we had a

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.390 
see it yourselves right there we had a
little<00:07:11.110> bit<00:07:11.200> more<00:07:11.350> possession<00:07:11.890> although<00:07:12.220> we

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
little bit more possession although we

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.220 
little bit more possession although we
have<00:07:12.490> more<00:07:12.610> position<00:07:13.030> i<00:07:13.120> think<00:07:13.360> a<00:07:13.570> draw<00:07:14.080> would

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.230 
have more position i think a draw would

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.690 
have more position i think a draw would
have<00:07:14.350> important<00:07:14.860> serve<00:07:15.010> but<00:07:15.160> luckily<00:07:15.370> enough

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
have important serve but luckily enough

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.660 
have important serve but luckily enough
we<00:07:15.760> got<00:07:16.330> the<00:07:16.450> three<00:07:16.660> points<00:07:16.690> and<00:07:17.370> yeah<00:07:18.370> we<00:07:18.490> move

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.670 
we got the three points and yeah we move

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.100 
we got the three points and yeah we move
on<00:07:18.790> to<00:07:18.880> the<00:07:18.970> player<00:07:19.180> ratings<00:07:19.570> i<00:07:19.660> think<00:07:19.900> you<00:07:19.990> can
