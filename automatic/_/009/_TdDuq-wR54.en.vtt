00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.670 
people then they truly didn't get the
story<00:02:47.860> that's<00:02:48.459> my<00:02:48.880> opinion<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:50.380> that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
story that's my opinion I think that

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.479 
story that's my opinion I think that
that<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:52.380> really<00:02:53.380> shallow<00:02:53.739> way<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.220> seeing

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
that is really shallow way of seeing

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.680 
that is really shallow way of seeing
this<00:02:54.760> book<00:02:54.970> because<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.360> book<00:02:55.420> has<00:02:57.660> such<00:02:58.660> a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
this book because this book has such a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.479 
this book because this book has such a
powerful<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.560> deeper<00:02:59.830> meaning<00:03:00.130> than<00:03:00.280> that

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
powerful and deeper meaning than that

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.020 
powerful and deeper meaning than that
and<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:02.100> actually<00:03:03.100> feel<00:03:03.400> kind<00:03:03.580> of<00:03:03.700> sorry<00:03:03.850> for

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
and I actually feel kind of sorry for

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.600 
and I actually feel kind of sorry for
those<00:03:04.270> who<00:03:04.480> don't<00:03:04.660> see<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.140> because<00:03:05.580> this
