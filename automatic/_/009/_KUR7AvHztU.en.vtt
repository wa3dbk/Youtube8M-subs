I<00:00:33.149> mean<00:00:33.690> right<00:00:34.200> now<00:00:34.260> he's<00:00:34.860> at<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.250> 600<00:00:35.760> I'd

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
I mean right now he's at about 600 I'd

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.569 
I mean right now he's at about 600 I'd
say<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.350> something<00:00:37.739> somewhere<00:00:38.460> around

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
say I think something somewhere around

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.630 
say I think something somewhere around
that<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.000> asked<00:00:39.360> him<00:00:39.420> earlier<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:40.160> right<00:00:41.160> here

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
that I asked him earlier but right here

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.510 
that I asked him earlier but right here
we<00:00:42.030> noticed<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.800> nothing<00:00:43.800> pops<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.370> on

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
we noticed that nothing pops up on

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.779 
we noticed that nothing pops up on
Gladius<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.450> then<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.890> realized<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> there

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
Gladius and then we realized that there

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.729 
Gladius and then we realized that there
is<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.210> shadow<00:00:48.600> priest<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.420> mage<00:00:51.739> so

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
is a shadow priest and a a mage so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.770 
is a shadow priest and a a mage so
immediately<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.309> pop<00:00:53.670> onto<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> shadow<00:00:54.360> priest

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
immediately I pop onto the shadow priest

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.240 
immediately I pop onto the shadow priest
because<00:00:55.110> i<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.399> hate<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.539> shadow<00:00:57.870> priests

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
because i have a hate for shadow priests

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.040 
because i have a hate for shadow priests
it's<00:00:59.250> nothing<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.640> personal<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.570> guess<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
it's nothing really personal I guess I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.299 
it's nothing really personal I guess I
just<00:01:01.079> don't<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.559> shadow<00:01:01.829> priests<00:01:02.129> because

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
just don't like shadow priests because

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.570 
just don't like shadow priests because
they<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.149> survive<00:01:03.739> quite<00:01:04.739> well<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
they can really survive quite well and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.840 
they can really survive quite well and
they<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.540> lot<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.810> damage<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> figured<00:01:08.430> I'd

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
they do a lot of damage so I figured I'd

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670 
they do a lot of damage so I figured I'd
shattering<00:01:09.689> throw<00:01:09.960> there<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.560> got

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
shattering throw there but it got

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.820 
shattering throw there but it got
interrupted<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> kind<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.880> kicked<00:01:12.060> me<00:01:12.299> off

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
interrupted so I kind of kicked me off

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.740 
interrupted so I kind of kicked me off
but<00:01:13.830> yeah<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> guess<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> tick<00:01:15.119> off<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.540> kind

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
but yeah I guess the tick off was kind

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.390 
but yeah I guess the tick off was kind
of<00:01:15.780> good<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.530> start<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.920> blow<00:01:17.130> him<00:01:17.310> up

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
of good because I start to blow him up

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.960 
of good because I start to blow him up
here<00:01:17.700> pretty<00:01:17.880> fast<00:01:19.130> I'm<00:01:20.130> getting<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.549> lot<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
here pretty fast I'm getting a lot of

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.240 
here pretty fast I'm getting a lot of
cloths<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.659> Smashbox<00:01:21.930> which<00:01:22.619> obviously<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
cloths of Smashbox which obviously I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.170 
cloths of Smashbox which obviously I
love<00:01:23.670> he<00:01:24.390> doesn't<00:01:24.720> love<00:01:24.840> cloth<00:01:25.170> smash<00:01:25.560> Bronx

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
love he doesn't love cloth smash Bronx

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.580 
love he doesn't love cloth smash Bronx
and<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.390> starting<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.200> bit<00:01:28.380> more

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and I'm starting to do a little bit more

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.969 
and I'm starting to do a little bit more
damage<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.170> I<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.619> he's<00:01:31.829> almost

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
damage here and I see that he's almost

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
damage here and I see that he's almost
dead<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.030> try<00:01:33.240> hard<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.780> him

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
dead so I really try hard to get him

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.390 
dead so I really try hard to get him
down<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:35.119> he's<00:01:36.119> absorbing<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> fail

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
down and he's absorbing that was a fail

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.200 
down and he's absorbing that was a fail
broke<00:01:38.850> leap<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:39.930> opinion<00:01:41.210> started

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
broke leap in my opinion started

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.300 
broke leap in my opinion started
executing<00:01:42.479> well<00:01:43.170> attempting<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.920> text<00:01:44.159> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
executing well attempting to text you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149 
executing well attempting to text you
and<00:01:44.570> then<00:01:45.570> he<00:01:45.899> gains<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.500> half<00:01:46.710> his<00:01:46.920> health

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and then he gains about half his health

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.480 
and then he gains about half his health
back<00:01:48.020> which<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.290> also<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.070> ticks<00:01:50.310> me

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
back which really also kind of ticks me

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.730 
back which really also kind of ticks me
off<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.880> I'm<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.259> think<00:01:52.619> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
off so I'm going and then I think I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.030 
off so I'm going and then I think I
finally<00:01:53.130> drop<00:01:53.610> them<00:01:53.820> right<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> it's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
finally drop them right here so it's

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.330 
finally drop them right here so it's
fairly<00:01:56.280> good<00:01:56.520> job<00:01:56.549> amanha<00:01:57.180> marstons<00:01:57.719> part<00:01:58.340> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
fairly good job amanha marstons part and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.389 
fairly good job amanha marstons part and
then<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.090> kind<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.360> hop<00:02:00.570> onto<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.399> frost

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
then we just kind of hop onto the frost

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.069 
then we just kind of hop onto the frost
mage<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.969> screw<00:02:03.329> around<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.689> little<00:02:03.840> bit<00:02:03.990> I

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
mage and screw around a little bit I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
that but he still can heal so we wanted

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.510 
that but he still can heal so we wanted
to<00:02:20.100> down<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.640> as<00:02:20.790> fast<00:02:21.000> as<00:02:21.120> possible<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
to down here as fast as possible and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.490 
to down here as fast as possible and
once<00:02:23.520> we<00:02:23.730> did<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.270> was<00:02:24.450> pretty<00:02:24.690> easy<00:02:24.810> from

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
once we did it was pretty easy from

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.160 
once we did it was pretty easy from
there<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:26.010> do<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.880> little<00:02:27.120> tea<00:02:27.300> bag<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:27.810> because

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
there I do a little tea bag here because

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.030 
there I do a little tea bag here because
I<00:02:28.470> felt<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.010> was<00:02:29.130> necessary<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.220> teabag

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
I felt it was necessary I like to teabag

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.130 
I felt it was necessary I like to teabag
so<00:02:35.040> yeah<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.880> pretty<00:02:36.240> much<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.600> end<00:02:36.840> of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
so yeah this is pretty much the end of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.680 
so yeah this is pretty much the end of
game<00:02:37.350> 1<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:40.880> finally<00:02:41.880> blow<00:02:42.150> them<00:02:42.270> up<00:02:42.330> for<00:02:42.570> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
game 1 and finally blow them up for the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.370 
game 1 and finally blow them up for the
one<00:02:42.810> they're<00:02:43.050> all<00:02:43.490> right<00:02:44.490> now<00:02:45.240> on<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.930> next

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
one they're all right now on to the next

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.070 
one they're all right now on to the next
game<00:02:48.830> now<00:02:49.830> most<00:02:50.190> decent<00:02:50.430> i<00:02:50.670> guess<00:02:50.810> next<00:02:51.810> game

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
game now most decent i guess next game

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.500 
game now most decent i guess next game
here<00:02:52.530> i<00:02:52.680> notice<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.550> we're<00:02:53.880> up<00:02:54.000> against<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
here i notice that we're up against the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.199 
here i notice that we're up against the
lock<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.680> immediately<00:02:55.980> hop<00:02:56.490> onto<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.970> lot

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
lock so I immediately hop onto that lot

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.850 
lock so I immediately hop onto that lot
because<00:02:57.570> I'm<00:02:57.959> not<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.170> fan<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.440> LOX<00:02:58.770> either

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
because I'm not a fan of LOX either

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.790 
because I'm not a fan of LOX either
because<00:03:01.860> they<00:03:02.190> can<00:03:02.340> also<00:03:02.520> heal<00:03:02.970> themselves

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
because they can also heal themselves

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.949 
because they can also heal themselves
fairly<00:03:04.800> well<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.760> hop<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.570> hunter

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.380 
fairly well but I hop on to the hunter
because<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.440> know<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.980> hunter<00:03:08.310> will<00:03:08.640> do<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.880> lot

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
because I know the hunter will do a lot

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.010 
because I know the hunter will do a lot
of<00:03:09.420> damage<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.020> me<00:03:10.350> one<00:03:11.010> lock<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.030> no<00:03:12.780> no
