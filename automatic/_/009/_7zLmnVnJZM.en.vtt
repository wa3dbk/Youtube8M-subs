they<00:00:57.329> said<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> most<00:00:58.440> beat-up

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
they said that this was the most beat-up

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
you know it's been living in this bag

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
you know it's been living in this bag
protected<00:01:05.420> say<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:06.990> beat-up<00:01:07.580> see<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
protected say it's not beat-up see the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.380 
protected say it's not beat-up see the
box<00:01:09.630> there<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.860> thing<00:01:11.070> inside<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.820> had<00:01:12.270> to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
box there was one thing inside I had to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.910 
box there was one thing inside I had to
change<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.840> batteries<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.470> many<00:01:13.619> times

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
change the batteries so many times

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.039 
change the batteries so many times
because<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:14.880> malfunctioning<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
because it was malfunctioning when I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:16.910 
because it was malfunctioning when I
first<00:01:16.380> got<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
first got it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.190 
first got it
that<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:20.299> ended<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.390> having<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.780> replace<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that I I ended up having to replace the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160 
that I I ended up having to replace the
battery<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.670> little<00:01:24.150> battery<00:01:24.509> case<00:01:24.840> thing

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
battery the little battery case thing

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.749 
battery the little battery case thing
you<00:01:25.409> know<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.680> little<00:01:25.860> thing<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.460> holds<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you know the little thing that holds a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.210 
you know the little thing that holds a
9-volt<00:01:27.180> battery<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.409> soldered<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.950> new<00:01:29.070> one

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
9-volt battery and I soldered a new one

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.969 
9-volt battery and I soldered a new one
on<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.780> did<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.920> know

on and so because I did that you know

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.440 
on and so because I did that you know
the<00:01:32.070> guy<00:01:32.220> got<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.549> upset<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.970> said<00:01:33.210> I've<00:01:33.329> been

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the guy got all upset and said I've been

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.499 
the guy got all upset and said I've been
abusing<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.140> well<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.829> look<00:01:34.979> right<00:01:35.159> here

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
abusing this well if you look right here

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.990 
abusing this well if you look right here
the<00:01:36.509> there's<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> coax<00:01:37.950> wire<00:01:38.250> inside<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:38.970> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the there's a coax wire inside here that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.640 
the there's a coax wire inside here that
means<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> ground<00:01:39.659> wire<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.200> nothing<00:01:40.500> but

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
means the ground wire is nothing but

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.219 
means the ground wire is nothing but
cheap<00:01:40.860> mesh<00:01:41.100> very<00:01:41.970> very<00:01:42.390> thin<00:01:42.750> cheap<00:01:43.020> mesh

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
cheap mesh very very thin cheap mesh

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.920 
cheap mesh very very thin cheap mesh
with<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> nice<00:01:43.710> copper<00:01:44.700> positive<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> very

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
with a nice copper positive but a very

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.490 
with a nice copper positive but a very
crappy<00:01:46.380> negative<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.259> any

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
crappy negative so if there is any

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.219 
crappy negative so if there is any
stress<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.189> strain<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:50.939> bending<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.960> on

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
stress or strain or bending going on on

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.710 
stress or strain or bending going on on
this<00:01:52.560> wire<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.310> which<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.450> because

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
this wire here which there is because

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.280 
this wire here which there is because
it's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.200> metal<00:01:55.920> detector<00:01:56.719> well<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:57.930> happens

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it's a metal detector well what happens

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.039 
it's a metal detector well what happens
is<00:01:58.469> these<00:01:58.770> little<00:01:58.950> cheap<00:01:59.310> wires<00:02:00.240> inside<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
is these little cheap wires inside this

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.679 
is these little cheap wires inside this
coax<00:02:01.500> which<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.369> shouldn't<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.270> should<00:02:03.570> be

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
coax which it shouldn't be it should be

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.240 
coax which it shouldn't be it should be
two<00:02:03.930> copper<00:02:04.799> wires<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:05.399> ground<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:06.240> positive

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
two copper wires one ground one positive

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
two copper wires one ground one positive
well<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.759> did<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.060> broke<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.020> way<00:02:10.140> up

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
well it did just broke all the way up

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.800 
well it did just broke all the way up
the<00:02:10.410> line<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.129> there<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:11.910> there<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the line is one there is one there and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.940 
the line is one there is one there and
there's<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.230> up<00:02:13.470> here

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
there's one up here

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.970 
there's one up here
a man<00:02:14.190> would<00:02:14.790> not<00:02:14.970> honor<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.379> warranty<00:02:16.530> he

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
a man would not honor the warranty he

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.229 
a man would not honor the warranty he
said<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.190> had<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.459> pay<00:02:17.550> another<00:02:17.970> hundred

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
said I had to pay another hundred

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.960 
said I had to pay another hundred
dollars<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.870> another<00:02:19.140> probe<00:02:19.950> which<00:02:20.760> would

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
dollars for another probe which would

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.630 
dollars for another probe which would
have<00:02:21.060> been<00:02:21.180> another<00:02:21.420> crappy<00:02:21.780> coax<00:02:22.379> wire<00:02:22.650> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
have been another crappy coax wire so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.440

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
probe so I'm going to try and connect it

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.850
