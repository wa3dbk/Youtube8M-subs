00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.250
 special because I bring you a little gift 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.650
 As you already know, Christmas is approaching 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.010
 we are at Christmas and I wanted to give you a 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.780
 gift that is a music pack without 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.739
 copyright of every 391 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.199
 they are themes that is to say are all these all 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.829
 this - the file that says read and by 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.829
 please read 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.560
 for something 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.690
 good they are all as I just said and 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 what it means without author right not 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.230
 means that they will be able to put it in 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.450
 your videos 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.330
 they do tutorials or whatever and not 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.870
 they're going to skip copyright, so they do not 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 they will jump that this is continuity 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.600
 third party all the ball that way you guys 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.660
 can monetize your video and it coordinates 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.450
 above all that with reproduction and more and 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.290
 this is putting floors for less you can not 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.290
 have why 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.980
 and want to tell it but also all 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.230
 these do not have copyright so 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.840
 You can also put them in your videos 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.520
 the download is a silly installation 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.690
 is off but teach 7 followed 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.270
 by mega 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.310
 as you see says youcat peace without right 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.640
 adductor 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.950
 of 391 why 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.300
 I do not know how to pronounce in English that 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.090
 I think it's pronounced in English but in 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.590
 a three in three principle 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.379
 and you 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.840
 for Carlos, he will certainly dig with you 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.220
 do not have an account created in mega that 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.379
 I think that everyone has to 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.780
 give everything for those who will not seem 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.300
 this is not going to seem to matter to us 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.000
 plot for being a little sign around here and 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.459
 that says to accept right into the psyche 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.020
 and there they are going to, so for next, we will not 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.020
 leave 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:51.010
 and the discharge facilities of 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.010
 desktop documents 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.850
 why 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.990
 yes but do not want to be the desk 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.990
 they select so 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.000
 and I start to bring all the music 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:25.550
 preparation that's all friends 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:30.830

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:33.430

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.430
