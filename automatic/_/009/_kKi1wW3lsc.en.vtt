about animal heroes including pause

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.879 
about animal heroes including pause
there<00:03:22.329> seem<00:03:22.689> to<00:03:22.840> be<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.200> many<00:03:23.379> stories<00:03:23.769> of

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
there seem to be so many stories of

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.390 
there seem to be so many stories of

animals who somehow or other knew when

animals who somehow or other knew when
there<00:03:27.519> was<00:03:27.639> danger<00:03:27.879> and<00:03:28.329> did<00:03:28.719> something<00:03:29.109> about

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
there was danger and did something about

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.410 
there was danger and did something about
it<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.769> think<00:03:30.430> what<00:03:30.549> was<00:03:30.670> remarkable<00:03:31.000> about

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
it I think what was remarkable about

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.780 
it I think what was remarkable about
grizzly<00:03:32.109> was<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.530> he<00:03:32.650> stayed<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.459> long

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
grizzly was that he stayed for so long

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.729 
grizzly was that he stayed for so long
and<00:03:34.060> he<00:03:34.299> thought<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.569> there<00:03:34.930> are<00:03:35.139> for<00:03:35.500> so

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
and he thought that there are for so

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.550 
and he thought that there are for so
long<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:37.000> was<00:03:37.180> really<00:03:37.810> quite<00:03:38.019> something<00:03:38.260> for

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
long it was really quite something for

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.339 
long it was really quite something for
that<00:03:38.650> dog<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:38.889> do<00:03:39.159> that<00:03:39.480> but<00:03:40.480> what<00:03:40.629> encourages

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
that dog to do that but what encourages

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.349 
that dog to do that but what encourages
dogs<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:42.040> show<00:03:42.249> this<00:03:42.459> kind<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.909> courageous

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
dogs to show this kind of courageous

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.709

world's leading expert in animal
emotions<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.620> question<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.189> is<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.879> dog

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
emotions the question is is the dog

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.750 
emotions the question is is the dog
acting<00:03:52.659> instinctively<00:03:53.349> or<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:54.099> it<00:03:54.250> because<00:03:54.400> of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
acting instinctively or is it because of

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.199 
acting instinctively or is it because of
its<00:03:54.879> emotional<00:03:55.510> ties<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:56.650> its<00:03:57.000> companion<00:03:58.000> and

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
its emotional ties to its companion and

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.629 
its emotional ties to its companion and
I<00:03:58.750> think<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.079> answer<00:03:59.590> is<00:03:59.829> a<00:03:59.859> bit<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.400> both

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
I think the answer is a bit of both

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.720 
I think the answer is a bit of both
obviously<00:04:01.569> a<00:04:01.599> dog<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.260> social<00:04:02.799> creature<00:04:02.980> it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
obviously a dog is a social creature it

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.270 
obviously a dog is a social creature it
grows<00:04:04.150> up<00:04:04.180> in<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.629> pack<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.199> has<00:04:05.379> a<00:04:05.409> loyalty<00:04:06.099> to

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
grows up in a pack it has a loyalty to

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.330 
grows up in a pack it has a loyalty to
the<00:04:06.400> pack<00:04:06.639> and<00:04:07.000> we<00:04:07.569> become<00:04:08.079> part<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.949> the<00:04:09.069> past

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
the pack and we become part of the past

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.759 
the pack and we become part of the past
so<00:04:09.699> their<00:04:09.909> life<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.419> really<00:04:10.719> dedicated<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.469> us

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
so their life is really dedicated to us

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.589 
so their life is really dedicated to us
the<00:04:12.129> leader<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.609> pack<00:04:12.849> but<00:04:13.120> sometimes

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
the leader of the pack but sometimes

we knew he was out there somewhere we

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.880 
we knew he was out there somewhere we
know<00:05:27.370> he<00:05:27.520> was<00:05:27.700> shot<00:05:27.910> down<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:29.350> as<00:05:29.650> we<00:05:29.680> were

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
know he was shot down and as we were

move<00:05:32.040> so<00:05:33.040> I<00:05:33.070> figured<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:33.430> she'd<00:05:33.700> lost<00:05:33.850> her

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.160 
move so I figured that she'd lost her
nerve<00:05:34.300> and<00:05:35.040> instead<00:05:36.040> she<00:05:36.430> had<00:05:36.520> alerted<00:05:36.880> on
