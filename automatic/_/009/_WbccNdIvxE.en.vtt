 How to change the address of a large number of Kawahara shipping destinations 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.029
 I would like to explain 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.119
 I bought these 2 products 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:13.079
 It is world wide to sip at that time 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.910
 If you like this, send directly to a Japanese office 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.659
 Will 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.039
 To win the United States 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.090
 It will also be possible to transfer in the prefectural assembly 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.900
 Basically this has appeared before this and look at this account 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.909
 When you receive 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.310
 Joint communication 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.460
 This shipping has the same thing 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.739
 Funds are increasing I'm shipping address 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.739
 You can register to write this way 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.380
 What severeness does this happen to 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.910
 It becomes selective system 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.880
 There is about this make primary 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.910
 If you cooperate 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.330
 First of all in Japan 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.080
 As there are sellers three days of the beach 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.620
 For example, if you make the Japanese ga award US primary 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.890
 Basically, it is about a heavy prize 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.510
 It will be different from the present method of address recording in the United States 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.210
 is not it 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 Take a method to determine the destination 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.450
 Conversely speaking, America is now on this high-end makeup line 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.100
 Times act illegally with the primary of linux system 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.460
 If 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.220
 Producing a Japanese office when making dividend payments 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 Will be 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.870
 First 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.900
 Basically a helper 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.340
 How is the shipping address braille done? 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 Get a look at retinopathy in film history 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.700
 I want to expect it to be a request 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.590
 This is for sellers 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.220
 Invoice is called 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.960
 To have a bill issued 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.540
 By the way 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.660
 Instructor p2 card I'm sorry This is basically a US rival 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.810
 I can not be primary 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.160
 60 companies listed, for example, paid for this time 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.680
 It is going to send to the forwarding destination in the United States, but is increasing 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.940
 If you want me to send f1 Nakajima to Osaka victory 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.579
 Ask me this way 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.789

 You can request an invoice 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.709
 Because a good ball comes from people in the 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.019
 For that reason, if you rule, it will make Japan more powerful 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.019
 Become 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.249

 Mr. Lee comes out in various ways 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.099
 At first the primary address is also displayed 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.489
 But 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.479
 I love Japan 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.649

 Even if it changed for $ 8.75, it happens. 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:44.049
 The same feels resent even if you add the destination 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.179
 Recovered $ 75 level 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:51.009
 People told by sellers who may be different 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.790
 Japan came out 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.589
 Shipping cost 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.589
 It may not be set, so this time 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.619
 Please come 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:00.769
 For example 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.769
 If you look at this exhibition 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.809
 Suzuki 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.809
 But I did 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:14.619
 British 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.719

 japanfes. 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.960
 It is 99 euros because it is a paper 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.590
 Another head 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.439
 Make an overpayment 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.360
 When that happens 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.469
 Judgment remains unchanged at 75 colors 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.979
 So if you pay as it is probably 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.729
 To the other party 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.000

 Here are the numbers like this 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.660
 Fortunately there are 99 people at that time 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.930
 It is ok if you can in this way 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.009
 Like this yahoo 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.599
 False commercialization 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.309
 Come out 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:04.979
 Rampage lead 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.960
 As this monk may not be displayed, it is about as far as the Buddha 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.240
 It was an individual request as well 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.330
 I am asked to request Tatar Pravo Sera 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.779
 It's also a long time ago 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.329

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:21.460

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.460
 It becomes like this 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.729
 This makes it possible to abstract Kushikino
