deal is actually just implemented it

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.939 
deal is actually just implemented it
into<00:00:29.630> a<00:00:29.660> system<00:00:30.110> that<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:30.289> was<00:00:30.440> already<00:00:30.680> using

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
into a system that I was already using

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.100 
into a system that I was already using
through<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.760> public<00:00:32.090> records<00:00:32.300> i<00:00:32.629> was<00:00:32.750> able<00:00:32.900> to

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
through the public records i was able to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.330 
through the public records i was able to
find<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:35.379> local<00:00:36.379> community<00:00:36.949> bank<00:00:37.190> and

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
find a local community bank and

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.580 
find a local community bank and
basically<00:00:40.540> work<00:00:41.540> backwards<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.170> find<00:00:42.470> the

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
basically work backwards to find the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.229 
basically work backwards to find the
attorney<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.160> went<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:43.430> foreclosure<00:00:43.910> and

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
attorney that went to foreclosure and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.540 
attorney that went to foreclosure and
then<00:00:44.420> pulled<00:00:44.750> up<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.710> community<00:00:46.040> bank<00:00:46.370> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
then pulled up the community bank and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.729 
then pulled up the community bank and
actually<00:00:46.820> gave<00:00:47.059> me<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:48.050> asset<00:00:48.380> managers

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
actually gave me the asset managers

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.280 
actually gave me the asset managers
number<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:49.820> actually<00:00:50.180> fairly<00:00:50.390> easy<00:00:50.719> i<00:00:51.110> only

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
number so is actually fairly easy i only

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.920 
number so is actually fairly easy i only
thought<00:00:51.920> probably<00:00:52.640> happen<00:00:53.000> within<00:00:53.210> two<00:00:53.750> days

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
thought probably happen within two days

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.470 
thought probably happen within two days
of<00:00:54.140> getting<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.530> course<00:00:54.800> I<00:00:55.070> probably<00:00:56.000> went<00:00:56.270> in

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
of getting the course I probably went in

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.619 
of getting the course I probably went in
maybe<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.379> couple<00:00:57.739> hours<00:00:57.980> into<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.820> actual

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
maybe a couple hours into the actual

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.540 
maybe a couple hours into the actual
course<00:00:59.899> itself<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:00.950> was<00:01:01.129> able<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.430> get

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
course itself and I was able to get

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.570 
course itself and I was able to get
something<00:01:01.820> done

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.630 

basically<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:07.549> contract<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.880> contact<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
basically from contract or contact to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
basically from contract or contact to
close<00:01:11.640> probably<00:01:12.509> took<00:01:12.659> about<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.960> week<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.530> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
close probably took about a week but I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.719 
close probably took about a week but I
