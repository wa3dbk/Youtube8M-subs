00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
is how to get a pretty full sauce

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.429 
is how to get a pretty full sauce
normally<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.390> my<00:00:27.570> hair<00:00:27.750> braided<00:00:28.019> or

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
normally I have my hair braided or

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.890 
normally I have my hair braided or
twisted<00:00:28.859> or<00:00:28.949> something<00:00:29.340> right<00:00:29.429> now<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
twisted or something right now it's the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
twisted or something right now it's the
braids<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.279> down<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
braids are out and it's just down and a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.389 
braids are out and it's just down and a
half<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:34.110> ponytail<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.420> so<00:00:37.160> this<00:00:38.160> was

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
half of the ponytail and so this was

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.619 
half of the ponytail and so this was
kind<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.640> fancy<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:39.450> doesn't

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
kind of fancy but it really doesn't

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.819 
kind of fancy but it really doesn't
matter<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:40.079> something<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> give<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
matter just something to give you a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.810 
matter just something to give you a
something<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.910> start<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> that's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
something to start with and so that's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.170 
something to start with and so that's
where<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.149> start<00:00:45.559> then<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.590> take<00:00:47.100> an<00:00:47.730> under

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
where you start then you take an under

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819 
where you start then you take an under
piece<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.539> fabric<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.050> doesn't<00:00:49.440> matter<00:00:49.559> what

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
piece of fabric it doesn't matter what

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.970 
piece of fabric it doesn't matter what
it<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.730> point<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it is the point is for it to be here to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.850 
it is the point is for it to be here to
grip<00:00:53.250> your<00:00:53.280> top<00:00:54.090> Scott<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
grip your top Scott it's kind of a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.150 
grip your top Scott it's kind of a
layering<00:00:56.129> process<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.719> my<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
layering process and so my right now is

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
layering process and so my right now is
a<00:00:59.190> triangular<00:00:59.730> piece<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.239> fabric<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:02.850> just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
a triangular piece of fabric and it just

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.770 
a triangular piece of fabric and it just
goes<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:06.799> okay<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.610> were<00:01:08.700> taught<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.299> you

goes on okay and you were taught you you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.300 
goes on okay and you were taught you you
might<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.200> tie<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:10.860> time<00:01:11.040> and
