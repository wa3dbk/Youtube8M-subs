transplant surgery there are a lot of
thinking<00:01:41.890> factors<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.430> understand<00:01:43.120> when<00:01:43.780> it

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
thinking factors to understand when it

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.430 
thinking factors to understand when it
comes<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.770> anticipation<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.810> amount

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
comes to the anticipation of the amount

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.719 
comes to the anticipation of the amount
of<00:01:47.710> growth<00:01:48.120> that<00:01:49.120> you<00:01:49.270> will<00:01:49.479> have<00:01:49.750> but<00:01:50.729> simply

of growth that you will have but simply
stated<00:01:52.299> this<00:01:53.200> is<00:01:53.409> still<00:01:53.710> very<00:01:54.159> early<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.940> the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
stated this is still very early in the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.710 
stated this is still very early in the
course<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:56.110> your<00:01:56.770> hair<00:01:57.159> hair<00:01:57.909> growth<00:01:58.210> after

course of your hair hair growth after
transplant<00:01:59.470> in<00:01:59.770> my<00:02:00.520> practice<00:02:01.180> we<00:02:01.860> even<00:02:02.860> with<00:02:03.220> a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
transplant in my practice we even with a

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.050 
transplant in my practice we even with a
lot<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.500> advanced<00:02:05.500> methods<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.520> hair

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
lot of the advanced methods and hair

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.270 
lot of the advanced methods and hair
regenerative<00:02:07.720> technology<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.709> we<00:02:08.860> employ

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
regenerative technology that we employ

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.000 
regenerative technology that we employ
we<00:02:10.149> still<00:02:10.599> say<00:02:11.019> that<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:12.310> full<00:02:13.150> result<00:02:13.659> is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
we still say that the full result is

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.130 
we still say that the full result is
closer<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.250> approximately<00:02:16.150> one<00:02:16.420> year<00:02:16.989> after

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
closer to approximately one year after

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.089 
closer to approximately one year after
the<00:02:17.890> transplant<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.569> let's<00:02:19.810> understand<00:02:20.379> some

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
the transplant so let's understand some

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.820 
the transplant so let's understand some
of<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.280> things<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.849> are<00:02:22.120> happening<00:02:22.830> first

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
of the things that are happening first

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.780 
of the things that are happening first
of<00:02:23.980> all<00:02:24.300> when<00:02:25.300> hair<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:26.099> grafted<00:02:27.099> in<00:02:27.610> other

hair regeneration technology which we

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.449 
hair regeneration technology which we
developed<00:03:52.140> combining<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.380> material<00:03:54.250> called

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
the idea is is that with the advanced

hair gonna gonna thin out so when we

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.900 
hair gonna gonna thin out so when we
look<00:05:11.880> at<00:05:12.090> somebody<00:05:12.630> for<00:05:12.930> hair<00:05:13.199> transplant

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
look at somebody for hair transplant

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.090 
look at somebody for hair transplant
clearly<00:05:14.910> that<00:05:15.270> is<00:05:15.540> an<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:16.199> dominant<00:05:16.800> thought

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
clearly that is an a dominant thought

clearly that is an a dominant thought
and<00:05:17.490> what<00:05:18.389> we've<00:05:18.600> been<00:05:18.750> able<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.020> do<00:05:19.169> with<00:05:19.350> hair

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
and what we've been able to do with hair

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.010 
and what we've been able to do with hair
regeneration<00:05:19.740> is<00:05:20.580> address<00:05:21.210> that<00:05:21.479> I<00:05:21.750> think

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
regeneration is address that I think

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.710 
regeneration is address that I think
very<00:05:22.160> successfully<00:05:23.160> but<00:05:24.090> as<00:05:24.180> far<00:05:24.419> as<00:05:24.449> your

very successfully but as far as your

very successfully but as far as your
question<00:05:25.080> is<00:05:25.440> concerned<00:05:25.979> I<00:05:26.280> think<00:05:26.729> it's<00:05:27.090> very

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
question is concerned I think it's very

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.870 
question is concerned I think it's very

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
practice we see our patients very

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.529 
practice we see our patients very
frequently<00:05:41.090> understanding<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.210> even

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
frequently understanding that even

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.100 
frequently understanding that even
though<00:05:43.050> we<00:05:43.800> know<00:05:44.160> that<00:05:44.539> full<00:05:45.539> hair<00:05:45.840> growth

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
though we know that full hair growth

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.310 
though we know that full hair growth
will<00:05:46.350> not<00:05:46.380> occur<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:48.150> its<00:05:48.300> fullest<00:05:48.660> extent<00:05:48.780> I

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.790 
will not occur to its fullest extent I
should<00:05:49.590> say<00:05:50.060> until<00:05:51.060> about<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.360> year<00:05:51.450> it<00:05:52.020> is<00:05:52.440> very

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
should say until about a year it is very

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.950 
should say until about a year it is very
important<00:05:53.460> that<00:05:53.639> what<00:05:53.820> we<00:05:54.000> do<00:05:54.210> is<00:05:54.419> we<00:05:54.570> see<00:05:54.840> our

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
important that what we do is we see our

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.170 
important that what we do is we see our
patients<00:05:55.590> pretty<00:05:56.070> much<00:05:56.280> every<00:05:56.669> three<00:05:56.940> months

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
patients pretty much every three months

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.540 
patients pretty much every three months
minimum<00:05:57.720> and<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.470> door<00:05:58.710> is<00:05:58.860> always<00:05:59.070> open<00:05:59.190> for

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
minimum and the door is always open for

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.750 
minimum and the door is always open for
them<00:05:59.789> to<00:05:59.940> come<00:06:00.150> many<00:06:00.330> times<00:06:00.630> within<00:06:01.260> that<00:06:01.410> time

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
them to come many times within that time

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.810 
them to come many times within that time
timeframe<00:06:03.080> but<00:06:04.080> we<00:06:04.349> will<00:06:04.560> also<00:06:04.889> do

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
timeframe but we will also do

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.600 
timeframe but we will also do
microscopic<00:06:06.750> examinations<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:08.010> we<00:06:08.130> will<00:06:08.280> see

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
microscopic examinations and we will see

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.930 
microscopic examinations and we will see
how<00:06:09.389> things<00:06:09.870> are<00:06:10.050> progressing<00:06:10.400> so<00:06:11.400> that<00:06:11.610> the

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
how things are progressing so that the

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.439 
how things are progressing so that the
the<00:06:12.900> patient<00:06:13.260> understands<00:06:13.979> that<00:06:14.220> this<00:06:14.940> is<00:06:15.000> a

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
the patient understands that this is a

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.700 
the patient understands that this is a
natural<00:06:16.260> process<00:06:16.590> and<00:06:17.220> that<00:06:17.940> ultimately<00:06:18.710> the

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
natural process and that ultimately the

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.560 
natural process and that ultimately the
success<00:06:20.280> of<00:06:20.490> the<00:06:20.610> surgery<00:06:21.120> will<00:06:21.539> be

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
success of the surgery will be

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.100 
success of the surgery will be
determined<00:06:22.410> at<00:06:22.560> approximately<00:06:23.460> one<00:06:23.940> year<00:06:24.389> so

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
determined at approximately one year so

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.020 
determined at approximately one year so
for<00:06:25.320> now<00:06:25.440> I<00:06:25.740> think<00:06:26.099> it's<00:06:26.250> fine<00:06:26.580> that<00:06:26.880> you<00:06:27.000> are

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
for now I think it's fine that you are

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.320 
for now I think it's fine that you are
using<00:06:27.449> the<00:06:27.690> minoxidil<00:06:28.169> there<00:06:28.949> are<00:06:29.220> some<00:06:30.030> there

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
using the minoxidil there are some there

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.779 
using the minoxidil there are some there
is<00:06:30.389> some<00:06:30.510> evidence<00:06:30.900> that<00:06:31.260> minoxidil<00:06:31.889> topical

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
is some evidence that minoxidil topical

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.719 
is some evidence that minoxidil topical
will<00:06:33.060> help<00:06:33.560> move<00:06:34.560> things<00:06:34.919> along<00:06:35.070> or<00:06:35.430> help

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
will help move things along or help

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.219 
will help move things along or help
resynchronize<00:06:36.599> the<00:06:37.289> hair<00:06:37.530> growth<00:06:37.800> cycles<00:06:38.370> but

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
resynchronize the hair growth cycles but

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.810 
resynchronize the hair growth cycles but
understanding<00:06:40.229> that<00:06:40.470> throughout<00:06:41.310> this

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
understanding that throughout this

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.540 
understanding that throughout this
process<00:06:42.570> there<00:06:42.870> are<00:06:42.900> going<00:06:43.110> to<00:06:43.169> be<00:06:43.280> hairs<00:06:44.280> that

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
process there are going to be hairs that

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.330 
process there are going to be hairs that
shed<00:06:44.910> in<00:06:45.120> Harris's<00:06:45.630> start<00:06:45.930> to<00:06:46.050> grow<00:06:46.260> in<00:06:46.340> until

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
shed in Harris's start to grow in until

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.150 
shed in Harris's start to grow in until
you<00:06:47.490> reach<00:06:47.789> this<00:06:48.120> kind<00:06:48.449> of<00:06:48.539> equilibrium

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
you reach this kind of equilibrium

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.000 
you reach this kind of equilibrium
somewhere<00:06:50.160> at<00:06:50.400> about<00:06:50.699> the<00:06:50.880> 1-year<00:06:51.360> point<00:06:51.750> so<00:06:52.740> I

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
somewhere at about the 1-year point so I

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.800 
somewhere at about the 1-year point so I
wish<00:06:53.190> you<00:06:53.340> the<00:06:53.490> best<00:06:53.520> of<00:06:53.880> luck<00:06:54.150> I<00:06:54.330> hope<00:06:54.360> that

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
wish you the best of luck I hope that

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.670 
wish you the best of luck I hope that
was<00:06:54.930> helpful<00:06:54.960> and

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
was helpful and

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:18.190 
was helpful and
