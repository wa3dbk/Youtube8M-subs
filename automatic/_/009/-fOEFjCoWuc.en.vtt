and again his game is built on quickness
and<00:02:09.780> he<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.110> very<00:02:10.350> quick<00:02:10.649> he's<00:02:11.280> got<00:02:11.430> great

and he is very quick he's got great
acceleration<00:02:12.260> great<00:02:13.260> hands<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.700> good

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
acceleration great hands and the good

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.960 
acceleration great hands and the good
thing<00:02:15.300> about<00:02:15.330> him<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.930> his<00:02:16.380> hockey<00:02:16.890> IQ<00:02:17.340> would

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
thing about him is his hockey IQ would

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.449 
thing about him is his hockey IQ would
be<00:02:18.120> above<00:02:18.390> average<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.650> when<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
be above average and so when you you

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.229 
be above average and so when you you
combine<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.920> get<00:02:23.280> away<00:02:23.370> from<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:24.000> size

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
combine that you get away from the size

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.000 
combine that you get away from the size
factor<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.350> fact<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.739> matter<00:02:25.800> is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
factor and the fact of the matter is

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.830 
factor and the fact of the matter is
he's<00:02:26.880> very<00:02:27.120> strong

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
you know you would think oh maybe is a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.220 
you know you would think oh maybe is a
smaller<00:02:38.160> player<00:02:38.459> he<00:02:38.910> may<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.300> but<00:02:39.780> because<00:02:40.050> of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
smaller player he may not but because of

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.970 
smaller player he may not but because of
his<00:02:40.440> speed<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.920> strength<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.670> his<00:02:41.790> feet<00:02:41.970> he's
