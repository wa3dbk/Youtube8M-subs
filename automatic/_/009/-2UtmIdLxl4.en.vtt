00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:10.551
 Welcome to our World of Warcraft mini-guide dedicated to Hunter Survival. 

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:14.563
 This video offers a quick overview of everything you need to know 

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:17.873
 to start playing a level 90 Survival Hunter. 

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:22.635
 Hunter Survival uses focus as the primary resource. 

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:29.149
 The latter self-regulates slowly, but you can acccelerate it with Cobra Shot 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.362
 when you do not have enough resources to use more powerful techniques. 

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:37.103
 Before the fight, summon your pet 

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.875
 with Pet Call, or Resuscitate the Pet, if necessary. 

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.401
 In combat, spend your focus as soon as possible 

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.248
 in one of your three main techniques. 

00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:50.800
 The most important is Explosive Shot, which deals the highest damage 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.051
 so as soon as it is available, launch it immediately. 

00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:58.861
 Then there is Black Arrow, a pretty powerful effect over time 

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.569
 which also has a chance to trigger Ready to shoot, which allows you to launch 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:06.220
 immediately three consecutive explosive shots. 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.023
 Use Black Arrow as long as possible. 

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:13.629
 Otherwise, use your focus for Arcane Shot. Just make sure 

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:19.156
 keep enough focus for Explosive Shot or Black Arrow as soon as they are available. 

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:23.171
 You will have to learn a lot more to really master this character, 

00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:26.921
 but we hope that these tips will have put you on the right track. 

00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:29.282
 Once the basics have been learned, 

00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:34.568
 Spend a little time browsing through your spelling book, your talents and your glyphs 

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:37.959
 to discover the techniques that we have not discussed here. 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.601
 Thank you for having followed us and see you soon in Draenor!
