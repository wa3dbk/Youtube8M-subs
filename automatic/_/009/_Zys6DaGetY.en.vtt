to the roller so I don't have to look
for<00:03:02.510> any<00:03:02.659> clips<00:03:02.900> while<00:03:03.230> I'm<00:03:03.709> rolling<00:03:04.129> my<00:03:04.159> hair

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669

for any clips while I'm rolling my hair
and<00:03:06.879> yes<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.560> next<00:03:09.739> morning<00:03:09.889> you<00:03:10.370> wake<00:03:10.609> up

and your hair will be dry and you start

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.449 
and your hair will be dry and you start
taking<00:03:18.019> them<00:03:18.109> out<00:03:18.349> from<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.639> bottom<00:03:20.060> going<00:03:20.870> up

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
taking them out from the bottom going up

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.819 
taking them out from the bottom going up

don't worry they're all like tangles

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.759 
don't worry they're all like tangles
just<00:03:25.340> pull<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:26.049> just<00:03:27.049> pulling<00:03:27.379> your<00:03:27.500> hair

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769

where<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.280> piece<00:03:28.609> that<00:03:28.639> you<00:03:28.940> rolled<00:03:29.389> and<00:03:29.840> then

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
where the piece that you rolled and then

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.629 
where the piece that you rolled and then
just<00:03:30.199> curl<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.769> back<00:03:30.949> with<00:03:31.129> your<00:03:31.250> finger<00:03:31.609> and

just curl the back with your finger and
the<00:03:31.909> shape<00:03:32.180> will<00:03:32.379> probably<00:03:33.489> reconstruct<00:03:34.489> and

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
the shape will probably reconstruct and

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.379 
the shape will probably reconstruct and
