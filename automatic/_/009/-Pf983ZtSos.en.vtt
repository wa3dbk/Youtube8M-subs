here<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> little<00:02:08.849> bit<00:02:08.970> more<00:02:09.119> taut<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.899> it's

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
here a little bit more taut so that it's

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.110

it<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.890> stand<00:02:11.159> up<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.519> little<00:02:11.550> bit<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.000> have

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
it can stand up a little bit if you have

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.990 
it can stand up a little bit if you have
a<00:02:12.239> lot<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.480> items<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:13.140> there<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:14.489> other<00:02:14.610> reason

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
a lot of items in there the other reason

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.420 
a lot of items in there the other reason
why<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.599> it<00:02:15.840> seems<00:02:16.049> to<00:02:16.349> be<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.950> me<00:02:17.159> a

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
why I like it is it seems to be to me a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.910 
why I like it is it seems to be to me a
little<00:02:17.790> bit<00:02:17.909> more<00:02:18.180> gloomy<00:02:18.569> inside<00:02:18.989> because<00:02:19.890> of

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
little bit more gloomy inside because of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.649 
little bit more gloomy inside because of
the<00:02:20.129> fact<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.519> there<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.909> little<00:02:21.239> extra

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
the fact that there is a little extra

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.789 
the fact that there is a little extra
room<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.830> width<00:02:23.459> apart<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.409> like<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
room the width apart so and I like that

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.500 
room the width apart so and I like that
they<00:02:25.920> add<00:02:26.069> in<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.340> little<00:02:26.549> pocket<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.450> you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
they add in a little pocket so you

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690 
they add in a little pocket so you
really<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.170> feel<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:28.799> this<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> cute

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.030 
really can feel like this is a cute
little<00:02:29.849> bag<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.569> get<00:02:31.080> away<00:02:31.260> with<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.650> bought<00:02:31.920> it

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
little bag to get away with I bought it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.110 
little bag to get away with I bought it
so<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.400> could<00:02:32.459> use<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.819> in<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.970> summer

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so that I could use it in the summer

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.930 
so that I could use it in the summer
time<00:02:33.560> as<00:02:34.560> sometimes<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.400> don't<00:02:35.459> want<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.730> carry

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
time as sometimes I don't want to carry

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.309 
time as sometimes I don't want to carry
a<00:02:36.060> big<00:02:36.120> pocket<00:02:36.510> book<00:02:36.780> or<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.959> don't<00:02:37.140> want<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
a big pocket book or I don't want to

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.680 
a big pocket book or I don't want to
carry<00:02:37.500> too<00:02:37.680> many<00:02:37.769> items<00:02:38.069> around<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:39.060> just

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
carry too many items around so I just

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.899

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.670 
think it's a great addition to my
collection<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.660> will<00:02:42.870> probably<00:02:43.379> never<00:02:43.530> be

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680
