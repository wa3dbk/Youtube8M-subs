first off we'll talk about the size of

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.880 
first off we'll talk about the size of
it<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:35.410> you<00:00:35.559> can<00:00:35.739> see<00:00:35.950> it's<00:00:36.550> not<00:00:37.239> it's<00:00:38.230> not<00:00:38.440> huge

like other cameras are many people

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.100 
like other cameras are many people
complain<00:00:41.980> that<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.520> extended<00:00:43.360> battery<00:00:43.629> grip

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
complain that the extended battery grip

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.180 
complain that the extended battery grip
is<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:44.770> great<00:00:45.100> purchase<00:00:45.450> because<00:00:46.920> some<00:00:47.920> people

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
is a great purchase because some people

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.460 
is a great purchase because some people
like<00:00:48.310> to<00:00:48.430> have<00:00:48.579> their<00:00:48.730> whole<00:00:48.910> hand<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.570> for<00:00:50.320> me

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
like to have their whole hand and for me

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.069 
like to have their whole hand and for me
this<00:00:50.710> last<00:00:50.980> finger<00:00:51.220> doesn't<00:00:52.030> unless<00:00:52.540> I<00:00:52.780> really

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
this last finger doesn't unless I really

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.800 
this last finger doesn't unless I really
squish<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.680> on<00:00:53.800> there<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.760> few<00:00:55.000> big<00:00:55.329> hands<00:00:55.600> I

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
squish it on there so a few big hands I

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.660 
squish it on there so a few big hands I
would<00:00:55.870> highly<00:00:56.260> recommend<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:57.190> extended

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
would highly recommend the extended

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.130 
would highly recommend the extended
battery<00:00:57.820> grip<00:00:58.260> fits<00:00:59.260> on<00:00:59.500> down<00:01:00.040> here<00:01:00.430> and<00:01:01.140> I

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
battery grip fits on down here and I

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.950 
battery grip fits on down here and I
think<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:02.649> around<00:01:02.850> 150<00:01:03.850> dollars<00:01:04.210> but<00:01:04.839> it

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
think it's around 150 dollars but it

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.469 
think it's around 150 dollars but it
does<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.170> great<00:01:05.409> help<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.009> it<00:01:06.220> also<00:01:06.399> holds<00:01:07.090> two

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
does a great help and it also holds two

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.990 
does a great help and it also holds two
batteries<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.680> it's<00:01:08.829> twice<00:01:09.130> as<00:01:09.159> long<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.759> it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
batteries so it's twice as long and it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.990 
batteries so it's twice as long and it
can<00:01:10.030> run<00:01:10.270> on<00:01:10.299> double<00:01:10.720> A's<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.259> you<00:01:11.439> can<00:01:11.619> shoot

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
can run on double A's and you can shoot

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.399 
can run on double A's and you can shoot
vertically<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.420> horizontally<00:01:19.409> another

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
vertically and horizontally another

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.430 
vertically and horizontally another
thing<00:01:20.650> about<00:01:20.770> this<00:01:21.040> camera<00:01:21.370> is<00:01:21.760> that<00:01:22.299> it<00:01:23.170> has

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
thing about this camera is that it has

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.460 
thing about this camera is that it has
something<00:01:23.710> called<00:01:23.890> dust<00:01:24.640> vibration<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:26.229> what

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
something called dust vibration and what

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.930 
something called dust vibration and what
this<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.890> basically<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.549> when<00:01:27.790> you're

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
this is basically is when you're

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.510 
this is basically is when you're
changing<00:01:28.180> their<00:01:28.510> lenses<00:01:28.930> when<00:01:29.920> you're<00:01:30.040> taking

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
changing their lenses when you're taking

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.120 
changing their lenses when you're taking
the<00:01:30.580> lens<00:01:30.790> off<00:01:31.000> like<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.650> take<00:01:32.830> it<00:01:32.979> off

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
the lens off like this you take it off

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.320 
the lens off like this you take it off
dust<00:01:33.970> can<00:01:34.330> get<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:34.690> there<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.670> when<00:01:36.760> dust<00:01:37.060> gets

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
dust can get in there and when dust gets

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.810 
dust can get in there and when dust gets
in<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.810> ruins<00:01:38.290> your<00:01:38.350> photos<00:01:38.860> maybe<00:01:39.610> you're

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
in it ruins your photos maybe you're

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.340 
in it ruins your photos maybe you're
taking<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.180> picture<00:01:40.510> of<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.630> sky<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:43.350> find

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
taking a picture of the sky and you find

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.100 
taking a picture of the sky and you find
a<00:01:44.439> thing<00:01:44.590> looks<00:01:44.830> great<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.310> screen<00:01:46.110> but

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
a thing looks great on the screen but

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.840 
a thing looks great on the screen but
then<00:01:47.380> when<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:47.890> get<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.220> computer<00:01:48.640> look

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
then when you get to the computer look

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.920 
then when you get to the computer look
at<00:01:48.939> it<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.119> hundred<00:01:49.299> percent

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
at it a hundred percent

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.719 
at it a hundred percent
there's<00:01:50.409> all<00:01:50.650> kinds<00:01:51.070> of<00:01:51.130> little<00:01:51.189> dust

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
there's all kinds of little dust

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.030 
there's all kinds of little dust
particles<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.570> that's<00:01:52.869> not<00:01:53.080> good<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:53.560> what

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
particles and that's not good so what

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.280 
particles and that's not good so what
this<00:01:54.189> does<00:01:54.430> without<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.000> even<00:01:55.119> knowing<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.750> it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
this does without you even knowing is it

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.859 
this does without you even knowing is it
vibrates<00:01:56.920> inside<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:58.030> think<00:01:58.509> it's<00:01:58.630> called

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
vibrates inside I think it's called

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.730 
vibrates inside I think it's called
ultrasonic<00:01:59.670> like<00:02:00.670> just<00:02:01.270> like<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:02.259> know<00:02:02.380> this

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
ultrasonic like just like you know this

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.980 
ultrasonic like just like you know this
and<00:02:03.070> it<00:02:03.189> just<00:02:03.220> vibrates<00:02:03.850> all<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.360> dust<00:02:04.750> off

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
and it just vibrates all the dust off

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.039 
and it just vibrates all the dust off
and<00:02:05.799> that's<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.700> great<00:02:06.909> feature<00:02:07.180> but<00:02:07.570> some

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
and that's a great feature but some

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.690 
and that's a great feature but some
people<00:02:08.349> say<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.709> doesn't<00:02:08.950> go<00:02:09.129> to<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.459> full

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
people say it doesn't go to the full

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.449 
people say it doesn't go to the full
extent<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:10.290> taking<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.379> blower<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:12.040> actually

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
extent of taking a blower and actually

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.380 
extent of taking a blower and actually
going<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:12.939> there<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.329> blowing<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.870> out<00:02:13.959> but

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
going in there and blowing it out but

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.690 
going in there and blowing it out but
fermion<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:17.110> great<00:02:17.439> for<00:02:17.650> being<00:02:17.860> US<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.430> even

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
fermion it's great for being US and even

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.009 
fermion it's great for being US and even
their<00:02:18.970> media<00:02:19.269> people<00:02:19.480> but<00:02:19.780> if<00:02:19.870> you're

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
their media people but if you're

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.990 
their media people but if you're
professional<00:02:20.650> you'll<00:02:21.370> probably<00:02:21.610> want<00:02:21.940> to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
professional you'll probably want to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.229 
professional you'll probably want to
look<00:02:22.150> at<00:02:22.270> something<00:02:22.510> maybe<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
look at something maybe the

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.580 
look at something maybe the
five<00:02:25.510> d<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.540> pretty<00:02:28.720> good<00:02:28.900> camera<00:02:29.140> pan

five d that's a pretty good camera pan

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.800 
five d that's a pretty good camera pan
and<00:02:29.739> five<00:02:29.920> B<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.489> then<00:02:31.330> you'll<00:02:31.599> have<00:02:31.750> like

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
and five B and then you'll have like

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.190 
and five B and then you'll have like
that<00:02:32.319> Canon<00:02:33.069> L<00:02:33.280> lenses<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.720> now<00:02:34.930> I'm<00:02:35.019> going<00:02:35.110> to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
that Canon L lenses and now I'm going to

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.070 
that Canon L lenses and now I'm going to
talk<00:02:35.319> about<00:02:35.379> a<00:02:35.620> little<00:02:35.830> bit<00:02:35.980> about<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
talk about a little bit about the the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.420 
talk about a little bit about the the
lens<00:02:38.319> Tamron<00:02:39.220> 28<00:02:40.060> through<00:02:40.300> 75<00:02:40.720> zoom<00:02:41.590> lens<00:02:44.430> this

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
lens Tamron 28 through 75 zoom lens this

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.780 
lens Tamron 28 through 75 zoom lens this
lens<00:02:45.760> has<00:02:46.180> 2.8<00:02:46.870> aperture<00:02:47.440> which<00:02:48.160> means<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.640> can

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
lens has 2.8 aperture which means it can

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.729 
lens has 2.8 aperture which means it can
shoot<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.239> low<00:02:49.540> light<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.290> won't<00:02:50.500> be<00:02:50.650> as

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
shoot in low light and it won't be as

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.780 
shoot in low light and it won't be as
noisy<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.510> it'll<00:02:52.510> appear<00:02:52.630> brighter<00:02:53.610> which<00:02:54.610> is

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
noisy and it'll appear brighter which is

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.630 
noisy and it'll appear brighter which is
very<00:02:55.030> good<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.510> also<00:02:55.890> 28<00:02:56.890> pretty<00:02:57.430> low<00:02:57.610> number

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
very good and also 28 pretty low number

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.410 
very good and also 28 pretty low number
and<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:59.380> means<00:02:59.620> that<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.819> wider<00:03:01.090> angle

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
and that means that it's a wider angle

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.509 
and that means that it's a wider angle
because<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.319> seems<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.650> your<00:03:02.920> back<00:03:03.130> farther

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
because it seems like your back farther

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.900 
because it seems like your back farther
and<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.329> can<00:03:04.510> capture<00:03:04.780> more<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.790> a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
and it can capture more and this is a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.580 
and it can capture more and this is a
good<00:03:07.090> feature<00:03:07.599> for<00:03:08.200> shooting<00:03:08.769> landscapes<00:03:09.489> or

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
good feature for shooting landscapes or

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.180 
good feature for shooting landscapes or
panoramas<00:03:11.590> things<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:13.440> whereas<00:03:14.440> with

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
panoramas things like that whereas with

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.000 
panoramas things like that whereas with
say<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.670> 200<00:03:16.510> they're<00:03:17.049> in<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:17.410> far<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.680> it's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
say a 200 they're in so far that it's

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.789 
say a 200 they're in so far that it's
not<00:03:18.250> really<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.849> wide<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.630> so<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.590> really

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
not really that wide and so it really

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.720 
not really that wide and so it really
affects<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.459> uh<00:03:22.799> something<00:03:23.799> about<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.220> camera

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
affects it uh something about the camera

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.039 
affects it uh something about the camera
that<00:03:24.849> I'll<00:03:25.000> mention<00:03:25.209> is<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:27.190> 9<00:03:27.430> foot<00:03:27.849> 9<00:03:28.120> point

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
that I'll mention is the 9 foot 9 point

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.569 
that I'll mention is the 9 foot 9 point
autofocus<00:03:29.440> system<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:31.090> what<00:03:31.959> this<00:03:32.170> is<00:03:32.579> it's

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
autofocus system and what this is it's

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.789 
autofocus system and what this is it's
kind<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:33.880> hard<00:03:34.030> for<00:03:34.090> me<00:03:34.359> to<00:03:34.450> show<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.720> but<00:03:34.959> it's

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
kind of hard for me to show you but it's

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:42.180 
kind of hard for me to show you but it's
9<00:03:36.340> points<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.209> screen<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:42.010> can

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
9 points on the screen and you can

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.990 
9 points on the screen and you can
assign<00:03:42.519> with<00:03:43.299> these<00:03:43.510> buttons<00:03:43.840> right<00:03:44.380> here<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
assign with these buttons right here the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.750 
assign with these buttons right here the
9<00:03:46.239> point<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.440> can<00:03:47.680> put<00:03:47.889> it<00:03:48.040> say<00:03:48.579> you're

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
9 point so you can put it say you're

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.270 
9 point so you can put it say you're
shooting<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.450> picture<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.410> tree<00:03:50.709> over<00:03:50.950> here

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
shooting a picture of a tree over here

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.780 
shooting a picture of a tree over here
but<00:03:52.000> back<00:03:52.239> here<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:53.049> something<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.920> it's<00:03:54.430> way

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
but back here is something and it's way

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.599 
but back here is something and it's way
back<00:03:55.299> here<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.590> don't<00:03:56.889> want<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.250> focus

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
back here so you don't want it to focus

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.550 
back here so you don't want it to focus
on<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:57.910> tree<00:03:58.329> but<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.750> might<00:03:58.930> automatically

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
on that tree but it might automatically

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.059 
on that tree but it might automatically
autofocus<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:01.150> you'll<00:04:01.359> use<00:04:01.569> these<00:04:01.930> buttons<00:04:02.769> to

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
autofocus so you'll use these buttons to

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.789 
autofocus so you'll use these buttons to
adjust<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.329> to<00:04:04.359> the<00:04:04.600> side<00:04:04.870> which<00:04:05.410> will<00:04:05.620> focus

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
adjust it to the side which will focus

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.830 
adjust it to the side which will focus
in<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.459> back<00:04:06.639> of<00:04:07.239> course<00:04:07.480> there's<00:04:07.750> still

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
in the back of course there's still

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.420 
in the back of course there's still
manual<00:04:08.380> focus<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.010> can<00:04:09.160> do<00:04:09.280> that

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
manual focus and you can do that

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.759 
manual focus and you can do that
yourself<00:04:09.910> but<00:04:10.540> that's<00:04:10.840> great<00:04:11.170> for<00:04:11.380> beginners

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
yourself but that's great for beginners

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.400 
yourself but that's great for beginners
and<00:04:11.950> intermediates<00:04:12.579> who<00:04:13.079> like<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.230> ease<00:04:14.380> of

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
and intermediates who like the ease of

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.940 
and intermediates who like the ease of
use<00:04:15.510> something<00:04:16.510> also<00:04:17.049> on<00:04:17.169> here<00:04:17.349> that<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.620> have

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
use something also on here that I have

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.449 
use something also on here that I have
is<00:04:18.280> something<00:04:18.940> called<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.329> UV<00:04:19.810> filter<00:04:20.459> this

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
is something called a UV filter this

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.250 
is something called a UV filter this
filter<00:04:21.750> takes<00:04:22.750> out<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.110> bright<00:04:23.349> rays<00:04:23.650> and

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
filter takes out the bright rays and

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.350 
filter takes out the bright rays and
it's<00:04:26.260> great<00:04:26.650> alright<00:04:27.250> it's<00:04:27.430> just<00:04:27.490> if<00:04:28.180> you're

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
it's great alright it's just if you're

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.300 
it's great alright it's just if you're
shooting<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:28.810> picture<00:04:29.110> right<00:04:29.500> next<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.070> Sun

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
shooting a picture right next to the Sun

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.460 
shooting a picture right next to the Sun
and<00:04:30.580> it's<00:04:30.760> really<00:04:31.090> bright<00:04:31.450> it's<00:04:32.080> gonna<00:04:32.289> just

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
and it's really bright it's gonna just

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.700 
and it's really bright it's gonna just
blur<00:04:32.860> out<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.070> whole<00:04:33.400> thing<00:04:33.640> but<00:04:34.419> with<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.870> UV

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
blur out the whole thing but with the UV

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.850 
blur out the whole thing but with the UV
filter<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:36.490> won't<00:04:36.789> blur<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.240> out<00:04:37.330> as<00:04:37.510> much<00:04:37.860> uh

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
filter it won't blur it out as much uh

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.670 
filter it won't blur it out as much uh
this<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.520> a<00:04:39.550> great<00:04:39.880> camera<00:04:40.240> for<00:04:40.900> beginners<00:04:41.380> to
