00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.930
 the edges here the edges here the 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:11.290
 surgeon is the one who takes the most tweezers and 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.930
 imagine if you look after him like that 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.299
 here you can put the tweezers 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.480
 gauze or can hide them 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.460
 compresses and gauze 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.789
 and after a while this falls 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.359
 yes that's the reason this is the way 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.169
 correct place or whether the 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.690
 edges or folds are towards the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.750
 second help the first assistant and the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.230
 surgeon yes 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.230
 yes 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.210
 if the doctor is the folds here 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.760
 they will not be bothering us or going to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.960
 to be able to answer the instrumental 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.960
 since it's fixed 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.100
 we close the surgical whistle 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.280
 and again the currency has to 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.280
 place the buckets behind the singular 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.620
 you have to go from here to where 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.180
 giving them abdomen we're going to start another one 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.780
 Surgery 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.780
 what do you have to do 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.870
 and here we are talking about what 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.870
 and surgery 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.750
 doctor where are you going to look for her here 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.480
 are all my buts 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.780
 so avoid it because we're not going to spend anything 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.780
 plus 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:10.709
 that yes decided to implement what I 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:16.080
 instrumentalist I will take it and without 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:19.460
 I'll clean it up here below 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.460
 second scalpel 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.280
 remember the end of the stays and manu 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.810
 clear and what does not leave here I 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.610
 instrumentalist all the instrumental that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.709
 let him here I have to take it clean 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.920
 perfectly close in your case a 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:46.550
 clamp and placing back the second 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:50.390
 scalpel does not lower then the first one yes 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.910
 then I the instrumentalist and so nothing 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.220
 more I'm going to clean it up do not do this 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.740
 come many times I will do this 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.830
 a few slices of fingers have been spoken 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.830
 that really then over nothing 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.130
 plus 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:11.650
 do not start to give the fight look anything else 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.550
 a clean little ones what was cleaned it 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.550
 he cleaned what he did not 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.040
 this house that is wet here 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.870
 there is a bleeding blood vessel 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.430
 do not 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.640
 free up 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.129
 true yes but it will also give 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.879
 another pilot because there is also another glass 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.879
 bleeding 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.130
 In his mind 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.280
 do not 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:12.819
 yes doctor has to be located well in 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:15.909
 that's because the surgery room 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.989
 look at the glories of an arsonist 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.989
 who thinks it is 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.470
 extreme 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.420
 do not tell me 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.660
 I 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:42.289
 look if the human being is the prize 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.909
 and the lousy first assistant 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.620
 they insume it says the one that has to enter 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.370
 to remove 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.860
 but if there is an instrumentalist way 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.030
 then stand the bag room 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.030
 when I took her out of the room 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.680
 she is a collaborator of her restaurant 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.380
 without the trails 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.430
 the surgeon you do not know why 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.540
 Instrument tip with the thumb of the 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.380
 surgeon 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.860
 so easy for them to locate themselves but 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:27.460
 It's also free, that's why I'm telling you this 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.460
 way to give the pegs of equal 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.570
 and give him the clamp 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.540
 I do not have to change the form at all 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.510
 that I take the clamp 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.249
 ok then here they have already taken a glass 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.589
 bleeding already supports it they put it here 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:47.589
 how it gives you free culture 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.870
 and how they should take them as they 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.870
 he gives them first 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.889
 here is all of quick decisions and 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.610
 good decisions do not 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:15.470
 no the future room has to stay here 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.800
 good attention 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.650
 now you do not have to put here not 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.200
 is the need to take up here itself 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.360
 but attention as the truth take them 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.360
 not in the form of a claw 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:36.460
 way of telling is in the form of a claw 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.550
 If I were to take it away, I would do this 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.610
 I'm not doing this, it's in the form of 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.060
 claw if I to her to feel the pressure 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.500
 of my hand and already light red and no longer the 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.190
 cut or nothing 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.880
 that's why the fingers 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:57.240
 Yes Yes 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:01.310
 maybe you have to put it for one 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.310
 for another, they must take it
