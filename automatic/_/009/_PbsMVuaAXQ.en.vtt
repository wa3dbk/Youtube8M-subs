00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.470 
been wearing them for about a week or so
along<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> sides<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.180> does<00:00:48.450> have

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
along the sides here it does have

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.049 
along the sides here it does have
locking<00:00:49.350> buttons<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.460> position<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
locking buttons so you can position the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720

headband<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.719> certain<00:00:52.140> way<00:00:52.320> although<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.460> feel

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
headband a certain way although I feel

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
headband a certain way although I feel
it's<00:00:53.910> easier<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.110> pull

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it's easier if you actually just pull

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.350 
it's easier if you actually just pull
the<00:00:55.739> headphones<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.430> where<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.940> need<00:00:57.149> them<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the headphones to where you need them to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.080 
the headphones to where you need them to
be<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.500> those<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:58.800> pretty<00:00:58.980> useless<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.430> me<00:00:59.760> on

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
be so those are pretty useless for me on

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.119 
be so those are pretty useless for me on
the<00:01:00.329> outside<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> earphones<00:01:01.289> you've<00:01:01.949> just

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you can take a look and just see what

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.569 
you can take a look and just see what
you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.869> expect<00:01:52.380> from<00:01:52.890> these<00:01:53.070> headphones

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
you can expect from these headphones

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.480 
you can expect from these headphones
here<00:01:54.000> I'm<00:01:54.540> definitely<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:55.020> an<00:01:55.200> audiophile<00:01:55.799> so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
here I'm definitely not an audiophile so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.950 
here I'm definitely not an audiophile so
it's<00:01:56.640> best<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.360> look<00:01:57.540> at<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it's best for you to just look at the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.230 
it's best for you to just look at the
stats<00:01:58.799> yourself<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> screen<00:01:59.729> as<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.060> comes

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
stats yourself on the screen as it comes

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.840 
stats yourself on the screen as it comes
straight<00:02:00.420> from<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> manufacturer<00:02:01.759> now<00:02:02.759> as

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
straight from the manufacturer now as

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.179 
straight from the manufacturer now as
far<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.060> how<00:02:03.240> these<00:02:03.390> headphones<00:02:03.930> sound<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.619> will

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
far as how these headphones sound I will

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.650 
far as how these headphones sound I will
say<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.549> they<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:05.700> pretty<00:02:06.149> well<00:02:06.840> rounded

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
say that they are pretty well rounded

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.300 
say that they are pretty well rounded
there<00:02:09.080> was<00:02:09.170> nothing<00:02:09.440> really<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.890> stood<00:02:10.250> out

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
there was nothing really that stood out

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.440 
there was nothing really that stood out
to<00:02:10.460> me<00:02:10.870> the<00:02:11.870> highs<00:02:12.080> were<00:02:12.380> not<00:02:12.590> ear-piercing

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
to me the highs were not ear-piercing

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.150 
to me the highs were not ear-piercing
the<00:02:14.450> lows<00:02:14.810> were<00:02:15.050> not<00:02:15.290> overwhelming

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the lows were not overwhelming

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.500 
the lows were not overwhelming
everything<00:02:16.760> just<00:02:16.940> seemed<00:02:17.240> pretty

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
everything just seemed pretty

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.110 
everything just seemed pretty
well-rounded<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.640> they<00:02:19.640> kind<00:02:19.850> of<00:02:19.880> meshed

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
well-rounded and they kind of meshed

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.360 
well-rounded and they kind of meshed
together<00:02:20.240> nicely<00:02:20.750> now<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.470> did<00:02:21.710> think<00:02:21.920> overall

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
together nicely now I did think overall

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.130 
together nicely now I did think overall
considering<00:02:23.150> these<00:02:23.240> are<00:02:23.420> 50<00:02:23.750> millimeter

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
considering these are 50 millimeter

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.470 
considering these are 50 millimeter
drivers<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.040> bass<00:02:25.250> was<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.880> little<00:02:26.330> bit

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
drivers that the bass was a little bit

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.080 
drivers that the bass was a little bit
underwhelming<00:02:27.290> at<00:02:27.470> first<00:02:27.740> however<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:28.790> did

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
underwhelming at first however I did

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.750 
underwhelming at first however I did
actually<00:02:29.240> get<00:02:29.570> better<00:02:29.990> results<00:02:30.710> when<00:02:31.130> using

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
actually get better results when using

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.150 
actually get better results when using
these<00:02:32.120> headphones<00:02:32.600> with<00:02:32.840> my<00:02:33.020> smartphone<00:02:33.500> the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
these headphones with my smartphone the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.530 
these headphones with my smartphone the
reason<00:02:34.400> why<00:02:34.520> though<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.940> because<00:02:35.300> that

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
reason why though is because that

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.340 
reason why though is because that
actually<00:02:36.080> has<00:02:36.260> an<00:02:36.640> EQ<00:02:37.640> on<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.420> adjusts

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
actually has an EQ on it that adjusts

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.840 
actually has an EQ on it that adjusts
the<00:02:39.410> levels<00:02:39.830> so<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.130> they<00:02:40.370> sound<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.730> little

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
the levels so that they sound a little

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.750 
the levels so that they sound a little
bit<00:02:41.090> better<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.780> actually<00:02:42.320> also<00:02:42.680> used<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.459> my

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
bit better I actually also used it on my

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.820 
bit better I actually also used it on my
smartphone<00:02:44.090> with<00:02:44.390> Beats<00:02:44.630> Audio<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.590> think

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
smartphone with Beats Audio and I think

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.229 
smartphone with Beats Audio and I think
it<00:02:45.920> actually<00:02:46.220> sounded<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.700> best<00:02:46.940> in

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
it actually sounded the best in

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.660 
it actually sounded the best in
combination<00:02:47.900> with<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.130> overall<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.459> was<00:02:49.640> a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
combination with that overall it was a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.060 
combination with that overall it was a
lot<00:02:49.940> louder<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:51.230> really<00:02:51.440> allowed<00:02:51.770> the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
lot louder and it really allowed the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.120 
lot louder and it really allowed the
lows<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:53.060> shine<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.750> then<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.200> highs<00:02:54.470> were

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
lows to shine and then the highs were

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.729 
lows to shine and then the highs were
also<00:02:55.550> louder<00:02:56.270> as<00:02:56.480> well<00:02:56.750> however<00:02:57.470> if<00:02:57.590> you're

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
also louder as well however if you're

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.350 
also louder as well however if you're
not<00:02:57.770> into<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.790> really<00:02:58.970> don't<00:02:59.209> like

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
not into that and you really don't like

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.690 
not into that and you really don't like
an<00:02:59.540> EQ<00:02:59.900> messing<00:03:00.770> with<00:03:00.800> your<00:03:01.070> music<00:03:01.430> at<00:03:01.550> all

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
an EQ messing with your music at all

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.910 
an EQ messing with your music at all
then<00:03:02.270> they<00:03:02.390> still<00:03:02.630> do<00:03:02.870> sound<00:03:03.140> pretty<00:03:03.260> solid

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
then they still do sound pretty solid

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.850 
then they still do sound pretty solid
without<00:03:04.640> anything<00:03:05.239> like<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.690> but<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.680> does

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
without anything like that but it does

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.080 
without anything like that but it does
make<00:03:07.040> me<00:03:07.220> think<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.550> these<00:03:07.850> headphones

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
make me think that these headphones

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.690 
make me think that these headphones
really<00:03:08.660> would<00:03:08.900> shine<00:03:09.290> if<00:03:09.640> they<00:03:10.640> were

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
really would shine if they were

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.300 
really would shine if they were
connected<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.390> headphone<00:03:11.660> amp<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.680> really

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
connected to a headphone amp I really

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.920 
connected to a headphone amp I really
think<00:03:13.519> they<00:03:13.610> need<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:13.970> little<00:03:14.180> bit<00:03:14.390> more<00:03:14.600> juice

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
think they need a little bit more juice

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.900 
think they need a little bit more juice
than<00:03:14.989> what<00:03:15.440> I'm<00:03:15.530> giving<00:03:15.860> them<00:03:16.010> coming<00:03:16.700> out<00:03:16.790> of

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
than what I'm giving them coming out of

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.380 
than what I'm giving them coming out of
my<00:03:17.060> PC<00:03:17.600> or<00:03:17.870> my<00:03:18.110> smartphone<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:19.120> once<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:20.239> get

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
my PC or my smartphone and once you get

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.880 
my PC or my smartphone and once you get
it<00:03:20.540> connected<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.019> one<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.290> those<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:21.440> really

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
it connected to one of those I really

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.289 
it connected to one of those I really
think<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.280> where<00:03:22.489> these<00:03:22.640> headphones<00:03:22.880> will

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
think is where these headphones will

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.940 
think is where these headphones will
shine<00:03:23.600> now<00:03:24.080> one<00:03:24.230> thing<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.470> actually<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.769> did

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
shine now one thing I actually I did

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.830 
shine now one thing I actually I did
forget<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.250> mention<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.390> headphones

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
forget to mention is that the headphones

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.500 
forget to mention is that the headphones
are<00:03:27.110> semi-open<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.880> does<00:03:29.030> leak<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.390> little

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
are semi-open so it does leak a little

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.449 
are semi-open so it does leak a little
bit<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.870> sound<00:03:30.170> when<00:03:30.769> you<00:03:30.860> do<00:03:30.980> have<00:03:31.160> them<00:03:31.310> at

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
bit of sound when you do have them at

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.949 
bit of sound when you do have them at
full<00:03:31.670> volume<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.540> would<00:03:32.690> just<00:03:32.840> be

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
full volume so that would just be

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.270 
full volume so that would just be
another<00:03:33.470> thing<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.830> you'd<00:03:33.950> want<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.160> be

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280
