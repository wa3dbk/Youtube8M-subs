exactly<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.960> same<00:01:31.189> I'm<00:01:32.189> gonna<00:01:32.479> stack<00:01:33.479> them<00:01:33.720> in

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
exactly the same I'm gonna stack them in

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
exactly the same I'm gonna stack them in
Photoshop<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.560> horizontals<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.549> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
Photoshop to horizontals like this so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.429 
Photoshop to horizontals like this so
you<00:01:35.759> got<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.390> horizontals<00:01:36.960> they're<00:01:37.320> gonna

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you got one to horizontals they're gonna

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
you got one to horizontals they're gonna
overlap<00:01:37.860> by<00:01:38.100> about<00:01:38.250> 20<00:01:38.610> percent<00:01:38.640> they're

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
overlap by about 20 percent they're

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.690 
overlap by about 20 percent they're
gonna<00:01:39.600> perfectly<00:01:40.200> line<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.250> they

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
gonna perfectly line up and then they

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.010 
gonna perfectly line up and then they
just<00:01:41.850> drop<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> two<00:01:42.299> layers<00:01:42.479> together<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
just drop the two layers together and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.440 
just drop the two layers together and
because<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.710> gonna<00:01:43.799> use<00:01:43.890> filters<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.820> will

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
because I'm gonna use filters I will

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.499 
because I'm gonna use filters I will
have<00:01:45.630> exact<00:01:46.200> same<00:01:46.409> exposure<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.100> both<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.579> no

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
have exact same exposure for both and no

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.149 
have exact same exposure for both and no
mess<00:01:48.780> no<00:01:49.500> messing<00:01:49.799> around

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
mess no messing around

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.060 
mess no messing around
so<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.399> filters<00:01:50.729> am<00:01:50.880> i<00:01:50.970> using<00:01:51.149> well<00:01:52.070> I've

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
so what filters am i using well I've

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.389 
so what filters am i using well I've
gotta<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> two-stop<00:01:54.439> hard-edged<00:01:55.439> sing

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
gotta have a two-stop hard-edged sing

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.539 
gotta have a two-stop hard-edged sing

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
ray grad the dark in that sky I need

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.209 
ray grad the dark in that sky I need
that<00:01:59.670> sky<00:01:59.909> darken<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.600> foreground<00:02:01.500> light<00:02:01.890> so

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
that sky darken and foreground light so

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.620 
that sky darken and foreground light so
the<00:02:02.340> foreground<00:02:02.670> comes<00:02:02.969> through<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> clear

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the foreground comes through the clear

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.059 
the foreground comes through the clear
part<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:05.040> sky<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.479> under

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
part and the sky is going to be under

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.339 
part and the sky is going to be under
exposed<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.310> bit<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> show<00:02:10.229> up

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
exposed a bit and it's going to show up

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.420 
exposed a bit and it's going to show up
darker<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> even<00:02:11.250> out

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
darker so it's going to even out

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.640 
darker so it's going to even out
exposure<00:02:11.819> I've<00:02:12.360> also<00:02:12.569> got<00:02:12.930> a

what I'm gonna do is photograph the
scene<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.909> way<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.599> can<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:39.870> I've<00:02:39.989> got

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
scene this way and you can see I've got

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.289 
scene this way and you can see I've got
a<00:02:40.200> bubble<00:02:40.500> level<00:02:40.769> on<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.819> can<00:02:42.030> level

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
a bubble level on here and I can level

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.470 
a bubble level on here and I can level
the<00:02:42.390> scene<00:02:42.629> and<00:02:42.900> then<00:02:43.439> I'll<00:02:43.939> take<00:02:44.939> an<00:02:45.060> exposure

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the scene and then I'll take an exposure

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.270 
the scene and then I'll take an exposure
with<00:02:45.690> my<00:02:45.840> tilt<00:02:46.079> shift<00:02:46.139> lens<00:02:46.379> in<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:46.920> center

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
with my tilt shift lens in the center

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.250 
with my tilt shift lens in the center
adjust<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.030> filter<00:02:48.269> exactly<00:02:48.840> where<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.019> need

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
adjust the filter exactly where I need

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.879 
adjust the filter exactly where I need
it<00:02:49.409> and<00:02:49.730> then<00:02:50.730> determine<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.209> exposure<00:02:51.889> set

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
it and then determine the exposure set

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.009 
it and then determine the exposure set
my<00:02:53.129> camera<00:02:53.190> on<00:02:53.549> manual<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.150> take<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:54.810> same

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
my camera on manual and take the same

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.039 
my camera on manual and take the same
exposure<00:02:55.889> with<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.250> shift<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.909> the<00:02:57.420> lens<00:02:57.720> up

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
exposure with the shift of the lens up

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.110 
exposure with the shift of the lens up
and<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.920> filter<00:02:59.189> actually<00:02:59.340> stays<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.700> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
and the filter actually stays in the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.970 
and the filter actually stays in the
correct<00:03:00.359> place<00:03:00.599> and<00:03:00.900> then<00:03:01.470> do<00:03:01.950> another

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
correct place and then do another

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.000 
correct place and then do another
exposure<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.030> shift<00:03:03.599> down<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.379> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
exposure with the shift down and the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.520 
exposure with the shift down and the
filter<00:03:05.340> stays<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.879> roughly<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:06.530> exactly

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
filter stays and roughly this exactly

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.770 
filter stays and roughly this exactly
we're<00:03:07.680> supposed<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:07.980> be<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:09.269> seems

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
we're supposed to be it seems

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.000 
we're supposed to be it seems
counterintuitive<00:03:10.109> it<00:03:10.560> seems<00:03:10.739> like<00:03:10.859> it's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
counterintuitive it seems like it's

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.000 
counterintuitive it seems like it's
dropping<00:03:11.189> and<00:03:11.689> rising<00:03:12.689> but<00:03:13.260> actually<00:03:13.920> it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
dropping and rising but actually it

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.339 
dropping and rising but actually it
stays<00:03:14.189> on<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.400> horizon<00:03:14.790> line<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.200> it's<00:03:16.200> good

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
stays on the horizon line and it's good

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.379 
stays on the horizon line and it's good
to<00:03:16.439> go<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:16.799> I'll<00:03:16.950> demonstrate<00:03:17.129> that<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.639> camera

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
to go so I'll demonstrate that in camera

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.379 
to go so I'll demonstrate that in camera
in<00:03:18.959> just<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.410> second<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:20.010> hang<00:03:20.549> on<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.060> look<00:03:21.269> out

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
in just a second so hang on and look out

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.770 
in just a second so hang on and look out
for<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.629> bugs<00:03:23.060> all<00:03:24.060> right<00:03:24.269> we<00:03:24.359> got<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.540> hurry

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
for the bugs all right we got a hurry

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.869 
for the bugs all right we got a hurry
because<00:03:25.109> we're<00:03:25.319> losing<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.400> little<00:03:26.549> bit<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
because we're losing a little bit of the

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.970 
because we're losing a little bit of the
color<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.329> sky<00:03:27.540> we've<00:03:28.139> set<00:03:28.379> up<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.650> rebel

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
color in the sky we've set up the rebel

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.069 
color in the sky we've set up the rebel
with<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.430> 24<00:03:29.940> tilt<00:03:30.180> shift<00:03:30.239> on<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:30.870> we're

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
with the 24 tilt shift on and we're

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.409 
with the 24 tilt shift on and we're
gonna<00:03:31.169> do<00:03:31.319> that<00:03:31.440> trick<00:03:31.709> where<00:03:31.889> we<00:03:32.180> shift<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
gonna do that trick where we shift the

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.629 
gonna do that trick where we shift the
lens<00:03:33.599> down<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.230> then<00:03:34.620> shift<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.129> lens<00:03:35.310> up<00:03:35.489> hi

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
lens down and then shift the lens up hi

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.140 
lens down and then shift the lens up hi
have<00:03:36.180> two<00:03:36.799> horizontal<00:03:37.799> images<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.819> they're

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
have two horizontal images and they're

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.659 
have two horizontal images and they're
gonna<00:03:39.239> be<00:03:39.389> stacked<00:03:39.859> to<00:03:40.859> make<00:03:41.010> one<00:03:41.220> big

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
gonna be stacked to make one big

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.339 
gonna be stacked to make one big
vertical<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.389> so<00:03:42.780> I'll<00:03:42.900> show<00:03:43.049> you<00:03:43.109> how<00:03:43.169> to<00:03:43.260> do

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
vertical and so I'll show you how to do

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.360 
vertical and so I'll show you how to do
that<00:03:43.470> in<00:03:43.650> camera

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
that in camera

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.460 
that in camera
first<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.060> all<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.449> again<00:03:45.810> remind<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.349> of

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
first of all just again remind you of

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.680 
first of all just again remind you of
the<00:03:46.560> scene<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.069> we're<00:03:48.060> gonna<00:03:48.150> try<00:03:48.419> to<00:03:48.479> hurry

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
the scene and we're gonna try to hurry

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.059 
the scene and we're gonna try to hurry
because<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.989> bugs<00:03:49.139> are<00:03:49.290> driving<00:03:49.560> me<00:03:49.650> crazy

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
because the bugs are driving me crazy

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.640 
because the bugs are driving me crazy
the<00:03:50.489> winds<00:03:50.699> starting<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.090> pick<00:03:51.299> up<00:03:51.440> wind<00:03:52.440> is

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
the winds starting to pick up wind is

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.080 
the winds starting to pick up wind is
nice<00:03:52.859> though<00:03:53.129> because<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.400> takes<00:03:53.729> away<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
nice though because it takes away the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.119 
nice though because it takes away the
bugs<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.780> makes<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.079> grass<00:03:55.379> move<00:03:55.709> and

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
bugs and it makes this grass move and

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.619 
bugs and it makes this grass move and
the<00:03:56.370> nice<00:03:56.489> thing<00:03:56.669> about<00:03:56.699> the<00:03:56.970> moving<00:03:57.209> grass<00:03:57.419> is

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
the nice thing about the moving grass is

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.689 
the nice thing about the moving grass is
then<00:03:57.750> we<00:03:57.840> can<00:03:57.959> do<00:03:58.049> tricks<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.560> solid<00:03:59.400> ND

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
then we can do tricks like solid ND

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.300 
then we can do tricks like solid ND
filter<00:04:00.090> for<00:04:00.870> really<00:04:01.229> long<00:04:01.379> exposures<00:04:01.889> like<00:04:02.069> 30

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
filter for really long exposures like 30

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.250 
filter for really long exposures like 30
seconds<00:04:02.849> or<00:04:03.000> 1<00:04:03.359> minute<00:04:03.389> and<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:03.959> grass<00:04:04.229> will

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
seconds or 1 minute and this grass will

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.050 
seconds or 1 minute and this grass will
turn<00:04:04.650> into<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.889> sea<00:04:05.190> of<00:04:05.220> kind<00:04:05.609> of<00:04:05.699> painterly

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
turn into a sea of kind of painterly

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.000 
turn into a sea of kind of painterly
color<00:04:06.359> but<00:04:06.930> let's<00:04:07.139> just<00:04:07.319> work<00:04:07.739> on<00:04:07.859> the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
color but let's just work on the

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.509 
color but let's just work on the
straight<00:04:08.310> shot<00:04:08.970> for<00:04:09.900> now<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.919> will<00:04:11.220> bring

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
straight shot for now and I will bring

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.460 
straight shot for now and I will bring

a professional by the way and we have
the<00:04:22.919> grad<00:04:23.099> filter<00:04:23.279> and<00:04:23.639> we're<00:04:24.479> gonna<00:04:24.570> stick

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
the grad filter and we're gonna stick

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.940 
the grad filter and we're gonna stick
this<00:04:25.020> over<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.380> lens<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.710> we're<00:04:25.860> gonna

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
this over the lens and we're gonna

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.350 
this over the lens and we're gonna
darken<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.550> sky

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
darken the sky

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.460 
darken the sky
and<00:04:27.479> we're<00:04:27.599> gonna<00:04:27.720> let<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.080> foreground

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
and we're gonna let the foreground

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.350 
and we're gonna let the foreground
brighten<00:04:28.949> up<00:04:29.069> so<00:04:29.550> I'll<00:04:29.819> show<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.060> how<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.210> do

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
brighten up so I'll show you how to do

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.640 
brighten up so I'll show you how to do
that<00:04:30.539> and<00:04:30.840> then<00:04:30.960> we'll<00:04:31.110> do<00:04:31.259> that

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
that and then we'll do that

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.170 
that and then we'll do that
shifting<00:04:32.220> up<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.490> down<00:04:32.610> with<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:32.909> tilt<00:04:33.120> shift

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
shifting up and down with the tilt shift

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.719 
shifting up and down with the tilt shift
lens<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:33.840> we'll<00:04:34.710> make<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.889> picture<00:04:35.159> and<00:04:35.550> we'll

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
lens and we'll make a picture and we'll

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.399 
lens and we'll make a picture and we'll
see<00:04:35.849> the<00:04:35.969> end<00:04:36.000> results<00:04:36.419> okay<00:04:36.629> so<00:04:36.689> let's<00:04:37.349> do<00:04:37.530> it

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
see the end results okay so let's do it

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.800 
see the end results okay so let's do it
all<00:04:40.409> right<00:04:40.650> let's<00:04:41.400> throw<00:04:42.090> this<00:04:42.270> grad<00:04:42.599> filter

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
all right let's throw this grad filter

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.899 
all right let's throw this grad filter
in<00:04:43.080> it's<00:04:43.469> now<00:04:43.680> full<00:04:44.009> of<00:04:44.039> fingerprints

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
in it's now full of fingerprints

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.520 
in it's now full of fingerprints
which<00:04:45.180> again<00:04:45.629> I<00:04:45.689> don't<00:04:45.840> recommend<00:04:46.199> you<00:04:46.409> do

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
which again I don't recommend you do

which again I don't recommend you do
this<00:04:46.620> at<00:04:46.800> home<00:04:46.830> there's<00:04:47.699> those<00:04:47.849> fingerprints

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
this at home there's those fingerprints

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.580 
this at home there's those fingerprints
oh<00:04:48.629> my<00:04:48.960> goodness

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590

oh my goodness
so<00:04:50.479> we're<00:04:51.479> gonna<00:04:51.629> drop<00:04:51.930> this<00:04:52.139> down<00:04:52.439> and<00:04:53.159> let's

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
so we're gonna drop this down and let's

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.339 
so we're gonna drop this down and let's
focus<00:04:53.909> that<00:04:54.060> lens<00:04:54.300> first<00:04:54.569> oh<00:04:54.870> there<00:04:55.199> that's

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
focus that lens first oh there that's

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.860 
focus that lens first oh there that's
much<00:04:55.620> nicer<00:04:56.009> I<00:04:56.219> always<00:04:57.090> recommend<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.689> you

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
know now notice that the grad filter

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.649 
know now notice that the grad filter
really<00:05:07.259> does<00:05:07.710> darken<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.430> sky<00:05:08.669> now<00:05:09.419> we<00:05:09.479> can

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
really does darken the sky now we can

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.450 
really does darken the sky now we can
take<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:10.050> go<00:05:10.229> too<00:05:10.289> far<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:10.979> you<00:05:11.129> see<00:05:11.340> when

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
take it and go too far and you see when

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.330 
take it and go too far and you see when
we<00:05:11.550> go<00:05:11.669> too<00:05:11.729> far<00:05:11.879> that<00:05:12.560> we<00:05:13.560> actually<00:05:13.740> over

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
we go too far that we actually over

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.159 
we go too far that we actually over
darken<00:05:14.729> those<00:05:14.879> hills<00:05:15.180> in<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.419> background<00:05:15.840> and

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
darken those hills in the background and

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.439 
darken those hills in the background and
if<00:05:16.289> we<00:05:16.349> go<00:05:16.469> too<00:05:16.530> high<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:17.759> doesn't<00:05:18.120> quite<00:05:18.270> work

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
if we go too high it doesn't quite work

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.519 
if we go too high it doesn't quite work
so<00:05:18.509> what<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:18.900> want<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.050> do<00:05:19.139> is<00:05:19.259> get<00:05:19.409> that

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
exactly the transition of the the grad

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.579 
exactly the transition of the the grad
filter<00:05:43.500> much<00:05:43.940> more<00:05:44.940> distinct<00:05:45.389> it's<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:46.080> larger

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:46.589 
filter much more distinct it's a larger

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:49.760 
filter much more distinct it's a larger
the<00:05:46.740> aperture<00:05:47.099> number<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:48.240> more<00:05:48.539> the<00:05:49.440> harder

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
the aperture number the more the harder

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.740 
the aperture number the more the harder
the<00:05:49.979> the<00:05:50.250> grad<00:05:50.430> filter<00:05:50.610> will<00:05:50.909> be<00:05:50.940> so<00:05:51.300> I<00:05:51.330> would

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
the the grad filter will be so I would

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.240 
the the grad filter will be so I would
actually<00:05:52.349> push<00:05:52.500> in<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:52.770> depth<00:05:52.949> of<00:05:53.039> field

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
actually push in the depth of field

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.459 
actually push in the depth of field
button<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.729> wiggle<00:05:54.449> it<00:05:54.539> a<00:05:54.599> bit<00:05:54.779> and<00:05:54.990> adjust<00:05:55.349> it

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
button and wiggle it a bit and adjust it

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.170 
button and wiggle it a bit and adjust it
like<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:55.889> so<00:05:56.430> that<00:05:56.520> looks<00:05:56.669> really<00:05:56.729> good<00:05:56.969> now

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
like so so that looks really good now

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.619 
like so so that looks really good now
all<00:05:57.479> we<00:05:57.569> have<00:05:57.719> to<00:05:57.750> do<00:05:58.279> wait<00:05:59.539> checking<00:06:00.539> to<00:06:00.569> make

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
all we have to do wait checking to make

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.390 
all we have to do wait checking to make
sure<00:06:00.779> that<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.229> lights<00:06:01.409> still<00:06:01.620> good<00:06:01.830> yep

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
sure that the lights still good yep

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.490 
sure that the lights still good yep
what<00:06:02.969> we<00:06:03.029> got<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.240> do<00:06:03.330> now<00:06:03.509> is<00:06:03.779> shift<00:06:04.139> the<00:06:04.349> lens

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
what we got to do now is shift the lens

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.749 
what we got to do now is shift the lens
up<00:06:04.680> and<00:06:04.830> down<00:06:04.979> on<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:06.409> small<00:06:07.409> sensor<00:06:08.400> camera

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
up and down on a small sensor camera

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.999 
up and down on a small sensor camera
like<00:06:08.909> this<00:06:09.029> rebel<00:06:09.270> watch<00:06:10.139> how<00:06:10.379> far<00:06:10.620> we<00:06:10.860> can

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
like this rebel watch how far we can

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.939 
like this rebel watch how far we can
shift<00:06:11.250> this<00:06:11.810> tilt<00:06:12.810> shift<00:06:12.870> lens<00:06:13.169> we<00:06:13.560> can<00:06:13.740> go

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
shift this tilt shift lens we can go

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.459 
shift this tilt shift lens we can go
watch<00:06:14.819> this<00:06:15.150> this<00:06:15.479> is<00:06:15.659> the<00:06:15.779> center<00:06:16.080> position

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
watch this this is the center position

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.689 
watch this this is the center position
remember<00:06:16.949> first<00:06:17.370> of<00:06:17.490> all<00:06:17.639> take<00:06:17.849> your<00:06:19.699> base

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
remember first of all take your base

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.100 
remember first of all take your base
exposure<00:06:21.210> here<00:06:21.539> figure<00:06:21.750> out<00:06:21.870> your<00:06:21.960> base

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
exposure here figure out your base

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.610 
exposure here figure out your base
exposure<00:06:22.529> here<00:06:22.969> in<00:06:23.969> this<00:06:24.180> case<00:06:24.389> I'm<00:06:25.289> getting<00:06:25.409> a

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
exposure here in this case I'm getting a

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.050 
exposure here in this case I'm getting a
reading<00:06:25.830> at<00:06:26.819> 2<00:06:27.240> f11<00:06:28.020> of<00:06:28.400> one<00:06:29.400> second<00:06:29.819> already

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
reading at 2 f11 of one second already

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.749 
reading at 2 f11 of one second already
because<00:06:30.240> it's<00:06:30.389> getting<00:06:30.539> kind<00:06:31.050> of<00:06:31.080> dark<00:06:31.289> and

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
because it's getting kind of dark and

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.029 
because it's getting kind of dark and
then<00:06:32.759> I<00:06:32.789> would<00:06:32.969> set<00:06:33.120> my<00:06:33.210> camera<00:06:33.800> manually<00:06:34.800> one

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
then I would set my camera manually one

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.029 
then I would set my camera manually one
second<00:06:35.459> at<00:06:35.550> f/11<00:06:35.759> and<00:06:36.180> then<00:06:36.839> I<00:06:37.050> would<00:06:37.289> make<00:06:37.469> an

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
second at f/11 and then I would make an

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.639 
second at f/11 and then I would make an
exposure<00:06:38.870> for<00:06:39.870> the<00:06:39.990> bottom<00:06:40.289> part<00:06:40.529> of<00:06:40.560> the

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:40.649 
exposure for the bottom part of the

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:41.180 
exposure for the bottom part of the
frame

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
frame

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.580 
frame
so<00:06:41.310> far<00:06:41.490> we<00:06:41.580> can<00:06:41.700> go<00:06:41.760> down<00:06:42.050> holy<00:06:43.050> moly<00:06:43.470> that's

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
so far we can go down holy moly that's

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.370 
so far we can go down holy moly that's
pretty<00:06:44.430> amazing<00:06:44.700> and<00:06:45.210> watch<00:06:45.810> how<00:06:45.960> far<00:06:46.140> we<00:06:46.290> can

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
pretty amazing and watch how far we can

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.590 
pretty amazing and watch how far we can
go<00:06:46.500> up<00:06:47.690> like<00:06:48.690> we<00:06:48.930> can<00:06:49.260> take<00:06:49.470> in<00:06:49.800> a<00:06:50.010> whole<00:06:50.760> lot<00:06:51.450> of

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
go up like we can take in a whole lot of

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.480 
go up like we can take in a whole lot of
sky<00:06:52.140> actually<00:06:52.380> you'd<00:06:52.650> need<00:06:52.830> three<00:06:53.070> shots<00:06:53.340> to

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
sky actually you'd need three shots to

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.790 
sky actually you'd need three shots to
get<00:06:53.640> this<00:06:53.730> all<00:06:53.910> in<00:06:53.940> one<00:06:54.240> there<00:06:54.560> one<00:06:55.560> in<00:06:55.710> the

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
get this all in one there one in the
