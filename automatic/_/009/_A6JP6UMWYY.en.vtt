 I also told you the feeling that I 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.770
 when the Benedictine was born and I 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.450
 I was very scared to have a wife. 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.270
 I thought I was just supposed to have a son, man. 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.810
 I wanted to know how to deal with something. 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 I thought that too and the way you 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.270
 it's a friendship and a complicity 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.310
 is a thing among women 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.890
