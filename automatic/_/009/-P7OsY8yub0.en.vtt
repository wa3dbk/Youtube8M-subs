show you our new pipettes these are some
very<00:00:33.460> very<00:00:33.850> tiny<00:00:34.270> pipettes<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:41.050> see<00:00:41.260> how<00:00:41.469> much

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
very very tiny pipettes to see how much

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.270 
very very tiny pipettes to see how much
she<00:00:41.980> loves<00:00:42.580> them

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
she loves them

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.980 
she loves them
they're<00:00:45.280> a<00:00:45.310> lot<00:00:45.520> smaller<00:00:46.030> than<00:00:46.240> the<00:00:46.540> pipe<00:00:46.780> that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
they're a lot smaller than the pipe that

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.280 
they're a lot smaller than the pipe that
I<00:00:47.020> was<00:00:47.290> using<00:00:47.560> in<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:47.830> last<00:00:48.100> video<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.960> hold

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
I was using in the last video they hold

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:08.780 
I was using in the last video they hold
about<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:55.120> milliliter<00:00:55.630> or<00:00:56.290> one<00:00:57.070> cc<00:00:57.700> of<00:00:57.780> fluid

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.120 

and<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.690> tip<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.560> them<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.980> very<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:12.180> tiny

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.340 

and<00:01:17.130> I've<00:01:17.790> noticed<00:01:18.060> since<00:01:18.720> I've<00:01:18.930> been<00:01:19.080> using

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and I've noticed since I've been using

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:29.120 
and I've noticed since I've been using
these<00:01:20.010> pipettes<00:01:20.700> she<00:01:21.030> eats<00:01:21.330> better<00:01:27.950> she<00:01:28.950> can

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
these pipettes she eats better she can

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.690 
these pipettes she eats better she can
get<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.570> very<00:01:30.570> end<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> pipe<00:01:31.980> out<00:01:32.190> way

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
get that very end of the pipe out way

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.480 
get that very end of the pipe out way
back<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.600> her<00:01:34.140> mouth<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> there's<00:01:37.950> less<00:01:38.130> chance

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
back in her mouth so there's less chance

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.710 
back in her mouth so there's less chance
of<00:01:38.700> choking<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.390> aspiration<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:44.510> now<00:01:45.510> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
of choking or aspiration and now that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.020 
of choking or aspiration and now that
she's<00:01:45.990> four<00:01:46.380> weeks<00:01:46.620> old<00:01:49.220> her<00:01:50.220> intake<00:01:50.790> has

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
she's four weeks old her intake has

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
she's four weeks old her intake has
increased<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.990> she<00:01:52.200> takes<00:01:53.390> 12<00:01:54.390> cc's<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.680> milk

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
increased as she takes 12 cc's of milk

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.420 
increased as she takes 12 cc's of milk
at<00:01:57.360> every<00:01:58.350> feeding<00:02:00.260> which<00:02:01.260> is<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:02.130> over

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
at every feeding which is a little over

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.690 
at every feeding which is a little over
two<00:02:02.670> teaspoons<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:05.120> I<00:02:06.120> feed<00:02:06.420> her<00:02:07.250> every<00:02:08.250> four

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
two teaspoons and I feed her every four

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.990 
two teaspoons and I feed her every four
hours<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:10.250> don't<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.459> up<00:02:11.550> at<00:02:11.730> night<00:02:11.970> for

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
hours I don't get up at night for

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.050 
hours I don't get up at night for
anymore<00:02:12.900> she's<00:02:13.680> getting<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> big<00:02:14.340> girl

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.550 

and<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.050> she's<00:02:24.350> four<00:02:24.680> weeks<00:02:26.260> I've<00:02:27.260> taken

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
and now that she's four weeks I've taken

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.280 
and now that she's four weeks I've taken
her<00:02:27.800> out<00:02:28.069> of<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.880> kitten<00:02:29.270> box<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.900> she<00:02:32.930> has<00:02:33.260> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
her out of the kitten box so she has a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.430 
her out of the kitten box so she has a
little<00:02:33.500> more<00:02:33.650> room<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.069> run<00:02:34.670> around<00:02:35.440> although

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
little more room to run around although

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.520 
little more room to run around although
she<00:02:36.500> doesn't<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:37.069> much<00:02:37.250> running<00:02:37.730> yet

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
she doesn't do much running yet

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
she doesn't do much running yet
she<00:02:39.530> still<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:39.830> kind<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.370> eats<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.819> sleeps

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
she still just kind of eats and sleeps

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.520 
she still just kind of eats and sleeps
but<00:02:43.550> by<00:02:43.760> next<00:02:43.819> week<00:02:44.390> when<00:02:44.690> she's<00:02:44.930> five<00:02:45.230> weeks

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
but by next week when she's five weeks

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.590 
but by next week when she's five weeks
old<00:02:45.770> she'll<00:02:46.130> probably<00:02:46.430> be<00:02:46.910> drinking<00:02:47.360> water

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
old she'll probably be drinking water

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.020 
old she'll probably be drinking water
out<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.860> water<00:02:49.040> dish<00:02:49.370> by<00:02:49.610> herself<00:02:52.030> and

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
out of the water dish by herself and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:08.020 
out of the water dish by herself and
maybe<00:02:53.590> experimenting<00:02:54.820> with<00:02:55.820> some<00:02:56.000> solid<00:02:56.540> food

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.300 

and<00:03:08.600> she<00:03:08.780> takes<00:03:09.020> about<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.500> teaspoon<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:12.310> then

and she takes about a teaspoon and then
what's<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.730> little<00:03:13.970> break<00:03:14.210> maybe<00:03:14.630> take<00:03:14.930> a

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
what's a little break maybe take a

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.260 
what's a little break maybe take a
little<00:03:15.230> nap<00:03:15.440> for<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.130> few<00:03:16.310> minutes<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:19.270> then

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
little nap for a few minutes and then

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.850 
little nap for a few minutes and then
she'll<00:03:20.510> finish<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.050> rest<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.440> her<00:03:21.650> milk<00:03:23.830> but<00:03:24.830> I

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
she'll finish the rest of her milk but I

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.140 
she'll finish the rest of her milk but I
wanted<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.280> show<00:03:25.490> you<00:03:25.550> these<00:03:25.760> new<00:03:26.000> little

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
wanted to show you these new little

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.020 
wanted to show you these new little
pipettes

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
pipettes

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.800 
pipettes
because<00:03:29.030> they<00:03:29.180> are<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:29.810> neat<00:03:30.970> they're<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.300> so

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
because they are so neat they're so so

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.830 
because they are so neat they're so so
tiny<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.620> end<00:03:35.380> but<00:03:36.380> they'll<00:03:36.620> be<00:03:36.770> perfect

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
tiny on the end but they'll be perfect

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.300 
tiny on the end but they'll be perfect
for<00:03:38.840> newborn<00:03:39.350> kittens<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.840> would<00:03:42.080> say<00:03:42.350> up

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
for newborn kittens and I would say up

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.449 
for newborn kittens and I would say up
to<00:03:44.320> probably<00:03:45.320> two<00:03:45.650> weeks<00:03:45.890> old<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:49.190> have

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
to probably two weeks old and I have

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.760 
to probably two weeks old and I have
some<00:03:49.790> other<00:03:50.030> sizes<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.840> I'll<00:03:51.230> be<00:03:51.410> making

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
some other sizes that I'll be making

00:03:51.770 --> 00:04:00.420 
some other sizes that I'll be making
videos<00:03:53.320> coming<00:03:54.320> up<00:03:54.380> in<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.680> next<00:03:54.830> few<00:03:55.280> days

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.740 

this<00:04:01.430> is<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.760> pipette<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.239> was<00:04:02.510> using

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
this is the pipette I was using

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.479 
this is the pipette I was using
previously<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.720> if<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.620> compare<00:04:07.130> it<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.370> the

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
previously and if you compare it to the

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.009 
previously and if you compare it to the
new<00:04:07.700> one<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:10.640> can<00:04:10.700> see<00:04:11.000> how<00:04:11.150> much<00:04:11.300> smaller<00:04:11.570> the
