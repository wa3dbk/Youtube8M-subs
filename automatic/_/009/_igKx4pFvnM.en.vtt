topic<00:00:08.450> let's<00:00:09.450> start<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:10.050> defining<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
topic let's start with defining the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.860 
topic let's start with defining the
frequency<00:00:11.400> there<00:00:12.030> are<00:00:12.179> two<00:00:12.330> formulas

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
frequency there are two formulas

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.709 
frequency there are two formulas
available<00:00:13.530> if<00:00:13.710> K<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.030> number<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.389> cycles

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
available if K is the number of cycles

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.200 
available if K is the number of cycles
and<00:00:16.199> T<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.160> time<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.580> takes<00:00:17.789> for<00:00:18.029> them<00:00:18.150> to

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and T the time it takes for them to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.050 
and T the time it takes for them to
complete<00:00:18.750> then<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.010> frequency<00:00:20.550> by

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
complete then we get the frequency by

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.750 
complete then we get the frequency by
dividing<00:00:21.539> K<00:00:21.779> by<00:00:22.260> T<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:23.160> unit<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.529 
frequency is 1 over second or simply
Hertz<00:00:27.769> hence<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.010> frequency<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:30.029> also<00:00:30.269> be

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
Hertz hence the frequency can also be

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.979

radius of the circle in our case the
circle<00:02:19.380> has<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> radius<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:20.100> 1<00:02:20.190> meter

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
circle has a radius of 1 meter

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.080 
circle has a radius of 1 meter
hence<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.570> velocity<00:02:22.050> equals<00:02:22.620> 31<00:02:23.370> meters<00:02:23.580> per

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
hence the velocity equals 31 meters per

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.140 
hence the velocity equals 31 meters per
second<00:02:24.570> as<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.740> radius<00:02:26.100> increases<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
second as the radius increases the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.390 
second as the radius increases the
velocity<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.990> object<00:02:28.020> increases<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.160> well

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
velocity of the object increases as well

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.550 
velocity of the object increases as well
because<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.420> object<00:02:30.840> has<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.020> travel<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
because the object has to travel a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.620 
because the object has to travel a
longer<00:02:31.800> distance<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.880> same<00:02:33.090> time<00:02:33.390> of

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
longer distance in the same time of

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.590 
longer distance in the same time of
circulation<00:02:34.400> what<00:02:35.400> keeps<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.970> object<00:02:36.390> in<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
circulation what keeps the object in the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.840 
circulation what keeps the object in the
circle<00:02:36.990> though<00:02:37.170> why<00:02:37.770> doesn't<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.550> fly
