00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
total darkness in a little bit you also

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.749 
total darkness in a little bit you also
have<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.500> switch<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.550> pretty

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
have this switch here which is pretty

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
have this switch here which is pretty
easy<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.120> use<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.079> either<00:00:34.290> use<00:00:34.500> your

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
easy to use you can either use your

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.069 
easy to use you can either use your
index<00:00:34.980> finger<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.399> turn<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.840> then<00:00:36.960> you

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
index finger to turn it on but then you

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.540 
index finger to turn it on but then you
really<00:00:37.320> can't<00:00:37.559> reach<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.399> your

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
really can't reach for it with your

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.760 
really can't reach for it with your
thumb<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> usually<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:39.960> use<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.469> left<00:00:40.649> hand

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
thumb so I usually just use my left hand

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.369 
thumb so I usually just use my left hand
to<00:00:41.010> turn<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.489> off<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.149> that's<00:00:43.079> how<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to turn it on and off and that's how it

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.850 
to turn it on and off and that's how it
works

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
works

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.119 
works
you<00:00:44.610> also<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:45.090> where<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> battery<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.950> go

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you also have where the battery would go

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.180 
you also have where the battery would go
and<00:00:47.399> down<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.910> does<00:00:48.239> use<00:00:49.640> cr123a<00:00:50.840> batteries

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
and down this does use cr123a batteries

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.670 
and down this does use cr123a batteries
I'll<00:00:53.190> show<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.699> look<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:53.910> here

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
I'll show you what they look like here

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.619 
I'll show you what they look like here
and<00:00:55.680> they've<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.969> little<00:00:57.360> small

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
and they've just this little small

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.950 
and they've just this little small
battery<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:58.890> simply<00:00:59.129> fit<00:00:59.550> inside

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
battery and it will simply fit inside

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
battery and it will simply fit inside
and<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.680> close<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.340> your

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and then you can close it up and your

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.990 
and then you can close it up and your
flashlight<00:01:03.420> work<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> total<00:01:05.159> length<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
flashlight work now the total length of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.460 
flashlight work now the total length of
the<00:01:06.570> flashlight<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.790> 3<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.030> 1/4<00:01:09.720> inches<00:01:10.170> long

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the flashlight is 3 and 1/4 inches long

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.719 
the flashlight is 3 and 1/4 inches long
about<00:01:11.510> but<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.320> amount<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.799> space<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.430> you

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
about but the amount of space that you

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
about but the amount of space that you
need<00:01:14.970> from<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.200> back<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.770> front<00:01:16.979> of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
need from the very back to the front of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.570 
need from the very back to the front of
the<00:01:17.220> rail<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.640> only<00:01:18.299> about<00:01:18.840> 2<00:01:19.229> inches<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> then

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the rail is only about 2 inches and then

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.660 
the rail is only about 2 inches and then
the<00:01:21.270> problem<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> encountered<00:01:22.490> with<00:01:23.490> my

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the problem that I encountered with my

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.200 
the problem that I encountered with my
Walther<00:01:24.060> p99<00:01:24.390> airsoft<00:01:25.140> pistol<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.729> from

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
Walther p99 airsoft pistol is that from

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.050 
Walther p99 airsoft pistol is that from
the<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.540> back<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.189> notch<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the very back here to this notch here is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.840 
the very back here to this notch here is
one<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> half<00:01:30.900> inches<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.250> did<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.579> have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
one and a half inches and I did not have

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.179 
one and a half inches and I did not have
one<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> half<00:01:33.600> inches<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.990> space<00:01:34.229> from<00:01:34.979> my

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
one and a half inches of space from my

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.600 
one and a half inches of space from my
trigger<00:01:35.460> guard<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.630> where<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.979> notches<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.579> my

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
trigger guard to where the notches on my

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
trigger guard to where the notches on my
rail<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> had<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.530> was<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
rail so what I had to do was get a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.760 
rail so what I had to do was get a
dremel<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.659> sanded<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.229> down<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
dremel and I just sanded this down and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.399 
dremel and I just sanded this down and
now<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.640> fits<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.000> pretty<00:01:45.149> nicely<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.229> you're

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
now it fits in pretty nicely so you're

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.109 
now it fits in pretty nicely so you're
going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.770> need<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.100> least<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> half

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
going to need at least one and a half

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.539 
going to need at least one and a half
inches<00:01:48.509> from<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> very<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:49.979> where<00:01:50.430> your

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
inches from the very back or where your

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.819 
inches from the very back or where your
trigger<00:01:50.759> guard<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.930> where<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
trigger guard would be to where the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.810 
trigger guard would be to where the
front<00:01:53.240> notch<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:55.259> rail<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.340> then

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
front notch of your rail is and then

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.330 
front notch of your rail is and then
