00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.090
 I'll start by applying cocoa butter 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.250
 any lip moisturizer 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.160
 that uses this is because it is the most 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.230
 cheap thousand pesos good you can not beat him 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.970
 to that now as I will be applying 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.670
 shadows although in your ally I will apply 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.369
 so many but if I need everything to be 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.560
 stay in place and I'll throw a little 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.730
 a first this is the first mineral of 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.730
 serious shadows 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.129
 since he will not be using so much shadow 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.829
 use this project techniques that 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.780
 clearer than my skin tone and this 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.670
 brush to apply under the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.019
 eyebrows and so I get any favor that 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.479
 have done when I get out in the 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.610
 eyebrows and apart illuminates a bit only 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:53.470
 two very small points 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.270
 so preferably throw it a lot about 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.270
 of sight 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.670
 and when there is almost nothing left of 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.060
 product can take it a little bit more 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.100
 for here 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.170
 and that's what sealed with a little 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.720
 translucent powder trying not to touch 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.910
 both eyebrows 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.370
 I will only use this brush for 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.220
 blur of costales and this palette 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.920
 also sacks in is called sibiu and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.250
 the tone you will be using will be this 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.300
 it's like light coffee I'm going to apply it from the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.300
 basin up 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.670
 and will explain the situation of the still 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 I do not know two months without seeing each other and it ends 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.240
 to get to andrew then and it's very 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.770
 happy and is doing a dance like the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.770
 of happy feet because the plane 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.130
 it's Andrew now with a small brush 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.550
 more or less like that and again with the same 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.520
 palette but now using this song that 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.260
 it's like an olive green 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.060
 I do not know if it's called like that but it's 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.369
 practically a pretty dark green 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.670
 it looks slightly brown but the details 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.979
 of excess and I'm going to apply it in the part 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.140
 below only that I will apply from here 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.209
 halfway and try not to start 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.720
 from so out there so that later it does not 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.330
 see as elongated I will start as from 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.330
 here and I will explain it until now 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.760
 and now I'm going to start blurring if 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.130
 they want they can remove the excess what 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.870
 has a brush in his hand that 's 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.630
 what I always do, I'm going to start 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.700
 judge and I'll try while they blur 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.280
 like that you do not see so straight lines 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.940
 but wider and also to get to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.940
 further inside 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.020
 I think I will apply a little more but only 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.860
 on the outside to make them more 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.860
 intense outside 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.790
 Now I'm going to do an outline with 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.640
 butts on top for the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.310
 delineated will be using eyeliner 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.380
 liquid bill marker report 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.450
 gates cosmetics so to me of line and 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.160
 I feel that it was not perfect with the fine 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.750
 but it does not matter because I'm going to add 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.630
 a little bit of gold up now with the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.210
 mix jumbo pencil in white color is 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.070
 llama milk and is brochita I will take with the 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.870
 brush directly from here and I'm going to 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.870
 make a line on the eyeliner 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.840
 and I had 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.090
 I'm going to clean this in my arm because I do not 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.950
 and blur that white line can 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.200
 blur everything you want and can 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.360
 falling on the black does not matter just 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.670
 make sure that in the part of the tail 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.530
 it's not so blurred it's like that I want it 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.870
 is more or less dry now following 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.830
 with the same palette I'm going to take this 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.500
 tone like bronze from here 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.360
 I'll take with this brush and put it right 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.280
 there on top of the part where I play 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.130
 remove the sofa he mentioned that he was here 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.390
 because that moving connection and feel 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.000
 that will explode at any time 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.610
 more salty person edge for the colex 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.470
 the connections we go chiquitana pass them 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.750
 worrying 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.850
 because we got leftovers and if the charges 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.519
 as I take gold here and there not 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.420
 I was just now with the black 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.420
 we go back and there 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.990
 ok I need death of the eyes only 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.630
 we need the eyelash I want it to look 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.430
 very big but I do not have good eyelashes 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.590
 I have false eyelashes but I do not have the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.950
 sticking the tabs so I will use 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.449
 the curler then the first of tabs and 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.759
 then plates 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.289
 the tabs are ready now I want 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.839
 go with the sunscreen but how 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.599
 ok I'm going to touch that connection again 

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:54.029
 it does not go off I understand that this is 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.169
 travel as I have sunscreen and 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:58.020
 I'm starting to see a little 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.830
 brilliant why then take a little 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.830
 of translucent powder 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.920
 of any excess with a brush in 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.450
 fan shape and now if I go with the 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.750
 connoisseur and the teacher that would be 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:16.720
 using is the sun is vary from coast to 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.720
 james and how do I have the golden one and this one like 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.949
 Actually, you almost do not notice this 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.290
 bronzer but I do not feel like using 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.290
 place so also place 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.980
 5000 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.590
 I do not know how to pay this finally the lips 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.199
 yes I love dark lips like that 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.449
 that I will use as always in labial 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.599
 jellyfish mix but this is not to use 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:53.430
 eye 2 each as lipstick but 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:53.430
 black berry which is simply an excess 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.410
 and now if it's the jellyfish life of my 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.110
 I'm shaking not sure he has a 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.420
 blog but I'm knowing and everything and this 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.910
 it's the final I love the lips 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.190
 dark and it looks black but in reality 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.580
 it is a very dark violet tastes very well 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.970
 where it looks like blue does not apply 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.860
 that's all a kiss until next video 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.570
 stain or I removed him if I'm going to be 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.700
 doing a tutorial about how 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.920
 do the outline with butts because 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.979
 had done one and it was lousy because in 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.979
 Italy could not see anything 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.979
 gifted
