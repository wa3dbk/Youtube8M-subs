00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
power your gem that used to be in IB 2

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.910 
power your gem that used to be in IB 2
and<00:00:51.579> you<00:00:52.359> need<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:52.809> get<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.199> perfect<00:00:53.710> power

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
and you need to get a perfect power

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.849 
and you need to get a perfect power
before<00:00:54.340> it<00:00:54.579> will<00:00:54.789> work<00:00:55.030> however<00:00:55.870> it<00:00:56.440> says<00:00:56.649> on

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
before it will work however it says on

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.069 
before it will work however it says on
the<00:00:56.980> website<00:00:57.430> we<00:00:57.730> will<00:00:57.969> be<00:00:58.180> able<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.570> forge

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
the website we will be able to forge

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.560 
the website we will be able to forge
them<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.769> then<00:01:00.309> it<00:01:00.460> will<00:01:00.609> turn<00:01:00.820> into<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.180> great

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
them and then it will turn into a great

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.229 
them and then it will turn into a great
parry<00:01:02.050> or<00:01:02.260> gem<00:01:02.620> which<00:01:03.100> means<00:01:03.429> we'll<00:01:03.820> only<00:01:04.119> have

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
parry or gem which means we'll only have

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.450 
parry or gem which means we'll only have
to<00:01:04.570> get<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:04.960> great<00:01:05.259> parry<00:01:05.619> for<00:01:05.979> it<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.280> work

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
to get a great parry for it to work

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.400 
to get a great parry for it to work
rather<00:01:06.970> than<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.450> perfect<00:01:07.720> parry

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
rather than a perfect parry

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.820 
rather than a perfect parry
so<00:01:09.250> here<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.000> am<00:01:10.119> getting<00:01:10.509> some<00:01:10.960> perfect<00:01:11.440> palace

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
so here I am getting some perfect palace

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.910 
so here I am getting some perfect palace
and<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.700> way<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:12.880> do<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.899> match<00:01:14.530> the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
and the way to do it is to match the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.300 
and the way to do it is to match the
titanosaur<00:01:15.610> angle<00:01:16.390> exactly<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.289> also<00:01:17.979> swipe

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
titanosaur angle exactly and also swipe

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.580 
titanosaur angle exactly and also swipe
at<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.670> last<00:01:18.910> moment<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.690> you<00:01:20.140> can<00:01:20.319> check

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
at the last moment and you can check

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.370 
at the last moment and you can check

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.490 
that video for more information about
perfect<00:01:24.039> powers<00:01:24.429> also<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.539> will<00:01:25.929> be<00:01:26.140> bringing

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
perfect powers also I will be bringing

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.790 
perfect powers also I will be bringing
out<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.830> new<00:01:27.069> video<00:01:27.970> I'm<00:01:28.539> working<00:01:29.050> on<00:01:29.200> today

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
out a new video I'm working on today

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.089 
out a new video I'm working on today
with<00:01:30.550> exclusive<00:01:31.270> information<00:01:31.630> from<00:01:32.440> an<00:01:32.679> IB

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:33.099 
with exclusive information from an IB

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:35.580 
with exclusive information from an IB
animator<00:01:33.670> on<00:01:34.030> how<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.420> get<00:01:34.720> perfect<00:01:35.020> powers

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
animator on how to get perfect powers

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.790 
animator on how to get perfect powers
even<00:01:35.890> easier<00:01:36.599> turning<00:01:37.599> to<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.989> second<00:01:38.560> new

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
even easier turning to the second new

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.130 
even easier turning to the second new
gem<00:01:39.160> that<00:01:39.399> was<00:01:39.489> announced<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.929> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
gem that was announced and this is the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.430 
gem that was announced and this is the
rare<00:01:41.410> defense<00:01:41.950> gem<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.880> it's<00:01:43.599> a<00:01:43.720> bit<00:01:43.869> like<00:01:43.899> the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
rare defense gem and it's a bit like the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.190 
rare defense gem and it's a bit like the
spectrum<00:01:45.039> defense<00:01:45.429> that<00:01:45.640> we<00:01:45.789> had<00:01:45.970> in<00:01:46.149> IB<00:01:46.599> 2<00:01:46.869> but

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
spectrum defense that we had in IB 2 but

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.589 
spectrum defense that we had in IB 2 but
again<00:01:47.530> with<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:47.979> difference<00:01:48.429> this<00:01:49.300> one

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
again with the difference this one

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.859 
again with the difference this one
allows<00:01:50.259> protection<00:01:51.220> against<00:01:51.789> everything<00:01:52.119> but

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
allows protection against everything but

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.520 
allows protection against everything but
it<00:01:53.140> starts<00:01:53.590> with<00:01:53.649> only<00:01:53.920> 5%<00:01:54.640> protection

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
it starts with only 5% protection

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.369 
it starts with only 5% protection
however<00:01:56.530> they<00:01:57.039> do<00:01:57.099> say<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.940> can<00:01:58.179> forge<00:01:58.569> the<00:01:59.080> gem

00:01:59.369 --> 00:01:59.379 
however they do say we can forge the gem

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.040 
however they do say we can forge the gem
until<00:02:00.280> we<00:02:00.429> get<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.849> hundred<00:02:01.239> percent<00:02:01.569> of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
until we get a hundred percent of

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.609 
until we get a hundred percent of
protection<00:02:02.890> from<00:02:03.670> all<00:02:03.970> elements<00:02:04.629> so<00:02:05.259> that

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
protection from all elements so that

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.339 
protection from all elements so that
will<00:02:05.860> be<00:02:06.009> worth<00:02:06.220> working<00:02:06.700> on<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.780> suggest

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
will be worth working on and I suggest

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.220 
will be worth working on and I suggest
we<00:02:08.800> stock<00:02:09.160> up<00:02:09.399> on<00:02:09.610> our<00:02:09.940> element<00:02:10.479> defense<00:02:10.840> gems

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
we stock up on our element defense gems

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.860 
we stock up on our element defense gems
in<00:02:11.610> preparation<00:02:12.610> for<00:02:12.640> all<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.209> forging<00:02:13.690> we'll

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
in preparation for all the forging we'll

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.720 
in preparation for all the forging we'll
need<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.230> do<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.890> get<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> hundred

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
need to do to get it to a hundred

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.199 
need to do to get it to a hundred
percent

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
percent

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.869 
percent
so<00:02:17.109> I<00:02:17.349> hope<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.709> enjoyed<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.189> video<00:02:18.370> guys
