 before the premiere for political reasons 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.479
 thereby making the picture an advertisement and giving 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.580
 reason for the Western media gossip about the cruelest 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.560
 censorship in our country is not to give 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.990

 heard a loud moan and fans and 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.480

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.640

 some kind of benefit from you and opinion 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.460
 most viewers and some 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.120
 analysts 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.210
 This is generally better teaser for history 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:18.320
 teasers okay, it's better teaser if 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:22.680
 carry summer at least a year we are there 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:26.220

 characters and beautiful views by the way say 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.640
 that this is not a planet of tattoos this is some kind 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.910
 Other planet 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.010
 but han solo and chewbacca which neither 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.800
 a hair didn't turn gray 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.150
 pleased the guard malt and goes to be 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.150
 feeling old 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.860
 but today we will talk about the other old people 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.230
 Rather, the old men imagine you Liam 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.360
 nonona ed harris who's great 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.480
 performed their roles in the film center 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.150
 night runaway thanks to them for cliché 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.670
 and in the tail and in the mane the film can and even 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.590
 need to look and if unpredictable 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.570
 from the first frame the plot is a picture 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.450
 thanks to these two mastodon there you can 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.820
 it would be to praise and praise but alas, but all 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.739
 But not everything is so bad I liked more 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.180
 or less realistic action to me 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.850
 liked minor characters 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.310
 whether winsett diane lego is a joke 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.820
 spooky kelly performed by no one team 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.070
 or komono rapper is he and also nick 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.440
 Nolti literally in the episode still there 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.630
 will film fan of memory us on remake 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.970
 Robocop He walked the entire film with a gloomy 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.070
 face and not particularly pleased but he and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.130
 I shouldn’t have seemed to shine here 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.440
 main couple liam neeson and ed harris 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.989
 both are essentially characters from the same field both 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.910
 thug both git both excellent 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.590
 perform their roles liam neeson 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.019
 finally not playing brian mills 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.180
 the character is more mundane and in action 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.170
 the scenes show that he is too old for 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.420
 all this shit 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.180
 pleased with the presence of bruises and tangible 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.430
 wounds pleased with the presence of sane motives 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.860
 Pleases that the hero at times include 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.620
 brain in general everything would be fine if 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.040
 no plot yes this banal banal 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.769
 plot 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.200
 there are two friends both van de then both together 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.479
 passed the fire and water and both now 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.510
 become old men of one of them torments 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.580
 conscience and alcoholism nonson another caris 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.380
 He continues to conduct its business in the shadow 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.930
 both have sons and one beautiful 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.820
 moment by coincidence sons 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.320
 between themselves are in conflict and you can already 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.050
 calmly predict what will happen next 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.240
 sad consequences and history of the place 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.370
 conflict spills over to fathers and and 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.530
 spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.630
 spoiler spoiler but here without spoilers 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.850
 understandable like the plot we saw no longer 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.860
 once and not two you killed my wife you killed 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.419
 my dog ​​you killed my goldfish in 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.520
 Generally nothing new 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.410
 Alas, we do not throw at all 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.390
 no surprises and except 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.640
 mundane and quite fit 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.870
 action as well as excellent acting 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.610
 I could not please with the game anymore 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.950
 but unless additional is brought 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.480
 paints a drama about fathers relationship and 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.070
 children who are however quite 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.960
 banal yet I did not like 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.640
 some mounting glues since 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.890
 a couple of places characters away from the chase 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.900
 quite some sort of magical way in 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.790
 one frame they are trapped next already 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.560
 run down some stairs and the cops 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.390
 they suddenly lose it somehow completely 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.680
 lazily but still i will recommend this 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.840
 Movie to view if you have already watched 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.150
 fast and furious recommend precisely that because 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.710
 actors this harris and liam nonson very 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.810
 I really liked their looks and 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.200
 the relationship between their characters i 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.420
 give 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.370
 this ribbon silver hats good 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.230
 middle peasant without much surprise hope 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.000
 what is the director of the home courier 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.860
 will cease to rivet mediocre 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.350
 movies with nissan and give out something 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.170
 more individual makings for this 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.120
 there is well and you were in a falcon expressed 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.520
 go to the movies 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.520
 make your own bye
