00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 many women's hearts beat for him 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.350
 many men's hearts beat higher 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.030
 it's about cars with a man it went 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.070
 a whole life car and always is 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:21.270
 I also welcome as a talk-guest niki 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:25.439
 lauda I'm the third one but you 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.760
 Do not you dare me what I first 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.140
 have to say has in fact today 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.980
 birthday we are glad that he 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.980
 still there 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.290
 Can you say the car is your life? 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.739
 certainly the car is the most important in the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.300
 Life 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.640
 I would say half the life now 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.960
 by further you've ever 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.610
 but now it really is 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.809
 finally so i can get you here too 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.030
 do not cry more now 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.650
 So once stopped thinking of me 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.120
 It's over after two years I came 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.890
 again 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.650
 Now I am Abstinenz for a long time 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.059
 november actually moment itches me 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.010
 not about it not what in the future 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.570
 will happen 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.860
 formula 1 that's a sport about the 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.610
 many discussions are there again and again 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.350
 will give 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.330
 but it is certainly something many 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.670
 few car interested 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.850
 on the other hand, it is our whole life 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.890
 somewhere affects our whole life 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.810
 are you in the street on the highway 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.070
 a very different than in formula 1 were 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.450
 we definitely 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.039
 i can not stand against the grandmother 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.840
 Now race on the highway from 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.460
 the kac that happened that one 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.810
 has not looked at new car 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.300
 exactly that happens but as I said the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.680
 Street is something else I am up 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.539
 So the race track reacted 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.590
 thankfully necessary because it is not here 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.820
 will drive her around 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.460
 if you are one I add I am not quite 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.020
 restriction it depends on so in 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.049
 Austria has one in Germany 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.760
 is not there is any indication of the country 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.770
 So far, I believe that one 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.189
 in the future sometime for the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.600
 environmental what must do so long highway 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.430
 technically able to see so 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.659
 no dirt to test out behind 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.790
 I think I do not need one but if 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.020
 The technology of one day is no longer in 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.460
 the situation is to do that 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.810
 then I believe that one 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.759
 directing speed already makes sense 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.200
 if a young person says so 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.720
 would like to be auto racer 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.190
 Do you say you're making a boy comfortable? 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.440
 restaurant so my beautiful 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.000
 For example, try it now 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.280
 I'm already so far that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.140
 because a vet wants to be and the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.540
 other motocross driver I start 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.130
 was placed over the moon, of course, 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.630
 an insane risk and it is not 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.060
 difficult even if you are the best 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.070
 There are influences where you can not 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.799
 progresses if, for example, not that 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.269
 right at the right moment has 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.799
 I do not know what to fry 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.480
 In any case, you must know yourself 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.709
 then at the right moment the best is 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.940
 actually not for the audience 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.620
 to make out more 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.090
 they all have crazy cars to press 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.739
 all 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.050
 so do not do it and still make it 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.459
 one on which is enough niki lauda what is 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.150
 it then, in the end, you can be sure 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.620
 do not describe 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
 it's the nerves that's it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.989
 can drive or then yet 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.670
 the material 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.440
 I think it's the combination 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.750
 especially if you're in the right moment 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.519
 right car is just sitting in what 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.590
 by holding the year is correct frosted 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.870
 and so on then it's done there 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.430
 So there are great drivers always in the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.019
 have changed wrong moment and 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.030
 It was not always a team 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.220
 has more works by came the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.750
 not folk so destiny of all me 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.459
 my, you see a future for the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.720
 formula 1 do you believe that the discussion 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.400
 so aggravate that it's so expensive 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.019
 will be that people in too 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.239
 Germany what look or even tennis 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.489
 Do you see a possibility? 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.000
 formula 1 always in this attractiveness too 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.410
 receive 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.440
 so i believe that formula 1 is now 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.720
 Arriving at the highest point is unbelievable 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.430
 Many people are fascinated and you can do that 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.349
 departing from the road at the moment and 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.060
 New countries, for example, are now 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.950
 who once this year budapest can 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.000
 British and then new markets too 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.709
 open up but I believe that the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.239
 Formula 1 is free from all crises 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.340
 was in the first gasoline 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.900
 There was a crisis that is believed that the people 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.700
 have interest and I think that is 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.350
 exhausting what is the women what 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.180
 So fascinated by the car so you can see 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.400
 always where you are already women where I 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.380
 I'm not complaining a bit I do not want to 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.120
 but still say you also have the 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.590
 Experience made that it is then 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.139
 drive the tough men or put the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.849
 nice colorful cars maybe both 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.799
 the good mix must honestly say so 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.720
 I do not know but I believe that 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.380
 whole race atmosphere all this 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.150
 around 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.160
 the people partly almost a bit 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.570
 the danger of course you know that 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.010
 that many people just stand there and 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.830
 say maybe this will work today 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.150
 are that the unpleasant fans or 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.080
 You just say to yourself like that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.000
 circus and like all these 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.669
 Organizer can do this through the children 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.690
 home and say I was up 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.400
 every case 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.889
 thank god not god was the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.810
 do not always think so firstly 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.130
 thank you very much that you were there 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.800
 We know also indulged my 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.389
 successful broadcast 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.389
 Do you still have some blemishes ? 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.500
 good even if it really this 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.970
 car delivery did you find it yet 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.040
 if that song was maybe that was it 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.230
 not so great was that that was yes 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.850
 Whole rehearsed for three days whenever 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.070
 The rehearsal was then called it comes now 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.600
 Of course the movie was not played 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.520
 and then she went to the next rehearsal and 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.440
 It really took an hour 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.850
 great that there was a lag and then 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.110
 Suddenly on the dare until then 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.460
 started and again and again the film 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.090
 it was then played as three hours 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.070
 lasted 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.750
 yes that was a happy one I have to 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.910
 say but today comes injustice 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.910
 in front of niki lauda our guest 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.390
 Of course we thought he did 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.520
 has almost everything has an airline art 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.780
 children has a beautiful wife and with us 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.160
 what can you still be 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.900
 we have something to give 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.850
 he has been yes or in this show 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.260
 yes we presented the future car 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.450
 have the past car we have 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.580
 it dug that is by 180 thousand 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.170
 years first car and over 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.950
 the laugh it still drives it comes and 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.410
 to pick you up 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.410
 here is flint car 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.229
 Please take a seat 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.580
 but the exit please as I said 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.830
 Carefully I believe is now part of the 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.530
 often normal roads would be decent 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.150
 Herbert Grafinger He has this car in 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.139
 His possessions are difficult to see 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.110
 All this is already in 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.580
 so light bulbs are already 5000 years 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.590
 but old are replaced meanwhile 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.800
 at least twice that is still so 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:25.310
 that of 4000 so that's all 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.110
 massive granite and it would actually be 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.310
 it does not color itself for it 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.409
 the road is allowed to drive on the 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.270
 drive it so it is criticized in 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:37.490
 Austria is the mediator driving a car 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:39.409
 everything ok members on the tax this 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:44.050
 thanks to the vehicle for the visit 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:44.050
 reverse gear and all good good ride
