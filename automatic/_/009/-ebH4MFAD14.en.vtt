00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
up right about here I start to let the

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.200 
up right about here I start to let the
eyes<00:01:05.420> lose<00:01:06.380> focus<00:01:06.409> with<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.220> ball<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.790> I

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
target and that really kind of starts to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.520 
target and that really kind of starts to
rotate<00:01:13.580> my<00:01:13.790> shoulders<00:01:13.820> around<00:01:14.630> too<00:01:14.930> early<00:01:15.320> and

rotate my shoulders around too early and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.820 
rotate my shoulders around too early and
that's<00:01:16.040> where<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.460> start<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:17.000> lose<00:01:17.270> spin<00:01:18.110> so

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
that's where you start to lose spin so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.520 
that's where you start to lose spin so

his eyes stay up

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.790 
his eyes stay up
