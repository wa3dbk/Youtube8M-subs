point six and today I'm to thirty seven
point<00:00:34.770> four<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.149> means<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.930> one-week<00:00:37.260> loss

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
point four so that means a one-week loss

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.750 
point four so that means a one-week loss
of<00:00:37.770> 0.2<00:00:38.370> pounds<00:00:38.940> now<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:40.680> until<00:00:40.890> today<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.399> have

of 0.2 pounds now up until today I have
been<00:00:41.850> down<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.540> pound<00:00:42.840> which<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.500> kind<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
been down one pound which I was kind of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.130 
been down one pound which I was kind of
disappointed<00:00:44.010> about<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.079> morning

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
disappointed about but then this morning

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.299 
disappointed about but then this morning
I<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.680> up<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.340> pound<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.469> hence<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.829> point<00:00:50.100> two

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
I was up a pound so hence the point two

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.660 
I was up a pound so hence the point two
loss<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:52.340> knew<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.570> possibility<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
loss I knew it's a possibility to have a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.979 
loss I knew it's a possibility to have a
stall<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:59.059> it<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.210> unexpected

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
stall so it's not like it was unexpected

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.689 
stall so it's not like it was unexpected
but<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.379> still<00:01:01.559> disappointing<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.550> I'm

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
but it's still disappointing but I'm

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.870 
but it's still disappointing but I'm
trying<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.220> week<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.640> did

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
trying to just I know this week I did

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.270 
trying to just I know this week I did
not<00:01:06.030> drink<00:01:06.630> my<00:01:07.110> water<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.920> had<00:01:08.100> been

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

drinking<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.909> probably<00:01:09.180> drank<00:01:09.600> maybe<00:01:11.810> on

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
drinking I probably drank maybe on

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.190 
drinking I probably drank maybe on
average<00:01:12.990> six<00:01:13.530> glasses<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.010> day<00:01:14.960> instead<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
average six glasses a day instead of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.219

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
eight and I know that's not good enough

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.520 
eight and I know that's not good enough
