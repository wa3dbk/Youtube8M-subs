00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.180
 hello as already announced I would like 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.089
 give you something about my nose piercing 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.539
 told and that is it this time 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:16.280
 about how I change them and hundreds 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.530
 comments include whether I once 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.390
 can show how paramedics look in 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.390
 the nose if you see him 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.950
 just not it is in the nose one 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.560
 it does not look and yes now I want 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.210
 you show only times how such a 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.210
 I do noses plug purely'm currently 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.980
 the ring in here and become now 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.980
 do for you to get out and do it again purely 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.670
 once you turn it out like this 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.410
 outside is 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.769
 that's what the nasal plug looks like 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.350
 at least most of the one purely 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:10.159
 you can put it in your nose 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.159
 just so pure 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.049
 not quite so easy you push that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.049
 ball to 1 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.750
 and then he is in there as well the hook 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.840
 you have to turn again then it looks 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.789
 you can just about that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.179
 only so clean do I again 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.179
 short out 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.520
 so he just hangs inside 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.280
 sniffing the nostril is something now 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.520
 flushed 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.989
 yes because I do not often change the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.989
 That should be out of the way for a second 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:12.509
 and outside it is now trying it 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.509
 same again with the nose ring 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.610
 So first you have to be so pure and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.010
 look like he comes out again 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.380
 took a while but I've got it 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.600
 managed is shot there and was 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.300
 then just as easily from the hole boys 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.910
 find from inside and then just after 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.610
 Drive outside and then bring it in so pure 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.950
 it just out so now for the jewelry 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.830
 change from the sector 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.550
 this is retainer he is coming now 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.550
 into the nose 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.520
 he looks then from 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.690
 because then it is always best to do it completely 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.640
 up and away 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:19.620
 you can not see even get out their 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.740
 see it as pretty far ahead 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.210
 I was also interested in engraving 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.370
 when I let it sting me off 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.470
 even though it died right there 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.920
 so here it is full by the soft 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.990
 not punched through link yet 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.850
 just as soon as the front pretty 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.740
 especially when it's okay if that 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.020
 nasal bone is straight and so straight 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.340
 recipe so slate the nasal bone and 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.080
 so slate recipe to just and do me 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.830
 now a horseshoe rey there I turn 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.180
 just on one side the ball off me 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.730
 have my horseshoes a bit 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:04.380
 most of the time I am stuck together 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:09.620
 then in the nose the hole finds that 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:16.430
 really goes by itself so in it 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.430
 the ball has her hole and 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.970
 then I just turn on the ball 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.910
 nice that she will not be back 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.630
 falls out and so it is and 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.470
 catch fire 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.300
 You can also bring in the horseshoe 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.290
 Unfortunately I can not show how 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.370
 it went out 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.900
 horseshoe is just pushed together and 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.370
 I just do not have the opportunity 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:55.110
 that to be apart because I just 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:57.389
 do not have such a tongs otherwise 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.520
 jewelry very difficult for me 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.780
 to do such rings rhine 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.910
 There is low segment ring neck you 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.000
 are without beginning without end 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:16.400
 they look like they have here 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.400
 as a pole and there are 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.220
 wiesenstetter halt and you can then 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.060
 press it again 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.820
 the only problem is that there really 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.580
 I now find a ps should because 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.190
 he can offer that together again and 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.930
 so I do not dare just with the 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.789
 pliers because of the nose to have bent 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.280
 because if I slide on it or something 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:43.080
 You just have the possibility of something like that 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.520
 then to do or even really such 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.060
 in the middle of the ball inside 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.870
 he has two recesses and the ball 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:57.120
 they will be easy with the strings 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:59.419
 attached here I can again 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.419
 demonstrate 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.400
 many do that too with the pliers 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.600
 So you simply the ring at the 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.000
 he just pulls a ball apart 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.150
 do the ball out and then just 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.669
 make back down but I'll do it 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:24.790
 reluctantly as I said a bit 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:33.520
 I do not find it so scary now 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:35.010
 good with me, that's why I have too 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.990
 not inside 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.870
 that's how it will be now 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.900
 really not quite as nice and 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.460
 so do not do it 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:50.139
 and as I said you have the possibility 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:54.150
 To fold up the stuff it just stops 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:57.660
 be really broad enough about that 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:00.960
 goes beyond the bone fracture entertainment 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.780
 and otherwise 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.820
 you can actually fold up a lot 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.500
 only problem is that you sneeze 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.229
 or so the stuff go out again and 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:16.000
 at a retainer as I said it remains 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:22.150
 just in there above and just like that 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.150
 again I have to say from my 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.979
 East brings massively from the longer up and 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.060
 I do not want him anymore 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.889
 I hope I could enter you now 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.600
 show something about peaks 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.750
 I know I'm not like that now 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.580
 a piercing change professional but so do 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.380
 I always have it too 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.070
 possibility simply such rods through 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.479
 to do 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.889
 stupid at the sap and just as easy 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:47.500
 on the other side the ball, after all 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:48.490
 screw then just just one 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.010
 to see the ball 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:55.160
 Well, I have something like that 

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.360
 I'm not in it 

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.360
 So bye
