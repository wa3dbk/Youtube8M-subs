00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.390
 new video here on without galaxy and 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.420
 I want to pay you today 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.570
 on your android smartphone with kitkat 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.099
 can install the flashplayer and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.400
 Although this is actually quite easy 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.320
 and since android 4.0 developed adobe 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.930
 his flash player no longer for the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.609
 android platform and that's why you have to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.080
 Now go another way with it here 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.380
 the whole thing still works because there is 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.599
 yes still enough websites where still 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 the flash player is required and around 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.980
 Let's go download denise once 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.260
 under ball flash player archive 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.780
 and then we come to one side of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.340
 adobe i can give you the link too 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 in addition to the description 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.500
 So put archived flash player 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.160
 flash player versions are available here 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.620
 this side 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.809
 and yes we just have to 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 choose the right one that is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.649
 the archive of all the old ones, so to speak 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.109
 flash player version or scroll 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.940
 even down stands up then 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.079
 android version here and then 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.699
 Let's just take the oldest and here 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.220
 you also see that only to android 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.619
 4.0 go and that is actually now 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.610
 as a simpler we click on it and 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.350
 just let it download and 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.020
 that's the apk, so to speak 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.250
 for the android 4.0 platform is but 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 In the next step, we can do it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.720
 still use and though by 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.130
 a little trick because I can you 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.100
 say the background again 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 the flash player is having nowadays 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.920
 no longer used me because one 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.990
 puts on html5 nowadays and that's why 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.610
 the flash player is relatively relative 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.500
 becomes obsolete and will not work anymore 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.640
 we have to develop it now 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.259
 install here once 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.909
 of course you have to go to the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.970
 set settings have her 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.259
 you can install unknown sources 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.210
 That could easily be in the settings 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.060
 make sure if you so 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.350
 the can not install here will 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.460
 but you do not wash automatically 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.860
 pointed out 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.409
 so now we need the app 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.060
 firefox so who firefox anyway not 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.850
 on his smartphone should have 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.100
 just download and then go 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.580
 we are right here on the top of the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.350
 Click the Settings button 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.920
 again on attitudes then on 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.790
 view and here we can go under 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.220
 plugins we have to activate them 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.620
 and now firefox recognizes, so to speak, the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.840
 app dirk rahn downloaded 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.970
 So have the flash player app recognizes 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.460
 now, so to speak, as a plug-in and im 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.310
 firefox we can now use the web pages 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.830
 Just load and watch with flash 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.350
 here I eg my example of rtl 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.840
 that's the way I can in the app store 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.370
 Of course there is also an app where you rtl 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.560
 but I can not do that because 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.510
 I have my smartphone and he offers 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.160
 then hey says there is a smartphone 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.540
 reddened we do not want you and 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.510
 that's why I always have to 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.610
 watching over the internet browser and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.890
 you need flash and that works here 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.680
 you see it is being played and I can 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.990
 again show the evidence against by 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.160
 I just need to open it in chrome 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.930
 not me all that and then 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.410
 he complains yes we need the flash 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.260
 player 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.320
 and the whole thing is just because the whole thing 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.450
 is outdated and actually everything 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.890
 to be converted to html5 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.900
 but of course there are still 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.560
 enough websites where you can flash player 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.959
 needs and yes because the app only for 4.0 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.120
 So we have a way here now 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.890
 how we do it all on kitkat 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.750
 can and you can see here now 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.700
 chrome does not work 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.709
 So now we have the proof here 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.600
 that the whole thing worked and that 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.380
 the site is really a flash player 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.959
 needed 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.700
 and yes I hope that you all 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.920
 helped you to have yours now 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.980
 movies also on the android smartphone 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.180
 and otherwise I would 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.340
 let's see what happens next 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.959
 video on my channel again until then 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.959
 have fun and bye
