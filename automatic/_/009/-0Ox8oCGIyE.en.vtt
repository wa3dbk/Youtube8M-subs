basically over and start off with true
bank<00:01:36.180> ramps<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.490> kind<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> phantoms<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.990> are

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
bank ramps or kind of phantoms these are

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.700 
bank ramps or kind of phantoms these are
these<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.189> bankrupt<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.659> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.409> a
