00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
this case I haven't memorized that so I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709 
this case I haven't memorized that so I
will<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.040> go<00:02:02.189> back<00:02:02.399> down<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> bottom<00:02:03.600> of

will just go back down to the bottom of

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.959 
will just go back down to the bottom of
the<00:02:03.810> list<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.189> third<00:02:05.490> column<00:02:05.939> here

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
the list and then the third column here

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.050 
the list and then the third column here
is<00:02:08.569> it's<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.020> be<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:11.430> ones<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.819> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
is it's going to be the ones that you
