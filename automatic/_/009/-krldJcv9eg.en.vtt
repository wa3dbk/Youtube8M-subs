00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.009
 to bloggers today Tuesday 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.039
 painted first impressions 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.779
 adams the theme I think 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.550
 everybody has something here 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.119
 draws more attention on people better stick with one thing you to look at 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.490
 It's when you meet someone, he's waiting in one of my colleagues. 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.830
 school said that the first thing she takes a person to whom they were the 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.720
 porpoises 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.750
 But she was well looked after and she was very afraid of people with us. 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.700
 trains I never get on the phone 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.170
 never never went through my head to fail with someone's hand when 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.170
 know 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.000
 I think the first thing I look at when periods or sounds have 70 men 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.610
 observed yesterday if the person because 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.010
 when the very perfect attendants I feel very shy of sharia that makes 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.240
 I was able to converse with the person to the most 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.500
 Strange the person seems closer to Sardinia 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.140
 year seems so unreachable 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.110
 We're kind of weird down here. 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.060
 and I feel very bad cause of this so I always look for people always 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 like more people with accused teeth 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 she knew the person well start today 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.220
 the picture will never get out of my head ever so afraid to contact the person 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.240
 origins in the company of cement so high 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.500
 but the company if you have very very subtle teeth 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.170
 I want to know what exactly people are looking first at 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.640
 each person does 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.820
 with the first ethnic groups with poor adherence 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.820
 eyebrows 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.090
 daughters 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 then this corpitcho and the nostrils are the same 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.490
 each one has 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.160
 because it's strange 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.570
 and even agree ink-covered in mere impressions are kind to fars them 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.989
 always wrong 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.890
 three companies are difficult with me because I do not usually talk to 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.829
 people you do not know then the set is very quiet because it 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:20.959
 know well 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.759
 very much 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.769
 it's very difficult to talk the series starts to talk about something had accepted tel 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.389
 I understand something about if I mistake then the minute-by-minute part 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.489
 would be arguing confident about syndicate talking about that but 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.489
 usually I do not talk about 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.649
 currently does not seem so interesting but I also know 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.869
 He does not want me to do anything that we lose. 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.639
 after this interview she did with a new illness that she admitted she feels 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.389
 part of it were also 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.849
 some websites 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.029
 and until tomorrow, date
