00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.190 
you know Noah 3 is a really heavy game
and<00:03:50.430> given<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> devices<00:03:51.569> performance<00:03:52.019> in<00:03:52.109> the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
and given the devices performance in the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.869 
and given the devices performance in the
previous<00:03:52.499> games<00:03:52.709> we<00:03:53.189> didn't<00:03:53.430> expect<00:03:53.670> much

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
previous games we didn't expect much

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.339 
previous games we didn't expect much
from<00:03:53.909> this<00:03:54.150> device<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.870> that's<00:03:55.079> how<00:03:55.200> it

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
from this device and that's how it

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:02.599 
from this device and that's how it
panned<00:03:55.530> out<00:04:00.859> as<00:04:01.859> you<00:04:02.069> can<00:04:02.189> see<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.400> screen

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
panned out as you can see on the screen

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.190 
panned out as you can see on the screen
right<00:04:02.639> now<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.000> gameplay<00:04:03.420> was<00:04:03.689> really<00:04:03.989> choppy

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
right now the gameplay was really choppy

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.199 
right now the gameplay was really choppy
even<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.040> low<00:04:05.219> graphics<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.700> device<00:04:05.939> did<00:04:06.060> not

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
even on low graphics the device did not

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:17.270 
even on low graphics the device did not
hold<00:04:06.389> up<00:04:15.530> if<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.680> talked<00:04:16.829> about<00:04:17.039> how<00:04:17.220> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
hold up if you talked about how the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.620 
hold up if you talked about how the
device<00:04:17.549> feels<00:04:17.789> in<00:04:17.970> your<00:04:18.000> hand<00:04:18.120> while<00:04:18.449> playing

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
device feels in your hand while playing

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.599 
device feels in your hand while playing
games<00:04:18.959> it's<00:04:19.500> obvious<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:19.889> given<00:04:20.310> its<00:04:20.370> sheer

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
games it's obvious that given its sheer

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.099 
games it's obvious that given its sheer
size<00:04:20.880> it's<00:04:21.419> not<00:04:21.539> really<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.959> most

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
size it's not really the most

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.920 
size it's not really the most
comfortable<00:04:22.560> gaming<00:04:22.889> device<00:04:23.509> it<00:04:24.509> also<00:04:24.599> has<00:04:24.900> a

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
comfortable gaming device it also has a

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.110 
comfortable gaming device it also has a
tendency<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.740> heat<00:04:25.919> up<00:04:25.949> during<00:04:26.220> games<00:04:26.580> which

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
tendency to heat up during games which

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.689 
tendency to heat up during games which
does<00:04:27.300> become<00:04:27.599> irritating<00:04:28.050> over<00:04:28.199> time<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:32.610> in

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
does become irritating over time so in

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.310 
does become irritating over time so in
conclusion<00:04:32.880> we<00:04:33.270> like<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.570> say<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:33.960> even

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
conclusion we like to say that even

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.589 
conclusion we like to say that even
though<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> Galaxy<00:04:34.949> mega<00:04:35.099> 6.3<00:04:35.430> has<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.240> really

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
though the Galaxy mega 6.3 has a really

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.300 
though the Galaxy mega 6.3 has a really
big<00:04:36.840> display<00:04:37.289> which<00:04:37.530> obviously<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.130> most

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
big display which obviously to most

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.830 
big display which obviously to most
people<00:04:38.669> would<00:04:38.820> mean<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.240> good<00:04:39.570> gaming

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
people would mean a good gaming

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.360 
people would mean a good gaming
experience<00:04:40.289> but<00:04:40.979> we<00:04:41.099> were<00:04:41.220> really

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
experience but we were really

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.279 
experience but we were really
disappointed<00:04:41.610> with<00:04:42.240> its<00:04:42.389> performance<00:04:42.630> even

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
disappointed with its performance even

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:44.779 
disappointed with its performance even
low-end<00:04:43.710> games<00:04:43.889> like<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.160> trigger<00:04:44.520> did<00:04:44.669> not

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
low-end games like that trigger did not

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.760 
low-end games like that trigger did not
hold<00:04:45.000> up<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.840> if<00:04:45.930> gaming<00:04:46.289> is<00:04:46.380> one<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.620> your

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
hold up so if gaming is one of your

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.439 
hold up so if gaming is one of your
major<00:04:46.949> priorities<00:04:47.550> in<00:04:47.699> a<00:04:47.759> device<00:04:48.000> we
