00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
it it is a little bit small and a little

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.060 
it it is a little bit small and a little
bit<00:00:41.399> maroon<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.510> burgundy<00:00:43.440> compared<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
bit maroon or burgundy compared to the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.190 
bit maroon or burgundy compared to the
red<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.640> still<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:44.969> bad<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.840> paint's

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
red but it's still not bad the paint's

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.529 
red but it's still not bad the paint's
solid<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.100> sculpted<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.820> textured<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
solid and this sculpted is textured I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.420 
solid and this sculpted is textured I
like<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.230> actually<00:00:49.559> put<00:00:49.739> straps<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
like that they actually put straps in

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.580 
like that they actually put straps in
here<00:00:50.700> instead<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.270> having<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.199> same<00:00:52.410> as

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
here instead of just having the same as

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.650 
here instead of just having the same as
before<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.579> didn't<00:00:53.789> paint<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> rivets<00:00:54.360> still

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
before it didn't paint the rivets still

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.630 
before it didn't paint the rivets still
but<00:00:54.960> here's<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> thing<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> straps<00:00:56.399> if

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
but here's the thing with the straps if

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
but here's the thing with the straps if
you<00:00:56.730> want<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.120> his<00:00:57.360> forearm<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you want it on his forearm you have to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.380 
you want it on his forearm you have to
really<00:00:58.949> cinch<00:00:59.280> him<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.300> you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
really cinch him up like this so you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.660 
really cinch him up like this so you
have<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> huge<00:01:00.930> strap<00:01:01.260> hanging<00:01:01.530> down<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.640> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
have a huge strap hanging down now I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.100 
have a huge strap hanging down now I
think<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.000> reason<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.390> gave<00:01:03.539> us<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> straps

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
think the reason they gave us the straps

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.020 
think the reason they gave us the straps
is<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> could<00:01:04.710> put<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.189> his<00:01:05.489> back<00:01:05.519> as

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is so you could put it on his back as

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.179 
is so you could put it on his back as
well<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> my<00:01:07.080> phone's<00:01:07.380> ringing<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.890> let<00:01:08.040> me

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
well and my phone's ringing so let me

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.020 
well and my phone's ringing so let me
answer<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:09.140> back<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.650> shield<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
answer that back to the shield the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
answer that back to the shield the
straps<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.810> there<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.830> have

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
straps are there I think so you can have

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.219 
straps are there I think so you can have
it<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.490> his<00:01:14.640> back<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.060> fits<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.570> does<00:01:15.810> fit<00:01:16.049> on

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it go on his back it fits it does fit on

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.810 
it go on his back it fits it does fit on
there<00:01:16.439> never<00:01:16.920> does<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> movie

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
there never does that in the movie

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
there never does that in the movie
though<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.259> said<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.770> this

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
though and like I said to have this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
though and like I said to have this
shield<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.610> his<00:01:20.640> forearm<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.630> straps<00:01:21.960> really

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
shield on his forearm the straps really

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.859 
shield on his forearm the straps really
look<00:01:23.070> terrible<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> an

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
look terrible so it's kind of an

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
look terrible so it's kind of an
unnecessary<00:01:25.680> improvement<00:01:26.580> which<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> really

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
unnecessary improvement which is really

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.499 
unnecessary improvement which is really
not<00:01:27.420> an<00:01:27.630> improvement<00:01:27.869> at<00:01:28.320> all<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.360> there<00:01:30.360> are

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
not an improvement at all so there are

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.969 
not an improvement at all so there are
some<00:01:30.720> pluses<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> soft<00:01:31.770> rubber

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
some pluses it's not the soft rubber

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.260 
some pluses it's not the soft rubber
that<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> thought<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.150> not

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that I thought it was so it's not

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.870 
that I thought it was so it's not
terrible<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.439> are<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.829> problems<00:01:35.040> as

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.309 
here a little bit of gray down here but
in<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.770> colored<00:02:11.129> areas<00:02:11.550> there's<00:02:11.849> no<00:02:12.090> paint<00:02:12.569> so

in the colored areas there's no paint so

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.059 
in the colored areas there's no paint so
it<00:02:13.440> looks

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
it looks

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.119 
it looks
really<00:02:14.579> really<00:02:15.269> cheap<00:02:15.749> and<00:02:15.989> really<00:02:16.920> really

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
really really cheap and really really

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.129 
really really cheap and really really
bright<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.239> don't<00:02:18.450> care<00:02:18.599> for<00:02:18.719> that<00:02:18.900> very

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139 
bright so I don't care for that very

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.470 
bright so I don't care for that very
much<00:02:19.349> at<00:02:19.680> all<00:02:20.159> the<00:02:20.579> sculptures<00:02:20.849> are<00:02:21.030> decent

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
much at all the sculptures are decent

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.839 
much at all the sculptures are decent
but<00:02:21.959> we<00:02:22.049> don't<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.349> any<00:02:22.590> paintwork<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.700> on

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
but we don't have any paintwork going on

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.539 
but we don't have any paintwork going on
it's<00:02:24.719> just<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.379> bland<00:02:25.709> looking<00:02:26.189> so<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.370> don't

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
it's just so bland looking so I don't

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.530 
it's just so bland looking so I don't
like<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.019> next<00:02:28.019> thing<00:02:28.139> I<00:02:28.230> don't<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.499> is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
like that next thing I don't like is

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.539 
like that next thing I don't like is
growing<00:02:30.540> he's<00:02:30.810> got<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.139> newer<00:02:31.379> groin<00:02:31.950> where

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
growing he's got the newer groin where

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.220 
growing he's got the newer groin where
he's<00:02:32.700> got<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.060> T<00:02:33.359> jointed<00:02:33.750> hips<00:02:33.930> which<00:02:34.079> is

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
he's got the T jointed hips which is

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.099 
he's got the T jointed hips which is
nice<00:02:34.409> there<00:02:34.859> T<00:02:35.069> jointed<00:02:35.519> bald<00:02:35.730> disc<00:02:36.000> hips<00:02:36.359> so

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
nice there T jointed bald disc hips so

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.159 
nice there T jointed bald disc hips so
that's<00:02:37.349> okay<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.450> don't<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:40.169 
that's okay but I just don't like the

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:41.720 
that's okay but I just don't like the
sculpt<00:02:40.560> work<00:02:40.739> here<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.099> kind<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.400> makes<00:02:41.579> him

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
sculpt work here it kind of makes him

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.819 
sculpt work here it kind of makes him
look<00:02:41.849> like<00:02:41.909> he's<00:02:42.209> wearing<00:02:42.419> a<00:02:42.599> speedo<00:02:42.870> and

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
look like he's wearing a speedo and

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.129 
look like he's wearing a speedo and
that's<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.939> issue<00:02:45.060> for<00:02:45.389> all<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.749> figures

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
that's the issue for all the figures

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.659 
that's the issue for all the figures
with<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.469> joint<00:02:46.739> this<00:02:46.889> bottom<00:02:47.250> part<00:02:47.400> comes

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
with this joint this bottom part comes

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.569 
with this joint this bottom part comes
down<00:02:47.909> way<00:02:48.299> too<00:02:48.359> far<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:50.129> is<00:02:50.340> really

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
down way too far and this is really

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.449 
down way too far and this is really
accentuated<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.840> doesn't<00:02:52.169> cover<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.650> hip<00:02:52.829> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
accentuated it doesn't cover the hip the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.140 
accentuated it doesn't cover the hip the
ball<00:02:53.760> joint<00:02:54.030> at<00:02:54.209> all<00:02:54.419> so<00:02:55.169> this<00:02:55.469> little<00:02:56.250> shape

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
ball joint at all so this little shape

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.490 
ball joint at all so this little shape
right<00:02:57.419> there<00:02:57.449> it<00:02:57.719> just<00:02:57.750> doesn't<00:02:58.109> look<00:02:58.230> good<00:02:58.349> in

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
right there it just doesn't look good in

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.939 
right there it just doesn't look good in
my<00:02:58.530> opinion<00:02:59.989> articulation<00:03:00.989> for<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.230> head<00:03:01.439> he

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:01.949 
my opinion articulation for the head he

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.740 
my opinion articulation for the head he
got<00:03:01.980> has<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.519> disc<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.939> there<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.449> it<00:03:03.599> goes

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
got has the disc in there so it goes

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.780 
got has the disc in there so it goes
forward<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.260> backward<00:03:04.680> pretty<00:03:05.430> good<00:03:05.579> range

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
forward and backward pretty good range

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.909 
forward and backward pretty good range
of<00:03:05.879> motion<00:03:06.030> better<00:03:06.480> than<00:03:06.659> Ironman<00:03:07.079> even<00:03:07.469> then

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
of motion better than Ironman even then

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.649 
of motion better than Ironman even then
it's<00:03:08.069> on<00:03:08.189> a<00:03:08.219> ball<00:03:08.430> joint<00:03:08.669> so<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.909> has<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.449> full

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
it's on a ball joint so it has the full

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.349 
it's on a ball joint so it has the full
range<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.079> motion<00:03:10.439> but<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.819> head<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.209> way

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
range of motion but the head is way

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.789 
range of motion but the head is way
bigger<00:03:12.629> than<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.959> neck<00:03:13.169> so<00:03:13.319> he's<00:03:13.439> got<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> real

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
bigger than the neck so he's got a real

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.309 
bigger than the neck so he's got a real
skinny<00:03:14.010> neck<00:03:14.280> syndrome<00:03:14.760> doesn't<00:03:15.629> look<00:03:16.139> good

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
skinny neck syndrome doesn't look good

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.670 
skinny neck syndrome doesn't look good
at<00:03:16.769> all<00:03:18.139> shoulders<00:03:19.139> same<00:03:19.379> as<00:03:19.500> always

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
at all shoulders same as always

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.949 
at all shoulders same as always
shoulders<00:03:20.189> are<00:03:20.340> fine

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
shoulders are fine

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.050 
shoulders are fine
ball<00:03:21.959> disc<00:03:22.259> shoulders<00:03:22.799> biceps<00:03:23.129> swivel<00:03:23.759> double

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
ball disc shoulders biceps swivel double

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.119 
ball disc shoulders biceps swivel double
jointed<00:03:24.299> elbows<00:03:24.449> that's<00:03:24.959> all<00:03:25.169> okay<00:03:25.620> no

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
jointed elbows that's all okay no

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.069 
jointed elbows that's all okay no
articulation<00:03:26.579> in<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> hands<00:03:27.449> other<00:03:27.689> than<00:03:27.959> the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
articulation in the hands other than the

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.050 
articulation in the hands other than the
swivel<00:03:28.470> at<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> forearm<00:03:29.220> inside<00:03:29.699> the<00:03:29.849> glove

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
swivel at the forearm inside the glove

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.460 
swivel at the forearm inside the glove
so<00:03:30.870> that's<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.259> for<00:03:31.439> that<00:03:32.449> torso<00:03:33.449> pretty<00:03:34.259> good

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
so that's it for that torso pretty good

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.319 
so that's it for that torso pretty good
range<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.769> motion<00:03:34.949> on<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.340> torso<00:03:35.579> biggest

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
range of motion on the torso biggest

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.360 
range of motion on the torso biggest
problem<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.109> goes<00:03:37.259> back<00:03:37.500> really<00:03:37.739> far<00:03:38.069> and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
problem is it goes back really far and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.490 
problem is it goes back really far and
has<00:03:38.909> this<00:03:39.030> kind<00:03:39.329> of<00:03:39.389> big<00:03:39.599> cliff<00:03:39.870> right<00:03:40.259> there

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
has this kind of big cliff right there

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.949 
has this kind of big cliff right there
big<00:03:40.769> overhang<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:42.329> doesn't<00:03:42.599> go<00:03:42.659> forward

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
big overhang and it doesn't go forward

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.559 
big overhang and it doesn't go forward
very<00:03:43.169> far<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.189> it's<00:03:44.400> kind<00:03:44.669> of<00:03:44.699> weird<00:03:44.879> and<00:03:45.090> in

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
very far so it's kind of weird and in

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.259 
very far so it's kind of weird and in
the<00:03:45.659> back<00:03:45.979> has<00:03:46.979> this<00:03:47.129> is<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.280> humpback<00:03:48.030> thing

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
the back has this is the humpback thing

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.879 
the back has this is the humpback thing
going<00:03:48.540> on<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.989> just<00:03:49.229> it's<00:03:49.560> kind<00:03:49.799> of

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
going on it just it's kind of

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.259 
going on it just it's kind of
weird-looking<00:03:50.189> it's<00:03:50.639> not<00:03:50.819> really<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.239> right

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
weird-looking it's not really the right

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.789 
weird-looking it's not really the right
shape<00:03:52.009> way<00:03:53.009> too<00:03:53.069> much<00:03:53.340> back<00:03:53.549> not<00:03:53.759> enough<00:03:54.030> chest

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
shape way too much back not enough chest

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.349 
shape way too much back not enough chest
but<00:03:55.799> that's<00:03:56.009> it<00:03:56.189> it<00:03:56.459> does<00:03:56.669> have<00:03:56.879> some<00:03:57.060> side<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
but that's it it does have some side to

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.059 
but that's it it does have some side to
side<00:03:57.540> motion<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.049> that's<00:03:58.229> nice<00:03:58.439> actually<00:03:58.799> it's

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
side motion so that's nice actually it's

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.979 
side motion so that's nice actually it's
a<00:03:59.099> good<00:03:59.280> range<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.549> motion<00:03:59.699> they're<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.780> kind

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
a good range of motion they're just kind

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.479 
a good range of motion they're just kind
of<00:04:01.049> awkward<00:04:01.199> overall<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.979> already<00:04:02.280> talked

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
of awkward overall I already talked

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.679 
of awkward overall I already talked
about<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:02.759> hips<00:04:02.969> the<00:04:03.120> thighs<00:04:03.150> swivels

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
about the hips the thighs swivels

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.140 
about the hips the thighs swivels
built-in<00:04:04.049> double<00:04:04.799> jointed<00:04:05.129> knees<00:04:05.189> now<00:04:06.090> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
built-in double jointed knees now the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.520 
built-in double jointed knees now the
foot<00:04:06.449> is<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.659> same<00:04:06.840> as<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.169> new<00:04:07.319> Marvel

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
foot is the same as the new Marvel

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.490 
foot is the same as the new Marvel
Legends<00:04:07.979> design<00:04:08.400> there's<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:09.030> disc<00:04:09.599> hinge<00:04:10.139> in

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
Legends design there's the disc hinge in

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.679 
Legends design there's the disc hinge in
there<00:04:10.859> and<00:04:11.069> then<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.699> peg<00:04:11.909> goes<00:04:12.120> forward<00:04:12.539> and

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
there and then the peg goes forward and

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.959 
there and then the peg goes forward and
the<00:04:12.750> foot<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.139> it<00:04:13.259> can<00:04:13.409> rotate<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:14.159> that

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
the foot so it can rotate like that

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:16.580 
the foot so it can rotate like that
which<00:04:15.479> I<00:04:15.599> still<00:04:15.780> don't<00:04:15.989> particularly<00:04:16.320> care

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
which I still don't particularly care

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.379 
which I still don't particularly care
for<00:04:17.009> it's<00:04:17.159> better<00:04:17.310> than<00:04:17.489> no<00:04:17.639> ankle<00:04:17.969> rocker<00:04:18.180> at

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
for it's better than no ankle rocker at

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.479 
for it's better than no ankle rocker at
all<00:04:18.539> but<00:04:19.349> it<00:04:19.560> pushed<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.949> foot<00:04:20.130> at<00:04:20.219> a<00:04:20.280> weird

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
all but it pushed the foot at a weird

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.250 
all but it pushed the foot at a weird
angle<00:04:20.699> you<00:04:21.030> can't<00:04:21.239> just<00:04:21.419> give<00:04:21.570> them<00:04:21.719> you<00:04:22.049> can't

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
angle you can't just give them you can't

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.620 
angle you can't just give them you can't
just<00:04:22.409> turn<00:04:22.889> his<00:04:23.039> foot<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.969> have<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.240> turn<00:04:24.449> it

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
just turn his foot you have to turn it

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.160 
just turn his foot you have to turn it
and<00:04:24.779> then<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.110> also<00:04:25.260> moves<00:04:25.620> it

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
and then it also moves it

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.080 
and then it also moves it
angle<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.070> it's<00:04:27.190> kind<00:04:27.400> of<00:04:27.460> not<00:04:27.640> very<00:04:27.880> natural

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
angle so it's kind of not very natural

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.200 
angle so it's kind of not very natural
so<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:28.750> don't<00:04:28.960> care<00:04:29.110> for<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:29.500> be<00:04:29.590> honest

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
so I don't care for it to be honest

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.670 
so I don't care for it to be honest
so<00:04:31.210> he's<00:04:31.330> not<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.510> bad<00:04:31.750> figure<00:04:32.200> he's<00:04:32.470> just

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
so he's not a bad figure he's just

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.710 
so he's not a bad figure he's just
there's<00:04:33.550> not<00:04:33.670> a<00:04:33.730> whole<00:04:34.000> lot<00:04:34.210> that's<00:04:34.330> actually

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
there's not a whole lot that's actually

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.940 
there's not a whole lot that's actually
good<00:04:35.140> about<00:04:35.530> him

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
good about him

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.400 
good about him
so<00:04:36.910> am<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.150> gonna<00:04:37.300> recommend<00:04:37.660> it<00:04:37.960> I<00:04:38.140> am<00:04:38.380> just

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
so am I gonna recommend it I am just

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.400 
so am I gonna recommend it I am just
because<00:04:39.010> it's<00:04:39.520> a<00:04:39.820> pretty<00:04:40.270> solid<00:04:40.600> cat<00:04:41.050> figure

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
because it's a pretty solid cat figure

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.290 
because it's a pretty solid cat figure
there's<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.920> lot<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.190> problems<00:04:42.670> so<00:04:43.150> if

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
there's just a lot of problems so if

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.840 
there's just a lot of problems so if
you're<00:04:43.540> if<00:04:44.380> you're<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.680> completist<00:04:45.250> by<00:04:45.700> all

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
you're if you're a completist by all

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.000 
you're if you're a completist by all
means<00:04:46.090> get<00:04:46.420> it<00:04:46.600> if<00:04:47.050> you're<00:04:47.260> only<00:04:47.440> getting<00:04:47.740> it

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
means get it if you're only getting it

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.260 
means get it if you're only getting it
to<00:04:48.190> get<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.460> because<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.850> really<00:04:49.120> good

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
to get it because it's a really good

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.030 
to get it because it's a really good
figure<00:04:49.570> then<00:04:49.810> probably<00:04:50.260> pass<00:04:50.500> on<00:04:50.770> it

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
figure then probably pass on it

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.680 
figure then probably pass on it
so<00:04:51.400> there<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:51.700> guys<00:04:51.910> thanks<00:04:52.240> for<00:04:52.300> watching
