ribbon<00:06:54.230> right<00:06:55.230> here<00:06:55.530> at<00:06:55.590> the<00:06:55.710> opening<00:06:56.250> where

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
ribbon right here at the opening where

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.690 
ribbon right here at the opening where
the<00:06:58.140> golden<00:06:58.770> hardware<00:06:59.160> you<00:06:59.370> know<00:06:59.460> there's<00:06:59.640> a

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
the golden hardware you know there's a

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.000 
the golden hardware you know there's a
like<00:07:00.060> a<00:07:00.090> ring<00:07:00.360> a<00:07:00.630> circle<00:07:01.110> and<00:07:01.290> then<00:07:01.470> you<00:07:01.620> have<00:07:01.800> a

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
like a ring a circle and then you have a

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.250 
like a ring a circle and then you have a
golden<00:07:02.280> chain<00:07:02.490> coming<00:07:02.760> out<00:07:02.880> so<00:07:03.120> I<00:07:03.360> just<00:07:03.870> cover

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
golden chain coming out so I just cover

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.100 
golden chain coming out so I just cover
it<00:07:04.440> I<00:07:04.560> wrap<00:07:04.860> it<00:07:04.890> around<00:07:05.100> with<00:07:05.520> just<00:07:06.480> Moschino

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
it I wrap it around with just Moschino

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.070 
it I wrap it around with just Moschino
ribbon<00:07:07.410> that<00:07:07.620> was<00:07:07.890> used<00:07:08.130> to<00:07:08.340> close<00:07:08.640> the<00:07:08.820> bag

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
ribbon that was used to close the bag

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.830 
ribbon that was used to close the bag
tight<00:07:10.080> and<00:07:10.550> so<00:07:11.550> basically<00:07:12.030> the<00:07:12.300> goal<00:07:12.510> doesn't

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
tight and so basically the goal doesn't

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.470 
tight and so basically the goal doesn't
rub<00:07:13.200> against<00:07:14.040> each<00:07:14.130> other<00:07:14.400> you<00:07:14.910> know<00:07:15.030> against

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480 
rub against each other you know against

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.820 
rub against each other you know against
one<00:07:15.690> another<00:07:15.720> so<00:07:16.080> the<00:07:16.169> chain<00:07:16.380> doesn't<00:07:16.560> rub

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
one another so the chain doesn't rub

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.400 
one another so the chain doesn't rub
against<00:07:17.130> the<00:07:17.700> golden<00:07:18.030> ring<00:07:18.210> so<00:07:18.870> that<00:07:18.900> the

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.410 
against the golden ring so that the

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.060 
against the golden ring so that the
golden<00:07:20.010> hardware<00:07:20.370> kind<00:07:21.090> of<00:07:21.240> can<00:07:22.020> be<00:07:22.620> preserved

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070 
golden hardware kind of can be preserved

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.420
