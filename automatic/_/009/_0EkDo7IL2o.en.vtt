00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 a king kong or king kong 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.379
 it is released from the feet to obviate 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.139
 on the hands to overcome the obstacle the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.900
 dash does the exact opposite, it is released 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.059
 to throw the feet forward and behind 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.000
 hands to overcome later 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.189
 the obstacle because I say this is 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.220
 quite complex for the simple 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.810
 fact that if you do n't have a complete one 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.820
 security of one's momentum 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.070
 own trajectory in addition to getting hurt i 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.510
 wrists you can risk a fall of 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.890
 back in front or behind state then 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 try to assimilate what is there 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.629
 I will explain today in this tutorial e 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.170
 later when I do a focus on 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.570
 about this tweak try to 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.520
 work a lot on the exercises for 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.710
 lose the fear of doing this 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.710
 movement but now we move to action 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.559
 the desktop scores a lot 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.840
 particular needs a running start 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.030
 quite enough charge for 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.570
 allow the body to rush with 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.430
 all the strength over the obstacle 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.070
 thrusting her legs in front of evening not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.010
 the legs are completely extended though 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.950
 they need a momentum like they do 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.650
 is giving a kick know something 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.890
 momentum to see as always describe a 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.700
 bow an arc of fall that allows me 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.410
 to jump a little as if you want 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.410
 to land on the state while sitting 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.710
 this attitude obviously for 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.079
 finished in the sense one rushes as if 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.390
 you must fall on the state with your butt 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.670
 holding it up to the expense but just before 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.930
 hands fall from falling to grip 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.659
 to allow the body 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.479
 amortization similar to that of the 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.970
 speed ball and thus overcome the momentum 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.539
 of the legs if it were not a dacha 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.539
 box 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.490
 the direction in which you will launch 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.560
 Important links because you won't have to 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.030
 be towards the ground but in front 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.190
 to you if it won't be otherwise I can 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.810
 to do what is down and therefore not 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.400
 you will be able to re - launch into 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.400
 safety beyond the obstacle 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.240
 then also for today it's all and I hope to 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.490
 having been useful for this trick vi 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.050
 you have been waiting for the last for a long time 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.060
 tips that I can give you as I already have 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.270
 said is to take a nice momentum with 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.040
 legs stretched out by at least one 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.050
 quite the length of your leg 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.910
 stretched out so you can no longer loose 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.550
 far from this it happens to do the 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.050
 comment 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.480
 also remember to take this 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.610
 arc of fall as always on the stack 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.610
 olho that you aim perfect
