00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 it's worth more a clinical tip to teach 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.859
 something about clinical photographs 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.070
 I use a canoe off in which they put 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.519
 until names of three a rebel of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.189
 three for three children 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.189
 a macro 105 millimeters 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 macro 100 millimeters 1 for 118 and a 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.870
 circular flash m14x of canon 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.879
 it is very important that the flash be 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.100
 exactly this flash that is the flash 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.520
 that I was going to totally agree 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.890
 with the camera to adjust the good I'll 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.920
 to put the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.980
 speed in 1 to 30 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.909
 in this wheel you can change the values 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:01:02.200
 of the speed I'm going to put one for 30 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:04.480
 the f-22 if I pressed this button abi 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.760
 I do the same thing I can change the value of 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.060
 F 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.680
 the apartment will be in a car 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.500
 and everything else normal this is the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.689
 sensitivity or the size of the image to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.270
 I like to use the s1 which is enough 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.030
 for classes and to save everything 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.850
 it is possible the machine must be in the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.390
 manual so that I can get these two 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.320
 good things good patient position 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.480
 than the separator but vice versa when 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.600
 I put it backwards close we can well 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.110
 upside down it's going to separate a little bit higher 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.110
 high 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.700
 I'm going to take a camera 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.700
 in this position 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.930
 I'm going to press the button to the middle 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.920
 [Music] 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.119
 until you have the focus 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.270
 and there is the result of this photo ja 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.270
 ja 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.840
 now for eyepiece photos 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.940
 higher 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:21.080
 work is to evaluate for f-16 and f-18 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.080
 for 2018 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.640
 I'll be watching from above look 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.640
 the position as it looks 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.790
 high the result the photo cross to 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.620
 Exterior 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.340
 [Music] 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.080
 then lower kursaal side can give 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.080
 the return to the separator 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.209
 and there is the position 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.780
 is the result and now the photos 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.780
 side 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.180
 when I'm with him but it's good 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.080
 remember that sometimes you have to put 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.160
 a little air in the mirror 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.110
 the f16 must be changed again at f 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.950
 22 or 25 let me take the picture again 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.950
 which was called here 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.819
 there is the result of the photo 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:53.230
 He is like Christ on the other side of 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.230
 us while hours 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.860
 Good Morning 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.140
 [Music] 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.819
 there is the result 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.800
 and this is the setting for the photos 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.240
 unlikely that are the photos that 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.790
 we take out all the times and other 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.070
 important after removing all the 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.180
 forms sequences patient photos I'm going 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.180
 to take a picture 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.090
 of the clinical record 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.000
 so they have the patient's name 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.130
 I have marked after many photos 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.669
 thanks for the help with nitro photos 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.260
 orally with the pib the oral photos of 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.160
 the patients and before us 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.160
 Thank you
