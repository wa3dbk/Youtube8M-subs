00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.190 
resting it served as a good way to show
you<00:04:25.670> how<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.880> characters<00:04:26.330> had<00:04:26.480> grown<00:04:26.720> since<00:04:27.080> I

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
you how the characters had grown since I

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.050 
you how the characters had grown since I
last<00:04:27.230> meeting<00:04:27.770> and<00:04:27.980> it<00:04:28.100> really<00:04:28.310> showed<00:04:28.700> what

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
last meeting and it really showed what

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.790 
last meeting and it really showed what
garish<00:04:29.390> as<00:04:29.570> tyranny<00:04:29.990> really<00:04:30.320> meant<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.590> throw

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
garish as tyranny really meant to throw

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.130 
garish as tyranny really meant to throw
and<00:04:31.160> Jaina<00:04:31.760> being<00:04:32.030> slightly<00:04:32.360> psychotic<00:04:32.780> was

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
and Jaina being slightly psychotic was

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.080 
and Jaina being slightly psychotic was
very<00:04:33.320> intriguing<00:04:33.770> do<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.640> think<00:04:34.970> this

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
very intriguing do I think this

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.610 
very intriguing do I think this
cinematic<00:04:35.450> was<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.810> good<00:04:36.050> close<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:36.500> the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
cinematic was a good close to the

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.280 
cinematic was a good close to the
expansion<00:04:36.950> no<00:04:37.940> because<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.780> don't<00:04:38.840> think<00:04:39.170> it

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
expansion no because I don't think it

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.260 
expansion no because I don't think it
will<00:04:39.470> not<00:04:40.100> killing<00:04:40.430> garish<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:40.790> instead

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
will not killing garish and instead

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.330 
will not killing garish and instead
deciding<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.840> put<00:04:41.990> him<00:04:42.080> on<00:04:42.170> trial<00:04:42.500> in<00:04:42.740> Pandaria

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
deciding to put him on trial in Pandaria

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.740 
deciding to put him on trial in Pandaria
makes<00:04:43.550> me<00:04:43.700> think<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:43.970> there's<00:04:44.180> still<00:04:44.300> just<00:04:44.480> a

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
makes me think that there's still just a

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.630 
makes me think that there's still just a
little<00:04:44.930> bit<00:04:45.050> left<00:04:45.290> in<00:04:45.470> mr.<00:04:45.770> Pandaria<00:04:46.280> for<00:04:46.460> us

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
little bit left in mr. Pandaria for us

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.670 
little bit left in mr. Pandaria for us
although<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.360> have<00:04:47.510> no<00:04:47.720> clue<00:04:47.930> for<00:04:48.200> what<00:04:48.320> ideas

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
although I have no clue for what ideas

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.380 
although I have no clue for what ideas
of<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.830> whole<00:04:48.980> patch<00:04:49.250> Blizzard<00:04:49.730> might<00:04:49.910> have<00:04:50.120> I
