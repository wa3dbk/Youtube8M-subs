00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hey, how are youtube friends today? 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.560
 I'm going to teach how to play that song 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.660
 damn moment you're not going to like 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.400
 I must confess that you will not like it for 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.620
 I became one of my favorite groups 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.630
 claws so super good their songs and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.120
 we have also there the song of a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.140
 nine o'clock so far and now we're going to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.640
 do this so well let's start 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.560
 perfect the standard tuning in the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.480
 guitar you know we have video 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.519
 show too and can also 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.859
 find what would be us the letter with 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.900
 the chords on my page that under the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.030
 description let's start with the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:46.350
 chords we will occupy without minor fa 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:48.649
 sustained lower sun re my again and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.649
 less 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:57.530
 re sharp I say all sharp sorry 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.190
 he has held check I know how he is going to be 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.190
 and now we are explaining fast 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.190
 stosur 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 d 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.440
 I 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.610
 chicken I know how we are going to occupy the dew 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.460
 let's cook our two in what 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.740
 it would be if minor we are going to give two blows 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.130
 down and then we must use 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.410
 the technique up if they do not have what 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.230
 that would be the nib can they put their 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.950
 hand this way and with the fingernail 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:02:00.140
 fat they do what would be the return and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:03.640
 with this year what would be down ok 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.640
 I'm going to start slow 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.990
 again 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.840
 slower 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.930
 ok transforming is going to be slower as 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.820
 I did it right now we started with the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.820
 second part would be equal stanza 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.090
 my minor 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.750
 C sharp 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.390
 to 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.380
 ah 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.090
 perfect this is going to be the circle for 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.340
 everything that would be our part of the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.130
 verse then comes what would be the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.660
 chorus we will use no chord 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.160
 extra che I know how it's going to be 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.160
 first fast then slower 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.760
 do not 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.760
 i 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.110
 or that it will be slower for those who 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.710
 they're starting 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.710
 we started my minor 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.770
 yes 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.530
 2 sharp 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.360
 more sustained 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.109
 my minor 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.910
 without minor 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.400
 Sun 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.400
 F sharp if minor 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:42.240
 perfect after it comes as a small 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:47.300
 inter check I know how well this will do more 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.300
 use the map of what would be 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.770
 and the 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.420
 I will put the forms here the letter and 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.270
 check does not come in the video demonstration 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.630
 is after the sun or the sun or nothing 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.300
 use pure sun 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.400
 and if minor for if they want to do the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.600
 accompaniment of the sun or that part of 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.600
 rec alex diego check yes 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.700
 you 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.919
 and then repeat again what would be 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.919
 The chorus 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.979
 ok we have now thus armed what 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.139
 it would be verse chorus and good this little 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.629
 inter remember that you must master 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.550
 well what it would be for a song what 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.530
 which are practically all circles 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.169
 the songs are circles in what is 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.240
 stanza and chorus so if you master it 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.210
 well then well they are going to be super 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.610
