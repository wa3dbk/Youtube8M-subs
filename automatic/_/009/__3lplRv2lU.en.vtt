dual<00:00:20.699> rectifier<00:00:22.340> I<00:00:23.480> was<00:00:24.480> very<00:00:24.779> very<00:00:25.080> very

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
dual rectifier I was very very very

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.310 
dual rectifier I was very very very
confused<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:27.330> god<00:00:27.480> I've<00:00:27.570> never<00:00:27.750> used<00:00:27.960> MIDI

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
confused just god I've never used MIDI

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.919 
confused just god I've never used MIDI
before<00:00:29.090> I've<00:00:30.090> been<00:00:30.210> playing<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.689> pretty<00:00:30.840> much

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
before I've been playing for pretty much

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.240 
before I've been playing for pretty much
20<00:00:31.320> years<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.850> kind<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.880> avoided<00:00:33.420> MIDI<00:00:34.250> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
20 years but kind of avoided MIDI and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.850 
20 years but kind of avoided MIDI and
why<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.000> took<00:00:36.450> me<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.809> little<00:00:37.200> while<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.739> get

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
why it took me a little while to get

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.290 
why it took me a little while to get
this<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.640> there<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> lot<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
this going and there was a lot of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.340 
this going and there was a lot of
confusion<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.340> when<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:43.110> first

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
confusion so when you get this the first

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.560 
confusion so when you get this the first
thing<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> want<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.370> hit<00:00:47.780> one<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:50.570> edit

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
thing you want to do is hit one and edit

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.389 
thing you want to do is hit one and edit
at<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> same<00:00:52.050> time<00:00:52.289> both<00:00:52.559> Edit<00:00:52.920> buttons<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
at the same time both Edit buttons and

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.069 
at the same time both Edit buttons and
what<00:00:56.399> it'll<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.059> it'll<00:00:57.270> allow<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
what it'll do is it'll allow you to

when<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.680> hit<00:01:11.210> number<00:01:12.210> four<00:01:12.600> for

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
when you do that you hit number four for

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.620 
when you do that you hit number four for
expanders<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.979> then<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.090> scroll<00:01:15.390> down

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
expanders and then you can scroll down

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.800 
expanders and then you can scroll down
you'll<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:15.930> GC<00:01:17.060> x1<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> turn

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
you'll see GC x1 and you want to turn

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.649 
you'll see GC x1 and you want to turn
that<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.310> that's<00:01:20.310> about<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.790> far<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.270> got<00:01:21.450> for

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that on that's about as far as I got for

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
that on that's about as far as I got for
the<00:01:21.720> longest<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.460> what<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> do

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the longest time what you want to do

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
the longest time what you want to do
after<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.130> have

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
after that is I don't think I have

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.039 
after that is I don't think I have
anything<00:01:26.460> set<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.090> number<00:01:27.390> two<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.960> have

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
anything set up on number two you have

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.580 
anything set up on number two you have
to<00:01:28.200> turn<00:01:28.439> turn<00:01:29.100> off<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.520> GC<00:01:30.000> X<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.570> it'll<00:01:31.439> turn

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to turn turn off the GC X and it'll turn

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.350 
to turn turn off the GC X and it'll turn
off<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> ground<00:01:32.159> control<00:01:32.520> Pro<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.090> then

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
off the ground control Pro and then

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.899 
off the ground control Pro and then
it'll<00:01:33.900> restart<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> do<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.729> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
it'll restart then what you do is you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.170 
it'll restart then what you do is you
hit<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.750> right<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.170> here's<00:01:37.439> one<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
hit like right here here's one of the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.200 
hit like right here here's one of the
just<00:01:39.180> default<00:01:40.220> settings<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.579> it'll<00:01:41.759> say<00:01:41.909> twin

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
just default settings so it'll say twin

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.289 
just default settings so it'll say twin
cores<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.790> select<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.960> first<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:47.299> then

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
cores so you select that first and then

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.520 
cores so you select that first and then
you<00:01:48.420> hold<00:01:48.659> down<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.110> edit<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.000> then<00:01:51.530> it'll

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you hold down on edit and then it'll

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.990 
you hold down on edit and then it'll
tell<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.700> have

tracks<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.780> set<00:01:54.960> up<00:01:55.049> here<00:01:55.170> there's<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.439> plan<00:01:55.979> on

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
tracks is set up here there's a plan on

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.649 
tracks is set up here there's a plan on
getting<00:01:56.250> one<00:01:56.490> later<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:59.119> hit<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> banks

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
getting one later and you hit the banks

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.690 
getting one later and you hit the banks
down<00:02:01.670> until<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> get<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> GC<00:02:03.360> x1<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.610> you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
down until you get the GC x1 so what you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.850 
down until you get the GC x1 so what you
can<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:06.000> there<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:08.569> five<00:02:09.569> six<00:02:10.259> seven<00:02:10.770> and

seven eight or whatever you know
combination<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.030> want<00:02:41.270> on<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.020> gcx<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
combination you want on the gcx and you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.130 
combination you want on the gcx and you
do<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.390> output<00:02:44.960> so<00:02:45.200> out<00:02:46.210> /no<00:02:47.210> so

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
do that on the output so out /no so

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.700 
do that on the output so out /no so
we're<00:02:48.350> back<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:50.270> ground<00:02:50.540> control<00:02:51.170> Pro<00:02:51.440> on

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
we're back on the ground control Pro on

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.110 
we're back on the ground control Pro on
the<00:02:51.830> GC<00:02:52.250> x1<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.810> can<00:02:53.960> set<00:02:54.140> up<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.650> GC<00:02:55.580> X's<00:02:55.910> so

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
the GC x1 you can set up to GC X's so

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.240 
the GC x1 you can set up to GC X's so
you<00:02:56.600> can<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.900> multiple<00:02:57.290> things<00:02:57.710> plugged<00:02:58.070> in

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
you can have multiple things plugged in

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.350 
you can have multiple things plugged in
so<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.390> now<00:02:59.770> well<00:03:00.770> say<00:03:01.040> like<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.910> default

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
so right now well say like the default

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.640 
so right now well say like the default
on<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.870> dual<00:03:03.410> rectifier<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.190> two<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.780> let's

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
on the dual rectifier is two so let's

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.620 
on the dual rectifier is two so let's
change<00:03:07.070> this<00:03:07.490> to<00:03:07.790> three<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:10.630> channel

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
change this to three so this is channel

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.080 
change this to three so this is channel
1<00:03:11.810> 2<00:03:12.110> 3<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.830> then<00:03:13.130> boost<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:14.570> why<00:03:15.260> it's<00:03:15.440> 7

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
1 2 3 and then boost so why it's 7

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.200 
1 2 3 and then boost so why it's 7
that'll<00:03:17.090> light<00:03:17.240> it<00:03:17.360> up<00:03:17.480> here<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:19.000> light<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.120> up

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
that'll light it up here and light it up

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:29.380 
that'll light it up here and light it up
there<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:23.330> I<00:03:23.780> also<00:03:23.960> have<00:03:24.760> one<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:26.060> have<00:03:28.390> an

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
there and I also have one I have an

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.340 
there and I also have one I have an
Ibanez<00:03:29.930> ts9<00:03:30.470> setup<00:03:31.270> so<00:03:32.270> we'll<00:03:32.600> say<00:03:32.930> that'll

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
Ibanez ts9 setup so we'll say that'll

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.010 
Ibanez ts9 setup so we'll say that'll
turn<00:03:33.560> on<00:03:34.240> channel<00:03:35.240> 3

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
turn on channel 3

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.700 
turn on channel 3
and<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:37.490> tube<00:03:37.880> scream<00:03:38.210> at<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.420> same<00:03:38.600> time<00:03:38.810> so

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
and the tube scream at the same time so

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.860 
and the tube scream at the same time so
if<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:39.890> just<00:03:40.100> want<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> set<00:03:40.550> like<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.880> know<00:03:41.000> have

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
if I just want to set like you know have

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.420 
if I just want to set like you know have
that<00:03:41.900> set<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.710> can<00:03:43.510> hit<00:03:44.510> edit<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.170> I'll<00:03:46.160> just<00:03:46.280> do

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
that set I can hit edit and I'll just do

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.990 
that set I can hit edit and I'll just do
that<00:03:46.460> there<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.050> I'll<00:03:48.050> say<00:03:48.230> yes<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.970> then<00:03:49.970> I

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
that there and I'll say yes and then I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.110 
that there and I'll say yes and then I
can<00:03:50.270> go<00:03:50.870> through<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.830> can<00:03:52.040> rename<00:03:52.490> it<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.880> so

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
can go through and I can rename it to so

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.300 
can go through and I can rename it to so
I<00:03:53.180> can<00:03:53.590> hold<00:03:54.590> down<00:03:54.620> edit<00:03:56.770> and<00:03:57.770> I<00:03:57.830> can<00:03:57.860> go<00:03:58.070> here

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
I can hold down edit and I can go here

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.700 
I can hold down edit and I can go here
and<00:03:58.490> I<00:03:58.520> can<00:03:58.700> rename<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.240> and<00:03:59.420> to<00:04:00.170> rename<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.530> you

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
and I can rename it and to rename it you

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.580 
and I can rename it and to rename it you
just<00:04:01.010> cycle<00:04:01.730> through<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.320> these<00:04:03.320> are<00:04:03.470> the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
just cycle through the these are the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.710 
just cycle through the these are the
cycle<00:04:04.010> through<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.430> letters<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:07.630> then<00:04:08.630> you

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
cycle through the letters and then you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.740 
cycle through the letters and then you
can<00:04:08.870> go<00:04:08.990> up<00:04:09.020> and<00:04:09.380> down<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.980> choose<00:04:10.280> your<00:04:10.750> stuff

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
can go up and down and choose your stuff

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.210 
can go up and down and choose your stuff
and<00:04:11.990> then<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:12.200> save<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:12.740> just<00:04:12.920> hit<00:04:13.070> edit

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
and then to save it you just hit edit

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.300 
and then to save it you just hit edit
and<00:04:13.490> then<00:04:14.330> yes<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:15.050> save

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
and then yes to save

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.930 
and then yes to save
hmm<00:04:16.820> so<00:04:17.780> if<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:17.930> look<00:04:18.079> right<00:04:18.440> now<00:04:18.549> on<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.790> dual

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
hmm so if you look right now on the dual

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.300 
hmm so if you look right now on the dual
rectifier<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:20.540> have<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.109> on<00:04:21.230> you<00:04:21.980> can<00:04:22.130> see

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
rectifier I have it on you can see

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.530 
rectifier I have it on you can see
channel<00:04:23.260> 1<00:04:24.260> is<00:04:24.290> lit<00:04:24.620> up<00:04:25.120> alright<00:04:26.120> sorry<00:04:26.360> that's

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
channel 1 is lit up alright sorry that's

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.000 
channel 1 is lit up alright sorry that's
3<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:29.680> now<00:04:30.680> as<00:04:30.889> I<00:04:31.040> hit<00:04:31.639> through<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.060> different

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
3 and now as I hit through the different

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.950 
3 and now as I hit through the different
buttons<00:04:34.010> here<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:35.290> can<00:04:36.290> cycle<00:04:36.530> through<00:04:36.740> on<00:04:37.310> the

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
buttons here I can cycle through on the

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.220 
buttons here I can cycle through on the
different<00:04:38.960> channels<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:41.000> dual<00:04:41.780> rectifier

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
different channels of the dual rectifier

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.400 
different channels of the dual rectifier
that<00:04:43.990> is<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.320> simplest<00:04:45.770> way<00:04:45.980> to<00:04:46.040> set<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.580> up

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
that is the simplest way to set this up

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.230 
that is the simplest way to set this up
and<00:04:48.610> believe<00:04:49.610> me<00:04:49.729> there<00:04:49.880> was<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.000> lot<00:04:50.210> of

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
and believe me there was a lot of

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.540 
and believe me there was a lot of
confusion<00:04:50.510> that<00:04:51.550> actually<00:04:52.550> went<00:04:52.760> into<00:04:52.910> this

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
confusion that actually went into this

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.780 
confusion that actually went into this
since<00:04:55.550> again<00:04:55.880> I<00:04:55.910> have<00:04:56.150> never<00:04:56.389> used<00:04:56.660> MIDI<00:04:56.990> so

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
since again I have never used MIDI so

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.070 
since again I have never used MIDI so
hopefully<00:04:58.790> this<00:04:58.970> will<00:04:59.120> help<00:04:59.180> you<00:04:59.419> guys<00:04:59.600> out<00:04:59.870> if

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
hopefully this will help you guys out if

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.450 
hopefully this will help you guys out if
you're<00:05:00.320> looking<00:05:00.590> to<00:05:00.860> set<00:05:01.070> up<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.310> dual

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
you're looking to set up the dual

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:09.969 
you're looking to set up the dual
rectifier<00:05:06.460> with<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:08.560> gcx<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:09.800> ground

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
rectifier with the gcx and ground

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.610 
rectifier with the gcx and ground
control<00:05:10.430> Pro<00:05:10.750> eventually<00:05:11.750> I'm<00:05:12.110> gonna<00:05:12.380> get

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
control Pro eventually I'm gonna get

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.740 
control Pro eventually I'm gonna get
more<00:05:12.889> detailed<00:05:13.430> with<00:05:13.639> it<00:05:14.440> not<00:05:15.440> sure<00:05:16.570> for<00:05:17.570> the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
more detailed with it not sure for the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.880 
more detailed with it not sure for the
1074<00:05:18.740> gate<00:05:19.040> I<00:05:19.220> might<00:05:19.430> actually<00:05:19.610> set<00:05:20.060> up<00:05:20.090> -<00:05:20.890> so

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
1074 gate I might actually set up - so

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:28.409 
1074 gate I might actually set up - so
like<00:05:23.740> channel<00:05:24.740> 1<00:05:24.919> channel<00:05:25.250> 2<00:05:25.789> as<00:05:26.979> separate

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
like channel 1 channel 2 as separate
