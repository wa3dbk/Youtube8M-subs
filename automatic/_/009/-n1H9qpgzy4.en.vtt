00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.339 
what like the speed deterioration and
all<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.830> stuff<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.720> keep<00:00:27.720> watching<00:00:28.140> for

all that stuff and keep watching for

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.359 
all that stuff and keep watching for
this<00:00:29.330> firstly<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.599> got<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.960> ports<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
this firstly we got the ports so that

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
this firstly we got the ports so that
one's<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> MagSafe<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
one's the MagSafe this is for the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.790 
one's the MagSafe this is for the
ethernet<00:00:34.410> cable<00:00:34.890> that's<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> VGA

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
ethernet cable that's for the VGA

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.889 
ethernet cable that's for the VGA
external<00:00:37.800> monitor<00:00:38.190> then<00:00:39.120> there's<00:00:39.329> two<00:00:39.510> USB

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
external monitor then there's two USB

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.130 
external monitor then there's two USB
ports<00:00:40.550> an<00:00:41.550> audio<00:00:42.059> jack<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.899> Kensington

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
ports an audio jack and a Kensington

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.670 
ports an audio jack and a Kensington
lock<00:00:43.500> system<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.390> these<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> these<00:00:46.620> are

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
lock system so these are the these are

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.860 
lock system so these are the these are
the<00:00:46.800> ports<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.180> MacBook<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.539> there<00:00:48.780> is

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the ports for the MacBook and there is

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590 
the ports for the MacBook and there is
none<00:00:48.960> left<00:00:49.079> inside<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.030> honestly<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.090> reckon

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
none left inside and honestly I reckon

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720 
none left inside and honestly I reckon
is<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.140> shape<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.010> you've<00:00:53.550> already

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is this shape of it like you've already

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.910 
is this shape of it like you've already
noticed<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> shape<00:00:54.420> by<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.530> completely

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
noticed a shape by now it is completely

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.209 
noticed a shape by now it is completely
different<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.300> older<00:00:57.600> Mac<00:00:57.750> books<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
different to the older Mac books and

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.770 
different to the older Mac books and
then<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> looks<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.149> good

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
then it looks so good

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.189 
then it looks so good
these<00:01:01.469> ones<00:01:01.760> it's<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> safe<00:01:03.329> bar<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:03.870> cable

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
these ones it's like a safe bar or cable

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
these ones it's like a safe bar or cable
I<00:01:04.379> guess<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.619> could<00:01:04.739> say<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:05.640> honestly

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
I guess you could say right honestly

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.160

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and especially laptops and of course and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.980 
and especially laptops and of course and
um<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:36.740> fire<00:01:37.740> pretty<00:01:38.130> awesome<00:01:38.810> anyway<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
um just fire pretty awesome anyway so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.889 
um just fire pretty awesome anyway so
but<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.950> stickers<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.899> that's

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
but the little stickers there that's

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.069 
but the little stickers there that's
just<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.610> um<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> put<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:45.899> wrist

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
just for um like when you put your wrist

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.130 
just for um like when you put your wrist
there<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> surface<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.399> glossy<00:01:48.140> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
there because the surface is glossy it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.929 
there because the surface is glossy it
just<00:01:49.380> helps<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> reduce<00:01:50.130> friction<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.759> guess

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
just helps to reduce friction I guess

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.590 
just helps to reduce friction I guess
and<00:01:51.149> yeah<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:53.280> some<00:01:53.820> questions<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.390> had

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and yeah so some questions that I had

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.740 
and yeah so some questions that I had
earlier<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.369> surface<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.909> glossy<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
earlier on the surface is glossy but the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.050 
earlier on the surface is glossy but the
trackpad<00:01:58.049> itself<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.920> um<00:01:59.219> smooth<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.820> not<00:01:59.939> go

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
trackpad itself is um smooth it's not go

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.300 
trackpad itself is um smooth it's not go
through<00:02:00.210> its<00:02:00.899> our<00:02:01.110> forefinger<00:02:01.500> multi-touch
