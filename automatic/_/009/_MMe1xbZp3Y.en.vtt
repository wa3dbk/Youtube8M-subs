 being here 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.290
 and it remains to be done 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 the three operating systems that 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.510
 we have the most people 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.970
 if you want in matute the engine room or the referee will download 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.530

 Well, as mine is windows, I invite you sexist 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.510
 the file that you download 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.290
 once downloaded you have to unzip it 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.170
 extract the matter 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.170
 and that welcomes from this program 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.690
 we're going to see what it is 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.799
 my dad is this 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.599
 what you have to do the first thing you have to do is now in stage 8m 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.279
 i after 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:16.729
 already a device 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.699
 they have to connect the cable 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.189
 Once it is sold at once, get to know the computer 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.189
 something ekin and that is open to childhood 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.569
 if it has to be opened 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.849
 and it ends August if it is in knowing 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.140
 and if you do not choose to go forward because it connects and roots 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.159
 good 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.169
 percent already starting this 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:40.400
 we put here 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.899
 in preparing 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.559
 the psoe 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.499
 when we click 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.549
 p 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.549
 from 6 to 8 due to the slowdown in investment 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.779
 the first tie with three seconds that were for what 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.439
 so that they prepare 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.519
 finished this seconds 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.519
 I feel a few seconds where you have to leave 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.769
 held down 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.409
 the squad of figures 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.699
 is an example that love its reach that has proclaimed 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.869
 finished the campaign 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.279
 then they have to leave behind let's press a button 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:16.379
 two weeks pointed 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.439
 after they have those two organs 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.819
 although said municipalities that now pachuca must do better 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.629
 that his only engine that he already made in the fruitless 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.769
 I think they play without leaving 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.949
 - Andean 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.049
 Israel has to be a personal connection 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.439
 they are two seconds debuted in the cinema 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.449
 well the ten seconds 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.809
 while pressing the send button 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.909
 after a very disturbing shock the 10 seconds until 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:46.889
 finish 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.039
 after 10 seconds, 15 seconds follow 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.359
 when you have to release it just look at it so elusive 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.720
 i the button leave 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.829
 so I have left 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.139
 that is, they are three 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.249
 stages 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.839
 where to decide 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.539
 the headquarters in the second that are ten seconds 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.629
 platini that the state approves quickly 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.029
 after the 15 seconds where nothing else has to be hurried the young 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:14.899
 we are going to give it well 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.659
 tallahassee seconds he said 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.190
 after and in another order 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.489
 picture andes liter 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.139
 this is over and if in the 10 seconds 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.550
 and rushing at the same time the vote is to say 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.969
 hilde johnson 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:31.199
 they finish 10 seconds and nothing else 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.490
 they leave passionate of young vote 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.349
 and he has to jump the crime 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.120
 after sustains who rented king who already begins to prepare since the bei 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.770
 the Swiss program the sixth is not what they have to do is this 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.610
 because you can not mix an issue 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.610
 tried figs or whatever 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.050
 there are risks and vulnerability 2 but not 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.129
 they will always defend like this 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.259
 free as the things do not colegiarse perfect start 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.710
 only the people who 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.080
 and you could still young 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.509
 of fabric 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.430
 for the same reason 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.629
 geek perkins 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:12.999
 i simon 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:16.789
 because he is the oldest of them we have things that they have no objections to 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.930
 paying 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.240
 it can also be your victory 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.240
 of abandonment on the applications that we acted 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.949
 although the scarce coverage 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.770
 until here is behind 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.770
 giving away the actor not to be mixed 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.099
 they are applications that the house costs money 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.509
 and Croats to have access to enter 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.529
 alfaro cross but with your intuition 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.490
 the expert in the story bop to be beasts 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.050
 Sometimes he pays you 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.319
 the actress spent 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.360
 then it's all friends 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 it's very simple 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.229
 think it well sybase always 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.039
 but that's something very nice pointed 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.770
