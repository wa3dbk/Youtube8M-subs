the cotton balls with the foil paper the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.960 
the cotton balls with the foil paper the
or<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.880> those

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
or you know if you have one of those

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
or you know if you have one of those
jars<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:49.799> twisting<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
jars that I do then I'm twisting and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.830 
jars that I do then I'm twisting and
twisting<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.000> finger<00:01:51.299> even<00:01:51.450> though<00:01:51.689> that's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
twisting my finger even though that's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.410 
twisting my finger even though that's
easier<00:01:52.380> than<00:01:52.740> doing<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> cotton

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
easier than doing it just with a cotton

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.240 
easier than doing it just with a cotton
ball<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.189> still<00:01:56.759> don't<00:01:57.469> like<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.740> because

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
ball but I still don't like that because

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.700 
ball but I still don't like that because
we're<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.180> mommy<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.930> first<00:02:01.200> temple<00:02:01.500> for

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
me

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.819 
me
it<00:02:02.369> leaves<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.270> strong<00:02:03.689> smell<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.590> I've

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
it leaves just a strong smell like I've

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.219 
it leaves just a strong smell like I've
moved<00:02:05.159> all<00:02:05.460> my<00:02:05.490> nail<00:02:05.759> polishes<00:02:06.299> now<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.049> my

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.719 
closet and that's where I do my nails
now<00:02:09.270> because

now because

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.410 
now because
the<00:02:11.060> smell<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:11.930> strong<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.640> was<00:02:14.030> really
