00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.100
 we add 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.020
 mixtures 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.020

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
 the csi coria 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.840
 yes 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.170
 and finally 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
 the things that I started to throw that we already have 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.830
 softened 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 we dilute the gelatin 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.820
 and then 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.920
 we will put it 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.690
 in a recipient 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.690
 in the tray 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.460
 we will have left it in the camera for four hours until it has set 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.580
 and we have it 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.970
 already with the texture 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.290
 of gelatin 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.960
 we reserve 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960
 we put the candidate 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.130
 in the container that I have that next morning 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.660
 so is 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:15.089
 7 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.099
 what we do is 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.510
 little by little it will melt quimixtlan 2 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.069
 the two ingredients until one single 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.129
 when we have everything 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.059
 we propose 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.119
 in a tray 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.119
 scam paper 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.949
 We were going to dodge it 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.359
 so that we stay 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.359
 with a thickness 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.859
