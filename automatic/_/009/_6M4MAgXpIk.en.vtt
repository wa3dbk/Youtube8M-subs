00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.700
 hello and welcome to this video 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.540
 today he plays in pro blog and the topic he has 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.340
 come out is the football world cup yes because 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.070
 there is no talk of another world there is no other 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.279
 World Basketball World Championship 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.380
 for example or of skydiving I think 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.420
 that there is nothing good that is the global loves 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.400
 define it first of all because the world 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.670
 It is an event that takes place every four 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.650
 years where football teams 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.230
 each country face each other in a championship 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.290
 to life or death not actually life 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.630
 death is not a championship who wins 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.219
 more money they arrive and they already earn 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.020
 money but if they win the world win 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.149
 much much more money and 15 lie 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.770
 slick and advantages that the world has 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.320
 can world is an event then that 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.700
 it entertains people besides money 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.200
 that moves although it does not seem that 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.300
 many times they seem to steal us 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.829
 but there are many people who profit 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.719
 of this I the truth that I am one of those who 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.309
 I see very, very, very, very 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.989
 world not only football but the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.550
 world is something that leon encuestitas 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.649
 with your friends and you see it you can look 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.590
 I also do not like or dislike 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.030
 it does not bother me to see them with people vocalize 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.460
 if it is true that this year there is a lot 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.409
 controversial because Brazil is in bad 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.670
 conditions and they are spending after 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.649
 in the world and people are dying 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.170
 of hunger thing that I find fatal but 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.850
 all the countries of the same shit 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.130
 disadvantage that they see him world wide I think 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.840
 that is used a lot to distract the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.850
 people because people when there is football 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.319
 you forget the other problems 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.390
 will sum up that well the people are clear 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.979
 he is happy but you are straining things 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.469
 from behind you do not realize 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.179
 sounded a little bad that not for example 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.399
 I believe that the king applied because 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.509
 started some day and people do not 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.700
 is going to take so much ccoo integral 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.829
 claimed and you will see another example 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.170
 would be that the law of abortion is in fact 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.579
 will confirm already in July is not going to 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.959
 confirm right now and there 's also the 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.360
 world then people are distracted 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.829
 and nobody is going to throw fines for example 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.270
 I did not shave my eyebrows today and 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.340
 nor has there been an account because of 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.319
 world in the mold or distract but not 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.569
 I believe not shaved my eyebrows I 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.399
 I see like that not entertainment anymore and 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.649
 point you do not know what to hit 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.270
 separated in a stadium there is no wanted 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.429
 that is punch with the other team 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.470
 I played football as a child 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.610
 done to the caretaker in a children's team 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.170
 I was always so feminine 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.550
 we go all the championships programs of 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.319
 good now however I get a ball and 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.819
 it scares me 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.890
 What I think is wrong done 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.739
 men's marketing campaign plan 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.109
 they all see football almost all the heteros 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.090
 of women not also compensated 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.890
 then we will propose campaign to 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.799
 that football is seen more by women 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.750
 I say that one proposal would be that the 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.849
 runners were without shirts because 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.590
 If I really like twins and 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.959
 the ankles of the players but not 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.030
 puts me face naked torso would win 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.010
 many points another possibility so that 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.859
 the women went to see them it would be that 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.329
 could they design the clothes of the 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.069
 players that maybe at the end of 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.840
 a survey was made and 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.150
 we could all decide what color 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.950
 would carry in the next season the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.870
 team that I say because soccer 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.730
 feminine is so known to men 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.010
 They like to see women with 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.200
 texts hanging so vote vote explains 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.760
 In short it is outrageous what 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.060
 they win that it is true that they earn it by 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.180
 advertising and everything was justified yet 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.430
 that's a lot of hard money because 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.409
 Imagine that a soccer player 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.840
 he earns so many millions he would give for 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.340
 invest in nuclear weapons or whatever 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.140
 that he was the pincer with so much money 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.720
 it has to look like what you want and it 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.310
 you are giving a cane that you give them 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.230
 that that as the idea one to invest 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.879
 where you should not be charged a country 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.709
 the line late here I was telling you 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.930
 I would like you to tell me what 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.400
 it seems like this of the world I know that almost everything 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.840
 I was very indignant about Brazil 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.730
 but well I always like that I 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.900
 comment and tell me look then I have not 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.489
 fact that you said is wrong and that 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.190
 let's converse as we always have a 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.190
 very friendly and peaceful conversation 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.300
 caputo
