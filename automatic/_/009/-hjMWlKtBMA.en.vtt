actually going to break some more here

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.789 
actually going to break some more here
just<00:03:46.419> so<00:03:46.510> i<00:03:46.540> could<00:03:46.629> hopefully<00:03:47.139> get<00:03:47.470> some<00:03:47.500> more

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.189 
just so i could hopefully get some more
hunger<00:03:48.280> just<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.389> next<00:03:49.540> sandwich<00:03:49.930> doesn't

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
hunger just so the next sandwich doesn't

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.589 
hunger just so the next sandwich doesn't
completely<00:03:50.829> fill<00:03:51.310> us<00:03:51.489> up<00:03:51.669> just<00:03:52.269> because<00:03:52.419> we

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
completely fill us up just because we

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.780 
completely fill us up just because we
have<00:03:53.049> two<00:03:53.410> more<00:03:53.440> sandwiches<00:03:54.129> to<00:03:54.280> go<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:54.760> i

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
have two more sandwiches to go so i

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.670 
have two more sandwiches to go so i
don't<00:03:55.060> really<00:03:55.180> want<00:03:55.389> to<00:03:55.449> have<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.599> get<00:03:55.720> hunger

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
don't really want to have to get hunger

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.009 
don't really want to have to get hunger
again<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.970> we'll<00:03:58.090> try<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.269> break<00:03:58.449> all<00:03:58.629> these<00:03:58.810> it

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
again so we'll try to break all these it

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.240 
again so we'll try to break all these it
really<00:03:59.260> won't<00:03:59.409> take<00:03:59.620> any<00:03:59.829> time<00:04:00.069> whatsoever

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
really won't take any time whatsoever

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.949 
really won't take any time whatsoever
with<00:04:00.819> this<00:04:01.000> haste<00:04:01.239> buff<00:04:01.480> we<00:04:01.629> could<00:04:01.780> probably

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
with this haste buff we could probably

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.199 
with this haste buff we could probably
get<00:04:02.169> all<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.440> obsidian<00:04:02.739> before<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.879> potion

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
get all this obsidian before the potion

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.199 
get all this obsidian before the potion
effect<00:04:04.480> actually<00:04:04.959> wears<00:04:05.199> off<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:06.489> we'll<00:04:06.970> see

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
effect actually wears off so we'll see

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.129 
effect actually wears off so we'll see
if<00:04:07.239> we<00:04:07.389> could<00:04:07.540> do<00:04:07.629> that<00:04:07.659> that<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.019> our

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
if we could do that that is our

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.300 
if we could do that that is our
challenge<00:04:08.319> to<00:04:08.500> get<00:04:08.590> all<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.919> up<00:04:09.040> sitting
