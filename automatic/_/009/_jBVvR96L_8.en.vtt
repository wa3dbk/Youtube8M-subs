00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and that's why they include this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.539 
and that's why they include this
extender<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:55.920> stick<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.369> in

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
extender so you can just stick this in

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.469 
extender so you can just stick this in
here<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.860> use<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.070> so

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
here like this and use it like so

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.030 
here like this and use it like so
otherwise<00:02:00.479> you're<00:02:00.719> really<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:01.799> use

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
otherwise you're really you could use

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.609 
otherwise you're really you could use
maybe<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.880> iphone<00:02:03.299> one<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:04.350> have

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
maybe the iphone one but you really have

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.160 
maybe the iphone one but you really have
to<00:02:04.740> reach<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.159> get<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.399> there<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:06.659> that's

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
to reach to get in there and then that's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.389 
to reach to get in there and then that's
pretty<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> you've<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.160> got<00:02:08.280> your

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
pretty much it you've just got your

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.760 
pretty much it you've just got your
camera<00:02:08.670> cut<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.450> back<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.530> does

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
camera cut out on the back so this does

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.320 
camera cut out on the back so this does
charge<00:02:11.099> your<00:02:11.280> phone<00:02:11.459> let's<00:02:11.730> turn<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.180> you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
charge your phone let's turn it on you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.400 
charge your phone let's turn it on you
can<00:02:12.450> see<00:02:12.599> it's<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:12.840> charging

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
can see it's not charging

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.090 
can see it's not charging
now<00:02:13.820> if<00:02:14.820> i<00:02:14.940> push<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:15.450> will<00:02:16.350> take<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> second

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
now if i push this will take a second

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.050 
now if i push this will take a second
and<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:18.600> should<00:02:18.900> actually<00:02:19.350> charge<00:02:20.060> sometimes

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
and it should actually charge sometimes

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.950 
and it should actually charge sometimes
you<00:02:21.240> have<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.480> hold<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.780> actually<00:02:22.670> there<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.790> go

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
you have to hold it actually there we go

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.900 
you have to hold it actually there we go
holding<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.770> turns<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.730> see

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
holding it it turns on and you can see

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.060 
holding it it turns on and you can see
it's<00:02:27.030> charging<00:02:27.420> now<00:02:27.570> now<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.350> iPhone<00:02:28.920> itself

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
it's charging now now the iPhone itself

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.580 
it's charging now now the iPhone itself
has<00:02:29.760> an<00:02:30.090> eighteen<00:02:30.510> hundred<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.960> ten<00:02:31.140> milliamp

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
has an eighteen hundred and ten milliamp

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.180 
has an eighteen hundred and ten milliamp
hour<00:02:31.770> battery<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.460> iphone<00:02:32.790> 6<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:34.020> is

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
hour battery in the iphone 6 this is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.350 
hour battery in the iphone 6 this is
3100<00:02:35.190> milliamp<00:02:35.550> hour<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.150> about<00:02:36.300> a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
3100 milliamp hour so you get about a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.750 
3100 milliamp hour so you get about a
charge<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:36.990> half<00:02:37.200> out<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.680> roughly<00:02:38.040> so

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
charge and a half out of it roughly so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.910 
charge and a half out of it roughly so
maybe<00:02:39.060> you're<00:02:39.270> done<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.660> ten<00:02:40.110> percent<00:02:40.590> this

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
maybe you're done to ten percent this

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.200 
maybe you're done to ten percent this
should<00:02:41.130> bring<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.430> back<00:02:41.610> up<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> hundred

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
should bring you back up to a hundred

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.540 
should bring you back up to a hundred
and<00:02:42.660> then<00:02:43.110> if<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.350> drop<00:02:43.590> back<00:02:43.770> down<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.070> 50<00:02:44.430> it

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
and then if you drop back down to 50 it

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.220 
and then if you drop back down to 50 it
should<00:02:44.700> bump<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.060> back<00:02:45.150> up<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.480> 100<00:02:45.900> again

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
should bump it back up to 100 again

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.710 
should bump it back up to 100 again
roughly<00:02:47.040> you're<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.300> will<00:02:48.480> vary

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
roughly you're going to it will vary

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.360 
roughly you're going to it will vary
depending<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.320> your<00:02:49.440> usage<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:50.070> sort<00:02:50.310> of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
depending on your usage that sort of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.550 
depending on your usage that sort of
thing<00:02:50.460> but<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.990> pretty<00:02:52.350> decent

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
thing but it's it's pretty decent

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.240 
thing but it's it's pretty decent
feeling<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.310> charges<00:02:53.990> via<00:02:54.990> USB<00:02:55.110> like<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.070> said

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
feeling it charges via USB like I said

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.980 
feeling it charges via USB like I said
before<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.700> just<00:02:56.880> simply<00:02:57.030> plug<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.720> here

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
before you just simply plug this in here

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.680 
before you just simply plug this in here
plug<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.710> into<00:02:58.890> any<00:02:59.070> wall<00:02:59.400> USB<00:02:59.820> adapter<00:03:00.570> on

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
plug it into any wall USB adapter on

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.990 
plug it into any wall USB adapter on
this<00:03:00.840> end<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:02.040> charge<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.640> go<00:03:02.790> or

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
this end and you can charge on the go or

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.060 
this end and you can charge on the go or
use<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:03.450> way<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.350> also<00:03:04.440> sync<00:03:04.890> with

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
use it this way you can also sync with

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.310 
use it this way you can also sync with
it<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.340> way<00:03:05.520> as<00:03:05.670> well<00:03:06.140> they've<00:03:07.140> also

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
it that way as well they've also

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.440 
it that way as well they've also
provided<00:03:08.040> cutouts<00:03:08.460> for<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.880> headphone<00:03:09.420> jack

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
provided cutouts for the headphone jack

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.060 
provided cutouts for the headphone jack
or<00:03:09.930> for<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.260> speaker<00:03:10.620> rather<00:03:10.800> in<00:03:11.040> the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
or for the speaker rather in the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.280 
or for the speaker rather in the
microphone<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.330> can<00:03:12.540> get<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.840> those<00:03:12.960> as

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
microphone so you can get to those as

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.380 
microphone so you can get to those as
well<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.190> it's<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.370> pretty<00:03:14.520> simple<00:03:14.910> case

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
well so it's a pretty simple case

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.000 
well so it's a pretty simple case
doesn't<00:03:15.960> really<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> whole<00:03:16.590> lot<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.770> lay

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
doesn't really have a whole lot of lay

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.470 
doesn't really have a whole lot of lay
on<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.250> table<00:03:17.280> protection<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.300> have<00:03:18.450> a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
on the table protection you do have a

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.320 
on the table protection you do have a
lip<00:03:18.780> there<00:03:19.080> but<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:20.070> maybe<00:03:20.280> want<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.300> a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
lip there but you maybe want to be a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.430 
lip there but you maybe want to be a
little<00:03:21.510> bit<00:03:21.660> careful<00:03:21.840> when<00:03:22.170> you're<00:03:22.260> laying

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
little bit careful when you're laying

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.500 
little bit careful when you're laying
this<00:03:22.650> down<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.550> don't<00:03:23.580> rub<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.000> glass

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
this down so you don't rub you the glass

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.150 
this down so you don't rub you the glass
on<00:03:24.690> anything<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.140> otherwise<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.980> pretty

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
on anything but otherwise it's a pretty

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.910 
on anything but otherwise it's a pretty
simple<00:03:26.630> typical<00:03:27.630> battery<00:03:27.959> charger<00:03:28.440> case<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
simple typical battery charger case and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.230 
simple typical battery charger case and
