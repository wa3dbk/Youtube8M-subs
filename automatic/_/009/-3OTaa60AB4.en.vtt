00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
these two and the reason why there is

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.719 
these two and the reason why there is
that<00:04:18.560> gap<00:04:18.829> there<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.370> obviously<00:04:20.060> one<00:04:21.610> you<00:04:22.610> know

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
that gap there is obviously one you know

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:23.950 
that gap there is obviously one you know
there<00:04:22.970> was<00:04:23.030> going<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.270> be<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.390> gap<00:04:23.600> because<00:04:23.870> i

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
there was going to be a gap because i

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.719 
there was going to be a gap because i
couldn't<00:04:24.200> fit<00:04:24.470> this<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.830> between<00:04:24.979> my<00:04:25.310> window

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
them together without there being some

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.719 
them together without there being some
sort<00:04:29.780> of<00:04:30.050> gap

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729

would<00:06:10.270> say<00:06:10.529> but<00:06:11.529> the<00:06:11.889> time<00:06:12.099> being<00:06:12.339> that's<00:06:12.490> the

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
would say but the time being that's the

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.659 
would say but the time being that's the
way<00:06:12.789> is<00:06:12.909> going<00:06:13.120> to<00:06:13.180> be<00:06:14.219> it<00:06:15.219> didn't<00:06:15.520> come<00:06:15.639> out

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
way is going to be it didn't come out

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:17.189 
way is going to be it didn't come out
perfect<00:06:16.180> by<00:06:16.300> any<00:06:16.330> means<00:06:16.479> but<00:06:16.870> it<00:06:17.020> actually

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
perfect by any means but it actually

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.869 
perfect by any means but it actually
works<00:06:17.559> really<00:06:17.680> well<00:06:17.889> and<00:06:18.189> I<00:06:18.279> kind<00:06:18.520> of<00:06:18.550> like<00:06:18.759> the
