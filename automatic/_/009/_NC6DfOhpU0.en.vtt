00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
picture quality on the w8 is so great

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.700 
picture quality on the w8 is so great
because<00:00:28.580> of<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:28.970> x-reality<00:00:29.359> pro<00:00:29.470> this<00:00:30.470> is<00:00:30.529> the

because of the x-reality pro this is the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.049 
because of the x-reality pro this is the
brains<00:00:31.039> of<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.250> operation<00:00:31.279> this<00:00:31.789> really

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
brains of the operation this really

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.240 
brains of the operation this really
drives<00:00:32.330> the<00:00:32.840> picture<00:00:33.110> quality<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.860> make<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.160> as

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
drives the picture quality to make it as

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.070 
drives the picture quality to make it as
crisp<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:34.699> sharp<00:00:34.760> as<00:00:35.150> possible<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.900> fact

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
crisp and sharp as possible the fact

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.750 
crisp and sharp as possible the fact
that<00:00:36.110> it's<00:00:36.290> also<00:00:36.410> freed<00:00:36.769> is<00:00:36.920> well<00:00:37.160> really<00:00:37.519> adds

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
that it's also freed is well really adds

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.970 
that it's also freed is well really adds
to<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:37.970> immersiveness<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:38.690> experience<00:00:39.140> the

to the immersiveness and experience the

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.740 
to the immersiveness and experience the
sound<00:00:40.250> on<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.460> w8<00:00:40.850> is<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.180> impressive<00:00:41.659> because

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
sound on the w8 is so impressive because

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.170 
sound on the w8 is so impressive because

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
of the base reflect speaker modern TVs

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.939 
of the base reflect speaker modern TVs
being<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:44.720> thin<00:00:45.019> sound<00:00:45.440> is<00:00:45.650> normally

sacrificed<00:00:46.519> with<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.119> technology<00:00:47.420> we<00:00:47.629> can

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:47.869 
sacrificed with this technology we can

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:49.869 
sacrificed with this technology we can
really<00:00:48.140> work<00:00:48.290> on<00:00:48.500> improving<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.010> base<00:00:49.190> also

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
really work on improving the base also

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.640 
really work on improving the base also
