 have trouble with the sword to ben me I 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.049
 would choose the second option 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.680
 a few minutes of hit at the end of 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.720

 build muscle you have to contract 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.619
 and stretch the muscles of the cladding and 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.060
 do not stretch a muscle its guarantees if 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.320
 you take someone who has a flat stomach 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.149

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.100
 you ask him to do only cladding 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.170
 there will never be teenagers again 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.970

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.070
 the gymnasts 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.720

 twice a week and when the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.660
 classic 34 minutes once or twice 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.150
 per week but it's impossible to say 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.860
 which is better how often should 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.140
 Teens work to get it 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.700
 stand out if you already have a flat stomach 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.500

 Yet when the remove its 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.520

 what are the saddlebags is 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.700
 from Greece which is at the level of 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.350
 rock and butt there is not a 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.610

 is it morphology or 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.490

 of course in the hands of FARC it takes 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.950
 bodybuilding and fitness fans there 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.840
 there is no one who has this problem because 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.120
 that she trains and not a lot 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.500
 of fat so it only takes ten minutes 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.660
 and calories and that I had like 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.000
 now for muscle concert they 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.060
 squat Photovine traction presses 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.530
 for the ipch bench press 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.400
 I start to lose weight is 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.470
 aware of the risk 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.940
 it will happen for a moment that your body there 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.990
 will not have a choice that you say the 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.720
 greece lying in the hips 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.330
 and the buttocks is it essential to 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.820
 work the lower body there is nothing 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.770
 of primordial if you do not want you can 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.180
 do not go to work 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.620
 I too am in your place and I 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.160
 lower body well developed compared 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.690
 to the euro of the body here is what I will do 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.150
 he works in France explosiveness 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.700
 for example three four sets of 5's 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.970
 track be a series of three years a 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.490
 squat is nice with quad jams and 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.110
 an exercise for spies with some 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.340
 race you put a lot of impact on the 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.590
 knee and ankle joints 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.880
 so even if you can not develop the 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.330
 muscles you still have to make them 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.370
 solid 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.020
 it's just a bad idea of ​​them 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.960
 ignore especially if you do the race 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.780
 foot and here is the question I get 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.730
 regularly cellulite 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.720
 instead of answering in these videos I 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.910
 tried to do a little bit more 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.500
 research on this topic and make a 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.140
 specific video about cellulite for 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.100

 thank you and the next video
