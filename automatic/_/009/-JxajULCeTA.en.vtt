this<00:00:10.870> is<00:00:11.019> Steve<00:00:11.290> with<00:00:11.320> Montana<00:00:11.950> trout<00:00:12.309> anglers

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
this is Steve with Montana trout anglers

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.299 
this is Steve with Montana trout anglers
and<00:00:13.150> today<00:00:13.450> I<00:00:13.480> am<00:00:13.870> going<00:00:14.080> to<00:00:14.200> be<00:00:14.379> tying<00:00:14.889> you<00:00:15.070> the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
and today I am going to be tying you the

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.929 
and today I am going to be tying you the
Jana<00:00:15.879> the<00:00:16.779> J<00:00:17.020> naught<00:00:17.260> is<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:18.220> strongest<00:00:18.670> knot

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
Jana the J naught is the strongest knot

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.510 
Jana the J naught is the strongest knot
that<00:00:19.150> I<00:00:19.180> found<00:00:19.570> for<00:00:19.930> joining<00:00:20.619> tip<00:00:21.279> it<00:00:21.430> to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
that I found for joining tip it to

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.910 
that I found for joining tip it to
leader<00:00:21.730> or<00:00:22.000> tip<00:00:22.210> it<00:00:22.330> to<00:00:22.450> tippet<00:00:22.779> material<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
leader or tip it to tippet material it

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.880 
leader or tip it to tippet material it
is<00:00:23.980> 100<00:00:24.849> percent<00:00:25.110> breaking<00:00:26.110> strength<00:00:26.350> meaning

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
is 100 percent breaking strength meaning

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.060 
is 100 percent breaking strength meaning
that<00:00:27.010> when<00:00:27.220> this<00:00:27.340> knot<00:00:27.580> is<00:00:27.760> tied<00:00:28.000> properly<00:00:29.070> it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
that when this knot is tied properly it

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.189 
that when this knot is tied properly it
is<00:00:30.189> actually<00:00:30.609> stronger<00:00:30.970> than<00:00:31.119> tip<00:00:32.050> it's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
is actually stronger than tip it's

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.009 
is actually stronger than tip it's
breaking<00:00:32.650> strength<00:00:32.890> itself<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.570> it's<00:00:34.720> a<00:00:34.780> great

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
breaking strength itself so it's a great

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.040 
breaking strength itself so it's a great
great<00:00:35.050> knot<00:00:35.650> to<00:00:35.830> learn<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:37.030> kind<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.629> consider

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
great knot to learn I kind of consider

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.890 
great knot to learn I kind of consider
it<00:00:38.230> a<00:00:38.590> little<00:00:39.129> bit<00:00:39.340> of<00:00:39.540> advanced<00:00:40.540> triple

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
it a little bit of advanced triple

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.770 
it a little bit of advanced triple
surgeon's<00:00:41.350> knot<00:00:41.559> if<00:00:41.890> you<00:00:42.040> will<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.420> improved

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
surgeon's knot if you will the improved

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.210 
surgeon's knot if you will the improved
blood<00:00:43.930> now<00:00:44.229> which<00:00:44.500> we've<00:00:44.710> showed<00:00:44.949> you<00:00:44.979> in

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
blood now which we've showed you in

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.899 
blood now which we've showed you in
another<00:00:45.430> video<00:00:45.670> is<00:00:46.120> is<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.570> similar<00:00:47.080> not<00:00:47.620> with

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
another video is is a similar not with

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.829 
another video is is a similar not with
hundred-percent<00:00:48.909> breaking<00:00:49.330> strength<00:00:49.570> and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
hundred-percent breaking strength and

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.740 
hundred-percent breaking strength and
that's<00:00:50.280> essentially<00:00:51.280> an<00:00:51.339> advanced<00:00:51.850> blood

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
that's essentially an advanced blood

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.410 
that's essentially an advanced blood
knot<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.290> either<00:00:54.159> one<00:00:54.489> of<00:00:54.519> these<00:00:54.670> are<00:00:54.970> far

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
knot so either one of these are far

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.170 
knot so either one of these are far
superior<00:00:55.600> standard<00:00:56.500> knots<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:57.150> after<00:00:58.150> a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
superior standard knots and after a

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.670 
superior standard knots and after a
little<00:00:58.330> research<00:00:58.570> we<00:00:58.930> discovered<00:00:59.080> them<00:00:59.500> and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
little research we discovered them and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.710 
little research we discovered them and
they're<00:01:00.369> definitely<00:01:00.909> definitely<00:01:01.330> good<00:01:01.690> to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
they're definitely definitely good to

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.079 
they're definitely definitely good to
learn<00:01:01.960> because<00:01:02.199> you're<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:03.489> leader<00:01:03.760> and

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
learn because you're your leader and

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.820 
learn because you're your leader and
tippet<00:01:04.479> strength<00:01:04.809> is<00:01:05.019> only<00:01:05.199> healthy<00:01:05.710> as

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
tippet strength is only healthy as

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.080 
tippet strength is only healthy as
strong<00:01:06.100> as<00:01:06.280> your<00:01:06.400> weakest<00:01:06.729> link<00:01:06.760> which

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
strong as your weakest link which

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.780 
strong as your weakest link which
typically<00:01:07.479> is<00:01:07.900> you're<00:01:08.080> not<00:01:08.260> so<00:01:08.740> these<00:01:09.640> are

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
typically is you're not so these are

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.789 
typically is you're not so these are
definitely<00:01:10.240> definitely<00:01:10.659> worth<00:01:10.960> learning<00:01:11.229> so

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
definitely definitely worth learning so

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.500 
definitely definitely worth learning so
the<00:01:11.920> first<00:01:12.130> thing<00:01:12.369> just<00:01:12.640> similar<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.090> triple

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
the first thing just similar to a triple

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.600 
the first thing just similar to a triple
surgeon's<00:01:14.049> is<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:14.410> you<00:01:15.130> know<00:01:15.250> if<00:01:15.370> this

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
surgeon's is that you know if this

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.400 
surgeon's is that you know if this
material<00:01:16.210> in<00:01:16.300> my<00:01:16.390> right<00:01:16.600> hand<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:16.990> tippet

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
material in my right hand is a tippet

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.450 
material in my right hand is a tippet
that<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.620> want<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.860> add<00:01:17.950> your<00:01:18.130> leader<00:01:18.370> and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
that you want to add your leader and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.000 
that you want to add your leader and
this<00:01:18.610> left<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.030> your<00:01:19.180> leading<00:01:19.360> material

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
this left is your leading material

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.350 
this left is your leading material
you're<00:01:21.010> just<00:01:21.190> gonna<00:01:21.310> cross<00:01:21.610> it<00:01:21.640> across<00:01:22.000> the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
you're just gonna cross it across the

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.710 
you're just gonna cross it across the
two<00:01:22.510> lines<00:01:22.780> together<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.340> then<00:01:25.030> you're<00:01:25.600> gonna

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
two lines together and then you're gonna

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.170 
two lines together and then you're gonna
form<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.170> circle<00:01:26.620> just<00:01:27.220> like<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.610> wouldn't<00:01:27.820> rip

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
form a circle just like you wouldn't rip

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.450 
form a circle just like you wouldn't rip
surgeons<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:29.800> now<00:01:29.950> with<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.160> triple

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
surgeons and now with the triple

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.460 
surgeons and now with the triple
surgeon's<00:01:30.970> typically<00:01:31.480> you'd<00:01:31.960> wrap<00:01:32.230> your

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
surgeon's typically you'd wrap your

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.070 
surgeon's typically you'd wrap your
you're<00:01:33.040> type<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.910> material<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.540> your<00:01:34.900> leader

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
you're type of material and your leader

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.890 
you're type of material and your leader
material<00:01:35.530> three<00:01:35.800> times<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.460> drop<00:01:37.150> tight<00:01:37.480> well

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
material three times and drop tight well

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.360 
material three times and drop tight well
this<00:01:38.170> one<00:01:38.380> essentially<00:01:38.770> what<00:01:39.040> you're<00:01:39.190> going

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
this one essentially what you're going

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.210 
this one essentially what you're going
to<00:01:39.400> be<00:01:39.550> doing<00:01:39.760> is<00:01:40.060> weaving<00:01:40.990> them<00:01:41.220> through

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
to be doing is weaving them through

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.770 
to be doing is weaving them through
through<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.610> circle<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.120> you<00:01:43.180> just<00:01:43.420> created

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
through the circle that you just created

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.720 
through the circle that you just created
and<00:01:44.230> that's<00:01:44.770> going<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:44.980> create<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.310> strong<00:01:45.580> or

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
and that's going to create a strong or

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.190 
and that's going to create a strong or
not<00:01:45.760> it<00:01:46.120> takes<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.420> little<00:01:46.570> bit<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.900> time<00:01:47.050> to

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
not it takes a little bit of time to

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.890 
not it takes a little bit of time to
learn<00:01:47.350> but<00:01:47.740> once<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.250> do<00:01:48.430> it's<00:01:48.700> it's<00:01:49.600> just<00:01:49.750> a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
learn but once you do it's it's just a

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.120 
learn but once you do it's it's just a
great<00:01:50.080> knot<00:01:50.320> so<00:01:50.620> the<00:01:50.680> first<00:01:50.890> thing<00:01:51.040> you're

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
great knot so the first thing you're

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.280 
great knot so the first thing you're
gonna<00:01:51.190> do<00:01:51.370> we<00:01:51.520> got<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:51.850> looped<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:53.170> gonna

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
gonna do we got this looped you're gonna

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.410 
gonna do we got this looped you're gonna
bring<00:01:53.560> your<00:01:53.740> two<00:01:53.890> lines<00:01:54.070> through<00:01:55.060> your<00:01:55.270> loop

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
bring your two lines through your loop

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.100 
bring your two lines through your loop
there<00:01:56.250> pinch<00:01:57.250> them<00:01:57.430> in<00:01:57.520> your<00:01:57.640> fingers<00:01:58.110> then
