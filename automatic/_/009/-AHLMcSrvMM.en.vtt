00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.880 
vine and it's a perennial vine I've
grown<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:21.720> yard<00:00:22.020> I've<00:00:22.320> tried<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
grown this in my yard I've tried to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.519 
grown this in my yard I've tried to
eradicate<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.050> unsuccessfully<00:00:25.050> over<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
eradicate it unsuccessfully over the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.490 
eradicate it unsuccessfully over the
last<00:00:25.769> five<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.519> six<00:00:26.849> years<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.199> here

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
last five or six years you can see here

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.769 
last five or six years you can see here
that<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.830> has<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.010> striking<00:00:29.699> blue<00:00:30.300> purple

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that it has a striking blue purple

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.069 
that it has a striking blue purple
flower<00:00:31.230> with<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> pinkish<00:00:32.700> throat<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
flower with a pinkish throat and the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
flower with a pinkish throat and the
leaves<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> heart<00:00:35.100> shape<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:35.969> also

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
leaves have a heart shape but they also

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.810 
leaves have a heart shape but they also
have<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.350> trial<00:00:37.860> lobe<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.790> see

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
have the trial lobe there that you see

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.670 
have the trial lobe there that you see
along<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:39.840> kind<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.410> two<00:00:40.649> different

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
along with it so kind of two different

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.479 
along with it so kind of two different
leaf<00:00:41.250> shapes<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.469> this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> good

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
leaf shapes and this is actually a good

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.119 
leaf shapes and this is actually a good
example<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.210> how<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.480> use<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.320> plant<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.800> see

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
example of how to use this plant you see

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.389 
example of how to use this plant you see
it<00:00:47.309> grown<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.940> chain-link<00:00:48.329> fence<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.399> I

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
it grown on a chain-link fence and I

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.520 
it grown on a chain-link fence and I
would<00:00:50.969> tell<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.539> design<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.379> going

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
would tell you in design I'm just going

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.310 
would tell you in design I'm just going
to<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.770> into<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.510> vines<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.809> general

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
to get into it because vines in general

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.110 
to get into it because vines in general
I'm<00:00:55.500> reluctant<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
I'm reluctant to use and this is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.619 
I'm reluctant to use and this is
probably<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.750> best<00:00:58.050> example<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.920> why<00:00:59.629> they're

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
probably the best example of why they're

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.080 
probably the best example of why they're
striking<00:01:01.050> plants<00:01:01.710> many<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.190> them<00:01:02.430> vines<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
striking plants many of them vines I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.350 
striking plants many of them vines I
mean<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.949> but<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.309> probably<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> biggest

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
mean and but the probably the biggest

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.130 
mean and but the probably the biggest
challenge<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.200> containment<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:09.140> controlling

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
challenge is containment and controlling

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.490 
challenge is containment and controlling
where<00:01:10.350> these<00:01:10.560> things<00:01:10.920> end<00:01:11.280> up<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.900> one's<00:01:13.200> on

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
where these things end up this one's on

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.679 
where these things end up this one's on
a<00:01:13.530> fence<00:01:13.979> where<00:01:14.340> they<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.180> keep<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
a fence where they can kind of keep it

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.289 
a fence where they can kind of keep it
controlled<00:01:16.380> by<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> fence<00:01:17.220> itself<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.150> it's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
controlled by the fence itself and it's

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.660 
controlled by the fence itself and it's
got<00:01:18.509> paving<00:01:19.049> around<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.740> most<00:01:19.950> sides<00:01:20.280> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
got paving around it on most sides so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.010 
got paving around it on most sides so
they<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.479> control<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.790> I<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:24.780> that's

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
they can control that and I think that's

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
they can control that and I think that's
probably<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.740> best<00:01:25.950> way<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> use<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.939> if

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
probably the best way to use this if

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.719 
probably the best way to use this if
you've<00:01:27.420> got<00:01:27.659> shrubs<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.500> trees<00:01:28.530> nearby<00:01:29.220> you're

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
you've got shrubs or trees nearby you're

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.310 
you've got shrubs or trees nearby you're
going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.479> later<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> video

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
going to see a little later in the video

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
going to see a little later in the video
where<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.829> happened<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.340> my<00:01:32.520> yard<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.030> have

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
where that happened in my yard I have

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
where that happened in my yard I have
not<00:01:33.960> been<00:01:34.229> able<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.710> rid<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> was

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
not been able to get rid of it it was

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760 
not been able to get rid of it it was
taking<00:01:35.970> over<00:01:36.270> everything<00:01:36.689> climbing<00:01:37.619> on

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
taking over everything climbing on

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.670 
taking over everything climbing on
everything<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.640> 30<00:01:39.390> 40<00:01:39.930> feet<00:01:40.259> away<00:01:40.439> from

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
everything and 30 40 feet away from

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.120 
everything and 30 40 feet away from
where<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> planted<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> plant<00:01:42.470> these<00:01:43.470> runners

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
where I planted the plant these runners

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.719 
where I planted the plant these runners
show<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.790> every<00:01:45.270> year<00:01:45.710> in<00:01:46.710> other<00:01:46.950> things<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
show up every year in other things and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.200 
show up every year in other things and
in<00:01:48.420> my<00:01:48.630> pool<00:01:48.869> equipment<00:01:49.439> area<00:01:49.700> inside<00:01:50.700> trees

all<00:01:51.750> over<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.259> fencing<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.820> amazing<00:01:54.450> how

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
all over the fencing just amazing how

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840 
all over the fencing just amazing how
prolific<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.590> thing<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.399> survivor

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
prolific this thing is it's a survivor

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.870 
prolific this thing is it's a survivor
to<00:01:57.270> say<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.659> least<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:59.159> reason<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.579> use

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to say the least so the reason you use

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.600 
to say the least so the reason you use
it<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.210> design<00:02:00.570> obviously<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.219> use<00:02:02.460> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
it in design obviously is you can use it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.179 
it in design obviously is you can use it
for<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> fence<00:02:03.180> cover<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:04.229> they<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.649> here

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
for a fence cover like they have here

I don't water mine anymore and the

much a survivor so if you're going to
use<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.730> design<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.420> better<00:03:03.630> know<00:03:03.960> how

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
use this in a design you better know how

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.650

you're<00:03:04.830> going<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.010> contain<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.450> you

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
you're going to contain it and that you

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.360 
you're going to contain it and that you
really<00:03:07.020> love<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.410> because<00:03:07.770> it's<00:03:07.980> going<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.220> be

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
really love it because it's going to be

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.070 
really love it because it's going to be
around<00:03:08.610> for<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> while<00:03:09.210> I<00:03:09.270> can<00:03:09.660> promise<00:03:09.930> you

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
around for a while I can promise you

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.400 
around for a while I can promise you
that<00:03:10.880> as<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.330> tell<00:03:12.630> I'm<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:13.050> not<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> big

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
that as you can tell I'm just not a big

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.680 
that as you can tell I'm just not a big
fan<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.920> any<00:03:14.430> plant<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.630> much

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
fan of any plant that I have this much

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.350 
fan of any plant that I have this much
trouble<00:03:16.140> controlling<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.580> think<00:03:17.940> that's

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
trouble controlling so I think that's

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.110 
trouble controlling so I think that's
the<00:03:18.630> biggest<00:03:18.840> hesitation<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:19.980> for<00:03:20.640> me<00:03:20.790> it's<00:03:20.970> a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
the biggest hesitation and for me it's a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.470 
the biggest hesitation and for me it's a
big<00:03:21.390> mark<00:03:21.780> against<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.640> plant<00:03:23.640> here<00:03:24.300> I'm

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
big mark against this plant here I'm

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.930 
big mark against this plant here I'm
showing<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.110> some<00:03:25.350> examples<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.280> where<00:03:26.640> it's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
showing you some examples of where it's

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.870 
showing you some examples of where it's
grown<00:03:27.540> into<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:28.170> number<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:28.830> other<00:03:29.130> plantings

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
grown into a number of other plantings

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.550 
grown into a number of other plantings
this<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.300> hard<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.720> read<00:03:30.930> visually<00:03:31.530> I

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
this is hard to read visually I

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.950 
this is hard to read visually I
understand<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.490> but<00:03:33.240> it's<00:03:33.390> kind<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.750> making

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
understand that but it's kind of making

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.080 
understand that but it's kind of making
the<00:03:34.260> point<00:03:34.590> here<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.070> climbing<00:03:35.640> up<00:03:35.760> into<00:03:35.970> a

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
the point here it is climbing up into a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.600 
the point here it is climbing up into a
tree<00:03:36.540> here<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.080> wrapped<00:03:37.440> itself<00:03:37.950> all<00:03:38.250> around

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
tree here it's wrapped itself all around

some shrubs and now growing up into this

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.470 
some shrubs and now growing up into this
tree<00:03:42.210> so<00:03:43.250> be<00:03:44.250> very<00:03:44.550> aware<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:45.030> what<00:03:45.300> you're

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
tree so be very aware of what you're

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.300 
tree so be very aware of what you're
getting<00:03:45.780> into<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.410> if<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.710> have<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> way<00:03:47.250> to

can be a nice showy addition to a garden
and<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:57.060> know<00:03:57.390> there<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.050> just<00:03:58.440> hanging

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
and you know there it is just hanging

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.730 
and you know there it is just hanging
out<00:03:58.980> climbing<00:03:59.370> all<00:03:59.640> over<00:03:59.670> my<00:04:00.120> Jasmine

out climbing all over my Jasmine
Jasmine's<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:01.860> lot<00:04:02.010> easier<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.550> control<00:04:03.030> and

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
Jasmine's a lot easier to control and
