00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 the kid is very good is that such 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.279
 Welcome back to the channel 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.410
 welcome to a live gameplay point 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.790
 zero here we are I know that you like a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.080
 I know that you like a lot this 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.670
 I play and I also have a lot of fun 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.710
 ok from time to time from time to time 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 he also encouraged me to record I'm going to 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.400
 play with the skirt you want to see guys 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.510
 but a pretty special way of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.430
 Market Stall 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.810
 the fire selector to put me 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.210
 the automatic anus because it is an authentic 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.949
 cheto and also I take the look is that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.019
 never goes with what I know what's called the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.580
 test I think it's good so this is 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.960
 a truth check or the peephole is 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.210
 I say see me but it was the weapon I'm going to 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.530
 put it in a curious way but it's better 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 he has is incredible he does not move 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.390
 practically nothing when shooting and you'll see 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.690
 If I get a good start and start 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690
 to kill people 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.190
 a real bastard gun 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 this weapon of truth that is the support or 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.760
 be it I had thierry there because I 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.760
 semiautomatic weapons then 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.630
 2 to 4 lines to the top and you will see if I 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.580
 salute or split account and started to take out 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.650
 black screams ice hallucinating what happens is that 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.660
 the enemies are good with the host 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.220
 ticket while the bullets what happens 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.930
 many times with the fal is this that 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.220
 start firing the agent and not after 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.900
 the bullets as has happened with the first 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.730
 uncle that I killed him half an hour 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.040
 then clear the impact through the 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.050
 wall when false things and I tell you that 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.020
 in white two the connection fails a bit 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.090
 because I'm going to four lines because you see the 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.480
 point there are jobs to three of 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.480
 reveal 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.880
 play with the falcon bad connection dude is 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.580
 the worst you can do because with 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.690
 semiautomatic weapons you need the 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.140
 precision and you need that bullets 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.150
 enter 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.680
 if the bullets do not come in, she 's a whore 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.960
 shit for the moment from the other team 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.960
 with 5 042 since they also go 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.030
 to see if the connection fails us very much 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.659
 if the host is given to us 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.659
 is that 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.840
 It is difficult because they come fuck 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.840
 shoot and it takes about half an hour 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.550
 to stay behind 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.890
 enemies as you see are pretty 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.200
 aggressive pick this up in case I later get 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.020
 I'm without bullets or something is worth here 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.090
 that someone almost certainly come today 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.800
 they are eating practically they are 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.800
 humiliating here good 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.370
 and he is here back with my fall 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.370
 I will try 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.569
 if you start to throw as a city â€‹â€‹now yes 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.840
 so I can not because in this game a 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.840
 cheto 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.510
 right now we are both here back 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.790
 you should try with the fal as far 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.680
 It is very good to accept fuck the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.599
 They sat the bastards hosts 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.359
 They are good and well that two masthead 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.810
 take this well if someone here 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.900
 exactly it is worth waiting for us 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.549
 and one more 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.549
 to see if another comes with the ghost 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.670
 It is worth trying to go with the silencer not 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.840
 I take ghost in this class 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.829
 but I 'm going to try to catch the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.829
 because as you can see they are 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.160
 formulating all the time here is worth 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.819
 perfect guys we have the sad v we are going to 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.439
 see if this 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.290
 can change a bit that type is 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.480
 enough or let me know if it puts me and 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.210
 we are going to burst the ones that really are worth 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.670
 I like I like we've started 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.770
 dying three times but good you see 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.970
 as we have we have adapted to the way 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.410
 of playing these people is pretty 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.240
 aggressive we have stayed a little bit 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.460
 back because the connection was not going 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.980
 especially well and now we're going to 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.580
 the low star to see the kid and he goes to 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.580
 go out there 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.230
 ok we do not load it and here is an uncle 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.000
 it seems that he is not playing we are going to 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.540
 see if we finish with him it's worth they have already 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.540
 finished with him 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.560
 another one better 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.460
 and this one carries a shotgun 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.209
 we are here to this drop shott vale 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.160
 perfect comes the fal I like a lot 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.030
 this good but because I am changing a 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.120
 heap between 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.230
 and send us an inexorable worth so 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.230

 but they're all here to be very 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.180
 difficult to get them out 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.940
 this map if it is inside the houses is 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.940

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.680

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.010
 this peephole is this view that says 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.110
 Peronist is not coming is the weird fucking 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.090

 Well I'm liking lots of 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.180
 gameplay because I do not know how to change my 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.960
 way to play fast has adapted me and 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.210
 is changing between the p vw and the fal 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.640
 has liked a lot the truth this 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.560
 how to adapt 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.030

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.700

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.800
 comment on telling what was 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.020

 I also have a great time, nothing swim 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.750
 31-5 ratio of 6 with 20 two

 assists the connection to and failing a 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.650
