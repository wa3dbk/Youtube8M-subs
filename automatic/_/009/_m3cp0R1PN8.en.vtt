00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.470
 and fighting 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.549
 look 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.110
 the design for a few years 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.140
 dear friend how are you 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:32.220
 and a year of this new format of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.720
 postpartum if the time that if we 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.360
 We have a lot of fun and they even pay us 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.360
 little but we are paid as 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.470
 when it is already unbearable for those two 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.180
 wearing times did not admit them gulf 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.800
 in the goal less attacked also in 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.690
 he the 2014 person dares who is in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.150
 control as well is not how it starts 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.610
 but how it ends up clear that we have to 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.880
 keep it 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.920
 things how do you do to keep yourself 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.290
 deserved not for the football not for 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.880
 but by the pressure never damages you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.440
 you pose say caray 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.979
 at some point I need to stop 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.330
 feel this pressure motivates me motivates me 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.659
 more and more really if it hurts a lot 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:29.060
 that a season does not leave a champion 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.060
 but that motivates me 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.130
 and he always said that I was lucky enough to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.000
 be champion in several teams 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.340
 it's like it grows I want to go out 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.100
 champion, whatever, I do not have much left 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.430
 but I think I have a sweetheart 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.940
 awesome that I really have not 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.040
 had 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.560
 Chaco long ago we talked with all white 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.750
 you shared with him you were with the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.170
 veracruz and surely you know it very 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.970
 well and if in your hands you were like 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.780
 this part of the blue cross would you make a 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.780
 goodbye for you 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.050
 well I have not been here is that really to 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.810
 Sometimes you talk a lot but 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.840
 today we have a person admired by 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.819
 all footballing environment and perhaps not 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.550
 so valued with mexico 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.230
 really us 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.230
 in the team 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.040
 and the truth that is right one sees 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.470
 always the side of the inmate cost of has 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.180
 42 years is not physically not like the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.900
 kids but you can not know that to 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.900
 42 years old 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.360
 the great players this channel of 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.690
 story and always with the blues but 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.190
 you have to customize it santa cruz very 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.020
 all right 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.970
 after series 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.000
 I always say it the other day it was 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.550
 eat home and I tell him said we have 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.940
 story here because it's awesome 8 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.010
 years of the bayern munich manchester 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.650
 city-blackburn rovers 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.650
 málaga Paraguayan selection 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.940
 awesome and even blue this me 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:48.020
 I imagine that like everything until we give 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.640
 for another but the truth that we are well 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.960
 we are aware that we are 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.010
 doing things well but also 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.010
 we are aware of what 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:11.859
 and so they keep him enjoying a 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:11.859
 little bit more there is not much pressure when 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:20.660
 during the tournament one would win and that 's what 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.530
 that unconsciously the press starts 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.880
 to play its important role in 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.949
 psychologically the player that 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.930
 way we heard cascarita the 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.820
 trunks just as it is with which we are going to 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.919
 play the park suddenly when you 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.919
 play on the team that always but you're 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.370
 there 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.820
 and that also happens at those levels but 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.820
 there is also something good 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.689
 and that he read it, we have to value it because 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.869
 all the equipment 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.599
 if really one hectare of between living 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:12.580
 that pressure without generating many things 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.499
 rare but you also have to value a lot 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.949
 the opportunity to talk with the 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:20.049
 reinforcements before the start of the 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.299
 tournament and tell them miracruz blue this 

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:25.589
 it's about this so they know him 

00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:28.389
 more one thing that does not need much 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:30.899
 talk so much because the press already 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.899
 responsible for 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:38.369
 the first question 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:38.369
 17 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.909
 It seems to me that sometimes the actions 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:51.339
 speak for themselves that a guy with the 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.929
 quality of roque santa cruz that say what 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:56.379
 who mediated could have gone to the nnsa 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:58.329
 new york to the angels return to their 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.769
 country and go to Argentina he could have 

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:03.309
 I decide what I would like to stay in 

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:04.629
 Málaga still play in media teams 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:06.719
 table up and fight for things 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.719
 important 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.710
 he did not have to ask who he is or what 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.260
 is happening there a man knew and what 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.050
 he put as an important challenge of his life 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.430
 and that's why he came, we also had the case 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.430
 of amaranto perea eight years 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.390
 Really 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.550
 It is a well-known team 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.160
 football is soccer
