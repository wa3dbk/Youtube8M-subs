00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.890
 dear friends, it's a homemaker we are 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.170
 here to talk about 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:19.119
 experiences in the family, what is this 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.830
 conversation space will be a moment where 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.840
 we will deal with issues related to 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.310
 family day by day 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.740
 situations that we all go through 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.300
 experiencing and knowledge 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.870
 which will add so that we 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.780
 we can tackle the obstacles and 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.379
 difficulties the opportunity to 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.139
 learning that we live in the family to 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.120
 Let's start our conversation 

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:51.289
 I think it's important to think what it is 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.019
 a family means family 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.289
 the term family it can be used in 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.999
 several meanings in various connotations 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.989
 nowadays when we think of 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.739
 family 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.390
 we think of a place where we are going to be loved 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.920
 sheltered shelters 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.570
 care the place of protective affection 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.030
 but you know that this definition of 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.980
 family and she has little time is recent 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.950
 in terms of Western society up to 300 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.950
 years ago 400 years ago 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.920
 the family was the place where they met 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.400
 people of the same blood 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.710
 ties of blood, then they were 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.740
 important for what to keep 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.290
 property for inheritance so that the 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.890
 dogs protect themselves if you find other clans 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.070
 enemies of 300 three hundred and fifty 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.280
 The family has been here for years. 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.090
 made this space of affection of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.210
 love 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.760
 before love it was to be lived 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.240
 out of the wedding outside the environment 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.430
 family the children they were not created 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.150
 next to your parents 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.090
 they were created by third parties or 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.480
 children were sent early 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.069
 for work is in the day to day toil 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.069
 daily close to parents 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.620
 the last 300 years then the man 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.400
 humanity has been facing the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.040
 familiar with another place 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.580
 where people meet not only with the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.250
 consanguineous bonds but mainly 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.680
 ties of affection for the desire to 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.750
 be together with the desire to share 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.030
 those experiences for a long time 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.730
 It was organized by parents. 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.459
 in the absence of their own children 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.599
 we all know stories we've already seen 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.090
 on television movies meetings the 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.670
 bride and groom meeting at the time of 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.130
 marriage meeting at the time of 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.450
 to marry in our society today 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.340
 Western this is inconceivable 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.459
 This shows a small sample of 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.500
 how family relationships have evolved 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.560
 even today it is not a reality 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.799
 for everyone when one thinks of the desire 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.940
 being together to unite lives 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.680
 marriage 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.750
 the desire to live together build a 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.799
 family imagines that the main 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.739
 reason 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.470
 that moves those individuals is 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.519
 the desire for love to be with the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.040
 affection 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.980
 today from the point of view of the whole 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.200
 society the idea is more accepted for 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.750
 formation of a new home 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.350
 of a new family nucleus is the basis of 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.170
 love and affection 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.290
 so our desire to live in that 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.100
 idealized and perfect family family 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.739
 where we are welcomed 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.120
 way we are our qualities of 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.630
 our defects 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.370
 is a recent desire in terms of 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.859
 experience of humanity in terms of 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.380
 society's experience 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.389
 How many times can we reincarnate? 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.069
 over the last 300 years 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:17.060
 this is a question that we should 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:20.349
 do some will say 345 some will 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.810
 say 1020 no matter what it matters 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.490
 this ideal family this desire to 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.139
 ideal family this desire 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.740
 family as a love space for 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:33.470
 protection it's recent for us 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.759
 evolving spirits reincarnating one 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.800
 planet earth 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:41.599
 a little over 300 years ago we have 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.039
 built and sought to constitute the 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:48.050
 our families 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:50.030
 within this perspective of affection is not 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.150
 so surprising that we have to 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.430
 difficulties and obstacles to overcome 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.580
 it's no wonder that we still 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.020
 we have questions to address in the 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.190
 family atmosphere 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.470
 the family she was not she she does not come if 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.270
 destroying it is not getting lost like 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.360
 some want to believe that they want to divulge 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.590
 in the media the ideal family 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.729
 still to come is yet to 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.340
 build by building 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:25.729
 Are you listening to us today? 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.229
 stop and think what you would like to 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.860
 your family 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.080
 What would you like to share? 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.240
 share building on your 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:42.099
 family environment but more patience 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:45.830
 tranquility better communication but 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:48.349
 affectivity increase care what 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.430
 you want for your family environment 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:55.669
 for your family income 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:59.120
 this may be the beginning of a great 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:02.509
 building your family is not 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.969
 perfect and I assure you that we do not 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.770
 Let's find family nuclei. 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.099
 perfect everywhere 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.120
 now begins the construction of this 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.210
 dream 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.719
 stop your contribution so that the 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.969
 your family becomes maybe in 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:22.340
 some time in this incar- 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.659
 future even more distant but 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:29.360
 make the start of this construction 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:33.589
 from this familiar environment of 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:37.360
 affection of protection of love bonds of 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:37.360
 ties for all eternity 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.260
 that's what we'll be talking about 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.690
 here in our weekly meetings 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.730
 always thinking about what we want 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.550
 always thinking about what we want 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.610
 always thinking and thinking in terms of 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.310
 immortal spirits what to live in 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.710
 family environment or what to look for in 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.930
 coexistence in our daily lives 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.970
 Let's go together on this journey in this 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:07.820
 It will be a pleasure to be here with you. 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.820
