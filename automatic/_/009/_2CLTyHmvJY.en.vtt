00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
in 2 seconds 0 to 10 what's what looks

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.360 
in 2 seconds 0 to 10 what's what looks
like<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.989> looks<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.289> nice<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> good

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
like it looks really nice it is a good

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.420 
like it looks really nice it is a good
product<00:02:11.610> indeed

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
product indeed

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.949 
product indeed
um<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:15.069> basically<00:02:15.150> um<00:02:16.150> before<00:02:16.569> we<00:02:16.719> start

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
um so basically um before we start

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.349 
um so basically um before we start
thinking<00:02:19.959> about<00:02:20.019> this<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.530> don't<00:02:21.099> take<00:02:21.939> too

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
thinking about this is don't take too

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.819 
thinking about this is don't take too
much<00:02:22.569> product<00:02:22.989> because<00:02:23.829> it<00:02:24.129> gets<00:02:24.579> heavy<00:02:24.819> like

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
much product because it gets heavy like

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.869 
much product because it gets heavy like
especially<00:02:26.829> if<00:02:27.069> your<00:02:27.189> hair<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.430> little<00:02:27.609> bit

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
especially if your hair is a little bit

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.490 
especially if your hair is a little bit
depth<00:02:28.150> which<00:02:28.359> is<00:02:28.510> which<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.049> what<00:02:29.319> mine<00:02:29.469> is

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
depth which is which is what mine is

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.259 
depth which is which is what mine is
right<00:02:29.799> now<00:02:29.859> mine<00:02:30.099> is<00:02:30.250> actually<00:02:30.609> towel<00:02:30.939> dried

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
right now mine is actually towel dried

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.170 
right now mine is actually towel dried
which<00:02:31.629> is<00:02:31.810> ok<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:32.980> if<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.400> put<00:02:33.639> it<00:02:33.730> on<00:02:33.879> like

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
which is ok but if you put it on like

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.170 
which is ok but if you put it on like
really<00:02:34.480> wet<00:02:34.840> hair<00:02:35.219> your<00:02:36.219> hair<00:02:36.250> gets<00:02:36.670> heavy

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
really wet hair your hair gets heavy

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.110 
really wet hair your hair gets heavy
fast<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.139> what<00:02:38.859> happens<00:02:39.219> is<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.879> can't

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
fast and what happens is you can't

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.910 
fast and what happens is you can't
really<00:02:40.299> stop<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.870> you'll<00:02:41.590> end<00:02:41.799> up<00:02:41.859> with

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
really stop it you'll end up with

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.160 
really stop it you'll end up with
something<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.760> flat<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.989> won't

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
ok let's do it so 9 10 1 2 10 ratio is

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.369 
ok let's do it so 9 10 1 2 10 ratio is
about<00:03:39.639> right<00:03:39.879> here<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:40.870> part<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.199> calm

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
about right here so this part I calm

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.949 
about right here so this part I calm
down<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.959> part<00:03:44.229> I<00:03:44.379> come<00:03:44.590> this<00:03:44.739> way<00:03:45.959> so

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
it a bit of volume but my hair is just a

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.240 
it a bit of volume but my hair is just a
little<00:04:49.800> bit<00:04:49.979> wet<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.400> I'm<00:04:50.490> gonna<00:04:50.610> weigh<00:04:50.789> it<00:04:50.909> out

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
little bit wet so I'm gonna weigh it out

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.740 
little bit wet so I'm gonna weigh it out
and<00:04:53.250> play<00:04:53.460> if<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.759> until<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.150> gets<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.539> little

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
and play if it until it gets a little

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:09.589 
and play if it until it gets a little
bit<00:04:54.990> drier<00:05:02.270> hi<00:05:07.099> although<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:08.220> hair<00:05:08.430> is<00:05:08.550> dry<00:05:09.300> I

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
bit drier hi although the hair is dry I

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.020 
bit drier hi although the hair is dry I
can<00:05:09.840> start<00:05:10.110> volumizing<00:05:10.979> it<00:05:11.099> and<00:05:11.340> this<00:05:11.759> is<00:05:11.909> the

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
can start volumizing it and this is the

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.170 
can start volumizing it and this is the
tricky<00:05:12.330> part<00:05:12.360> because<00:05:13.280> my<00:05:14.280> poking<00:05:14.639> method<00:05:14.969> it

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
tricky part because my poking method it

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.300 
tricky part because my poking method it
works<00:05:15.419> but<00:05:15.780> then<00:05:16.020> it<00:05:16.319> makes<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:17.039> look<00:05:17.159> really

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
works but then it makes it look really

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.950 
works but then it makes it look really
messy<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:18.000> when<00:05:18.240> you<00:05:18.330> have<00:05:18.419> shiny<00:05:18.659> hair<00:05:18.870> you

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
messy and when you have shiny hair you

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.540 
messy and when you have shiny hair you
don't<00:05:19.020> really<00:05:19.440> want<00:05:19.680> messy<00:05:20.009> hair<00:05:20.190> because<00:05:20.430> it

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
don't really want messy hair because it

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.089 
don't really want messy hair because it
looks<00:05:20.759> kind<00:05:20.969> of<00:05:21.030> greasy<00:05:21.360> and<00:05:21.690> gross<00:05:21.900> so<00:05:22.860> what<00:05:23.069> I

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
looks kind of greasy and gross so what I

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.510
