00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and kind of surpass that so it's always

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.289

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
you did without you know without really

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.150 
you did without you know without really
putting<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.780> work<00:02:56.959> now<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.890> know

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
putting in the work now you know

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.510 
putting in the work now you know
obviously<00:02:58.820> as<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.690> welterweight<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:01.370> got<00:03:01.489> a

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
obviously as a welterweight you got a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.570 
obviously as a welterweight you got a
lot<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:01.940> room<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.600> grow<00:03:02.780> into<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.739> 212<00:03:04.250> class

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
lot of room to grow into this 212 class

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.370 
lot of room to grow into this 212 class
and<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.360> probably<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.690> little<00:03:05.750> bit<00:03:05.930> early<00:03:06.230> to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
and it's probably a little bit early to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.990 
and it's probably a little bit early to
