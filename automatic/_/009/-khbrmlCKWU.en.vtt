00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.330
 Now you open this video and 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.150
 see the name of Syria of 4 with a tool 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.400
 d-25t and either that such and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.570
 start fumbling in your memory what 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.430
 so this is a gun so oh yes it's that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.480
 most of which is left earlier in the sixth 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.309
 kvass level 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.690
 But on from 4 on tyazhey 10 level and here I 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.649
 I immediately see two categories in front of me 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.590
 People first she has the brightest why 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.160
 Why put this gun on tank 10 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.680
 I do not know the level however there is a second 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.280
 category of people who have achieved their 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.210
 in the comments which described from 425 of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.879
 400 strom please show us it and 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.980
 better let's show you him I than that 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.680
 do you when you go out in 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.559
 maternity hospital for your team because on 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.900
 in fact, from 425 I have seen several times 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.600
 in random and you know it happened 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.630
 very cool because always these 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.310
 the players succumbed for my team one more 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.659
 a question which is pretty logical 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.380
 it pops up 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.360
 why does the gun d-25t have as 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 choice on a tank of 4 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.430
 I will answer you because in principle it 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.280
 the instrument was the only one installed 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.020
 on this tank, respectively, the gun m-62 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.220
 there it was never put for the first time 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.500
 NATO 10th appeared but he from 8 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.119
 therefore, in principle, people who put 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.750
 imagine d-25t on 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.270
 of 4 we'll just think about what 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.549
 they are very fond of historicity and not know 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.700
 and reenactors they want everything 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.549
 It was authentic as it was in history and in 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.040
 general and skates just going to think 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.009
 so and so before you go into battle as 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.469
 would you need to equip this tank in 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.960
 In principle, I put absolutely everything on 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.470
 recharge because recharge is 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.440
 the only thing 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.000
 what can put us a bit higher by 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.160
 compared with the top guns that is 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.310
 recharge I had in area 8 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.520
 seconds and not this long this and so long on 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.100
 eighth level 1008 on the tenth level with 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.110
 alpha 390 and with such a break through it 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.460
 Of course it's still very bad yes 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.230
 okay and in order to somehow 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.300
 compensate for your armor penetration 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.430
 just charging the corner oh well not full 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.740
 i'm registered e- ness who 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.440
 order to amuse you like a district 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.480
 tenth level I try quickly 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.850
 but in general, sabreaders were 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.800
 my main type of shells is still 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.840
 deliver those players by whom you 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.180
 you shoot them there is a damage panel and they 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.340
 see that they are shot with gold on them 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.370
 absolutely not embarrassed by the fact that in them the remote 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.830
 from not cumulative but a subcaliber and they to you 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.220
 write gold shoot 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.080
 there qqq and so on in general people are nothing 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.209
 not confused 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.220
 okay also omit this item come out in 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.890
 fight and so where do you now have to go 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.620
 viewing your pros and cons you have 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.750
 okay at least some kind of recharge okay 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.360
 do you have at least some reservation 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.670
 you have almost no armor penetration 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.340
 In this case, you need to go where 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.380
 you somehow will not punch and there 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.970
 where are you going to punch something 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.989
 accordingly you will just go with 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.690
 medium tanks 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:33.310
 if anything you have to limit it 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.799
 Perhaps the mass of the mass of the tank is-4 because 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.230
 that as far as I remember from 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.760
 4 is the heaviest mass produced 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.120
 capital and to ng eur 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.700
 but it kind of hints at the fact that with with 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.190
 poems you will interaction well so 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 myself though nonetheless enemy among 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.150
 tanks you will punch all sorts of 50b 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.070
 chemists who are really lucky enough 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.560
 directly booked and do not let at least 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.709
 one deity you meet on the flank 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.750
 at least one of the representatives 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.140
 waffentraguere because but i'm sure 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.250
 that through the man who took to himself 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.549
 d-25t on of 4 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.000
 he naturally will not pass by 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.990
 opportunity to charge 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.930
 special 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.209
 type of shells special type of shells for 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.060
 waffentragers but you know they are 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.930
 leave such in on you shoot and even 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.470
 if they know what instrument you are up against 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.870
 they fight them i'm sure they will also 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.320
 know what you shoot 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.090
 Well, in general, there are more addicted 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.880
 morality falls than hop and although in fact 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.740
 In fact, how many there are 530 alpha with a mine 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.950
 flies away vaffentraguera well with such 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.420
 recharging you know i would totally 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.030
 would not want to be in place 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.270
 none of the representatives of the 7 2 filter 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.520
 girov nevertheless we cannot but 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.420
 having some problems they again 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.780
 same connected with our armor penetration 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.360
 insofar as e100 but punch 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.040
 for example 217 armor penetration 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.150
 which is not very normal 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.550
 OK, but basically, the question is: 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.100
 that a decent e100 will not allow you 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:20.680
 go into such a projection so you can 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:22.540
 cause damage to him it turns out that but no 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.340
 You can of course ride with this gun 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.500
 new ones will more likely substitute 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.300
 not itself necessarily after his team 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.300
 there should be such a situation in 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.060
 which is exactly your damage on your part 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.910
 can be decisive for the whole team 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.060
 cost a large number of people winning 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.010
 therefore it is better not to substitute them 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.080
 all top gun a and of course you 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.030
 there may be a question of the same earring 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.130
 damage I managed to keep on it 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.660
 I had a tank like 2300 not 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.250
 I remember whether I have a screenshot 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.160
 because that prize account on which I 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.800
 rolled he already retired dou prize accounts 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.960
 there is such a property but overall i doom i 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.720
 I think you understand what and say just 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.990
 better put the top gun 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:12.760
 even if Article 4 of the instruments to be 25 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:17.100
 the object is rather a joke than anything else 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.100
 their hands on me all the luck while
