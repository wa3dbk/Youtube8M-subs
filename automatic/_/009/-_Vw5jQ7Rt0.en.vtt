00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello everyone i think many of you remember 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.620
 Now this knife a huge thank you to everyone who 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.410
 rejoiced with me during his 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.020
 but it's been some time 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:27.529
 may from took its rightful place in 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:33.719
 my collection but the story with him got 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:37.320
 not very unexpected continuation 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:44.309
 One person who noticed that in this 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:47.670
 the knife is missing something and yesterday I 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.270
 gladly took at the post office here such 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.500
 a small package from this person 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 now when i show his name i think 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.680
 many will understand it all Alexander 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.250
 ponomarenko 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.150
 if the english-speaking knife community 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.630
 there is taffeta mps then i'm sure sky 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.670
 my can say that our 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.119
 Russian-speaking knife community 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.590
 instead of comrade there for very confident 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.659
 takes Alexander ponomarenko 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:31.170
 him on a live studio hey project 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.310
 alexander contacted me we are with him 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.329
 got talking 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.970
 about the fact that all the same nakladochka 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.780
 there is little to us on the rat 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.530
 corresponds to the status of this knife i think 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.530
 many will agree with me 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.140
 Was held 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:58.880
 some work some kind of brainwave 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:02:01.469
 the assault and at the end a design was found 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.860
 which they didn't like 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.450
 and alexander and well according to our general 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.000
 opinion to this knife he should approach 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.810
 just great 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.870
 all wishes were taken into account 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.200
 i just can't wait to look at it 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.200
 live 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:33.750
 This would seem so small 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.750
 package wrapped but what is important 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:56.390
 Alexander put here still very 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:58.230
 a nice bonus but on nakladochka 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.230
 who we thought 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:07.800
 which were designed specifically for 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:11.550
 The rat pad made of carbon has 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.910
 just such a texture, that is, well, since 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.340
 I always love different designers 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.220
 explained why they did on their 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.980
 knives somehow naturally i 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.600
 I will explain these overlays 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.120
 that is, it's not just some kind of tribute 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:33.510
 beauty was the thought behind them 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.010
 to give a rat basically a rat is 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.870
 pretty measuring knife but that's his 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.520
 some kind of such inconspicuousness 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.520
 that is, the task was to add the rat 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.060
 a little bit of such aggressive traits but 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.470
 this without turning it into some kind 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.100
 some zombie killer and that is it 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.510
 there had to be a certain mix 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:11.310
 between elegance and power 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:14.750
 so hidden such power were therefore 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.750
 these are made lining 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.870
 Well, I also see Alexander put here 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.920
 very nice bonus in the form of such 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:31.470
 Here are beautiful beads that will need 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.320
 priladit choke on the ground Well Well first 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.290
 The part is passed now I already itch 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.820
 hands leave these overlays on the knife and 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.820
 see how it will look like 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:54.740
 what are you ready here she is my beauty 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.740
 look at this mega roof 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.650
 it is something 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:10.339
 lining steel just perfectly unscrewed 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.669
 screws 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:15.809
 removed the plastic put new nakladochka 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:24.659
 tighten the screws 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:27.479
 everything is just just unreal view now 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:34.639
 I donâ€™t know if the camera can 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:39.209
 Now transfer all the character that 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:42.949
 he got and but this is really something of something 

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.949
 this knife really deserves 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:52.580
 I must say that all this work 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:52.580
 alexander made absolutely free 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:06:02.089
 just like such a big gesture and therefore 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:06.330
 I want to send him tremendous respect and 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:07.909
 immeasurable gratitude to me just 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.620
 there are no words 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:16.139
 I will give a link to the channel of Alexander 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.830
 I donâ€™t know the description of this video 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.979
 to each 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.139
 survive this reincarnation 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:26.069
 his knife doesn't matter whether it's a rat or 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:28.189
 something else but this is crazy 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.189
 feeling 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:36.930
 thanks again thanks to alexander 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.550
 everyone for watching thanks for sharing 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:45.169

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:48.409
 I hope you were interested in bye bye 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:51.719
 a little bit still ca n't hold back 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:54.199
 so a little bit not to show it all in 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.199
 macro 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:13.979
 just super still an extra plus here 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:17.639
 by the way now while twisted a knife before 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:21.149
 the camera remembered that an extra plus 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:25.289
 in such a communication with the master is 

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:28.219
 what do you really can on design well here 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:31.439
 what do you like what is close to you 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:33.959
 in dealing with foreign here by these 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:34.769
 masters of course we are 

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:40.619
 privilege 

00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:45.419
 we have therefore need to respect people 

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:47.699
 which give us the opportunity such 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:53.119
 get up and get those feelings 

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:53.119
