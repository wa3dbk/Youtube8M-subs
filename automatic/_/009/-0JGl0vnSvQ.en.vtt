00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.960 
have a little bit too much room that me
that<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.100> card<00:01:50.310> might<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.549> crushed<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:50.909> I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
going to Center my card front window on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.539 
going to Center my card front window on
the<00:02:03.930> front<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.590> card<00:02:04.860> base<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> haven't

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the front of my card base and I haven't

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.069 
the front of my card base and I haven't
folded<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.090> half<00:02:06.119> yet<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.840> see<00:02:06.930> it's

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
folded it in half yet you can see it's

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.320 
folded it in half yet you can see it's
half<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.560> piece<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.250> card<00:02:08.459> stock<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:09.149> it's

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
half of a piece of card stock but it's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.900 
half of a piece of card stock but it's
cut<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.069> non-traditional<00:02:11.069> way<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.520> I'm

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
cut the non-traditional way and I'm

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.510 
cut the non-traditional way and I'm
using<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.239> yellow<00:02:12.420> colored<00:02:12.840> pencil<00:02:13.200> to

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
using a yellow colored pencil to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.250 
using a yellow colored pencil to
race<00:02:13.640> around<00:02:14.000> my<00:02:14.210> window<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> reason<00:02:15.140> I'm

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
race around my window and the reason I'm

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.750 
race around my window and the reason I'm
using<00:02:15.410> yellow<00:02:15.830> rather<00:02:16.100> than<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> regular

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
using yellow rather than a regular

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.520 
using yellow rather than a regular
pencil<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.270> because<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.900> won't<00:02:18.080> show<00:02:18.290> through

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
pencil is because it won't show through

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.770 
pencil is because it won't show through
my<00:02:18.680> washi<00:02:18.980> tape<00:02:19.280> very<00:02:19.550> easily<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.630> could

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
my washi tape very easily so you could

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.010 
my washi tape very easily so you could
probably<00:02:20.930> hardly<00:02:21.560> see<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.160> there<00:02:22.460> but<00:02:23.150> but<00:02:23.960> I

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
probably hardly see that there but but I

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.510 
probably hardly see that there but but I
can<00:02:24.290> see<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.560> bunny<00:02:24.740> well<00:02:24.950> enough<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.310> stick

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
can see the bunny well enough to stick

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520 
can see the bunny well enough to stick
my<00:02:25.640> washi<00:02:25.850> tape<00:02:26.150> down<00:02:26.390> I'm<00:02:26.990> gonna<00:02:27.200> zoom<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.500> a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
my washi tape down I'm gonna zoom in a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.860 
my washi tape down I'm gonna zoom in a
bit<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.920> can<00:02:28.010> have<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.490> better<00:02:29.060> view<00:02:29.150> here<00:02:29.750> I

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
bit so you can have a better view here I

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.780

think<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.470> might<00:02:30.740> if<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.950> squint<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.520> might

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
think you might if you squint you might

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.370 
think you might if you squint you might
just<00:02:32.120> be<00:02:32.330> able<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.600> make<00:02:32.780> out<00:02:32.960> that<00:02:33.170> bunny

card<00:03:07.340> base<00:03:07.550> in<00:03:07.880> half<00:03:08.330> so<00:03:08.570> I've<00:03:08.720> pre-scored

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
card base in half so I've pre-scored

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.720 
card base in half so I've pre-scored
this<00:03:09.590> because<00:03:09.920> I'm<00:03:10.190> working<00:03:10.370> with<00:03:10.640> that

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
this because I'm working with that

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.370 
this because I'm working with that
thicker<00:03:11.060> recollections<00:03:11.750> cardstock<00:03:12.260> from

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
thicker recollections cardstock from

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.680 
thicker recollections cardstock from
Michaels<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.670> don't<00:03:14.120> like<00:03:14.240> to<00:03:14.360> fold<00:03:14.570> it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
Michaels so I don't like to fold it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.030 
Michaels so I don't like to fold it
without<00:03:14.870> scoring<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.350> I'll<00:03:15.590> have<00:03:15.740> a<00:03:15.770> rough

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
without scoring it I'll have a rough

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.490 
without scoring it I'll have a rough
fold<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.640> then<00:03:17.300> after<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.810> fold<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.230> actually

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
fold and then after I fold it I actually

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.800 
fold and then after I fold it I actually
to<00:03:18.860> go<00:03:18.950> over<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.370> with<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.520> bone<00:03:19.760> folder<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.690> make
