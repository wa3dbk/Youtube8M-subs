important now the trigger is sloped and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.990 
important now the trigger is sloped and
it<00:01:48.350> feels<00:01:48.530> real<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.490> feel<00:01:49.730> like<00:01:49.850> I'm

it feels real and I feel like I'm

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
now the atomization control screw lets

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.730 
now the atomization control screw lets
you<00:01:59.510> dial<00:01:59.690> in<00:01:59.930> the<00:01:59.990> air<00:02:00.110> pressure<00:02:00.380> right<00:02:00.620> at

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
you dial in the air pressure right at

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.290 
you dial in the air pressure right at
the<00:02:00.830> head<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.130> airbrush<00:02:01.490> now<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:02.120> is

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the head of the airbrush now this is

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.190 
the head of the airbrush now this is
cool<00:02:02.450> because<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.780> can<00:02:02.900> change<00:02:03.110> the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
cool because you can change the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.350 
cool because you can change the
atomization<00:02:03.500> on<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.310> fly<00:02:04.520> from<00:02:04.850> silky<00:02:05.240> to

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.050 
stipple and the line pressure always
stays<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.400> same

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
stays the same

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.789 
stays the same
now<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.390> gravity-fed<00:02:08.929> design<00:02:09.259> lets<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.560> use

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
now the gravity-fed design lets you use

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.589 
now the gravity-fed design lets you use
lower<00:02:10.129> air<00:02:10.399> pressure<00:02:10.429> than<00:02:10.909> a<00:02:10.969> siphon<00:02:11.389> feed

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
lower air pressure than a siphon feed

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.540 
lower air pressure than a siphon feed
and<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.139> I'm<00:02:12.469> told<00:02:12.739> means

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
and that I'm told means

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.340 
and that I'm told means
overspray<00:02:14.180> which<00:02:14.390> translates<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.140> less

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
overspray which translates the less

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.010 
overspray which translates the less
waste<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.950> better<00:02:16.190> line<00:02:16.430> control<00:02:16.880> anyway<00:02:17.840> I

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
waste and better line control anyway I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.510 
waste and better line control anyway I
like<00:02:18.170> division<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.710> much<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.040> went<00:02:19.160> out<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.430> my

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
like division so much I went out of my

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.100 
like division so much I went out of my
way<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:19.880> performed<00:02:20.360> what<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:20.690> nothing

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
way and I performed what is nothing

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.140 
way and I performed what is nothing
short<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.560> small<00:02:21.890> miracle<00:02:22.220> for<00:02:23.030> my

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
short of a small miracle for my

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.300 
short of a small miracle for my
subscribers<00:02:23.840> more<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.830> later

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
subscribers more on that later

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.520 
subscribers more on that later
now<00:02:25.940> most<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:26.330> my<00:02:26.450> airbrush<00:02:26.780> reviews<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.260> do<00:02:27.410> a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
now most of my airbrush reviews I do a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.530 
now most of my airbrush reviews I do a
short<00:02:27.800> section<00:02:28.190> where<00:02:28.460> I<00:02:28.490> spray<00:02:28.790> test<00:02:29.120> pattern

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
short section where I spray test pattern

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.570 
short section where I spray test pattern
so<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.720> guys<00:02:30.230> can<00:02:30.470> see<00:02:30.680> exactly<00:02:31.130> what<00:02:31.460> to

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
so you guys can see exactly what to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.880 
so you guys can see exactly what to
expect<00:02:32.030> but<00:02:32.600> for<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.960> vision<00:02:33.320> I'm<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.740> going

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
expect but for the vision I'm not going

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.200 
expect but for the vision I'm not going
to<00:02:33.950> do<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.280> because<00:02:34.460> I've<00:02:34.730> already<00:02:34.880> sprayed

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
to do that because I've already sprayed

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.360 
to do that because I've already sprayed
complete<00:02:35.660> projects<00:02:36.290> using<00:02:36.470> only<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.160> vision

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
complete projects using only the vision

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.010 
complete projects using only the vision

action<00:02:46.790> now<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.240> construction<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:47.960> well

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
action now the construction is well

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.110 
action now the construction is well
above<00:02:48.530> par<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.160> performance<00:02:49.580> matches<00:02:50.090> a

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
sexy black finish the only thing that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.070 
sexy black finish the only thing that
would<00:02:52.220> be<00:02:52.340> better<00:02:53.180> would<00:02:53.660> be<00:02:53.690> an<00:02:53.870> affordable

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
would be better would be an affordable

would be better would be an affordable
price<00:02:54.500> tag<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.340> let's<00:02:55.370> cut<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.730> the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
price tag so let's cut to the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.970 
price tag so let's cut to the
infomercial<00:02:56.600> guy<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.990> he'll<00:02:57.710> tell<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:57.950> more

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
infomercial guy and he'll tell you more

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.050 
infomercial guy and he'll tell you more
about<00:02:58.130> that<00:03:00.280> how<00:03:01.280> much<00:03:01.460> would<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.700> be<00:03:01.820> willing

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
about that how much would you be willing

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.370 
about that how much would you be willing
to<00:03:02.240> pay<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.510> an<00:03:02.630> airbrush<00:03:02.900> at<00:03:03.020> this<00:03:03.140> quality

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
to pay on an airbrush at this quality

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.630 
to pay on an airbrush at this quality
500<00:03:04.190> dollars<00:03:04.430> no<00:03:04.880> 400<00:03:05.810> no<00:03:06.320> way<00:03:06.530> 300<00:03:07.280> you're

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
500 dollars no 400 no way 300 you're

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.290 
500 dollars no 400 no way 300 you're
getting<00:03:07.880> warmer

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
getting warmer

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.930 
getting warmer
this<00:03:08.480> maybe<00:03:08.690> retails<00:03:09.140> for<00:03:09.230> only<00:03:09.410> 295<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.520> wait

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
this maybe retails for only 295 but wait

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.050 
this maybe retails for only 295 but wait
there's<00:03:11.570> more<00:03:12.050> if<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.800> come<00:03:13.070> alright<00:03:13.550> enough

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
there's more if you come alright enough
