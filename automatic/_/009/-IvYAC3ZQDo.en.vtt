on<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> side<00:01:42.360> here<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:43.619> simple<00:01:43.770> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
on this side here it is really simple I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
on this side here it is really simple I
just<00:01:43.890> got<00:01:44.189> some<00:01:44.369> scissors<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.270> cut

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.340 
just got some scissors and I just cut
down<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.369> fluttered<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.170> is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
down and then I fluttered it so this is

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.310 
down and then I fluttered it so this is
what<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.560> looks<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.979> after<00:01:50.840> fixing<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.200> up

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
