little<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:08.130> know<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> three-dimensional<00:00:09.269> that

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
little you know a three-dimensional that

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.720 
little you know a three-dimensional that
goes<00:00:09.809> through<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.230> spring<00:00:10.590> me<00:00:10.769> like<00:00:11.099> like

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
so I always say 3d was like like in the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.540 
so I always say 3d was like like in the
card<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.150> attached<00:00:24.660> together<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.859> goes<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
card and attached together or goes you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.390 
card and attached together or goes you
know<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.359> some<00:00:27.599> fun<00:00:27.900> live<00:00:28.859> show

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
know we have some fun live show

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.299 
know we have some fun live show
let's<00:00:30.210> bring<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.720> some<00:00:30.960> green<00:00:31.619> color<00:00:31.859> has<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
let's bring the some green color has a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.630 
let's bring the some green color has a
coating<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:33.590> spring-like<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.430> will

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
coating is very spring-like so I will

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.220 
coating is very spring-like so I will
use<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.880> green<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:39.230> just

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
use that green right and then just

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.869 
use that green right and then just
basically<00:00:41.100> take<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:41.969> off<00:00:42.649> then<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.680> use<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> you

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
basically take it off then you use a you

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.889 
basically take it off then you use a you
know<00:00:46.010> sharp<00:00:48.200> knife<00:00:49.200> lines<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.390> why<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
know sharp knife lines so why are you

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.020 
know sharp knife lines so why are you
doing<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.340> lines<00:00:53.640> come

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
doing it you can see the lines come

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.130 
doing it you can see the lines come
around<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.020> they<00:00:55.230> were<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.590> find<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
around so they were how you find it

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.910 
around so they were how you find it
since<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
since we have like you know a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.029 
since we have like you know a
three-dimensional<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
three-dimensional and then as you see in

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
three-dimensional and then as you see in
a<00:01:02.219> lot<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> very<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.660> simple

a lot of you know it is a very is simple

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.280 
a lot of you know it is a very is simple
to<00:01:04.350> create<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.339> Leon<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.119> when<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:07.110> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
to create a Leon so when you do that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.810 
to create a Leon so when you do that
look<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.750> there's<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> lot<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
shows then I will use this one looks

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.389 
shows then I will use this one looks
almost<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.939> human<00:01:57.810> body<00:01:58.560> shape<00:01:58.920> gonna<00:01:59.189> so

so this kind of you know why the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.460 
so this kind of you know why the
dimension<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.629> have<00:02:17.659> to<00:02:17.930> literally<00:02:18.230> take

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
dimension you have to literally take

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.860 
dimension you have to literally take
your<00:02:18.650> time<00:02:18.860> take<00:02:19.819> your<00:02:19.849> time<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:21.370> make<00:02:22.870> things

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
your time take your time and make things

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.369 
your time take your time and make things
happen
