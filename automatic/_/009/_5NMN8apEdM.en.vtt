00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 dude thats they built dugouts stay 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 in the last century dugout she switched to 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.150
 the next helix and she is now mine 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 look is a higher level 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.390
 evolution than the same high-rise buildings 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.180
 I had a desire to build my own 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.720
 space create build a house but i 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.070
 did not understand where did not understand how trying 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.810
 answer yourself the question how am I 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.980
 imagined the scheme by which I 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.320
 must first go to work 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.510
 make a lot of money but me clearly 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.090
 it seemed that if you want a house first 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.070
 make money and then I got here 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.750
 absolutely accidentally saw a man 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.000
 who abandoned this paradigm 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.739
 just took and built yourself a house why 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.610
 dugout she is one of such 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.129
 light such elegant ways 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.989
 solving the problem of a roof over your head here 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.399
 so that is you live in Moscow 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.500
 you need to work to pay for 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.789
 apartment must live in Moscow to pay 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.559
 for an apartment to live in Moscow that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.570
 pay the rent to work this 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.520
 a circle of 3 elements and you take it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.530
 you get rid of everything i mean you 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.140
 complete this crazy thought insane my 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 a glance of types she doesn't need to live 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.560
 just when some dude wants 50 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.479
 billion on the Olympics throw you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.159
 burn hear dude let's go we won't 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.780
 and this is the most 5 billion olympiad in 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.580
 the image can be simply divided into those 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.470
 Russian citizens buy themselves peas there 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.479
 the beans there are food normal and we will all 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.000
 dugouts heated photo formal 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 a man like he works he earns 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.939
 money he has a family he pulls a strap there 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.659
 this all means apartment in the mortgage 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.729
 car loan and this type of norm well then 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.950
 if I have been asked before 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.500
 I dig I would say it that way 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.540
 dig and when i took the shovel in hand and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.040
 next was a figure who had already dug 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.869
 his dugout began to dig he said 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.390
 still listen to pass that never life 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.189
 holding and it turned out that dig it 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.070
 also the process was very funny because 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.530
 what we rolled to stomach cramps 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.229
 but we started digging even you dig a hole 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.399
 arrange the walls as you think they are 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.130
 there must be walls insulate vyzhesh 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.540
 Well, do everything dugout seems to me 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.209
 Zimenko did a fine job 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.250
 I can't tell a friend 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:19.980
 that i can from this talk even here 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:22.230
 something like to understand that can seriously 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.360
 think seriously even thinks about what he 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.150
 ready twenty or thirty years 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.930
 spend your life on getting 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.060
 the concrete walls in this box he is mad 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.650
 yes he needs a roof over his head and of course 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.270
