00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
of lead core leader bands and you can

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.169 
of lead core leader bands and you can
still<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.499> still<00:00:55.739> use<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.550> child<00:00:56.760> rig<00:00:56.999> in

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
still you can still use the child rig in

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.110 
still you can still use the child rig in
that<00:00:57.510> sort<00:00:57.749> situation<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.339> rig<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.699> ideal

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that sort situation so this rig is ideal

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.369 
that sort situation so this rig is ideal

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
fishing these days the rig could stay

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.020 
fishing these days the rig could stay
out<00:02:39.569> for<00:02:39.780> sort<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.049> 24<00:02:40.530> even<00:02:41.280> 48<00:02:41.639> hours

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.720 
out for sort of 24 even 48 hours
sometimes<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:42.629> you<00:02:42.689> want<00:02:43.019> that<00:02:43.170> buoyancy<00:02:43.799> all

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
sometimes so you want that buoyancy all

stiff bristle filament that we use in

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.879 
stiff bristle filament that we use in
here<00:02:56.719> because<00:02:57.719> I'm<00:02:57.930> actually<00:02:58.169> using<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.680> court

here because I'm actually using a court
will<00:02:59.040> pop<00:02:59.219> up<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.669> so<00:02:59.969> buoyant<00:03:00.389> it's<00:03:00.810> do

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
will pop up and it is so buoyant it's do

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.050 
will pop up and it is so buoyant it's do
have<00:03:01.379> obviously<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.549> test<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.879> in<00:03:02.969> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
have obviously you can test it in the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.080 
have obviously you can test it in the
margins<00:03:03.510> before<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.019> cast<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.939> have<00:03:05.969> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
margins before you cast out is to have a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.670 
margins before you cast out is to have a
nice<00:03:06.299> big<00:03:06.510> blob<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.870> putty<00:03:07.049> just<00:03:07.139> to<00:03:07.469> hold

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
nice big blob of putty just to hold

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.740 
nice big blob of putty just to hold
everything<00:03:07.919> down<00:03:08.090> nice<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.299> pin<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.659> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
everything down nice and pin to the

everything down nice and pin to the
bottom<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.400> then<00:03:11.400> next<00:03:11.939> we<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.329> another

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
bottom and then next we have another

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.119 
bottom and then next we have another
tungsten<00:03:13.379> bead<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.780> depending<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.859> depth

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
tungsten bead so depending on the depth

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
of the debris on the bottom you can have

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.939 
of the debris on the bottom you can have
that<00:03:19.590> set<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.389> whichever<00:03:21.439> whichever<00:03:22.439> depth

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
that set to whichever whichever depth

that set to whichever whichever depth
that<00:03:23.159> you<00:03:23.310> want<00:03:23.549> really<00:03:24.290> are<00:03:25.290> usually<00:03:25.799> cast

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
that you want really are usually cast

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.830 
that you want really are usually cast
out<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.519> if<00:03:26.639> I<00:03:26.730> pull<00:03:26.939> if<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.269> pull<00:03:27.510> back<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.719> bit

how far back up the line I will use I

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.589 
how far back up the line I will use I
will<00:03:39.870> put<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.139> bead<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:41.239> there<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.329> have<00:03:42.479> it
