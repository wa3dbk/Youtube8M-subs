now<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.900> really<00:00:01.350> an<00:00:01.530> important

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
now this is really an important

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.340 
now this is really an important
development<00:00:02.669> for<00:00:02.909> all<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.210> us<00:00:03.360> because<00:00:04.110> it

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
development for all of us because it

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.769 
development for all of us because it
opens<00:00:04.680> up<00:00:04.830> possibilities<00:00:05.779> tremendous

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
possibilities for air travel and the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.110 
possibilities for air travel and the
ability<00:00:10.260> with<00:00:10.860> technology<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.759> connect

people<00:00:12.300> point-to-point<00:00:12.870> around<00:00:13.380> our<00:00:13.530> world

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
people point-to-point around our world

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.849 
people point-to-point around our world
maybe<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.570> design<00:00:15.929> cruiser<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.410> bigger<00:00:16.650> than

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
maybe a design cruiser is bigger than

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.080 
maybe a design cruiser is bigger than
just<00:00:16.980> an<00:00:17.160> airplane<00:00:17.520> maybe<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.029> about

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
just an airplane maybe it's about

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.240 
just an airplane maybe it's about
getting<00:00:18.900> people<00:00:19.020> together<00:00:19.320> more<00:00:19.770> efficiently

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
getting people together more efficiently

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.880 
getting people together more efficiently
and<00:00:20.520> better<00:00:21.029> use<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> their<00:00:21.689> time<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and better use of their time and a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.679 
and better use of their time and a
better<00:00:23.070> flying<00:00:23.519> experience<00:00:24.060> an<00:00:24.240> airplane<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
better flying experience an airplane the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.320 
better flying experience an airplane the
flies<00:00:24.930> hire<00:00:25.320> an<00:00:25.680> airplane<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:27.000> connect

the world almost any city pair around

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.189 
the world almost any city pair around
the<00:00:29.310> world<00:00:29.519> directly<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.660> airplane<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.109> will

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the world directly an airplane that will

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.260 
the world directly an airplane that will
be<00:00:31.289> operationally<00:00:32.040> efficient<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.730> because

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
be operationally efficient and because

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
be operationally efficient and because
of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.480> less<00:00:33.660> time<00:00:34.130> economically<00:00:35.130> very

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
of the less time economically very

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.430 
of the less time economically very
efficient<00:00:35.969> also<00:00:36.120> now<00:00:36.780> maybe<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.200> really

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
efficient also now maybe it's really

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440 
efficient also now maybe it's really
about<00:00:37.649> getting<00:00:37.890> people<00:00:38.160> together<00:00:38.460> around<00:00:39.030> our

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
about getting people together around our

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.920 
about getting people together around our
world<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:41.629> are<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.899> ready<00:00:43.969> okay<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.450> go

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
world so are you ready okay here we go

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.040 
world so are you ready okay here we go
we're<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> reveal<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.239> first

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
we're going to reveal to you the first

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:05.229 
we're going to reveal to you the first
the<00:00:49.890> first<00:00:50.250> unveiling<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.870> sonic<00:00:52.230> cruiser

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:14.469 

well<00:01:05.870> what<00:01:06.020> do<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.170> think<00:01:06.229> is<00:01:06.650> it<00:01:06.860> good<00:01:13.479> we

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
well what do you think is it good we

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.210 
well what do you think is it good we
have<00:01:14.630> engines<00:01:15.110> now<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.590> can<00:01:15.710> produce<00:01:15.860> enough

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
have engines now that can produce enough

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.790 
have engines now that can produce enough
thrust<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:17.210> fly<00:01:17.510> around<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.409> speed<00:01:18.650> of<00:01:18.770> sound

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
thrust to fly around the speed of sound

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.630 
thrust to fly around the speed of sound
so<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.490> engines<00:01:19.970> are<00:01:20.119> what<00:01:20.240> enables<00:01:20.720> the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
so the engines are what enables the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.430 
so the engines are what enables the
sonic<00:01:22.640> cruiser<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.210> then<00:01:23.659> we<00:01:23.840> add<00:01:24.050> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
sonic cruiser and then we add the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.020 
sonic cruiser and then we add the
advances<00:01:24.950> in<00:01:25.100> aerodynamics<00:01:25.340> the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
advances in aerodynamics the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.030 
advances in aerodynamics the
configuration<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:27.229> we're<00:01:27.770> all<00:01:27.860> been

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
configuration that we're all been

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.700 
configuration that we're all been
talking<00:01:28.399> about<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.540> materials<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
talking about and the materials and the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.950 
talking about and the materials and the
systems<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.190> simplify<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.630> ability<00:01:32.930> to

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
systems that simplify and the ability to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.899 
systems that simplify and the ability to
connect<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.500> airplane<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.250> simplify<00:01:34.850> the

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
connect the airplane and simplify the

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.419 
connect the airplane and simplify the
systems<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.960> we<00:01:36.080> have<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:36.290> set<00:01:36.890> of<00:01:37.009> enabling

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
systems and we have a set of enabling

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.669 
systems and we have a set of enabling
technologies<00:01:38.119> for<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.420> first<00:01:38.690> time<00:01:39.020> will

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
technologies for the first time will

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.130 
technologies for the first time will
allow<00:01:39.950> us<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.550> move<00:01:40.700> substantially<00:01:41.539> faster<00:01:41.780> in

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
allow us to move substantially faster in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.320 
allow us to move substantially faster in
speed<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.710> we<00:01:43.280> think<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.700> we<00:01:43.910> can<00:01:44.060> improve

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
speed and we think that we can improve

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.080 
speed and we think that we can improve
that<00:01:44.539> speed<00:01:44.840> by<00:01:45.050> around<00:01:45.259> 20%<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.280> cruise

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
that speed by around 20% and cruise

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.430 
that speed by around 20% and cruise
efficiently<00:01:47.869> around<00:01:48.670> 0.95<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.940> 0.98<00:01:50.479> Mach

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
efficiently around 0.95 to 0.98 Mach

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.249 
efficiently around 0.95 to 0.98 Mach
number<00:01:51.800> can<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:52.580> be<00:01:52.700> done<00:01:53.020> absolutely<00:01:54.020> can<00:01:54.200> we
