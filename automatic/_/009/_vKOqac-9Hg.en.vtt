and<00:02:21.670> every<00:02:22.670> time<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.910> sit<00:02:23.150> down<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.420> kit<00:02:23.630> I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
and every time I sit down to the kit I

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.660 
and every time I sit down to the kit I
might<00:02:24.020> put<00:02:24.290> on<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.680> different<00:02:25.100> one<00:02:25.430> that's

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
might put on a different one that's

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.130 
might put on a different one that's
going<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.880> allow<00:02:26.030> me<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.240> play<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.960> play

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
going to allow me to play to play

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.260 
going to allow me to play to play
different<00:02:27.560> think<00:02:28.280> differently<00:02:28.730> because<00:02:29.120> when

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
different think differently because when

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.750 
different think differently because when
I<00:02:29.300> hit<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.840> area<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.740> my<00:02:30.890> drumset<00:02:31.370> now<00:02:31.550> I'm

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
I hit that area of my drumset now I'm

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.220 
I hit that area of my drumset now I'm
getting<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.090> different<00:02:32.420> sound<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.020> allows

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
getting a different sound so it allows

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:59.699 
getting a different sound so it allows
me<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.470> be<00:02:33.680> more<00:02:33.890> creative
