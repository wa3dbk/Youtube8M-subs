series<00:00:12.090> role<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.719> start<00:00:12.960> I've<00:00:13.170> been<00:00:13.349> told<00:00:13.530> that

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
series role of start I've been told that

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.530 
series role of start I've been told that
it's<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.190> pretty<00:00:14.639> much<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.880> same<00:00:15.089> engine<00:00:15.420> as

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
it's a pretty much the same engine as

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.250 
it's a pretty much the same engine as
the<00:00:15.570> axial<00:00:16.109> 0.28<00:00:17.449> that's<00:00:18.449> my<00:00:18.690> point<00:00:19.080> two<00:00:19.230> eight

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
the axial 0.28 that's my point two eight

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.150 
the axial 0.28 that's my point two eight
there<00:00:19.560> add<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.520> about<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.119> summer<00:00:21.390> now

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
there add that for about a summer now

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
there add that for about a summer now
running<00:00:23.160> great<00:00:29.210> we're<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> crack<00:00:30.570> this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
running great we're going to crack this

running great we're going to crack this
guy<00:00:30.840> open<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.830> looks<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> bunch<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.460> parts

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
guy open it looks like a bunch of parts

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.490 
guy open it looks like a bunch of parts
but<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.510> much<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:35.130> main

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
but it's not much really have one main

shaft<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> engine<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
shaft of the engine and then you have a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.580 
shaft of the engine and then you have a
smaller<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.280> which<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:42.030> turn<00:00:42.270> is

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
smaller one that which is in turn is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.520 
smaller one that which is in turn is
connected<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> road<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.489> start<00:00:44.700> itself

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
outside case and six screws I'm going to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.560 
outside case and six screws I'm going to
be<00:00:53.640> using<00:00:53.969> three<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
be using three of them so with the

be using three of them so with the
backing<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.989> your<00:00:58.109> hand<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.770> insert<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
backing in your hand you just insert the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
backing in your hand you just insert the
one<00:00:59.760> small<00:01:00.090> piece<00:01:00.270> which<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.570> connected<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
one small piece which is connected to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.840 
one small piece which is connected to
the<00:01:01.379> road<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.590> start<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.370> turns<00:01:02.579> at

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the road or start that's what turns at

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.170 
the road or start that's what turns at
the<00:01:02.879> main<00:01:03.149> gear<00:01:04.309> alright<00:01:05.309> I'm<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> open

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the main gear alright I'm going to open

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.670 
the main gear alright I'm going to open
up<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> applied<00:01:07.049> tube<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.650> grease<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:10.260> with

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
up the applied tube of grease and with

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.770 
up the applied tube of grease and with
that<00:01:10.890> add<00:01:12.710> quite<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> bit<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.869> healthy<00:01:15.869> amount<00:01:16.080> I

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
that add quite a bit a healthy amount I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
that add quite a bit a healthy amount I
did<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> once-over<00:01:19.350> after<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.979> spun<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.759> around

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
did the once-over after I spun it around

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.700 
did the once-over after I spun it around
make<00:01:21.240> sure<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.750> spread<00:01:22.170> everywhere

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
make sure it was spread everywhere

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.380 
make sure it was spread everywhere
again<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.700> turn<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> row<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
again that one turn with the row to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.730 
again that one turn with the row to
start<00:01:24.509> we'll<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> just

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
start we'll do that for you but I just

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.660 
start we'll do that for you but I just
want<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> make<00:01:26.070> sure<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:26.640> enough

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
want to make sure that there was enough

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.740 
want to make sure that there was enough
and<00:01:27.090> full<00:01:27.360> coverage<00:01:27.799> pop<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.979> back<00:01:29.280> plate<00:01:29.610> on

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
and full coverage pop the back plate on

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.679 
and full coverage pop the back plate on
and<00:01:31.520> then<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:32.880> pretty<00:01:33.210> much<00:01:33.360> ready<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and then that's pretty much ready to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
and then that's pretty much ready to
start<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.470> remove<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.950> pull<00:01:35.400> start

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
start just have to remove the pull start

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
start just have to remove the pull start
now<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> pull<00:01:40.740> start<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> four<00:01:42.229> hex<00:01:43.229> head

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
now so a pull start is a four hex head

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.700 
now so a pull start is a four hex head
screws<00:01:44.540> they<00:01:45.540> come<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.810> quite<00:01:46.110> easy<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.649> you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
screws they come out quite easy and you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.100 
screws they come out quite easy and you
should<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.920> left<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.369> starter<00:01:50.729> shaft

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
should be left with the starter shaft

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.910 
should be left with the starter shaft
just<00:01:52.110> insert<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.479> photo<00:01:54.479> start<00:01:54.869> add<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
just insert the photo start add the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.109 
just insert the photo start add the
three<00:01:56.399> screws<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:58.759> it's<00:01:59.759> pretty<00:02:00.000> much<00:02:00.090> done
