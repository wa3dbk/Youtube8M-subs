00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
especially what in my opinion is the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.899 
especially what in my opinion is the
best-looking<00:01:17.580> camel<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.240> called<00:01:18.479> 2d<00:01:18.720> history

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the one that I'm using here and in my

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
the one that I'm using here and in my
opinion<00:01:26.549> looks<00:01:27.020> insane<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> thermal

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
opinion looks insane with the thermal

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.819 
opinion looks insane with the thermal
scope<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.600> looks<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.110> nice<00:01:31.380> and
