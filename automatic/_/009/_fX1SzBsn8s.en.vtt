00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 you are a milan imac fan and I am 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.850
 Interista I invited a Milanese mi 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.830
 hoe is pulled on my feet 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.759
 but your milan is not going 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.490
 just fine this year but how much 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.740
 first the luck turns hopefully what to say 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 as soon as possible because now 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.939
 we're going pretty bad it's a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.699
 question of wheels there too and maybe a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.490
 little more than those against a little less 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.490
 luck but bad luck are moments 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.920
 no for all now he was ever able to 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.290
 but I think they will know there is a team 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.540
 therefore quite large in the world 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.780
 he knew how to get out of this problem 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.210
 the coach is sent away I don't know but 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.710
 i married the milan price list you would send 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 of cheerful 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.500
 yes but not so much because it loses so much 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
 but now the team does not play well anymore 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.120
 everything therefore to give a shock 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.890
 I do n't but let's shake instead 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.340
 Balotelli must remain at Milan 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.040
 rightly not but if last year a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.590
 end of season showed that it is a lot 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.960
 important for the team so maybe 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.750
 as a person not everyone likes but how 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.530
 footballer I think there are no fans 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.720
 of balotelli both as a person and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.549
 okay then between the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.640
 Ticino footballers you have many friends 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.570
 what do you care dear notify tifi 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.229
 noise does not fix you to depends on 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.880
 But if the games go of Lugano 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.590
 province of lugano for my friends 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.350
 that I have inside there is more than anything else I hope 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.720
 that they play well and so on 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.759
 so for the other teams I am a bit 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.009
 biased to my friends does not look 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.070
 the teams in general 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.649
 then we have prepared a little something 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.549
 for you there is someone I spoke to about 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:01.280
 you someone who knows you well then 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.280
 let's hear what this gentleman says 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.650
 I think that solar and honest sincere julie 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.320
 so I don't know what to say I'm proud 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.770
 of the institutions that willingly defect is 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.560
 messy little messy a little 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.380
 uncaring about certain things though 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.330
 will improve a pride because it has gods 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.970
 goals he had for him 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.340
 reaching if it is clear that he had to 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.650
 continue so presentiment was there 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.430
 that I am sincere but the inter so not 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.900
 20 is very good at playing soccer if 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.940
 he had played soccer maybe not 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.610
 I was even more pleased though 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.770
 I personally not the family is 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.880
 surely I personally know there is 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.490
 to soccer 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.580
 I only in time to continue like this 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.770
 never stop and never set 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.030
 always a goal that surely is 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.450
 will reach these are my wishes 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.670
 the popes the popes always present though if 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.670
 you were the most happy player 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.640
 yes yes but there was a period where I was 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.100
 undecided about what to do but now living 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.010
 ambrì near the valascia was it is 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.940
 it was easy to leave but how much it is 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.239
 the figure of the father is important to you but 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.790
 much because anyway now 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.610
 in the interview to maletto many things 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.310
 good but when I maybe get home 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.910
 and played well the first one 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.440
 however he tells me he takes me back or at least 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.520
 always try to keep my feet for me 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.830
 land 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.570
 both he and all are very important 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.540
 the family that is always there anyway 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.190
 then since we are in closing there is 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.310
 something I would like to know once 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.710
 closed his playing career the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.560
 eyes that we hope will be very long 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.390
 what would you like to do when you're older? 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.770
 so maybe I 'd like to help the most 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.170
 young people but always stay in the world 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.280
 coach hockey these things 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.710
 to ambrì getting out of them and you like it then 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.710
 despite being small, make one 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.820
 cold rogue acacia types will be dame 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:18.090
 bellizzese ambrì is therefore part of me 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.910
 I will not hide it you will pass a beautiful one 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.290
 life on the ice of the valascia or della 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.940
 new track that by the way maybe 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.130
 will also carry your name or will have some 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.130
