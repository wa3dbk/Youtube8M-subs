something<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> may<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.480> guessed<00:01:00.660> hard

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
something you may have guessed hard

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.179 
something you may have guessed hard
we're<00:01:02.430> talking<00:01:02.609> about<00:01:02.850> mile<00:01:03.600> stay<00:01:04.040> with<00:01:05.040> his

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
we're talking about mile stay with his

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.940 
we're talking about mile stay with his
miles<00:01:05.460> tiny<00:01:05.790> legs<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.900> everyone<00:01:07.409> muscle<00:01:07.770> size

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
miles tiny legs so everyone muscle size

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.399 
miles tiny legs so everyone muscle size
has<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> limit<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.080> protein

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
has a limit because of this protein

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.760 
has a limit because of this protein
called<00:01:11.010> miles<00:01:11.310> 10<00:01:11.689> mile<00:01:12.689> stan<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> main

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
called miles 10 mile stan is the main

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
called miles 10 mile stan is the main
factor<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.490> determining<00:01:14.640> how<00:01:15.210> large<00:01:15.570> your

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
factor in determining how large your

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.800 
factor in determining how large your
muscles<00:01:16.170> can

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
muscles can

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.300 
muscles can
so<00:01:17.810> everyone<00:01:18.320> has<00:01:18.470> different<00:01:18.770> levels<00:01:19.040> of

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
so everyone has different levels of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.500 
so everyone has different levels of
myostatin<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:21.170> has<00:01:21.799> been<00:01:22.040> studies<00:01:22.549> done<00:01:22.580> most

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
myostatin it has been studies done most

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.960 
myostatin it has been studies done most
champion<00:01:24.080> body<00:01:24.320> butters<00:01:24.710> have<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.340> very<00:01:25.729> low

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
champion body butters have a very low

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.180 
champion body butters have a very low
level<00:01:26.000> milestone<00:01:26.990> meaning<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:27.830> they<00:01:28.010> have

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
level milestone meaning that they have

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.670 
level milestone meaning that they have
more<00:01:28.430> potential<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:29.030> grow<00:01:29.409> everybody<00:01:30.409> always

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
more potential to grow everybody always

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.399 
more potential to grow everybody always
wondered<00:01:31.340> why<00:01:32.090> can<00:01:32.360> some<00:01:32.570> guys<00:01:32.600> always<00:01:32.990> beep

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
wondered why can some guys always beep

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.940 
wondered why can some guys always beep
up<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.040> get<00:01:34.640> bigger<00:01:35.170> faster<00:01:36.170> than<00:01:36.350> other<00:01:36.530> so

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
up and get bigger faster than other so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.850 
up and get bigger faster than other so
my<00:01:37.159> 07<00:01:37.490> was<00:01:37.759> first<00:01:38.060> discovered<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:38.869> Belgium

my 07 was first discovered in Belgium
blue<00:01:40.159> cows<00:01:40.550> they<00:01:41.479> always<00:01:41.720> wonder<00:01:42.259> why<00:01:42.530> these

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
blue cows they always wonder why these

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.999 
blue cows they always wonder why these
cows<00:01:43.100> were<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:43.580> big<00:01:43.880> these<00:01:44.840> cows<00:01:45.170> had<00:01:45.470> two<00:01:45.860> to

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
cows were so big these cows had two to

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.219 
cows were so big these cows had two to
three<00:01:46.190> times<00:01:46.220> more<00:01:46.640> muscle<00:01:47.210> mass<00:01:47.240> than<00:01:47.810> normal

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
three times more muscle mass than normal

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.889 
three times more muscle mass than normal

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.430 
Callens and when once research was done
they<00:01:51.740> found<00:01:51.950> out<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.220> these<00:01:52.399> cows<00:01:53.440> didn't

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
they found out that these cows didn't

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.370 
they found out that these cows didn't
have<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.679> gene<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.130> produces<00:01:55.580> most<00:01:56.240> at<00:01:56.509> the

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
this a little too complicated so I'm a

this a little too complicated so I'm a
dumb<00:02:05.149> it<00:02:05.270> down<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.450> bit<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.320> because

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
dumb it down a bit and just because

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.520 
dumb it down a bit and just because
those<00:02:06.920> cows<00:02:07.420> didn't<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.570> this<00:02:08.899> gene<00:02:09.289> that

are<00:03:03.060> actually<00:03:03.660> real<00:03:04.020> folks<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.160> see<00:03:05.459> this

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
are actually real folks so you see this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.240 
are actually real folks so you see this

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
big they can get and that's exactly why

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.340 
big they can get and that's exactly why
some<00:03:14.819> people<00:03:15.090> go<00:03:15.209> bold<00:03:15.480> them<00:03:15.660> easier<00:03:16.080> than

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
some people go bold them easier than

else another thing that I want to talk

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.860 
else another thing that I want to talk
about<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.370> some<00:04:11.760> supplement<00:04:12.420> companies

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
about is that some supplement companies
