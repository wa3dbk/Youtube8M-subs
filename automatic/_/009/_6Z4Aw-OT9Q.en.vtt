okay so I don't know what happened in it
I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.290> maybe<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.830> planted<00:01:11.189> these<00:01:11.340> seeds

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
I think maybe when I planted these seeds

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.539 
I think maybe when I planted these seeds
it<00:01:11.909> must<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.270> planted<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:13.140> sapling<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.430> this

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it must have planted a sapling for this

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
it must have planted a sapling for this
tree<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.240> guess<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.409> kind<00:01:16.710> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
tree as well I guess that's kind of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.980 
tree as well I guess that's kind of
weird<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.250> would<00:01:17.460> happen

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
weird that that would happen

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.749
