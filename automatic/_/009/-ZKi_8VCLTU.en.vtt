00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.899
 Of course, after the conductive business, look for obelix 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:15.920
 OK, I, too , somehow it's already out of date that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.110
 Greece rex obelix but it seems that this 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.360
 feature has already come to an end so 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.630
 you will have to wait for the next look 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.149
 how quickly all Romans disappeared 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.100
 that it all happened somehow too 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.450
 easy how many there were and how many became 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.450
 Now I will twist a piece of paper 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.370

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.390

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:12.120
 we finish off the last 9 by the way 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.120
 Already 8 already seven so that already there is no sense 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:25.150
