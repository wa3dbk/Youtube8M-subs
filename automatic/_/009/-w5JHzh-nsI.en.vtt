00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.299
 on YouTube as we are so up to a 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.270
 new video now he wants to teach them 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.939
 how come I already worms 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.369
 had opened and it occurred to me to bring the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.070
 video but anyway let's open 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.950
 the box though to rainbow orders 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.579
 millwall I usually ask a thousand 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.399
 worms every month and a half depends that 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.100
 much as the animals right now as already 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.060
 I have more rich 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.720
 I ask more often 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.720
 in the house and here 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.039
 It has a bag because they are all 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.039
 watch 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.680
 let's try to open this 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.100
 leave me using another hand here 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.520
 look 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.520
 there are all the worms 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.350
 there are a thousand worms and horta I am going to pass them 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.350
 in a little boat 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.760
 that I'll show you ok ok I'm going to cut here 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.070
 well and then there are the worms that 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.420
 I like them about as 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.190
 They will be able to see them put them in some pieces of 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.260
 carrot this so it's very 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.850
 important that your food is the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.050
 food that you will give to the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.720
 insects that you will give to your 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.420
 reptiles and they well fascinate after 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.790
 to toss a piece of carrot to a 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.430
 Dad's chub or zucchini 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.800
 and let them feed like this to gecko 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.330
 at the time of eating an insect and the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.620
 insect is going to have enough nutrients 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.310
 and this is going to happen to your echo and 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.439
 believe me it's going to reverberate 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.140
 in the feeding I was with very back 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:03.070
 very very very important to feed your 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.770
 insects ok and it's very easy it 's nothing 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.649
 from the other world to wait for another 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.630
 Loading worms are worms 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.760
 different are called phoenix millions 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.990
 they are very rich in calcium the first time 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.120
 I was going to use them but it did not come 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.860
 I hope you tell me a while tomorrow I will 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.069
 I can read a video and I add it here to 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.959
 end of this video or leave 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.420
 and thanks to everyone who participated 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.640
 in the question of the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.220
 of last week and in the question 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.680
 this week and I put them on and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.630
 it hurts the best answers ok 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.360
 perfect after you stay here 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.870
 a few hours I 'll pass a cap more 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.870
 small 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.540
 and they will stay there in refrigeration 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.420
 very important I develop a kind of 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.360
 allergy to worms and all now I'm going 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.570
 to start sneezing for the rest of the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.570
 day 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.180
 then you can and do 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.480
 say relatively large amounts 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.180
 of worms I recommend you to use 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.190
 masks and gloves me for the excitement of 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.710
 record the video I forgot the cut 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.770
 I am suffering the consequences but 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.140
 it does not matter well then thank you very much 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.010
 for subscriptions for likes 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.920
 for the comments I leave the question 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.410
 of the week and the responses of the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.050
 last week and if I can the video of the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.180
 other worms are that and they take care 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.650
 thanks I got the worms a couple 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.440
 of days later but here we leave you 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.230
 with the video 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.550
 they were without worms phoenix worlds they 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.410
 they call in the first one that I try them and 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.020
 I'm not, it seems that they loved the 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.490
 old for the taste and because it also 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.940
 move then we could care 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.940
 of the animal 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.750
 and I tell them true in short and when the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.940
 translation would be like phoenix 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.620
 They are rich in calcium when the video comes up 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.350
 that we see on a comparative table 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.950
 who has one and to see that they are 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.440
 very rich in calcium these worms and 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.000
 geniuses but those rich in calcium and very 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.720
 low in fat then a new 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.299
 excellent food source 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.489
 those that move enough let's study the 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.040
 animal care lack of good 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:26.350
 new turtles so they can see what they 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.350
 will love 7 miles I hope 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.160
 is waiting for the schools and all 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.400
 remember that I am going to put it as they are 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.400
 poles 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.920
 and I tell them but they seem to have loved 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.830
 the turtles too 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.350
 and very happy I will ask for more of these 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.350
 more followed for those who do not also 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.050

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.330

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.100
 He said he's going to ask for more alive than in 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.480
 california usa then for me 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.700
 ask where it already ordained 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.700

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.969
 but anyway they are down there 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.940
