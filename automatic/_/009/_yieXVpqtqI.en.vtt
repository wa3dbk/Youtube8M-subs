00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.540
 A battery 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.470
 loaded with charge 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.470

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.710

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.600

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.650

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.010
 contemplate that they see it 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:59.180

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.960
