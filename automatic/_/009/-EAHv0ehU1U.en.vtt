and figure out what he's wanted and a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.670 
and figure out what he's wanted and a
new<00:00:20.250> chain<00:00:20.609> which<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.500> main

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
new chain which is really the main

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.400 
new chain which is really the main
purpose<00:00:22.920> were<00:00:23.369> we're<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.810> chains<00:00:25.109> kind

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
purpose were we're here the chains kind

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.410 
purpose were we're here the chains kind
of<00:00:25.470> jumped<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.970> we're<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> try<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
of jumped out so we're going to try to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.700 
of jumped out so we're going to try to
get<00:00:27.570> these<00:00:27.689> bolts<00:00:27.930> off<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> sprocket

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
get these bolts off the sprocket

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.220 
get these bolts off the sprocket
hopefully<00:00:29.340> they'll<00:00:29.519> work<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
hopefully they'll work for the for the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.459 
hopefully they'll work for the for the
new<00:00:31.380> sprocket<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:32.099> got<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> countersunk<00:00:32.940> deal

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
new sprocket it's got a countersunk deal

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.299 
new sprocket it's got a countersunk deal
and<00:00:35.570> well<00:00:36.570> show<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.140> most<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> process

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and well show you most of the process

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.750 
and well show you most of the process
here<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> video<00:00:38.969> probably<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
here in the video probably not all of it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.790 
here in the video probably not all of it
here<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:43.460> all<00:00:44.460> right<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:45.030> had<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.649> take<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here we go all right we had to take the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.520 
here we go all right we had to take the
torch<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.610> cut<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> chain<00:00:48.600> off<00:00:48.840> there's<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
torch and cut the chain off there's a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
torch and cut the chain off there's a
factory<00:00:49.920> chain<00:00:50.160> didn't<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> master<00:00:50.850> link

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
factory chain didn't have a master link

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.750 
factory chain didn't have a master link
and<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:53.460> factory<00:00:53.910> bolts<00:00:54.360> I'm<00:00:55.079> not<00:00:55.260> gonna<00:00:55.440> work

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and the factory bolts I'm not gonna work

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.900 
and the factory bolts I'm not gonna work
on<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.090> aftermarket<00:00:58.460> sprocket<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.699> went

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
on this aftermarket sprocket so we went

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.270 
on this aftermarket sprocket so we went
and<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.030> some<00:01:00.329> stainless<00:01:00.809> steel<00:01:01.190> bolts<00:01:02.190> from

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and got some stainless steel bolts from

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.870 
and got some stainless steel bolts from
the<00:01:02.370> hardware<00:01:02.730> store<00:01:03.049> metric<00:01:04.640> we<00:01:05.640> were<00:01:05.729> able

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the hardware store metric we were able

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.350 
the hardware store metric we were able
to<00:01:06.060> use<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.570> same<00:01:07.200> nuts<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:08.180> some<00:01:09.180> nice

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to use the same nuts on some nice

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.230 
to use the same nuts on some nice
stainless<00:01:09.810> washers<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.530> along<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
stainless washers to go along with it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.469 
stainless washers to go along with it
and<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.479> gonna<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.320> screwed<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:14.479> get

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and I'm gonna get that screwed on get

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.450 
and I'm gonna get that screwed on get
the<00:01:15.600> new<00:01:15.750> chain<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.380> put<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.280> back

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
the new chain on put it all back

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.230 
the new chain on put it all back
together<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:19.700> hopefully<00:01:20.700> that'll<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
together and hopefully that'll be the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
together and hopefully that'll be the
gear<00:01:21.720> ratio<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.350> each<00:01:22.680> design<00:01:27.860> alright<00:01:28.860> so

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
gear ratio that each design alright so

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.630 
gear ratio that each design alright so
this<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.579> axle<00:01:30.540> nut<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.250> what<00:01:32.250> I've<00:01:32.400> done

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
this is the axle nut and what I've done

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.990 
this is the axle nut and what I've done
is<00:01:32.970> actually<00:01:33.560> taking<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> lock<00:01:34.950> part<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
is actually taking the lock part of it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.140 
is actually taking the lock part of it
away<00:01:37.159> from<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> factory<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:38.850> got<00:01:38.970> these<00:01:39.090> two

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
away from the factory it's got these two

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.080 
away from the factory it's got these two
little<00:01:39.390> tabs<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.110> either<00:01:40.259> side<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.670> may<00:01:41.939> or

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
little tabs on either side you may or

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
little tabs on either side you may or
may<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.540> see<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.110> I've<00:01:43.350> kind<00:01:43.860> of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
may not can see now because I've kind of

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.620 
may not can see now because I've kind of
ground<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.430> back<00:01:44.670> anyway<00:01:45.180> they<00:01:45.299> come<00:01:45.509> in

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
ground them back anyway they come in

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.710 
ground them back anyway they come in
contact<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:47.340> thread<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.060> that's<00:01:48.450> what

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
contact with the thread and that's what

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.630 
contact with the thread and that's what
locks<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.009> what<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> looks<00:01:50.460> like

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
locks it so this is what it looks like

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
locks it so this is what it looks like
after<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.240> grind<00:01:51.509> those<00:01:51.720> off<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.500> we're

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
after you grind those off and we're

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.370 
after you grind those off and we're
going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.640> use<00:01:53.820> some<00:01:54.030> Loctite<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.899> reason<00:01:55.259> why

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
going to use some Loctite and reason why

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
going to use some Loctite and reason why
we<00:01:55.560> ground<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.009> off<00:01:56.189> because<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.820> eats<00:01:57.000> into

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
we ground that off because it eats into

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.510 
we ground that off because it eats into
the<00:01:57.390> threads<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.770> end<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.009> having<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.369> buy

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the threads and you end up having to buy

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.209 
the threads and you end up having to buy
axle<00:02:00.090> about<00:02:00.360> every<00:02:00.750> three<00:02:01.500> four<00:02:01.740> times<00:02:02.009> you

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
axle about every three four times you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.270 
axle about every three four times you
take<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> back<00:02:02.729> wheel<00:02:02.969> off<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.159> get

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
take the back wheel off and that can get

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.199 
take the back wheel off and that can get
costly<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:06.899> tip<00:02:07.610> we've<00:02:08.610> got<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
costly so that's my tip we've got the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.150 
costly so that's my tip we've got the
chain<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.489> everything<00:02:11.489> look

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
chain on it everything look

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.700 
chain on it everything look
a<00:02:12.190> master<00:02:13.150> link<00:02:13.390> was<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> little<00:02:14.050> little<00:02:14.470> loose

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
a master link was a little little loose

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.650 
a master link was a little little loose
but<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.370> looked<00:02:15.610> at<00:02:15.730> my<00:02:15.850> other<00:02:16.000> bikes<00:02:16.300> and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
but we looked at my other bikes and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.880 
but we looked at my other bikes and
they're<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.870> same<00:02:17.110> they've<00:02:17.470> been<00:02:17.620> running

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
they're the same they've been running

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.190 
they're the same they've been running
for<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.100> long<00:02:18.280> time

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
for a long time

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.560 
for a long time
there's<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.580> stainless<00:02:21.580> bolts<00:02:22.030> we<00:02:22.180> got<00:02:22.390> from

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
there's the stainless bolts we got from

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.920 
there's the stainless bolts we got from
the<00:02:22.690> hardware<00:02:23.110> store<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:25.450> see<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the hardware store and you see on the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.560 
the hardware store and you see on the
back<00:02:26.140> side<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.860> washer<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:31.030> we<00:02:31.180> put<00:02:31.420> on

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
back side see the washer that we put on

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.540 
back side see the washer that we put on
it's<00:02:31.840> got<00:02:32.140> just<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.740> right<00:02:32.770> amount<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.310> thread

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
it's got just the right amount of thread

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.960 
it's got just the right amount of thread
sticking<00:02:34.060> out<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.210> think<00:02:34.650> those<00:02:35.650> two<00:02:36.640> are

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
sticking out I think those two are

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.970 
sticking out I think those two are
locking<00:02:37.630> nuts<00:02:37.870> but<00:02:38.200> don't<00:02:38.440> mess<00:02:38.650> with<00:02:38.740> those

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
locking nuts but don't mess with those

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.820 
locking nuts but don't mess with those
because<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.730> want<00:02:39.970> those<00:02:40.180> locked<00:02:40.830> unless

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
because you want those locked unless

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.380 
because you want those locked unless
you're<00:02:42.070> gonna<00:02:42.190> be<00:02:42.340> changing<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.910> sprocket
