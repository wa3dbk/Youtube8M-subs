00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
animations are actually not very good at

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
animations are actually not very good at
all<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.659> I'm<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.079> sure<00:01:40.259> what's<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.680> here

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
all so I'm not sure what's going on here

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.469 
all so I'm not sure what's going on here

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.749 
it seems like this game is in its very
first<00:01:43.020> stages<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.799> development<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.399> they're

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
first stages of development and they're

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.100 
first stages of development and they're
just<00:01:44.850> opening<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> public<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.960> while

just opening up to the public so while

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.780 
just opening up to the public so while

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it says beta I would really treat this

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.600 
it says beta I would really treat this
game<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.180> an<00:01:48.329> alpha<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.770> there's<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> lot<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
game as an alpha but there's a lot of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.120 
game as an alpha but there's a lot of
cool<00:01:50.850> things<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.299> does<00:01:51.659> look<00:01:52.200> nice<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
cool things to it does look nice it it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
cool things to it does look nice it it
does<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.820> doesn't<00:01:54.030> look<00:01:54.210> horrible<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.869> has

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
does it doesn't look horrible it has

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109 
does it doesn't look horrible it has
like<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.530> cartoony<00:01:55.920> graphics<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.909> it's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
like really cartoony graphics but it's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.330 
like really cartoony graphics but it's
it's<00:01:57.479> kind<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.659> cute<00:01:57.840> at<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:57.990> same<00:01:58.079> time<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.710> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
it's kind of cute at the same time and I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's kind of cute at the same time and I
think<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> ideas<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.119> everything<00:02:00.390> behind<00:02:00.509> it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
think the ideas and everything behind it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.969 
think the ideas and everything behind it
are<00:02:00.810> really<00:02:01.049> cool<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.439> basically<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.890> have

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
are really cool so basically you have

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.469 
are really cool so basically you have
monsters<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.820> life<00:02:03.000> points<00:02:03.390> in

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
monsters and you have life points in

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
monsters and you have life points in
your<00:02:03.570> attack<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.469> enemy<00:02:04.979> wizard<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.399> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
your attack the enemy wizard and you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.130 
your attack the enemy wizard and you
attack<00:02:06.149> their<00:02:06.299> life<00:02:06.450> points<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
attack their life points and then you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.869 
attack their life points and then you
also<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.350> monsters<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:07.979> do<00:02:08.489> special

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
also have monsters I can do special

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.100 
also have monsters I can do special
effects<00:02:09.119> UF<00:02:09.300> trap<00:02:09.509> card<00:02:09.750> stuff<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.080> that

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
effects UF trap card stuff like that

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.750 
effects UF trap card stuff like that
very<00:02:10.560> soon<00:02:10.739> when<00:02:10.860> magic<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> gathering<00:02:11.310> very

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
very soon when magic the gathering very

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
very soon when magic the gathering very
similar<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.090> hearthstone

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
similar to hearthstone

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.230 
similar to hearthstone
so<00:02:14.010> far<00:02:14.220> there's<00:02:14.520> nothing<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.850> really<00:02:14.940> sets

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
so far there's nothing that really sets

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.550 
so far there's nothing that really sets
it<00:02:15.300> apart<00:02:15.420> from<00:02:15.630> any<00:02:15.840> other<00:02:15.930> game<00:02:16.200> other<00:02:16.350> than

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
it apart from any other game other than

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.290 
it apart from any other game other than
it<00:02:16.920> looks<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.580> really<00:02:17.730> geared<00:02:17.970> for

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
it looks like it's really geared for

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.540 
it looks like it's really geared for
children's<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.350> I'm<00:02:19.680> gonna<00:02:19.860> suggest<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.400> for

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
children's so I'm gonna suggest it for

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.980 
children's so I'm gonna suggest it for
children<00:02:21.000> gamers<00:02:21.330> or<00:02:21.360> people<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.690> want<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
children gamers or people that want to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.210 
children gamers or people that want to
get<00:02:22.050> children<00:02:22.230> into<00:02:22.680> these<00:02:22.770> kind<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.040> games

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
get children into these kind of games

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.920 
get children into these kind of games
but<00:02:23.490> other<00:02:23.910> than<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.180> there's<00:02:24.870> really

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
but other than that there's really

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.570 
but other than that there's really
nothing<00:02:25.440> substantial<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.100> game<00:02:26.310> that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
nothing substantial to the game that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.190 
nothing substantial to the game that
makes<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.850> different<00:02:27.180> there's<00:02:27.450> really<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.690> lot

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
makes it different there's really a lot

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.750 
makes it different there's really a lot
of<00:02:28.350> reasons<00:02:28.680> why<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.860> would<00:02:29.100> even<00:02:29.280> call<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.580> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
of reasons why I would even call it a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.520 
of reasons why I would even call it a
bad<00:02:29.880> game<00:02:30.150> but<00:02:30.840> that's<00:02:31.050> my<00:02:31.140> personal<00:02:31.470> opinion

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
bad game but that's my personal opinion

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.740 
bad game but that's my personal opinion
anyways<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:32.430> scaling<00:02:32.640> shore<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.090> free<00:02:33.450> MMO

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
even if sometimes the games are really

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.290
