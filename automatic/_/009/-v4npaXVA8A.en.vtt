00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.530
 hello how are you in this video I'm going to 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.020
 do a tarantella for that I'm going to 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.260
 need a mold that can be savarin 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.140
 it can be custard or it can be this 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.300
 it's for floating island 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:27.140
 let's use 8 eggs three apples 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.740
 milk bread type of tables and like this in 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.680
 slices 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.690
 sugar condensed milk essence 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.540
 vanilla and lÃ¶w zest 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.690
 here I have the apples peeled and 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.000
 cut in half slices so finite 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.640
 if you want to not be 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.530
 go rusting you can throw juice 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.309
 lemon over let's make the candy 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.710
 I put 300 grams of sugar here and 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.970
 now I 'm going to throw 150 centimeters 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.970
 cubic of water 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.879
 and we take it until there is color 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.879
 amber 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.290
 little by little it is changing color 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.930
 when we achieve an amber color 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.930
 is when we put out the fire 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:30.409
 quickly let's caramelize 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 the entire surface of the 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.210
 we take a dish towel so as not to burn 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.869
 because this goes up a lot of temperature and 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.340
 we move it from side to side to cover 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.340
 all the surface of the candy 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:51.340
 be very careful before the 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.340
 candy we are going to put slices of more 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.929
 next to each other 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.060
 until we in this way by 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.310
 other side I have here the slices of 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.350
 what we are going to do is 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.350
 just remove the edges 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.050
 so that we are left with the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:20.410
 fillets all neat now in a 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.410
 blender we are going to put the 8 eggs 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.269
 vanilla essence 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.460
 this is approximate will be a teaspoon 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.170
 or two 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.440
 let's make the condensed milk to the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.440
 can 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.870
 and 750 cubic centimeters of milk 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.870
 entire 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.599
 so now what we 're going to do is 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:56.319
 Blend until all is well 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.319
 homogeneous 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.130
 in this way everything sparkling has us 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.730
 what we are going to do is take 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.390
 some of the layers of bread and we're going 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.960
 to cut into a triangle shape 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.170
 some yes now I'm going to show you like this 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.760
 that first we are going to put a slice of 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.629
 honeycomb on the side 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.629
 on the other side 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.680
 to the center 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.299
 low 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:38.420
 and with these triangle shapes what 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.420
 let's do is fill in the edges 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.180
 Now what we are going to do is throw 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.180
 our mix 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.510
 moistening all the slices 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.439
 we press so that all the 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.439
 wet landmarks edges 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:11.040
 now let's put another layer but of 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.879
 apples next to each other 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.879
 in this way 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.400
 to plunder with the hard race of lemon 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.970
 remember that only the part 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.970
 yellow 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:33.789
 and now we are going to place layers of apple 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:37.240
 but you stop like this and all 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:43.199
 looking at the same address and then 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.199
 we will place another layer of bread 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:54.250
 taking care that the layers of 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.250
 apple that we put around 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.499
 holding so that we do not run 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:05.949
 loaves we're going to throw again the 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:05.949
 liquid 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.750
 until wet 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.750
 all slices of bread 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.460
 we put another layer of apples 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:27.590
 we remove the lemon zest 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:30.139
 and we repeat the operation until finished 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.960
 with the ingredients in this way already 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:37.340
 I finished with the last layer of bread in 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.160
 total you 22 slices of bread but for 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.849
 this mold that is quite large and 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.069
 deep you will use according to the 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:51.009
 mold that you have pressured 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:51.009
 to wet all the slices well 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:59.010
 I have the oven preheated to a minimum 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:03.780
 yes so what you are going to do is 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:08.190
 place the mold in the oven for space 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:12.660
 of about an hour if and when 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:15.000
 they stick and it comes out dry it's already good here 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.040
 there is the tarantella just outside the 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.400
 oven now let's wait for it to 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.350
 cool and unmold what we're going to 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.470
 do now is unmold it so that it 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.540
 we place the base on it 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.560
 it's still a little hot so 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:38.400
 I'm going to play with a dish cloth and fast 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.400
 but firm let's turn the mold 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:54.060
 so carefully let's lift 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:07.210
 two 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.210
 and in this way 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.920
 we already have precious to our afternoon 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.850
 before the 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.340
 ready to eat 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:24.290
 I'm going to cut a portion to show you 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.290
 how is it inside 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:37.380
 they take them to the refrigerator 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:39.150
 and if you can not eat it like that and dating 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.080
 how can they accompany it with the 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.080
 Chantilly cream 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.430
 Well I hope you liked it
