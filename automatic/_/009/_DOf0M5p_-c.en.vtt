so<00:00:00.179> you<00:00:00.299> do<00:00:00.659> it<00:00:00.780> all<00:00:00.930> in<00:00:01.110> here<00:00:01.260> if<00:00:01.709> there<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.070> one

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
so you do it all in here if there is one

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.269 
so you do it all in here if there is one
thing<00:00:02.550> that<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:02.939> learned<00:00:03.179> in<00:00:03.419> my<00:00:03.540> journey<00:00:03.810> on<00:00:04.279> my

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
thing that I learned in my journey on my

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.839 
thing that I learned in my journey on my
instrument<00:00:06.000> it's<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.960> rhythm<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.639> much

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
instrument it's that rhythm is so much

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.700 
instrument it's that rhythm is so much
more<00:00:08.880> important<00:00:09.510> than<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.200> note<00:00:10.440> you're

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
more important than the note you're

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.419 
more important than the note you're
playing<00:00:11.059> it<00:00:12.059> really<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.440> play<00:00:13.679> random

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
playing it really is you can play random

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.670 
playing it really is you can play random
notes<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.240> don't<00:00:15.690> really<00:00:15.839> make<00:00:16.109> any<00:00:16.289> sense

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
notes that don't really make any sense

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.550 
notes that don't really make any sense
over<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.820> chord<00:00:18.060> progression<00:00:18.570> your<00:00:19.109> phrasing

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
over the chord progression your phrasing

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.269 
over the chord progression your phrasing
on<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.330> still<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> work<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:22.920> your

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
on and still it's going to work if your

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.750 
on and still it's going to work if your
rhythm<00:00:23.580> phrasing<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.390> coherent<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.859> that

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
rhythm phrasing is coherent and so that

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.950 
rhythm phrasing is coherent and so that
really<00:00:27.080> freed<00:00:28.080> me<00:00:28.380> up<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:29.269> do<00:00:30.269> not<00:00:30.480> worry<00:00:30.720> too

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
really freed me up to do not worry too

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.120 
really freed me up to do not worry too
much<00:00:30.990> about<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.279> theory<00:00:32.730> set<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.239> things<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
much about the theory set of things and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
much about the theory set of things and
focus<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.000> rhythm<00:00:36.360> side<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.660> things

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
focus more on the rhythm side of things

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.619 
focus more on the rhythm side of things
this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> help<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.739> create<00:00:38.010> some

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
this is going to help you create some

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.700 
this is going to help you create some
automatic<00:00:39.629> type<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:41.120> bebop<00:00:42.120> lines<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.840> of

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
automatic type of bebop lines and of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
automatic type of bebop lines and of
course<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.219> need<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> guideline

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
course you do need to have a guideline

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
course you do need to have a guideline
knowing<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:45.840> scales<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> help<00:00:46.680> but

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
knowing your scales is going to help but

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.250 
knowing your scales is going to help but
if<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.730> work<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:49.050> your

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
if you work a little bit more on your

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.340 
if you work a little bit more on your
rhythm<00:00:49.710> placement<00:00:50.250> your<00:00:51.180> propositions<00:00:52.170> are

rhythm placement your propositions are

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.560 
rhythm placement your propositions are
going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> sound<00:00:52.910> probably<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.059> lot<00:00:54.210> smarter

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
going to sound probably a lot smarter

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.040 
going to sound probably a lot smarter

comfortable beach will set a dad to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.090 
comfortable beach will set a dad to
maybe<00:01:14.869> 110<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.500> we'll<00:01:16.650> select<00:01:16.920> the

maybe 110 and then we'll select the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.460 
maybe 110 and then we'll select the
subdivision<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.049> case<00:01:19.110> will<00:01:19.439> be

sixteenth notes any time I'm playing and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
sixteenth notes any time I'm playing and
no<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.470> note<00:01:22.680> should<00:01:22.920> fall<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
no to that note should fall on one of

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:37.819 
no to that note should fall on one of
the<00:01:23.790> subdivisions<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.930> chose<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:37.680> can

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the subdivisions that I chose you can

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.520 
the subdivisions that I chose you can
expand<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.460> maybe<00:01:38.820> use<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.960> sixteenth

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
expand that maybe use the sixteenth

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.609 
expand that maybe use the sixteenth
triplets<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.140> six<00:01:43.140> notes<00:01:43.380> per<00:01:43.590> beat

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
triplets which is a six notes per beat

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.670 
triplets which is a six notes per beat
or<00:01:44.210> any<00:01:45.210> other<00:01:45.540> subdivision<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.530> can

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
or any other subdivision that you can

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.530 
or any other subdivision that you can
think<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.700> app<00:01:47.880> does<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.420> well

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
think of and that app does it very well

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.679 
think of and that app does it very well
ideally<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:50.070> want<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.520> disable<00:01:51.060> them<00:01:51.420> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
ideally you want to disable them and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.080 
ideally you want to disable them and
those<00:01:52.110> subdivisions<00:01:52.500> should<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.189> internally

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
those subdivisions should be internally

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.319 
those subdivisions should be internally
heard<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.530> I'm<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.219> deactivate<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
heard so I'm going to deactivate the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.999 
heard so I'm going to deactivate the
subdivisions<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.290> only<00:01:58.409> hear<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> beat

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
subdivisions and will only hear the beat

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.330 
subdivisions and will only hear the beat
in<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.880> mind<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.509> should<00:02:01.020> hear<00:02:01.290> those<00:02:01.500> teka<00:02:02.009> teka

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
in my mind I should hear those teka teka

tempo<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.640> then<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.360> enter<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:29.020> landing<00:02:30.010> tempo

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
tempo and then you enter a landing tempo

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.520 
tempo and then you enter a landing tempo
and<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:30.880> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.060> increase<00:02:31.360> gradually<00:02:32.110> for

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
and it's going to increase gradually for

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
minute once it's selected my tempo I can

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.140 
minute once it's selected my tempo I can
select<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.140> number<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.709> stable<00:03:58.640> bars<00:03:58.850> the

select the number of stable bars the
stable<00:03:59.510> bars<00:03:59.750> are<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.260> bars<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.890> are<00:04:01.220> going

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
stable bars are the bars that are going

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.030 
stable bars are the bars that are going
to<00:04:01.489> feature<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:02.480> metronome<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.200> in<00:04:03.920> this

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
to feature the metronome and in this

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.160 
to feature the metronome and in this
case<00:04:04.310> every<00:04:04.850> three<00:04:05.300> bars<00:04:05.569> is<00:04:05.840> going<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.050> be

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
case every three bars is going to be

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.900

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
fourth bar is going to leave the

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.479 
fourth bar is going to leave the
metronome<00:04:10.310> out<00:04:10.690> leaving<00:04:11.690> me<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.739> task<00:04:13.069> to

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
metronome out leaving me the task to

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.640 
metronome out leaving me the task to
internalize<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.450> tempo<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.140> it's<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.380> great

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
internalize the tempo and it's a great

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.920 
internalize the tempo and it's a great
way<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:15.950> kind<00:04:16.220> of<00:04:16.310> check<00:04:16.639> yourself<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.450> see<00:04:17.660> if

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
way to kind of check yourself and see if

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.550 
way to kind of check yourself and see if
you<00:04:18.380> are<00:04:19.060> if<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.359> are<00:04:20.389> playing<00:04:20.840> with<00:04:21.290> in<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
you are if you are playing with in the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:44.080 
you are if you are playing with in the
template<00:04:42.220> obviously<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.430> more<00:04:43.580> beats<00:04:43.850> you

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
template obviously the more beats you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.050 
template obviously the more beats you
leave<00:04:44.390> out<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:45.140> harder<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.770> is<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.310> the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
leave out the harder it is and the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.870 
leave out the harder it is and the
slower<00:04:47.539> you<00:04:47.990> set<00:04:48.470> your<00:04:48.680> metronome<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.400> harder

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
slower you set your metronome the harder

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.390 
slower you set your metronome the harder
it<00:04:50.000> is<00:04:50.030> but<00:04:50.360> this<00:04:50.479> is<00:04:50.660> a<00:04:50.690> great<00:04:51.260> way<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.680> improve

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
it is but this is a great way to improve

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.000 
it is but this is a great way to improve
and<00:04:52.729> learn<00:04:53.000> how<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.300> internalize<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.800> beat

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
and learn how to internalize the beat

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.790 
and learn how to internalize the beat
another<00:04:55.490> cool<00:04:55.789> feature<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:57.140> ghost<00:04:57.560> be

top here this allows you to set the

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.700 
top here this allows you to set the
percentage<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:04.840> chances<00:05:05.840> that<00:05:06.229> some<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.620> the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
percentage of chances that some of the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.340 
percentage of chances that some of the
beats<00:05:06.919> are<00:05:07.250> going<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:07.789> be<00:05:07.910> taken<00:05:08.479> out<00:05:08.750> so<00:05:09.110> if<00:05:09.260> I

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
beats are going to be taken out so if I

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.290 
beats are going to be taken out so if I
take<00:05:09.560> fifty<00:05:09.979> percent<00:05:10.310> for<00:05:10.550> example<00:05:11.000> if<00:05:11.210> I

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
take fifty percent for example if I

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.930 
take fifty percent for example if I
leave<00:05:11.479> it<00:05:11.600> like<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:11.810> and<00:05:12.289> I<00:05:13.190> enable<00:05:13.789> that

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
leave it like that and I enable that

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.640 
leave it like that and I enable that
dice<00:05:14.300> well<00:05:15.289> fifty<00:05:16.250> percent<00:05:16.669> of<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.630> of<00:05:18.289> the

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
dice well fifty percent of the of the

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.140 
dice well fifty percent of the of the
beats<00:05:18.890> are<00:05:19.010> going<00:05:19.160> to<00:05:19.220> be<00:05:19.280> taken<00:05:19.669> out<00:05:19.820> at

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
beats are going to be taken out at

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:38.239 
beats are going to be taken out at
random<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.229> let's<00:05:21.650> give<00:05:21.950> that<00:05:22.130> a<00:05:22.160> try
