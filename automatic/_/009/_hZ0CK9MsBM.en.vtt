though<00:00:18.440> it's<00:00:18.590> 30<00:00:18.830> degrees<00:00:19.190> outside<00:00:19.400> and<00:00:19.970> we

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
though it's 30 degrees outside and we

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.970 
though it's 30 degrees outside and we
just<00:00:20.539> got<00:00:20.660> to<00:00:20.690> put<00:00:20.869> a<00:00:20.930> snow<00:00:21.230> I<00:00:21.500> think<00:00:21.529> I<00:00:21.830> owe<00:00:21.860> it

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
just got to put a snow I think I owe it

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
really take a look at this oil so we can

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.609 
really take a look at this oil so we can
get<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:26.179> all<00:00:26.300> cleaned<00:00:26.599> out<00:00:26.720> get<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:27.380> rest<00:00:27.560> of

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
get it all cleaned out get the rest of

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.990 
get it all cleaned out get the rest of
the<00:00:27.710> motor<00:00:27.890> cleaned<00:00:28.189> out<00:00:28.339> and<00:00:28.609> get<00:00:28.730> this<00:00:28.849> thing

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
the motor cleaned out and get this thing

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.659 
the motor cleaned out and get this thing
ice<00:00:29.150> racing<00:00:29.619> so<00:00:30.619> in<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:30.800> previous<00:00:31.160> episodes

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
ice racing so in the previous episodes

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.610 
ice racing so in the previous episodes
we<00:00:31.880> noticed<00:00:32.210> a<00:00:32.270> crazy<00:00:32.599> ticking<00:00:33.080> noise<00:00:33.260> coming

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
we noticed a crazy ticking noise coming

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.710 
we noticed a crazy ticking noise coming
from<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.770> motor<00:00:33.980> we<00:00:34.790> hope<00:00:34.970> scraping<00:00:35.420> out<00:00:35.540> what

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
from the motor we hope scraping out what

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.090 
from the motor we hope scraping out what
we<00:00:35.810> could<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:36.200> cleaning<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.650> inside<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:37.040> the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
we could and cleaning the inside of the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.770 
we could and cleaning the inside of the
motor<00:00:37.220> with<00:00:37.490> some<00:00:37.640> diesel<00:00:37.910> would<00:00:38.180> help<00:00:38.390> loosen

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
motor with some diesel would help loosen

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.479 
motor with some diesel would help loosen
everything<00:00:38.990> up<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:39.380> allow<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.770> oil<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:40.160> flow

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
everything up and allow the oil to flow

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.240 
everything up and allow the oil to flow
but<00:00:41.480> even<00:00:42.170> after<00:00:42.410> all<00:00:42.530> our<00:00:42.710> excitement<00:00:43.039> of

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
but even after all our excitement of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.709 
but even after all our excitement of
finishing<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:43.699> project<00:00:44.149> and<00:00:44.270> starting<00:00:44.629> the

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
finishing the project and starting the

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.930 
finishing the project and starting the
car<00:00:44.930> we're<00:00:45.649> still<00:00:45.980> left<00:00:46.129> with<00:00:46.340> this<00:00:46.430> terrible

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
car we're still left with this terrible

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.639 
car we're still left with this terrible
clicking<00:00:47.329> noise<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:51.050> here's<00:00:51.289> our<00:00:51.440> noise

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
clicking noise so here's our noise

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.069 
clicking noise so here's our noise
baseline<00:00:52.340> for<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:52.609> motor<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.180> remember<00:00:53.840> this

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
baseline for the motor and remember this

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.170 
baseline for the motor and remember this
is<00:00:54.289> right<00:00:54.530> after<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:54.920> fresh<00:00:55.219> oil<00:00:55.460> change<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:56.030> new

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
is right after a fresh oil change a new

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:05.149 
is right after a fresh oil change a new
filter

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.399 

the<00:01:06.119> motor<00:01:06.329> doesn't<00:01:06.570> sound<00:01:06.899> too<00:01:07.049> healthy

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the motor doesn't sound too healthy

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
the motor doesn't sound too healthy
right<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:08.219> didn't<00:01:08.429> think<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.579> either

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
right we didn't think so either

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.179 
right we didn't think so either
so<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.840> decided<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> open<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> oil<00:01:10.890> filter

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
so we decided to open up the oil filter

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.459 
so we decided to open up the oil filter
housing<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.789> take<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.969> closer<00:01:12.270> look<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.840> what

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
housing and take a closer look and what

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.279 
housing and take a closer look and what
we<00:01:13.560> found<00:01:13.770> was<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.399> nasty<00:01:15.259> brand-new<00:01:16.259> oil

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
we found was just nasty brand-new oil

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.139 
we found was just nasty brand-new oil
that<00:01:16.710> looked<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:16.950> honey<00:01:17.250> five<00:01:17.579> minutes<00:01:17.939> ago

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
that looked like honey five minutes ago

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.380 
that looked like honey five minutes ago
was<00:01:18.659> now<00:01:18.899> this<00:01:19.110> thick<00:01:19.560> brown<00:01:19.950> sludge<00:01:20.399> and<00:01:20.759> then

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
was now this thick brown sludge and then

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.059 
was now this thick brown sludge and then
we're<00:01:21.479> also<00:01:21.600> chunks<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.259> flakes<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> old<00:01:22.890> oil

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
we're also chunks and flakes of old oil

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.100 
we're also chunks and flakes of old oil
everywhere<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> brand-new<00:01:24.509> filter<00:01:24.899> was

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
everywhere and the brand-new filter was

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.230 
everywhere and the brand-new filter was
completely<00:01:25.679> clogged<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.729> know<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.209> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
completely clogged we know we want a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.139 
completely clogged we know we want a
good<00:01:27.420> running<00:01:27.659> reliable<00:01:28.289> car<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.399> even

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
good running reliable car but now even

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.209 
good running reliable car but now even
just<00:01:30.390> idling<00:01:31.049> gives<00:01:31.409> us<00:01:31.530> an<00:01:31.679> oil<00:01:31.799> warning

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
just idling gives us an oil warning

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.730 
just idling gives us an oil warning
light<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.929> if<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.140> don't<00:01:34.289> come<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.679> a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
light and if we don't come up with a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740 
light and if we don't come up with a
plan<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.039> attack<00:01:35.219> for<00:01:35.459> this<00:01:35.729> oil<00:01:35.880> problem<00:01:36.390> this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
plan of attack for this oil problem this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.880 
plan of attack for this oil problem this
motor<00:01:36.959> is<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.319> to<00:01:37.380> last<00:01:37.500> long<00:01:37.649> at<00:01:37.950> all

now<00:01:43.890> even<00:01:44.489> though<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:44.909> cold<00:01:45.239> out<00:01:45.509> our

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
now even though it's really cold out our

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
now even though it's really cold out our
plan<00:01:46.289> is<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> bring<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:46.860> car<00:01:47.039> up<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> temp

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
plan is to bring the car up to temp

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.690 
plan is to bring the car up to temp
drain<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.929> strain<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.709> oil<00:01:49.739> several<00:01:50.429> times

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
drain and strain the oil several times

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
drain and strain the oil several times
until<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.539> see<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> major<00:01:51.959> flakes<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.590> oil

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
until we can see the major flakes of oil

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
until we can see the major flakes of oil
are<00:01:53.009> gone<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:54.360> some<00:01:54.539> more<00:01:54.720> seafoam

are gone and with some more seafoam
solvent<00:01:55.799> we're<00:01:56.429> really<00:01:56.610> hoping<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> break

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
solvent we're really hoping to break

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.550 
solvent we're really hoping to break
down<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> rest<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.869> gunk<00:01:58.049> inside<00:01:58.409> the

all<00:02:06.239> right<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.569> now<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.929> car<00:02:07.140> jacked<00:02:07.439> up

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
all right so now with the car jacked up

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.319 
all right so now with the car jacked up
we<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:07.979> how<00:02:08.160> bad<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.519> oil<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.179> got

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.329 
we know how bad this oil is it's got

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.840 
we know how bad this oil is it's got
bits<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.750> flaky<00:02:10.170> black<00:02:10.470> whatever<00:02:10.950> leftover

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
bits of flaky black whatever leftover

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.910 
bits of flaky black whatever leftover
inside<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:12.959> I've<00:02:13.049> got<00:02:13.079> I've<00:02:13.440> got<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> catch

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
inside so what I've got I've got a catch

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
inside so what I've got I've got a catch
pan<00:02:14.190> here<00:02:14.579> I'm<00:02:14.700> going<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.910> drain<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.299> oil

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
pan here I'm going to drain all the oil

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.390 
pan here I'm going to drain all the oil
out<00:02:15.780> into<00:02:16.139> it<00:02:16.260> let<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.470> drip<00:02:16.799> drip<00:02:17.010> drip<00:02:17.190> and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
out into it let it drip drip drip and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.210 
out into it let it drip drip drip and
then<00:02:17.940> I've<00:02:18.060> got<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.209> nice<00:02:19.049> clean<00:02:19.410> jug<00:02:20.040> right

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
then I've got a nice clean jug right

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.129 
then I've got a nice clean jug right
here<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.850> funnel<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.720> we're<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:21.989> going

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:22.139 
here and a funnel and we're just going

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.920 
here and a funnel and we're just going
to<00:02:22.200> use<00:02:22.290> some<00:02:22.410> coffee<00:02:23.190> filters<00:02:24.120> trying<00:02:24.870> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
to use some coffee filters trying to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.410 
to use some coffee filters trying to
filter<00:02:25.109> out<00:02:25.290> some<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.650> black<00:02:25.920> material

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
filter out some of this black material

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.640 
filter out some of this black material
and<00:02:27.420> with<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.630> temperature<00:02:28.019> dropping<00:02:28.319> I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
and with the temperature dropping I

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.140 
and with the temperature dropping I
thought<00:02:28.889> being<00:02:29.100> underneath<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.639> warm<00:02:29.880> car

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
thought being underneath the warm car

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.090 
thought being underneath the warm car
sounded<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.690> pretty<00:02:30.959> good<00:02:31.139> idea<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:32.069> I

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
sounded like a pretty good idea but I

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.550 
sounded like a pretty good idea but I
was<00:02:32.190> totally<00:02:32.639> wrong<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.569> warm<00:02:33.840> car<00:02:34.139> was<00:02:34.380> just

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
was totally wrong the warm car was just

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.680 
was totally wrong the warm car was just
melting<00:02:34.950> snow<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.250> ice<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.730> me<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.299> now<00:02:36.450> not

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
melting snow and ice on me so now not

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.930 
melting snow and ice on me so now not
only<00:02:36.720> was<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.109> cold<00:02:37.410> but<00:02:37.859> I<00:02:37.889> was<00:02:38.040> wet<00:02:38.280> also

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.610 

anyway<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.329> let<00:02:42.510> all<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.840> oil<00:02:43.019> drip<00:02:43.260> out<00:02:43.380> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
anyway we let all the oil drip out that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.589 
anyway we let all the oil drip out that
we<00:02:43.739> could<00:02:43.980> even<00:02:44.609> leaving<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.970> catch<00:02:45.150> pan<00:02:45.450> in

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
we could even leaving the catch pan in

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.599 
we could even leaving the catch pan in
place<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.200> adding<00:02:46.560> more<00:02:46.739> oil<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> filler

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
place and adding more oil to the filler

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.759 
place and adding more oil to the filler
in<00:02:47.849> hopes<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.660> flushing<00:02:49.049> out<00:02:49.169> in<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.530> stuck

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
in hopes of flushing out in it and stuck

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.140 
in hopes of flushing out in it and stuck
to<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:49.980> bottom<00:02:50.099> of<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.400> oil<00:02:50.430> pan<00:02:50.700> and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.129 

although<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.329> can't<00:02:54.569> see<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:54.959> video

although you can't see it in this video
the<00:02:55.739> last<00:02:55.950> few<00:02:56.220> drops<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.730> oil<00:02:56.910> we're<00:02:57.120> actually

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
the last few drops of oil we're actually

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.910 
the last few drops of oil we're actually
chunky

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
chunky

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.520 
chunky
with<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.970> oil<00:03:01.240> draining<00:03:01.600> out<00:03:01.750> now<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.319> time

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
with the oil draining out now it's time

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:13.350 
with the oil draining out now it's time
to<00:03:02.560> remove<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.069> oil<00:03:03.100> filter<00:03:10.950> as<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.209> see

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
to remove the oil filter as you can see

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.180 
to remove the oil filter as you can see
there's<00:03:13.569> tons<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.140> black<00:03:14.350> flakes<00:03:14.680> trapped<00:03:15.040> in

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
there's tons of black flakes trapped in

there's tons of black flakes trapped in
the<00:03:15.280> filter<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:18.310> oil<00:03:18.459> that's<00:03:18.700> remaining

the filter and the oil that's remaining

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.230 
the filter and the oil that's remaining
in<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.330> housing<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:19.900> just<00:03:20.200> nasty<00:03:20.440> too<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:22.090> next

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
in the housing is just nasty too so next

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.820 
in the housing is just nasty too so next
up<00:03:22.420> was<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.810> filter<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.230> oil<00:03:23.260> through<00:03:23.770> the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
up was to filter the oil through the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.670 
up was to filter the oil through the
coffee<00:03:24.100> filter<00:03:24.810> as<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:25.870> can<00:03:26.140> see<00:03:26.320> here<00:03:26.530> by<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
coffee filter as you can see here by the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.760 
coffee filter as you can see here by the
film<00:03:27.010> that's<00:03:27.220> sped<00:03:27.550> up<00:03:27.670> 400%<00:03:28.540> things<00:03:29.500> didn't

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
film that's sped up 400% things didn't

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.260 
film that's sped up 400% things didn't
go<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:30.069> well<00:03:30.100> so<00:03:32.370> off<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.610> hardware<00:03:33.910> store

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
go so well so off to the hardware store

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.760 
go so well so off to the hardware store
and<00:03:34.300> three<00:03:34.720> dollars<00:03:35.020> later<00:03:35.200> we<00:03:35.470> had<00:03:35.620> ourselves

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
and three dollars later we had ourselves

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.220 
and three dollars later we had ourselves
a<00:03:36.160> set<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.520> paints<00:03:36.850> trainers<00:03:37.239> in<00:03:37.540> medium<00:03:37.989> mesh

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
a set of paints trainers in medium mesh

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.280 
a set of paints trainers in medium mesh
variety<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:40.030> straining<00:03:40.300> process<00:03:40.840> was<00:03:41.019> much

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
variety the straining process was much

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.500 
variety the straining process was much
faster<00:03:41.530> than<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.010> coffee<00:03:42.190> filter<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.360> as<00:03:43.480> a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
faster than the coffee filter and as a

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.180 
faster than the coffee filter and as a
result<00:03:44.019> we<00:03:44.440> were<00:03:44.530> wondering<00:03:44.890> if<00:03:44.980> we<00:03:45.100> had

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
result we were wondering if we had

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.610 
result we were wondering if we had
chosen<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.610> wrong<00:03:45.790> mesh<00:03:46.090> weave<00:03:49.350> we<00:03:50.350> actually

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
chosen the wrong mesh weave we actually

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.780 
chosen the wrong mesh weave we actually
didn't<00:03:50.830> know<00:03:50.890> if<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.100> would<00:03:51.190> catch<00:03:51.400> anything

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
didn't know if it would catch anything

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.729 
didn't know if it would catch anything
at<00:03:51.880> all<00:03:52.000> but<00:03:52.959> then<00:03:53.140> when<00:03:53.260> we<00:03:53.350> look<00:03:53.530> at<00:03:53.620> the

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
at all but then when we look at the

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.530 
at all but then when we look at the
bottom<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.220> filter<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.790> closer<00:03:55.209> look

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
bottom of the filter a closer look

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.210 
bottom of the filter a closer look
revealed<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.440> bottom<00:03:56.769> portion<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.160> the

is after letting the oil sit for about
20<00:04:01.780> minutes<00:04:01.930> while<00:04:02.200> we<00:04:02.350> mince<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.739> store

the<00:04:07.990> filtered<00:04:08.380> oil<00:04:08.590> then<00:04:08.890> went<00:04:09.130> through

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
the filtered oil then went through

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.040 
the filtered oil then went through
another<00:04:09.610> new<00:04:09.820> strainer<00:04:10.210> and<00:04:10.480> back<00:04:10.780> into<00:04:10.990> the

another new strainer and back into the

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.040 
another new strainer and back into the
motor<00:04:11.320> for<00:04:11.560> another<00:04:11.800> cycle<00:04:12.480> we<00:04:13.480> repeated<00:04:13.930> this

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
motor for another cycle we repeated this

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.440 
motor for another cycle we repeated this
cycle<00:04:14.110> several<00:04:14.950> times<00:04:15.190> using<00:04:15.670> new<00:04:15.970> strainers

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
each time and while we're at it you took

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.910 
each time and while we're at it you took
time<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.780> clean<00:04:19.989> off<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.170> oil<00:04:20.530> filter<00:04:20.890> housing

cover<00:04:21.549> also<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:23.460> as<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.610> can<00:04:24.790> see<00:04:25.000> here<00:04:25.300> it's

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
cover also and as you can see here it's

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.879 
cover also and as you can see here it's
still<00:04:25.960> filthy

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.170 

if<00:04:31.889> everything<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.400> clean<00:04:32.669> as<00:04:32.790> we<00:04:32.910> could<00:04:33.060> get

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
if everything is clean as we could get

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.610 
if everything is clean as we could get
it<00:04:33.240> we're<00:04:33.660> going<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.810> be<00:04:33.930> upping<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.260> dosage

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
it we're going to be upping the dosage

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.550 
it we're going to be upping the dosage
of<00:04:34.770> seafoam<00:04:35.220> now<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.419> ratio<00:04:36.570> calls<00:04:37.050> for<00:04:37.320> one

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
of seafoam now the ratio calls for one

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.280 
of seafoam now the ratio calls for one
pint<00:04:37.860> for<00:04:38.220> ten<00:04:38.430> quarts<00:04:38.790> of<00:04:38.880> oil<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.360> as<00:04:40.139> you

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
pint for ten quarts of oil and as you

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.020 
pint for ten quarts of oil and as you
can<00:04:40.410> see<00:04:40.470> here<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.370> were<00:04:41.490> very<00:04:41.669> scientific<00:04:44.030> but

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
can see here we were very scientific but

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.180 
can see here we were very scientific but
before<00:04:45.480> we<00:04:45.600> button<00:04:45.870> everything<00:04:46.050> back<00:04:46.350> up<00:04:46.380> take

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
before we button everything back up take

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.440 
before we button everything back up take
a<00:04:47.250> look<00:04:47.460> at<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.639> strainer<00:04:47.910> from<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.240> last

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
a look at the strainer from the last

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.840 
a look at the strainer from the last
cycle<00:04:48.690> he<00:04:48.930> did<00:04:49.139> can't<00:04:50.070> really<00:04:50.280> say<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.610> looks<00:04:50.760> a

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
cycle he did can't really say it looks a

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.370 
cycle he did can't really say it looks a
whole<00:04:50.880> lot<00:04:51.000> better<00:04:51.180> from<00:04:51.570> when<00:04:51.690> we<00:04:51.810> started<00:04:51.840> I

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
whole lot better from when we started I

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.020 
whole lot better from when we started I
mean<00:04:53.010> there's<00:04:53.340> still<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.580> ton<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:53.910> stuff

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
mean there's still a ton of stuff

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.300 
mean there's still a ton of stuff
floating<00:04:54.480> around<00:04:54.600> in<00:04:54.840> this<00:04:54.930> motor<00:04:55.200> but<00:04:56.190> with

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
floating around in this motor but with

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.310 
floating around in this motor but with
attempts<00:04:56.669> almost<00:04:56.940> in<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.150> teens<00:04:57.419> we<00:04:57.840> decided

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
attempts almost in the teens we decided

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.110 
attempts almost in the teens we decided
to<00:04:58.410> throw<00:04:58.560> in<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.830> new<00:04:58.980> filter<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.580> call<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.030> a

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
to throw in a new filter and call it a

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.110 
to throw in a new filter and call it a
day<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:01.620> with<00:05:01.800> all<00:05:01.919> this<00:05:02.070> in<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.310> motor<00:05:02.490> let

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
day and with all this in the motor let

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.520 
day and with all this in the motor let
me<00:05:03.210> know<00:05:03.330> in<00:05:03.419> the<00:05:03.510> comments<00:05:03.900> below<00:05:04.020> how<00:05:04.350> long
