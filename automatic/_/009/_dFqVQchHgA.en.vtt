00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.670 
well as the black and Asif seas and so
they<00:03:03.210> had<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.600> move<00:03:03.750> from<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.200> north<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.500> the

they had to move from the north to the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.610 
they had to move from the north to the
south<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.310> south<00:03:06.300> was<00:03:06.660> therefore<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.320> front

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
south the south was therefore in front

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.710 
south the south was therefore in front
and<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.130> northern<00:03:08.340> coast<00:03:08.700> behind<00:03:09.270> them<00:03:09.510> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and the northern coast behind them a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.810 
and the northern coast behind them a
ship<00:03:10.680> captain<00:03:10.920> sailing<00:03:11.400> into<00:03:11.730> the

Mediterranean from the Bosporus would

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.610

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
look at the approaching African coast

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.410 
look at the approaching African coast
thus<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:17.190> east<00:03:17.400> was<00:03:17.610> on<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> left<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
thus the east was on the left and the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.110 
thus the east was on the left and the
west<00:03:18.930> was<00:03:19.110> on<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.470> right<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.880> why<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
west was on the right this is why the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.210 
west was on the right this is why the

first seed charts of both the traders in
the<00:03:23.430> military<00:03:23.730> put<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.390> east<00:03:24.600> on<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.990> left<00:03:25.200> it

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
the military put the east on the left it

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.980 
the military put the east on the left it
made<00:03:26.490> sense<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.910> put<00:03:27.210> that<00:03:27.390> which<00:03:27.600> lay<00:03:27.810> in

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
made sense to put that which lay in

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.100 
made sense to put that which lay in

one looks at the map corresponds with

one looks at the map corresponds with
