00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 I move away from text files in visual more weeks 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.180
 at night or text in visual c ++ 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.049
 requires the inclusion of a library named to register inc 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:17.460
 which provides the necessary functionalities to carry out the diverse 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.050
 situations that we can do with eight like 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.310
 which is to read information information in them 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.630
 for the present example we have a program that basically 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.429
 create 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.429
 a text file and second instance 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.520
 aure s-9 text to read the information it contains per month 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.140
 let's see in detail the program 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.440
 initially a text variable is declared 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.050
 which will be used later to read the file information 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.660
 we create the file 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.370
 new south mexico 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.820
 is a text file that we are going to call tepito punto txt 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.140
 it is necessary to declare 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.130
 the file as a variable as we have been doing with 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.750
 basic data types 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.460
 to manipulate in that case march it is necessary to declare 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.000
 first of all a Chinese type variable 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.760
 in this case fs would be the variable 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.020
 of sound file sound file 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.360
 I was born that is the name most orioles 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.130
 the type of data in this case 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.850
 we're going to refer to an output file then 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.810
 we say obstruct 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.049
 in the sentence 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.490
 that should be written 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.900
 to denote 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.950
 type of file 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.940
 of departure 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.420
 as well as when we declare an integer we say inc 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.100
 in this case to declare a departure 8 say obsession 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.160
 I did not use olé 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.160
 fs 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.470
 i the associated name or said file 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.360
 that the external name that has 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.830
 that external world is the same as we see through the windows explorer 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.900
 later the creation of the file 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.070
 we send a message to the same note the similarity 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.160
 that you have with a command that we already know drowned 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:10.759
 be you 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.709
 it's a command 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.079
 to send 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.639
 information on the screen 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.669
 in this case 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.859
 note that the form is exactly the same what changes is in this case the 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.039
 exit 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.639
 we are not sending to the screen but to the chibolas 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.519
 fs in this case our I the text 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.910
 We are throwing him 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.149
 the message hello world the idea is that that message 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.699
 6th sending is the file to be described in the same 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.439
 After the file is closed 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.939
 or the file 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.339
 to open it again 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.179
 but already as an input file 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.669
 to open the file 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.749
 as input is enough 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.749
 with specify insist 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:58.579
 name the variable file i the name expressed that our guys will have 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.080
 It is important that for whoever presents rohr 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.700
 when executing this instruction the file exists in this case there is no problem 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.700
 because previously we see it quereda 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.470
 once it has opened reading 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.200
 we proceed to be reading the information contained in it 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.729
 since 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.499
 an instruction was not addressed the subject and suction 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.269
 called the one that remains standing this institution 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.439
 which is specifically a functionality 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.980
 of the archives 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.449
 in this case we are using as 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.480
 the name of the variable efe 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.359
 point that pity 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.659
 two parameters the crime indicates 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.900
 the variable arrangement of characters kirwa atc 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.709
 take the information the idea of ​​the file 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.029
 and the second parameter tells us the maximum length of characters measured 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.180
 in this case we have arbitrarily placed 128 that the good 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.019
 we could have placed 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.100
 a lower or higher amount 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.419
 the idea is that 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.019
 if the content is lower or I mean the content of the file is 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.399
 less than 100 trancho characters 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.150
 at that time he was given that information 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.810
 otherwise, only these rockets implants are denied 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.219
 once you are given that information from the file 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.419
 is deposited in a quality variable 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.489
 later 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.389
 is presented on screen 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.300
 that information let's see 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.059
 we compiled the program 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.930
 we verify there are no errors 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.930
 as we are not seeing ya made now let's run 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.120
 it appears on screen message hello world apparently provoked only makes a 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.610
 screen display but 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.669
 it's not like that we're going to move to the folder 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.249
 where is our project 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.249
 there we will see what 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.550
 The file appears in common 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.840
 the fact pepito point that this exists kiabi has been created by our 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.809
 program has no content 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:58.809
 that there we have sent hello world 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.479
 and that has been done at that moment when we have stolen 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.259
 the departure of vicente night 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.289
 posteriomente 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.439
 because the file became open as we said 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.460
 take the information from it 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.460
 and then present it on screen 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.060
 let's see again the effect the idea is that 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.379
 let's erase 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.919
 We are not going to save 8 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.919
 so that we can see that indeed the program 'I know that creates it 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.809
 we return to the program 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:36.919
 we execute 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.520
 ready we go back to the folder 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.520
 and we see that the chibolas was once again created 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.580
 now let's see the file as it already exists 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.070
 we could open it directly as 8 incoming two oppose the comments 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.219
 here 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.399
 so that they are not discussed in the first instructions 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.889
 let's directly execute the opening of the file had already been done 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.129
 There are several problems 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.529
 opening memo because there we are going to meet annually 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.830
 the idea now here is that the file did not hit another that already exists then 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.550
 increase forgetfulness directly 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.550
 a second and I hope we have a new furnace 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.229
 not everything is because of the variable we have to win 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:30.550
 commentary 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.530
 our place it from 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.969
 this part 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:37.050
 because we need the declaration of the string variable 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.050
 morbid compile 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.499
 groped mistakes 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:47.879
 despite the file already exists in this case not only local but we go directly to 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:50.569
 opening it 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.270
 let's execute 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.419
 we are effectively getting the content 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.189
 what's in the file 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:01.369
 let's try and we open that file we change the content 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:05.629
 we're going let's complement it with 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.580
 raul kings 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.580
 then added 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.979
 one of those three points 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:21.979
 4th moss 

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:25.710
 we go again our program 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.089
 we execute 

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:32.799
 and we see that it shows us effectively the content that we have just modified
