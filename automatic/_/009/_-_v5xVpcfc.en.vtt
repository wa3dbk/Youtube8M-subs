00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
four were the same thing lashley that's

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.029 
four were the same thing lashley that's
kind<00:05:58.539> of<00:05:58.599> good<00:05:58.780> because<00:05:59.080> then<00:05:59.260> there's<00:05:59.650> a<00:05:59.740> lot

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
kind of good because then there's a lot

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.110 
kind of good because then there's a lot
of<00:06:00.070> minions<00:06:01.199> that's<00:06:02.199> triple<00:06:02.680> a<00:06:03.220> lot<00:06:03.610> of<00:06:03.729> camera

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
of minions that's triple a lot of camera

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.080 
of minions that's triple a lot of camera
taken<00:06:04.510> minions<00:06:05.130> um<00:06:06.130> what<00:06:06.729> do<00:06:06.789> you<00:06:06.849> think<00:06:07.000> the

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
taken minions um what do you think the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.670 
taken minions um what do you think the
most<00:06:07.300> doubles<00:06:07.870> I<00:06:08.080> think<00:06:08.470> we've<00:06:08.560> forgotten

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
most doubles I think we've forgotten

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.750 
most doubles I think we've forgotten
three<00:06:09.130> before<00:06:09.430> out<00:06:10.389> of<00:06:10.660> four<00:06:11.520> but<00:06:12.520> we<00:06:12.639> have

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
three before out of four but we have

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.820 
three before out of four but we have
never<00:06:12.910> done<00:06:13.210> that<00:06:13.449> I<00:06:14.580> know<00:06:15.580> what<00:06:16.330> once<00:06:16.720> wanna

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.530 

I<00:06:19.890> think<00:06:20.640> that's<00:06:20.790> gonna<00:06:20.910> have<00:06:21.120> to<00:06:21.150> be<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.420> end

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
I think that's gonna have to be the end

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.390 
I think that's gonna have to be the end
of<00:06:21.600> the<00:06:21.720> video<00:06:22.010> because<00:06:23.010> we<00:06:23.130> don't<00:06:23.340> have

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
of the video because we don't have

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.120 
of the video because we don't have
anything<00:06:23.750> wheeler<00:06:24.750> we<00:06:25.230> can<00:06:25.530> never<00:06:25.710> get<00:06:25.980> these

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
anything wheeler we can never get these

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.150 
anything wheeler we can never get these
again<00:06:26.460> or<00:06:27.240> we<00:06:28.110> definitely<00:06:28.620> need<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:28.830> get<00:06:29.040> him

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
again or we definitely need to get him

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.630 
again or we definitely need to get him
again<00:06:29.460> depends<00:06:30.120> on<00:06:30.210> how<00:06:30.300> you<00:06:30.330> look<00:06:30.630> at<00:06:30.840> it<00:06:31.640> cuz
