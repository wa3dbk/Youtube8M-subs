00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.290
 stand to serge and on hand the 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.330

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.460
 recently and that will be available 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.440
 besides that is available does 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.050
 currently in the next few days 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.460
 for 199 euros naked so quickly on 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.520
 the specs of the beast is a device 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.460
 with a 4.5 inch qhd screen seduces ps 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.619
 with a pixel density of 2 145 countries 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.989
 it's dual sim it's important to 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.059
 note he has a camera at the back of 5 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.910
 billion pixels a dual core processor 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.920
 1 gig hertz and then just about everything 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.400
 that we can say on this device I 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.470
 thought 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.390
 the other things maybe you too 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.910
 see the headphones finally the high 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.730
 speakers one to two so we have one 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.860
 terminal with that is dual sim dual 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.700
 dual speakers speaker and dual core 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.730
 it's a little bit alone 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.490
 the thing to note on it so it's a 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.100
 very light terminal with soft touch to 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.680
 the back completely plastic but 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.390
 rather in rather nice in terms 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.670
 of design then in the front we on the camera 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.480
 frontal I do not have the information there 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.850
 sorry down we have nothing if we turn on 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.800
 the screen and that the rags 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.700
 actually all the buttons are on 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.560
 the screen directly to the right the touch 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.100
 volume 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:32.180
 on the left the micro usb jack 3.5 right here 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.720
 here and the button had to me 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.270
 untangle 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.520
 the speakers the the camera the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.690
 flash led and that's all this is 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.450
 rather nice and then in the back a 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.890
 beautiful beautiful hull beautiful colts a toque 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.660
 friendly in soft touch with a slight 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.979
 rather rather successful relief so we're going 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.160
 quickly move to the interface after 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.290
 what I saw there is not an overlay 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.780
 dantesque we have where the parameters in 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.500
 Quick access to will quickly see 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.400
 the level of version 4.1.1 so if 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.290
 of course you can customize 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.300
 Home with different things and there 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.800
 hop we have that so it's pretty cool 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.960
 to customize it's the wizard 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.300
 really at the level of the peppers pole 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.050
 then lockscreen management with the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.519
 shortcuts down what splits and the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.160
 transitions at the reception level this 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.150
 kind of things 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.890
 so here the main menu is 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.510
 really the classic menu that you throw 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.769
 behind the same for multitasking 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.769
 leave m6 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.280
 what does it say ok so we have a 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.760
 small small window that can be activated 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.550
 or not 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.720
 when someone someone calls you 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.610
 you have seven little fans who can 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.560
 appear rather than resorting to all 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.130
 the screen why not and we have this screen 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.080
 pop with the side scrolls the 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.330
 contacts here in quick name access 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.800
 here and quickly on the seizure of 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.870
 french text fecteau since it is 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.780
 android really a basic name that's where 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.730
 we have this keyboard that is proposed 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.130
 it's either proposed by acer and if 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.490
 I 'm going to age and the keyboard too 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.690
 classic android that is displayed has it 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.110
 so that's great for our take 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.690
 in hand very clear of acer liquid e 1 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.910
 that we had to time we saw we had 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.510
 under the hands now at mwc and 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.380
 which is currently available for 199 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.380
 euros see you soon
