00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.620 
there are 10 holes in this tree set all
around<00:01:26.509> it<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:28.430> keepers<00:01:28.820> can<00:01:29.030> put<00:01:29.329> food

around it that the keepers can put food
in<00:01:29.900> through<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.860> spiral<00:01:31.220> staircase<00:01:31.250> that's

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
in through a spiral staircase that's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.940 
in through a spiral staircase that's
actually<00:01:32.119> inside<00:01:32.509> this<00:01:32.720> concrete<00:01:33.200> tree<00:01:33.470> and

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
actually inside this concrete tree and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.280 
actually inside this concrete tree and
so<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.060> animals<00:01:35.479> throughout<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.900> day<00:01:36.049> can

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
so the animals throughout the day can

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.260 
so the animals throughout the day can
search<00:01:36.560> for<00:01:36.770> their<00:01:36.920> food<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.700> keepers<00:01:38.030> can<00:01:38.180> go

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
search for their food the keepers can go

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.480 
search for their food the keepers can go
in<00:01:38.420> here<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:38.780> leave<00:01:39.409> food<00:01:39.710> they<00:01:40.130> can<00:01:40.280> stick

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
in here and leave food they can stick

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.300 
in here and leave food they can stick
branches<00:01:40.970> through<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:41.530> all<00:01:42.530> around<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.040> tree

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
branches through it all around the tree

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.249 
branches through it all around the tree
throughout<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.299> day<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.509> rather<00:01:44.869> than<00:01:45.079> just

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
throughout the day so rather than just

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.870 
throughout the day so rather than just
go<00:01:45.409> in<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.740> leave<00:01:45.920> food<00:01:46.100> for<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.430> animals<00:01:46.460> in

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
go in and leave food for the animals in

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.609 
go in and leave food for the animals in
the<00:01:46.970> morning<00:01:47.329> after<00:01:47.540> they<00:01:47.899> clean<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.229> exhibit

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
the morning after they clean the exhibit

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.679 
the morning after they clean the exhibit
and<00:01:48.649> then<00:01:48.829> let<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.100> animals<00:01:49.399> in<00:01:49.689> throughout

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
and then let the animals in throughout

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.209 
and then let the animals in throughout
the<00:01:50.869> day<00:01:51.020> they<00:01:51.170> can<00:01:51.320> be<00:01:51.409> leaving<00:01:51.710> food<00:01:51.920> for<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
the day they can be leaving food for the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.160 
the day they can be leaving food for the
animals<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.149> they<00:01:53.600> can<00:01:53.659> be<00:01:53.810> going<00:01:54.079> around

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
animals and so they can be going around

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.660 
animals and so they can be going around
in<00:01:54.439> searching<00:01:54.920> as<00:01:54.950> they<00:01:55.340> would<00:01:55.490> in<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.640> wild

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
in searching as they would in the wild

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.490 
in searching as they would in the wild
for<00:01:55.939> their<00:01:56.210> food<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.659> they<00:01:56.719> can<00:01:56.840> forage<00:01:57.140> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
for their food and they can forage and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.170 
for their food and they can forage and
try<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.130> find<00:01:58.280> out<00:01:58.490> where<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.790> keepers<00:01:59.090> have

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
try and find out where the keepers have

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.910 
try and find out where the keepers have
left<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.540> food<00:01:59.719> next<00:02:00.170> throughout<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.740> day

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
left the food next throughout the day

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.490 
left the food next throughout the day
we'll<00:02:01.670> keep<00:02:01.790> them<00:02:02.000> active<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.840> moving<00:02:03.170> around

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
we'll keep them active and moving around

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.380 
we'll keep them active and moving around
so<00:02:03.770> they're<00:02:03.920> engaged<00:02:04.399> mentally<00:02:04.880> as<00:02:05.030> well<00:02:05.090> as

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
so they're engaged mentally as well as

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.710 
so they're engaged mentally as well as
physically<00:02:05.840> with<00:02:05.990> all<00:02:06.110> these<00:02:06.289> ropes<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.720> logs

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
physically with all these ropes and logs

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.890 
physically with all these ropes and logs
we<00:02:09.229> also<00:02:09.350> have<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.950> trail<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.640> sway<00:02:11.180> poles<00:02:11.480> these

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
we also have a trail of sway poles these

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.890 
we also have a trail of sway poles these
are<00:02:12.140> big

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
are big

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.940 
are big
steel<00:02:14.739> bamboo<00:02:15.700> poles<00:02:16.019> but<00:02:17.019> they're<00:02:17.170> painted

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
steel bamboo poles but they're painted

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.940 
steel bamboo poles but they're painted
to<00:02:18.040> look<00:02:18.069> like<00:02:18.220> bamboo<00:02:18.670> but<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.000> idea<00:02:19.299> is<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
to look like bamboo but the idea is the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.300 
to look like bamboo but the idea is the
Orangatang<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.549> with<00:02:21.700> their<00:02:21.849> long<00:02:22.980> arm<00:02:23.980> reach

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
Orangatang is with their long arm reach

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.860 
Orangatang is with their long arm reach
will<00:02:24.579> be<00:02:24.640> able<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.879> grab<00:02:25.090> from<00:02:25.480> pole<00:02:25.689> to<00:02:25.720> pole

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
will be able to grab from pole to pole

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.710 
will be able to grab from pole to pole
and<00:02:26.260> actually<00:02:27.129> sway<00:02:27.819> through<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.450> exhibit

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
and actually sway through the exhibit

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.059 
and actually sway through the exhibit
without<00:02:28.930> ever<00:02:29.230> having<00:02:29.409> to<00:02:29.560> touch<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.920> ground

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
without ever having to touch the ground

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.800 
without ever having to touch the ground
so<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> whole<00:02:30.579> intent<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.689> these

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
so the whole intent is that these

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.780 
so the whole intent is that these
animals<00:02:32.079> that<00:02:32.590> live<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.189> trees<00:02:33.400> will<00:02:33.640> be

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
animals that live in the trees will be

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.849 
animals that live in the trees will be
able<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:34.120> live<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:35.319> trees<00:02:35.530> when<00:02:35.769> they're

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
able to live in the trees when they're

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.819 
able to live in the trees when they're
on<00:02:35.920> exhibit<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.700> can<00:02:37.030> go<00:02:37.299> freely<00:02:38.109> wherever

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
on exhibit and can go freely wherever

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.440 
on exhibit and can go freely wherever
they<00:02:39.069> want<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.609> space<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:43.150> there's<00:02:43.329> also

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
they want in this space so there's also

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.270 
they want in this space so there's also
a<00:02:43.599> water<00:02:43.870> feature<00:02:44.079> in<00:02:44.379> this<00:02:44.470> exhibit<00:02:44.829> so<00:02:45.129> that

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
a water feature in this exhibit so that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.949 
a water feature in this exhibit so that
we've<00:02:45.370> got<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> large<00:02:45.730> cascade<00:02:46.420> going<00:02:46.780> down<00:02:46.930> to

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
we've got a large cascade going down to

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.580 
we've got a large cascade going down to
a<00:02:47.170> small<00:02:47.590> shallow<00:02:47.920> pool<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:49.269> water<00:02:49.590> creates

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
a small shallow pool this water creates

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.830 
a small shallow pool this water creates
white<00:02:50.829> noise<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.459> help<00:02:51.670> sort<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.090> separate<00:02:52.629> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
white noise to help sort of separate the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.479 
white noise to help sort of separate the
exhibit<00:02:53.260> for<00:02:53.440> many<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.799> noise<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
exhibit for many of the noise of the

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.640 
exhibit for many of the noise of the
traffic<00:02:54.519> in<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.150> zoo<00:02:55.329> but<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.139> also<00:02:56.290> gives<00:02:56.530> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
traffic in the zoo but it also gives the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.379 
traffic in the zoo but it also gives the
animals<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.069> first-ever<00:02:57.430> opportunity<00:02:58.120> to

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
animals the first-ever opportunity to

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.839 
animals the first-ever opportunity to
play<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.049> water<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.439> experience<00:02:59.980> moving

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
play in the water to experience moving

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.800 
play in the water to experience moving
water<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:02.079> we<00:03:02.379> can<00:03:02.590> put<00:03:03.090> balls<00:03:04.090> or<00:03:04.420> things<00:03:04.659> in

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
water so we can put balls or things in

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.000 
water so we can put balls or things in
here<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.049> they<00:03:05.260> can<00:03:05.409> play<00:03:05.590> with<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.889> they

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
here that they can play with that they

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.470 
here that they can play with that they
can<00:03:06.189> fish<00:03:06.430> out<00:03:06.639> but<00:03:06.879> it<00:03:06.970> also<00:03:07.090> gives<00:03:07.209> an

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
can fish out but it also gives an

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.509 
can fish out but it also gives an
opportunity<00:03:07.569> in<00:03:08.049> this<00:03:08.200> small<00:03:08.349> section<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.370> the
