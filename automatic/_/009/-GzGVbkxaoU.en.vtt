for a second ok this is a Australia of
course<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.700> weather<00:00:11.880> pattern<00:00:11.969> that's

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
course in the weather pattern that's

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.240 
course in the weather pattern that's
around<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.200> right<00:00:13.380> now<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.799> live<00:00:13.980> weather

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
around it right now this is live weather

around it right now this is live weather
on<00:00:14.490> Google<00:00:15.089> Earth<00:00:15.179> right<00:00:15.450> now

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
on Google Earth right now

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.300 
on Google Earth right now
and<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.440> see<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> circular<00:00:17.100> pattern

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and you can see the circular pattern

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.920 
and you can see the circular pattern
that<00:00:17.609> goes<00:00:17.760> around<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.330> mean<00:00:18.660> if<00:00:18.750> there's

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
that goes around I mean if there's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750 
that goes around I mean if there's
obviously<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.770> circular<00:00:20.310> pattern<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.640> goes

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
obviously a circular pattern it goes

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.000 
obviously a circular pattern it goes
around<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.150> right<00:00:21.390> ok<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.410> when<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> take<00:00:22.920> the

around this right ok so when I take the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150 
around this right ok so when I take the
weather<00:00:23.189> away<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.600> put<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.170> that

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
weather away and I put up that that

it kind of comes up right here it's just

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.830 
it kind of comes up right here it's just
like<00:01:28.200> gets<00:01:28.380> pushed<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.920> something<00:01:29.159> ok<00:01:29.840> if

that<00:01:30.900> lined<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.619> then<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.070> like

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that lined up and then you can see like

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.100 
that lined up and then you can see like
let's<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.299> probably<00:01:33.540> lines<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.990> pretty

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
let's see this probably lines up pretty

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140 
let's see this probably lines up pretty
good<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.470> pretty<00:01:34.680> probably<00:01:35.040> pretty<00:01:35.159> close<00:01:35.340> see

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
good is pretty probably pretty close see

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
see another this is like the center of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.429 
see another this is like the center of
it<00:01:40.829> right<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.159> something<00:01:41.700> goes<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.150> there<00:01:42.439> ok

crater now let's just take a look at it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520 
crater now let's just take a look at it
without<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.150> weather<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.540> look<00:03:09.720> at<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> from

without the weather and look at the from
a<00:03:10.560> lack<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.860> distance<00:03:11.310> here<00:03:13.610> then<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.640> take<00:03:14.910> a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
a lack of distance here then just take a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.720 
a lack of distance here then just take a
look<00:03:15.150> at<00:03:15.209> look<00:03:15.390> at<00:03:15.510> how<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.840> fits<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:17.550> whole

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
look at look at how that fits the whole

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.480 
look at look at how that fits the whole
whole<00:03:18.150> ocean<00:03:18.630> floor<00:03:18.900> all<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:20.130> over<00:03:20.340> here

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.250 
I'm not sure about black scorpion yet
the<00:04:54.910> black<00:04:55.060> scorpion<00:04:55.330> character<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:55.990> is<00:04:56.080> the

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
the black scorpion character that is the

the black scorpion character that is the
Pacific<00:04:56.770> Champion<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.400> think<00:04:58.150> that<00:04:58.300> might<00:04:58.480> be

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
Pacific Champion I think that might be

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.710 
Pacific Champion I think that might be
the<00:04:58.810> South<00:04:59.020> Pole<00:04:59.290> of<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.470> moon<00:05:00.450> possibly<00:05:01.450> or

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
it may not even have anything to do with

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.500 
it may not even have anything to do with
the<00:05:03.100> moon<00:05:03.250> but<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:03.490> has<00:05:03.700> something<00:05:04.000> it's<00:05:04.300> has

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510

good<00:05:12.940> fit<00:05:13.120> there<00:05:13.270> like<00:05:13.510> I<00:05:13.540> said<00:05:13.660> I<00:05:13.840> showed<00:05:14.080> you

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
good fit there like I said I showed you

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.060 
good fit there like I said I showed you
pan<00:05:14.410> there<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.710> other<00:05:14.830> day

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
pan there the other day

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.350 
pan there the other day
let<00:05:15.280> me<00:05:15.370> see<00:05:15.520> if<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.700> could<00:05:15.820> find<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.150> there

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
let me see if I could find that there

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.850 
let me see if I could find that there
Japan<00:05:16.960> should<00:05:17.140> be<00:05:17.230> right<00:05:17.410> around<00:05:17.530> here

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
Japan should be right around here

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.420 
Japan should be right around here
somewhere

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
somewhere

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.830 
somewhere
or<00:05:18.880> maybe<00:05:19.030> it's<00:05:19.210> up<00:05:19.330> here<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:21.330> so<00:05:22.330> Japan<00:05:22.660> how

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
or maybe it's up here it is so Japan how

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.220 
or maybe it's up here it is so Japan how
it<00:05:22.930> fits<00:05:23.140> right<00:05:23.350> there<00:05:24.240> I'm<00:05:25.240> st.<00:05:25.570> right<00:05:26.020> in

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
it fits right there I'm st. right in

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.609 
it fits right there I'm st. right in
that<00:05:26.320> spot<00:05:26.500> there<00:05:27.420> really<00:05:28.420> well<00:05:28.720> really

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:32.619 

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:35.260 

so<00:05:33.619> check<00:05:33.919> it<00:05:34.039> out<00:05:34.159> just<00:05:34.610> try<00:05:34.819> to<00:05:34.879> piece<00:05:35.089> things

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
so check it out just try to piece things

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.510 
so check it out just try to piece things
back<00:05:35.539> together<00:05:35.659> you'll<00:05:36.409> see<00:05:36.589> how<00:05:36.949> they<00:05:37.429> go

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
back together you'll see how they go

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.510 
back together you'll see how they go
back<00:05:37.699> they<00:05:37.729> definitely<00:05:38.300> go<00:05:38.809> together<00:05:39.520> anyways

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
back they definitely go together anyways

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.859 
back they definitely go together anyways
I<00:05:40.610> should<00:05:40.639> just<00:05:41.119> take<00:05:41.300> that<00:05:41.389> out<00:05:41.449> of<00:05:41.599> picture

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:41.869 
I should just take that out of picture

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:43.350 
I should just take that out of picture
just<00:05:42.110> show<00:05:42.289> that<00:05:42.469> back<00:05:42.679> there

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
just show that back there

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.760 
just show that back there
turn<00:05:44.360> borders<00:05:44.779> on<00:05:44.929> you<00:05:45.050> turn<00:05:45.229> on<00:05:45.349> the<00:05:45.409> borders

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
turn borders on you turn on the borders

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.409 
turn borders on you turn on the borders
sometimes<00:05:46.159> that<00:05:46.520> confirms<00:05:46.939> things<00:05:47.149> too

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
sometimes that confirms things too

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.269 
sometimes that confirms things too
pretty<00:05:47.629> well<00:05:49.929> okay<00:05:50.929> over<00:05:51.889> here<00:05:51.919> he's<00:05:52.129> like

pretty well okay over here he's like

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:53.889 
pretty well okay over here he's like
this<00:05:52.399> this<00:05:52.639> ring<00:05:52.879> crater<00:05:53.270> that<00:05:53.539> I<00:05:53.599> always<00:05:53.719> talk

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:53.899 
this this ring crater that I always talk

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:55.119 
this this ring crater that I always talk
about<00:05:53.959> the<00:05:54.139> oval<00:05:54.379> crater<00:05:54.679> you<00:05:54.709> could<00:05:54.919> check<00:05:55.099> to

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 
about the oval crater you could check to

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.809 
about the oval crater you could check to
see<00:05:55.399> you<00:05:55.699> know<00:05:55.819> that<00:05:55.969> should<00:05:56.179> be<00:05:57.699> there<00:05:58.699> should

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
see you know that should be there should

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.100 
see you know that should be there should
be<00:05:58.939> a<00:05:58.969> shape<00:05:59.240> like<00:05:59.479> that<00:05:59.689> somewhere<00:06:00.020> around

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
be a shape like that somewhere around

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.749 
be a shape like that somewhere around
here<00:06:00.379> you<00:06:00.619> can<00:06:00.740> see<00:06:00.919> something<00:06:01.309> here<00:06:01.520> right

here you can see something here right

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:08.549 
here you can see something here right
here<00:06:01.999> or<00:06:02.419> something<00:06:03.219> somewhere<00:06:04.219> in<00:06:04.309> that<00:06:04.399> area

00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:08.559 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:10.540 

actually<00:06:09.559> got<00:06:09.830> a<00:06:09.860> couple<00:06:10.009> other<00:06:10.249> ones<00:06:10.369> I'd

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
actually got a couple other ones I'd

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.649 
actually got a couple other ones I'd
like<00:06:10.699> to<00:06:10.819> show<00:06:10.999> too<00:06:11.059> that<00:06:11.449> I<00:06:11.539> did<00:06:11.689> yesterday

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659

like to show too that I did yesterday
let's<00:06:14.659> just<00:06:14.809> check<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.110> weather<00:06:15.259> the

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529 
let's just check the weather the

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.019 
let's just check the weather the
circular<00:06:15.979> patterns<00:06:16.309> on<00:06:16.430> the<00:06:16.490> weather<00:06:16.669> in<00:06:16.939> the

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:17.029 
circular patterns on the weather in the

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.399 
circular patterns on the weather in the
weather<00:06:17.180> like<00:06:17.389> I've<00:06:17.509> uploaded<00:06:17.990> a<00:06:18.169> video<00:06:18.319> about

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
weather like I've uploaded a video about

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.139 
weather like I've uploaded a video about
already<00:06:18.770> should<00:06:19.369> be<00:06:19.459> becoming<00:06:19.849> more<00:06:19.939> defined

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:20.149 
already should be becoming more defined

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:23.199 
already should be becoming more defined
here<00:06:21.339> I<00:06:22.339> don't<00:06:22.580> know<00:06:22.699> if<00:06:22.759> they're<00:06:22.879> gonna<00:06:22.999> you

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.209 
here I don't know if they're gonna you

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:24.189 
here I don't know if they're gonna you
know<00:06:23.269> they<00:06:23.419> should<00:06:23.569> become<00:06:23.869> more<00:06:23.990> defined

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
know they should become more defined

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.730 
know they should become more defined
over<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.740> next<00:06:24.889> day<00:06:25.069> or<00:06:25.129> two<00:06:26.469> almost<00:06:27.469> looks

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
over the next day or two almost looks

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.779 
over the next day or two almost looks
like<00:06:27.860> right<00:06:28.069> now<00:06:28.099> they're<00:06:28.369> starting<00:06:28.610> to<00:06:28.639> go

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
like right now they're starting to go

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.230 
like right now they're starting to go
away<00:06:28.819> but<00:06:29.589> I'm<00:06:30.589> confident<00:06:31.369> the<00:06:31.669> next<00:06:31.699> day<00:06:32.089> or

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
away but I'm confident the next day or

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.949 
away but I'm confident the next day or
two<00:06:32.269> they<00:06:32.539> should<00:06:32.719> be<00:06:32.809> really<00:06:33.680> clear<00:06:34.959> circular

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:35.959 
two they should be really clear circular

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.929 
two they should be really clear circular
patterns<00:06:36.349> and<00:06:37.279> so<00:06:37.580> if<00:06:37.639> they're<00:06:37.759> kind<00:06:37.819> of

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:37.939 
patterns and so if they're kind of

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.269 
patterns and so if they're kind of
breaking<00:06:38.180> up<00:06:38.269> today<00:06:38.800> they<00:06:39.800> might<00:06:39.919> be<00:06:40.069> just

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:40.279 
breaking up today they might be just

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.949 
breaking up today they might be just
just<00:06:40.490> because<00:06:40.789> it's<00:06:40.969> during<00:06:41.149> the<00:06:41.240> daytime<00:06:41.569> so

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:41.959 
just because it's during the daytime so

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:45.999 
just because it's during the daytime so
nighttime<00:06:42.589> they<00:06:42.709> seem<00:06:42.889> to<00:06:42.979> be<00:06:43.099> better<00:06:45.009> anyways

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:46.009 
nighttime they seem to be better anyways

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:48.309 
nighttime they seem to be better anyways
that's<00:06:46.909> it<00:06:47.089> for<00:06:47.149> the<00:06:47.389> day<00:06:47.569> I<00:06:47.599> guess<00:06:48.019> I'll<00:06:48.289> show

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
that's it for the day I guess I'll show

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.199 
that's it for the day I guess I'll show
you<00:06:48.499> the<00:06:48.680> other<00:06:48.709> ones<00:06:49.039> when<00:06:49.309> I<00:06:49.339> get<00:06:49.819> some<00:06:49.969> when
