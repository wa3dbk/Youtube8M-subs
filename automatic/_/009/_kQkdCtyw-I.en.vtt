00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
start off playing horribly but after the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.640 
start off playing horribly but after the
first<00:00:12.300> couple<00:00:12.450> minutes<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.960> really<00:00:13.259> pick<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.530> up

you<00:01:49.590> jump<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.970> no<00:01:51.869> surprises

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you jump on there will be no surprises

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.620 
you jump on there will be no surprises
really<00:01:52.920> when<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.340> playing<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:54.390> for

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
playing for a long time and you hop on

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.500 
playing for a long time and you hop on
to<00:02:00.149> find<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.719> flamethrower

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
to find that the flamethrower

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.780 
to find that the flamethrower
is<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:01.840> lot<00:02:02.050> more<00:02:02.110> powerful<00:02:02.650> than<00:02:03.370> what<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.760> is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
is a lot more powerful than what it is

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.910 
is a lot more powerful than what it is
and<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.150> were<00:02:04.720> unaware<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.260> that<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.680> might

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
and you were unaware of that that might

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.430 
and you were unaware of that that might
jump<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.360> might<00:02:07.570> die<00:02:07.810> because<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.229> it

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
jump you and you might die because of it

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.290 
jump you and you might die because of it
so<00:02:08.740> little<00:02:09.400> things<00:02:09.550> like<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.790> and<00:02:10.090> stay

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
so little things like that and stay

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.920 
so little things like that and stay

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
like myself I would say to hop in quick

like myself I would say to hop in quick
match<00:02:19.270> for<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.570> bit<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:20.290> reason<00:02:20.620> for<00:02:20.650> this<00:02:20.830> is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
match for a bit the reason for this is

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.790 
match for a bit the reason for this is
that<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.370> skill<00:02:21.670> level<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.500> usually<00:02:23.500> lower

that the skill level is usually lower

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.610 
that the skill level is usually lower
lot<00:02:24.580> better<00:02:24.850> than<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.570> think<00:02:25.960> you're<00:02:26.410> more

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
lot better than that I think you're more

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.100 
lot better than that I think you're more

you don't run into a full team and
winning<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.530> really<00:02:33.010> important<00:02:33.520> when<00:02:33.670> you're

is a massive demotivator for most people
it's<00:02:45.550> manageable<00:02:46.180> when<00:02:46.420> you've<00:02:46.570> been<00:02:46.690> playing

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
lot of people who have been off are just

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.240 
lot of people who have been off are just
completely<00:02:55.510> discouraged<00:02:56.050> by<00:02:56.440> losses<00:02:57.100> all

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
completely discouraged by losses all

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.820 
completely discouraged by losses all
together<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.780> helpful<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.320> make<00:02:59.650> sure

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
together so it is helpful to make sure

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.170 
together so it is helpful to make sure
that<00:03:00.070> you're<00:03:00.100> winning<00:03:00.700> your<00:03:00.940> fair<00:03:01.150> share

games when you compact long to start the
third<00:03:04.480> thing<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.020> want<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.260> say<00:03:05.320> is<00:03:05.440> probably

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
third thing I want to say is probably

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.060 
third thing I want to say is probably
the<00:03:06.610> most<00:03:06.640> important<00:03:07.390> for<00:03:07.720> myself<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.500> that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
the most important for myself and that

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.250 
the most important for myself and that
is<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.520> try<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.880> take<00:03:10.180> note<00:03:10.510> on<00:03:10.720> what's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
is that I try to take note on what's

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.710 
is that I try to take note on what's
throwing<00:03:11.590> me<00:03:11.709> off<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.340> my<00:03:12.700> games<00:03:13.000> there's

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
throwing me off it in my games there's

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.170 
throwing me off it in my games there's
so<00:03:13.900> many<00:03:14.020> different<00:03:14.350> elements<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.610> player's

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
so many different elements to a player's

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.600 
so many different elements to a player's
game<00:03:16.450> style<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:18.040> put<00:03:18.280> things<00:03:18.459> in

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
game style and to put things in

game style and to put things in
perspective<00:03:18.760> what<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> would<00:03:20.050> say<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.260> throwing

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
perspective what I would say is throwing

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.710 
perspective what I would say is throwing
me<00:03:20.800> off<00:03:20.950> especially<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.090> match<00:03:22.330> is<00:03:22.570> my

where you are on the awesome scale of

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.600 
where you are on the awesome scale of
gears<00:04:39.729> who<00:04:39.880> are<00:04:39.970> gaming<00:04:40.240> if<00:04:41.070> these<00:04:42.070> tips<00:04:42.400> were

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
this is play with friends not only will

this is play with friends not only will
you<00:04:54.190> have<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.340> better<00:04:54.550> chance<00:04:54.610> of<00:04:54.940> winning<00:04:55.000> but

you have a better chance of winning but

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.719 
you have a better chance of winning but

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
also more prone to winning which will

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.810 
also more prone to winning which will
help<00:05:04.780> but<00:05:05.229> I<00:05:05.500> find<00:05:06.100> that<00:05:06.220> when<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.400> play<00:05:06.669> with
