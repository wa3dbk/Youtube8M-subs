hi<00:00:00.690> I'm<00:00:00.900> dr.<00:00:01.319> Altman<00:00:01.909> this<00:00:02.909> is<00:00:03.120> an<00:00:03.240> awesome

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hi I'm dr. Altman this is an awesome

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.930 
hi I'm dr. Altman this is an awesome
project<00:00:03.959> I'm<00:00:04.650> going<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.859> take<00:00:04.980> an<00:00:05.100> ipod<00:00:05.609> and

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
project I'm going to take an ipod and

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.450 
project I'm going to take an ipod and
connect<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> laser<00:00:07.280> instead<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
connect it to a laser instead of the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.580 
connect it to a laser instead of the
electricity<00:00:08.760> coming<00:00:09.240> from<00:00:09.510> my<00:00:09.660> ipod<00:00:10.139> and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
electricity coming from my ipod and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.879 
electricity coming from my ipod and
going<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> speaker<00:00:12.210> making<00:00:12.929> sound<00:00:13.290> it's

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
going to a speaker making sound it's

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.400 
going to a speaker making sound it's
going<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.219> go<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.670> laser<00:00:15.139> and<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.289> going

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
going to go to this laser and it's going

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.560 
going to go to this laser and it's going
to<00:00:16.470> vary<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.100> output<00:00:17.520> brightness<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
to vary the output brightness of the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.929 
to vary the output brightness of the
laser<00:00:18.840> slightly<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:19.710> can't<00:00:19.920> tell<00:00:20.189> if

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
laser slightly you really can't tell if

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.540 
laser slightly you really can't tell if
I<00:00:21.180> turn<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.170> let's<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.949> turn<00:00:23.430> on

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
I turn this on and let's do this turn on

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.650 
I turn this on and let's do this turn on
the<00:00:23.670> ipod<00:00:24.380> get<00:00:25.380> me<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.680> tunes<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.660> now

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the ipod get me some tunes going now

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.179 
the ipod get me some tunes going now
I've<00:00:27.810> got<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:29.010> artist<00:00:29.340> David<00:00:29.789> almond<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:31.189> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
I've got the artist David almond and the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.610 
I've got the artist David almond and the
sounds<00:00:32.550> coming<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.969> crank<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> volume<00:00:33.989> I

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
sounds coming out crank up the volume I

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.459 
sounds coming out crank up the volume I
should<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:34.950> able<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.160> hear<00:00:35.280> something<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.820> can't

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
should be able to hear something I can't

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.840 
should be able to hear something I can't
because<00:00:37.469> instead<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> speakers<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
because instead of going to speakers is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.030 
because instead of going to speakers is
now<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> laser<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.590> when<00:00:40.710> i<00:00:40.770> turn<00:00:40.950> on

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
now going to a laser so when i turn on

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.490 
now going to a laser so when i turn on
my<00:00:41.100> laser<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.940> i<00:00:42.660> don't<00:00:42.840> know<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.230> see

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
my laser and i don't know if you can see

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.930 
my laser and i don't know if you can see
this<00:00:43.620> or<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.820> laser<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:46.730> varying<00:00:47.730> its

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
this or not but the laser is varying its

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.569 
this or not but the laser is varying its
brightness<00:00:48.300> ever<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.170> slightly<00:00:49.500> nothing<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
brightness ever so slightly nothing you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.240 
brightness ever so slightly nothing you
can<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:50.789> detect<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.829> need<00:00:52.980> something

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
can really detect so we need something

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
can really detect so we need something
to<00:00:53.430> detect<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.239> variation<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.110> light<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
to detect that variation in light and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.880 
to detect that variation in light and
the<00:00:56.160> ideal<00:00:56.460> device<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> solar<00:00:57.510> cell<00:00:57.890> simply

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the ideal device is a solar cell simply

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.610 
the ideal device is a solar cell simply
solar<00:00:59.129> cell<00:00:59.399> i<00:00:59.430> got<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> radio<00:00:59.940> shack<00:01:00.590> put<00:01:01.590> a

it<00:01:09.450> radio<00:01:09.600> shack<00:01:09.960> radio<00:01:10.320> shack<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.650> get

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it radio shack radio shack and get

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.510 
it radio shack radio shack and get
everything<00:01:11.030> now<00:01:12.030> i<00:01:12.060> plug<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> solar<00:01:12.840> cell<00:01:13.140> in

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
everything now i plug the solar cell in

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
everything now i plug the solar cell in
now<00:01:14.520> any<00:01:14.939> variations<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.780> light<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.290> turn

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
now any variations of light will turn

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:29.270 
now any variations of light will turn
into<00:01:16.850> music<00:01:17.850> what's<00:01:18.330> this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.030 

I<00:01:32.869> can<00:01:33.869> send<00:01:34.080> this<00:01:34.170> bill<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.830> across

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
I can send this bill all the way across

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.850 
I can send this bill all the way across
the<00:01:35.250> room<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.840> will<00:01:36.990> still<00:01:37.320> work<00:01:37.350> let's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the room and it will still work let's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:02:22.500 
the room and it will still work let's
get<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.159> it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.240 

wiring<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.630> very<00:02:23.959> straightforward<00:02:24.380> we<00:02:25.010> take

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
wiring is very straightforward we take

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.430 
wiring is very straightforward we take
the<00:02:25.550> battery<00:02:26.060> pack<00:02:26.090> with<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.720> two<00:02:26.900> cells<00:02:27.170> in

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the battery pack with the two cells in

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.070 
the battery pack with the two cells in
it<00:02:28.599> we<00:02:29.599> attach<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:32.209> secondary<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:33.050> the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
it we attach it to the secondary of the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.900 
it we attach it to the secondary of the
transformer<00:02:36.250> there's<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.310> little<00:02:37.459> on/off

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
transformer there's a little on/off

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.280 
transformer there's a little on/off
switch<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.050> battery<00:02:39.410> pack<00:02:39.440> itself<00:02:41.290> and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
switch in the battery pack itself and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.740 
switch in the battery pack itself and
then<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:42.860> going<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.069> go<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.280> our<00:02:43.310> laser

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
then this is going to go to our laser

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.229 
then this is going to go to our laser
the<00:02:44.750> positive<00:02:45.380> side<00:02:45.620> which<00:02:45.980> would<00:02:46.190> be<00:02:46.340> in<00:02:46.970> this

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
the positive side which would be in this

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.620 
the positive side which would be in this
case<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.660> red<00:02:47.840> side<00:02:49.030> goes<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.269> a<00:02:50.300> red

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
case the red side goes to a red

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:58.979 
case the red side goes to a red
alligator<00:02:51.080> clip<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:54.110> negative<00:02:54.470> side

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.360 

those<00:02:59.989> are<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.260> black<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.709> I'll<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.220> get<00:03:01.340> a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
those are the black it I'll to get a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.780 
those are the black it I'll to get a
clip<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:04.100> attaches<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.910> laser<00:03:05.120> on

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
clip and that attaches to the laser on

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.490 
clip and that attaches to the laser on
the<00:03:07.790> primary<00:03:08.360> side<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.170> transformer<00:03:09.560> I

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500

to the headphones this is a stereo jack
but<00:03:22.730> I've<00:03:22.819> got<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.060> hooked<00:03:23.269> into<00:03:23.510> motto<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.830> I

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
but I've got it hooked into motto so I

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.550 
but I've got it hooked into motto so I
only<00:03:25.099> have<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.400> going<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.700> one<00:03:25.849> transformer

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
only have it going to one transformer

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.720 
only have it going to one transformer
this<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.920> transformer<00:03:28.640> device<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:31.489> wire

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.230 

the<00:04:42.120> solar<00:04:42.389> cell<00:04:42.720> was<00:04:42.870> easy<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.259> do<00:04:44.030> this<00:04:45.030> is

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
the solar cell was easy to do this is

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.790 
the solar cell was easy to do this is
the<00:04:45.300> case<00:04:45.539> it<00:04:45.750> came<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.229> I<00:04:46.380> drilled<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.770> little

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
the case it came in I drilled a little

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.490 
the case it came in I drilled a little
hole<00:04:47.039> on<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.400> side<00:04:47.430> wired<00:04:48.120> wire<00:04:48.569> to<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.199> top

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
hole on the side wired wire to the top

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.920 
hole on the side wired wire to the top
and<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.039> bottom<00:04:50.310> of<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.630> mounted<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.750> with

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
and to the bottom of it mounted it with

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.189 
and to the bottom of it mounted it with
my<00:04:52.080> Legos<00:04:52.319> and<00:04:53.030> then<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.389> single<00:04:55.050> funnel<00:04:55.650> jack

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
my Legos and then a single funnel jack

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.809 
my Legos and then a single funnel jack
so<00:04:58.199> it's<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.500> positive<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.280> negative<00:04:59.340> side

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
so it's the positive and negative side

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.629 
so it's the positive and negative side
of<00:04:59.849> the<00:05:00.030> solar<00:05:00.270> cell<00:05:00.599> and<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:01.650> goes<00:05:01.889> into<00:05:02.190> the

and aiming it at the same time and

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:09.409 
and aiming it at the same time and
you're<00:06:03.239> all<00:06:03.329> set<00:06:06.799> plug<00:06:07.799> the<00:06:08.009> other<00:06:08.039> end<00:06:08.419> into

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
you're all set plug the other end into

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:18.169 
you're all set plug the other end into
your<00:06:09.629> ipod<00:06:13.729> and<00:06:15.079> now<00:06:16.079> we've<00:06:16.379> got<00:06:16.709> a<00:06:17.179> modulated

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:18.179 
your ipod and now we've got a modulated
