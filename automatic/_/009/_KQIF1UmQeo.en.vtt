00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
st. Louis uh and i think it's indicative

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.020 
st. Louis uh and i think it's indicative
of<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:44.440> problem<00:04:44.890> obviously<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.550> we<00:04:45.670> know<00:04:45.850> is

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
of a problem obviously that we know is

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.750 
of a problem obviously that we know is
is<00:04:46.300> is<00:04:46.750> across<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.110> country<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:47.800> there<00:04:48.730> just

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
is is across the country and there just

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.670 
is is across the country and there just
seems<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.270> be<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.660> complete<00:04:50.050> absence<00:04:50.350> of

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
seems to be a complete absence of

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.790 
seems to be a complete absence of
leadership<00:04:55.140> anywhere<00:04:56.140> across<00:04:56.380> political

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
leadership anywhere across political

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.970 
leadership anywhere across political
spectrum<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.550> deal<00:04:57.700> with<00:04:57.880> this
