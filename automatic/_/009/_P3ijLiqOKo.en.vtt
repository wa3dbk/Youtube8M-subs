00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.490 
6,000 tell me about the candy pop 6000
and<00:00:48.440> how<00:00:48.590> it<00:00:48.740> works<00:00:49.330> this<00:00:50.330> works<00:00:50.570> by<00:00:50.960> melting

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
and how it works this works by melting

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.800 
and how it works this works by melting
sugar<00:00:52.010> with<00:00:52.340> hot<00:00:52.490> air<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:53.360> start<00:00:53.630> with<00:00:53.780> a

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
sugar with hot air so we start with a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.320 
sugar with hot air so we start with a
bed<00:00:54.170> of<00:00:54.410> sugar<00:00:54.770> just<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.550> flatbed<00:00:56.210> of

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
bed of sugar just a flatbed of

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.990 
bed of sugar just a flatbed of
granulated<00:00:56.690> C&amp;H<00:00:57.140> sugar<00:00:57.170> from<00:00:57.560> costco<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.370> we

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
granulated C&amp;H sugar from costco and we

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.790 
granulated C&amp;H sugar from costco and we
move<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.450> heating<00:00:59.990> element<00:01:00.050> over<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.620> where

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
move a heating element over it where

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.170 
move a heating element over it where
we're<00:01:00.920> blowing<00:01:01.220> hot<00:01:01.430> air<00:01:01.460> through<00:01:01.850> very

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
we're blowing hot air through very

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.030 
we're blowing hot air through very
slowly<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:02.840> where<00:01:03.350> we<00:01:03.500> move<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.770> heating

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
slowly and where we move the heating

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.770 
slowly and where we move the heating
element<00:01:04.370> we<00:01:04.489> melt<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.940> sugar<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.269> we<00:01:05.510> form<00:01:05.720> a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
element we melt the sugar and we form a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.750 
element we melt the sugar and we form a
neat<00:01:05.900> little<00:01:06.020> layer<00:01:06.350> of<00:01:06.470> caramel<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.130> then<00:01:07.160> we

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
neat little layer of caramel and then we

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.150 
neat little layer of caramel and then we
lower<00:01:08.120> that<00:01:08.510> layer<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:09.620> put<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.800> new<00:01:10.010> layer

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
lower that layer and we put a new layer

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.730 
lower that layer and we put a new layer
sugar<00:01:10.430> on<00:01:10.580> top<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:10.940> we<00:01:11.030> melt<00:01:11.270> again<00:01:11.740> melting

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
sugar on top and we melt again melting

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.130 
sugar on top and we melt again melting
to<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.730> layer<00:01:13.880> below<00:01:14.030> creating<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.630> fused

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
to the layer below creating a fused

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.960 
to the layer below creating a fused
three-dimensional<00:01:15.890> object<00:01:16.370> we<00:01:16.640> have<00:01:16.790> an

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
three-dimensional object we have an

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.490 
three-dimensional object we have an
eight<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.390> half<00:01:17.420> by<00:01:17.510> eleven<00:01:18.020> build<00:01:18.260> volume

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
eight and a half by eleven build volume

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.580 
eight and a half by eleven build volume
here<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.390> we<00:01:20.390> just<00:01:20.600> have<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.750> flat<00:01:21.170> bed<00:01:21.470> of

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
here and we just have a flat bed of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.470 
here and we just have a flat bed of
sugar<00:01:21.830> there<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.310> right<00:01:22.940> now<00:01:23.090> we're<00:01:23.240> printing

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
sugar there and right now we're printing

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.840 
sugar there and right now we're printing
some<00:01:23.870> objects<00:01:24.230> is<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.830> it's<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.400> seven<00:01:25.730> to

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
some objects is that it's a seven to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.240 
some objects is that it's a seven to
eight<00:01:26.000> inches<00:01:26.030> deep<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.010> right<00:01:28.010> now<00:01:28.040> is

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
eight inches deep so right now is

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.680 
eight inches deep so right now is
probably<00:01:28.460> only<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.700> few<00:01:28.850> inches<00:01:29.030> deep<00:01:29.330> but<00:01:29.570> as

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
probably only a few inches deep but as

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.090 
probably only a few inches deep but as
we<00:01:29.840> build<00:01:30.020> up<00:01:30.170> obvious<00:01:30.500> we<00:01:30.590> can<00:01:30.740> make<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:30.950> go<00:01:31.070> a

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
we build up obvious we can make it go a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.450 
we build up obvious we can make it go a
lot<00:01:31.280> taller<00:01:31.720> so<00:01:32.720> we're<00:01:33.590> moving<00:01:33.950> this<00:01:34.100> heating

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
lot taller so we're moving this heating

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.399 
lot taller so we're moving this heating
element<00:01:34.850> over<00:01:35.060> here<00:01:35.270> it's<00:01:35.390> on<00:01:35.510> an<00:01:35.630> XY<00:01:35.960> stage

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
element over here it's on an XY stage

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.260 
element over here it's on an XY stage
and<00:01:36.680> I've<00:01:36.740> got<00:01:36.890> this<00:01:37.040> aquarium<00:01:37.610> tubing<00:01:38.090> here

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
and I've got this aquarium tubing here

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.440 
and I've got this aquarium tubing here
and<00:01:38.390> we're<00:01:38.480> pumping<00:01:38.930> air<00:01:39.680> onto<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:41.150> sugar<00:01:41.360> and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
and we're pumping air onto the sugar and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.420 
and we're pumping air onto the sugar and
melting<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.930> as<00:01:42.020> we<00:01:42.170> go<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.530> what<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.400> that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
melting it as we go and what is it that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.960 
melting it as we go and what is it that
you're<00:01:43.670> making<00:01:44.090> here<00:01:44.330> right<00:01:44.540> now<00:01:44.750> sugar<00:01:45.500> cubes

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
you're making here right now sugar cubes

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.399 
you're making here right now sugar cubes
I've<00:01:46.970> been<00:01:47.120> for<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.540> while<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:47.690> don't<00:01:48.200> know<00:01:48.350> if

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
I've been for a while I don't know if

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.690 
I've been for a while I don't know if
these<00:01:48.500> are<00:01:48.560> really<00:01:48.740> correctly<00:01:49.159> proportion

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
these are really correctly proportion

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.090 
these are really correctly proportion

sugar cubes or even stuck together we

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.230 
sugar cubes or even stuck together we
just<00:01:52.280> started<00:01:52.430> printing<00:01:52.729> soon<00:01:52.970> as<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.120> got

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
just started printing soon as we got

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.020 
just started printing soon as we got
here<00:01:53.420> today<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.740> what<00:01:55.130> do<00:01:55.190> we<00:01:55.280> have<00:01:55.460> we<00:01:55.520> have

yeah<00:02:02.659> we<00:02:02.960> haven't<00:02:03.109> been<00:02:03.259> exactly<00:02:03.560> careful

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
yeah we haven't been exactly careful

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.819 
yeah we haven't been exactly careful
what<00:02:04.189> we<00:02:04.219> running<00:02:04.549> here<00:02:04.579> you<00:02:05.359> can<00:02:06.229> input<00:02:06.590> a

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
what we running here you can input a

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.789 
what we running here you can input a
digitized<00:02:07.429> 3d<00:02:07.939> model<00:02:08.299> is<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:09.289> what<00:02:09.470> happens

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
digitized 3d model is that what happens

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.440 
digitized 3d model is that what happens
okay<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.429> tell<00:02:10.700> me<00:02:10.729> about<00:02:10.879> this<00:02:11.090> what<00:02:11.299> is<00:02:11.420> this

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
okay so tell me about this what is this

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.080 
okay so tell me about this what is this
one<00:02:11.840> or<00:02:12.019> this<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.709> hollow<00:02:13.040> sphere<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:14.000> we

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
one or this is a hollow sphere that we

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.660 
one or this is a hollow sphere that we
printed<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.569> candy<00:02:14.870> fab<00:02:15.280> hollow<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.549> that

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
printed on the candy fab hollow so that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.190 
printed on the candy fab hollow so that
you<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:16.910> dump<00:02:17.180> out<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:17.330> extra<00:02:17.629> sugar<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.080> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
you can dump out the extra sugar on the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.750 
you can dump out the extra sugar on the
inside<00:02:18.590> that's<00:02:18.830> what<00:02:18.920> got<00:02:19.160> holes<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:19.670> but

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
inside that's what got holes in it but

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.039 
inside that's what got holes in it but
it's<00:02:19.910> an<00:02:20.030> example<00:02:20.299> of<00:02:20.540> something<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.870> we've

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
it's an example of something that we've

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.759 
it's an example of something that we've
actually<00:02:21.200> printed<00:02:22.720> how<00:02:23.720> many<00:02:23.930> layers<00:02:24.200> does

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
actually printed how many layers does

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.400 
actually printed how many layers does
that<00:02:24.860> represent<00:02:25.040> oh<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.989> looks<00:02:27.170> like<00:02:27.290> it's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
that represent oh it looks like it's

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.150 
that represent oh it looks like it's
about<00:02:27.590> 30<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:29.000> could<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.930> use<00:02:30.200> powdered

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
about 30 and could you use powdered

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.789 
about 30 and could you use powdered
sugar<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.670> get<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:32.030> higher<00:02:32.390> resolution<00:02:32.799> not

a plain silk screen and this right here
is<00:05:39.660> a<00:05:40.190> it's<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.310> photosensitive<00:05:42.120> photo<00:05:42.570> paper

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
is a it's a photosensitive photo paper

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.290 
is a it's a photosensitive photo paper
and<00:05:43.620> you're<00:05:43.860> going<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.100> wet<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:44.820> screen<00:05:45.120> with

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
and you're going to wet the screen with
