00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
tanking on my level 49 druid in the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.490 
tanking on my level 49 druid in the
worst<00:00:13.559> dungeon<00:00:14.490> i've<00:00:14.790> ever<00:00:15.150> been<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.719> well

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
worst dungeon i've ever been in well

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.960 
worst dungeon i've ever been in well
actually<00:00:16.619> knows<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> worst<00:00:17.369> engine<00:00:17.789> but

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
actually knows of the worst engine but

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.460 
actually knows of the worst engine but
it's<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.180> most<00:00:18.390> annoying<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:19.050> me<00:00:19.080> because

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
it's the most annoying to me because

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.010 
it's the most annoying to me because
I've<00:00:19.710> had<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.910> 15<00:00:21.480> times<00:00:21.840> now

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I've had to do this like 15 times now

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.560 
I've had to do this like 15 times now
because<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:23.039> random<00:00:23.400> dungeon<00:00:23.820> finder<00:00:24.210> won't

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
because the random dungeon finder won't

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.390 
because the random dungeon finder won't
pick<00:00:24.869> anything<00:00:25.380> else<00:00:27.439> what<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.560> place<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.859> is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
pick anything else what this place is is

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.020 
pick anything else what this place is is
the<00:00:29.929> I<00:00:30.929> think<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> purple<00:00:32.369> part<00:00:32.850> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the I think it's the purple part of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.860 
the I think it's the purple part of
meriden<00:00:34.309> it's<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.149> good<00:00:36.420> instance

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
meriden it's not the very good instance

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.799 
meriden it's not the very good instance
because<00:00:37.140> if<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.030> really<00:00:39.270> good<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
because if it's not really good as a

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.889 
because if it's not really good as a
instance<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.800> itself<00:00:41.280> because<00:00:42.210> there<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.719> only

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
instance in itself because there is only

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.920 
instance in itself because there is only
one<00:00:43.170> boss<00:00:43.500> right<00:00:44.129> at<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> end<00:00:44.579> who<00:00:45.180> actually

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
one boss right at the end who actually

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290 
one boss right at the end who actually
dropped<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.500> decent<00:00:46.890> stuff<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
dropped some decent stuff but it's a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
dropped some decent stuff but it's a
very<00:00:48.329> long<00:00:48.750> slog<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.410> order<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> get<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
very long slog in order to get to the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.229 
very long slog in order to get to the
boss<00:00:51.289> that<00:00:52.289> said<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.920> quite<00:00:53.340> fun<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.940> you're

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
boss that said it is quite fun if you're

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
boss that said it is quite fun if you're
doing<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.260> two<00:00:55.440> times

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
doing it for like one or two times

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.459 
doing it for like one or two times
because<00:00:56.430> there's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.300> ton<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> mobs<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
because there's a ton of mobs and you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.610 
because there's a ton of mobs and you
can<00:00:58.620> chain<00:00:58.920> pull<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.460> mad<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.940> I'm<00:01:00.059> doing<00:01:00.180> now

can chain pull like mad as I'm doing now
which<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.070> extremely<00:01:02.910> fun<00:01:03.180> there's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
which actually is extremely fun there's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.620 
which actually is extremely fun there's
