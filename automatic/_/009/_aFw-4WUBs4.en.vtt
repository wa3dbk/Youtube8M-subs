00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 we all love books and are 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.310
 like to influence it but is yours 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.810
 already noticed that books under 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.519
 circumstances can also ruin life 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:17.250
 I'll give you three examples today 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:18.720
 for how it should not go to 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.550
 example, you know that you have a book 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.460
 read since as yet fully in it 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.890
 and well then you have a stupid 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 talk to your boss and you 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.980
 reacted a bit patzig what 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.029
 anyway somehow not quite like that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.460
 the best solution is 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 but then you also do one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.450
 reference to a book what the boss 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.300
 probably does not know and is 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.030
 all over so you can tell me how 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 her work week until now except me 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.800
 did not feel that they had much 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.210
 did my last week so how 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.680
 was actually quite successful so 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.629
 I did the accounting I have 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.070
 the letters brought to the post office and 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.870
 of course the new packages picked up 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.699
 I have finished the satchels 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.079
 made for the company trip the room 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.789
 Booked that was maybe a way and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.140
 but I made it so the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.789
 we have the space we have the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.420
 invitation to a business trip already 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.119
 written and sent and yes 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.450
 of course I have the folder reform new 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.030
 made as they said that was 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.430
 my goodness is his house but everything is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.530
 now in order and nicely sorted 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 I also have a few more 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.400
 Talks I've had him back then 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.100
 already the transcripts sent and yes 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.130
 that was my last week why 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.270
 ask her and what about the report 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.549
 I told them to themselves 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.320
 to write 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.630
 I also managed the report 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.829
 I just told him something 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.560
 I did the whole last week 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.960
 that was really a lot of work so it does 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.640
 I am incredibly sorry that my time 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.899
 and lost their seemingly post 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.070
 the owls are gone as well 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.070
 was not as reliable as it once 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.960
 they were very clever for me 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.880
 have no idea what they are talking the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.100
 sounds fresh as someone begs well 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.610
 in addition to unpaid overtime out 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.520
 woman p 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.960
 I want the report at the latest 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.989
 Mr. hour here on the table 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.340
 otherwise we have to stretch again 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:13.370
 or a story has you so 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.840
 very ripped that you are 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.000
 maybe a bit subconscious 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.590
 I wish it was that way because 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.330
 it just so unbelievably fun or funny 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.760
 cool otherwise it would be something 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.000
 and then you commit the mistake the whole 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.599
 a bit stupid on the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.599
 to project reality 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.549
 may it as a short course so I have new 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.420
 get a rental agreement and I have myself 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.739
 Asked if you could talk about it 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.560
 they can because they already are 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.340
 better with know that should with 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.340
 your rental agreement 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.260
 you probably have more idea of ​​90 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.180
 because they take me on my arm 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.290
 Sorry I did not want to know her 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.000
 they not that book value in the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.720
 rubber boots over the lawyer the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.519
 cleaning lady is that is impossible 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.930
 i do good work here and then 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.540
 they come to the verarschen mix 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.670
 find it funny or what that's all about 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.079
 not 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.519
 you know what cleaning would be in anyway 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:15.139
 future itself well and last but not least 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.340
 Of course there is also the problem that 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.500
 books yourself a bit 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.299
 insult this is only recently 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.790
 happened and I felt so meta 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:27.489
 You just have to do that 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.470
 look at 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.470
 finally lunch time to live 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.290
 followed by their admirers, they came 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.120
 single-mindedly at my table 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.790
 strolled where I actually only in 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.340

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.660

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.220

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.310

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.100

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.079
