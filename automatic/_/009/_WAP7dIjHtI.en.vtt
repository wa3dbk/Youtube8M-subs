 In fact it's been also released eight Vanguard I very 8 new features 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:35.350
 The number of customers who have ever touched cards has been increasing from there 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:39.490
 The card market is expanding, such as being a woman 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.510
 It had been played at the time of the primary boom of the card game 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.689
 And those of man Na Ne parent now 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.760
 Te has become to you hey yeah state say that next to children 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.790
 Leave 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.790
 Though it is about the quality of the card game 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.110
 For example, the corners are cut round, but this must be even, for example 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.750
 Not 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:06.130
 Here it is is was still at Japan's manufacturing industry's great overseas It is the technology of this disconnect 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.360
 Then it is something that can not be easily copied 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:13.050
 So it is very important to say that the quality of paper here and there is no paper 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.050
 I'm stuck 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:23.200
 Here is the Korean version Here is the English version 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:25.360
 In fact, in Singapore the animation started in November and 8 English version of this in December 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.150
 Launched product development 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.729
 Here 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.470
 In fact, I 'm out of stock or repeat so much that production is too late. 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.680
 It is good, but is coming up 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:41.169
 Hey 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:47.979
 Since there is still a feature by country , the development of high school is sold in the British match according to that 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:49.000
 If it makes big, development in the United States is focused on time advertisement rather than TV advertisement 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.449
 I believe that 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.670
 One example is the Texas Rangers game 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:05:01.580
 It is at the time of only the opening ceremony of the past history's colored paper 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:06.770
 Is I Are You a British our It is further we have issued an advertisement for Unbleached President 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:10.660
 First of all Japan's notes we have lost the care colored paper is also very large so 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.660
 In the sense that 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:21.059
 I'm sorry that the cow Road Vanguard is here already 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:21.749
 I was able to show my seriousness. 8 people in the United States actually are in the venue 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.660
 is not it 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:27.980
 Funguard Promotion Card 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:32.140
 The I'm I am allowed to distribution is North Korea, which saw it was writing and want to come back while watching 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.140
 I think that there was also an effect of 100 people 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:40.650
 Because the corner give industry is said to be the year is it about 100 billion yen now this is 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.750
 Become a domestic only market 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.610
 So I 'm still convinced that it will be more than 100 billion yen as our company 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.030
 Well because it is available to you 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:56.009
 Card game is the entire industry is it equal to or greater than Kan Well, in the future 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:59.309
 Also I'm able to activate stop we believe that if Ikere Good luck 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:06.509
 m I hope is a trading car and not today 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:06.969
 8 It is a Japanese learning 8 cards that say such a and had come out Seiimoto 8 recently I think kana 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.169
 Hey 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:16.209
 8 cards or something is written on these cards . 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:20.050
 We introduce and various cute illustrations eh to the various things of Japan 

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:23.199
 And with these cards, everyone overseas is already really 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.069
 I can study Japanese happily 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:31.310
 Really another deli also of the card world we think there is a lot of potential 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:36.020
 I think that will raised very well from this 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.530
 Yes I have a card game I like and I go to card shops in Ikebukuro etc. 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.960
 But 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:47.590
 Where so also amazing cheerful is that 1-year 100 billion clothing market was nod 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.590
