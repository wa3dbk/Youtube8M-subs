00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
knife and you'll be super lunge it's

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.510 
knife and you'll be super lunge it's
also<00:02:27.030> very<00:02:27.270> very<00:02:27.540> easy<00:02:27.810> one<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.170> do<00:02:28.319> but<00:02:28.980> you

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
also very very easy one to do but you

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.339 
also very very easy one to do but you
have<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.730> buy<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.269> claymores<00:02:30.720> which<00:02:31.170> are<00:02:31.319> a

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
have to buy the claymores which are a

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.080 
have to buy the claymores which are a
thousand<00:02:31.769> so<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.129> think<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.730> first<00:02:32.910> method

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
thousand so I think the first method

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.869 
thousand so I think the first method
would<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.450> easier<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.319> that<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.190> Claymore

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
would be easier but that the Claymore

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.790 
would be easier but that the Claymore
one<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.150> also<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.450> new<00:02:36.599> method<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.709> what

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
one is also a new method now that's what

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.410 
one is also a new method now that's what
