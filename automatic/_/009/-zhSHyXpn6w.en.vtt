00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519

with the rest of your food because then

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.619 
with the rest of your food because then

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
they pick up a drink and they walk

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.840 
they pick up a drink and they walk
around<00:00:37.870> they<00:00:38.260> socialize<00:00:38.890> with<00:00:39.160> others<00:00:39.579> and

around they socialize with others and

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.299 
around they socialize with others and
they<00:00:40.480> enjoy<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:41.109> party<00:00:41.500> instead<00:00:41.859> of<00:00:42.010> just

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
they enjoy the party instead of just

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.060
