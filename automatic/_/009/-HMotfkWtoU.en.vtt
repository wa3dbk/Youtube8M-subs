00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.759
 Welcome friends to this new program 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.309
 of natives 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.870
 definitely in addition to doing 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.000
 exercise every day even if it's a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.269
 small amount of our time 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.730
 dedicated to this aspect live 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.119
 calmly with the best humor 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.130
 possible to take life as it is also 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.189
 another important aspect is to sleep well 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.619
 in this program we are going to talk about a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.020
 I tecito of the strongest that I can them 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.770
 recommend Mexican plants that we 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.980
 can help that insomnia problem 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.649
 that some people suffer not without 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.079
 before mentioning that sleeping in the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.360
 darkness helps us a lot to 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.120
 produce that sleep hormone the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.210
 melatonin that depends precisely on 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.460
 the lack of light to develop 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.460
 the doctor will also be with us 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.510
 Mauricio Padilla who is going to talk to us 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.010
 about legumes beans and all 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.550
 its properties 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.270
 this simple the simple food that 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.210
 it gives us incredible benefits 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.700
 and finally I'm going to give you a recipe 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.100
 that you have asked us to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.590
 turn your shampoo the shampoo that you 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.960
 use at home in an herbal shampoo that 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.149
 will help on the one hand to stimulate the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.939
 hair growth and on the other 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.159
 Prevent hair from falling out 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.829
 we have what you think 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.360
 with this program we are going to start this 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.360
 new adventure come with me 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.240
 about 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.390
 now 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.280
 i 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.280
 this is nature 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.940
 how about friends then we continue with this 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.180
 recipe that you requested there 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:19.170
 people who struggle to grab that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.569
 necessary dream necessary diego because 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.330
 when we do not sleep well everything is 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.660
 alter we do not work well we surrender 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.110
 well we are going the appetite we walk badly 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.739
 humor 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.620
 so sleep well is important 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:38.400
 as always nature is prodigal and 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.860
 they give us many options to help 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.120
 to fall asleep from the soft 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.220
 Relaxers like chamomile and melissa 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.640
 to those stronger than valerian 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.410
 the hops but there are also plants 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.190
 mexican women who can help us 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.550
 enormously to help reconcile the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.880
 I dream this recipe from my knowledge 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.590
 it's probably the best recipe that we 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.270
 can help for those hard people 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.720
 hard to sleep 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.380
 There are four Mexican plants tomb 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.450
 cowboys tomb jeans jeans the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.490
 name is suggestive in itself but 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.590
 I want to tell you that this plant that 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.500
 grows in chihuahua is a vine 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.500
 woody and the name tomb cowboys that 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.870
 well is associated with its sedative effect 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.090
 it really comes because the cowboys in 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.170
 the old time when horses 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.520
 they were our main means of 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.430
 movement because they were entangled in 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.560
 occasions in these vines of this 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.080
 plant that received this name grave 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.970
 jeans because it was precisely that 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.840
 the horses stopped and the cowboy 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.180
 I would shoot forward the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.940
 next plant is the melissa a plant 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.400
 delicious taste of origin 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.130
 Mediterranean but already cultivated in 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.450
 our country for years another 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.920
 relaxing very well studied and apart 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.150
 delicious that will support us 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.860
 synergize the effect 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.530
 sedative or hypnotic of the grave jeans 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.010
 another plant hand flower a tree 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.829
 tropical from mexico beautiful by the way 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.490
 of its flowers that look literally 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.340
 handyman there comes his name and that 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.430
 has the effect also inducing the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.000
 dream and finally let's finish 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.400
 our recipe with leaves and stems of the 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.100
 white sapote tree this tree 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.560
 tropical that we use a lot for 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.230
 control of blood pressure in this 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.710
 recipe the white zapote what it does is 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.500
 act as a vasodilator and when generating 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.160
 that vasodilatation produces the 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.040
 drowsiness so this recipe 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.440
 that I already know from here because we're leaving 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.920
 to drugs drugs that 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.050
 ideally we should avoid as 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.140
 let's make the recipe equal parts 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.570
 half a cup of each a quarter cup 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.060
 from each one the amount you want 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.100
 prepare but let's combine them is 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.530
 say let's make a combined 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.990
 our four plants we are going to put them 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.980
 in a place where we can mix the 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.340
 blankets before passing them to the bottle 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.780
 where are we going to store our combined 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.030
 so that all plants can be 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.580
 adequately combine the ideal is that 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.400
 are previously crushed of that 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.050
 can be mixed and when 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.970
 we are going to take our 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.810
 spoonfuls to prepare our 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.760
 infusion then we are sure of 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.640
 that each tablespoon will bring the proportion 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.580
 adequate of any of the plants 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.980
 that we are combining this tea must of 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.900
 particularly if used concentrated 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.190
 you are one of those people who 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.030
 they struggle a lot 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:02.220
 to sleep I consider this is a tea 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.490
 for adults for difficult people from 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.830
 sleep ideally not a two tablespoons 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.590
 let's do it very loaded two 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.020
 spoonfuls for a cup that in this 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.690
 In a particular case it is convenient that we take it 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.900
 hot since the tea heat cited 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.120
 It also helps us induce sleep 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.630
 as always we have our fresh water 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.350
 boiled freshly lifted from the stove and 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.690
 we are going to pour the on our plant and 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.900
 let rest in this case it agrees not 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.900
 rest too 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.930
 so that the tea does not cool two three 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.150
 four minutes we leave and if you want 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.759
 sweeten it in sweet preferably 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.070
 with honey if you are not diabetic if 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:49.070
 no better not honey sweet honey 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.740
 can support or synergize the effect 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.259
 relaxing of somnifera plants but 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.289
 better so we leave it and we're going to take it 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:07:00.560
 about 30-40 minutes before we go to 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:02.509
 sleep since this one literally mediates you 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.120
 hour after having taken it goes to 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:08.510
 start producing that you nod and 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:12.590
 start blinking and go to that bed to 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:14.539
 sleep like a trunk all night 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.580
 in this way we can get up on the 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:19.070
 morning rested and ready to 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.470
 continue the day friends as this is a 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.410
 recipe more than you have suggested to us 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.800
 here for your natural program what do you 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.800
 It seems 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:32.709
 ah
