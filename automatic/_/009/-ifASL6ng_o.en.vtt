00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
in combat pack number two and of course

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.819 
in combat pack number two and of course
it<00:00:39.600> would<00:00:39.719> make<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> lot<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.110> sense<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
it would make a lot of sense right I

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.209

think<00:00:41.190> other<00:00:41.430> than<00:00:41.550> spawn<00:00:42.680> alien<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.890> probably

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
think other than spawn alien is probably

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.889
