00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.740

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.380
 when we started looking for the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 shoes for our wedding 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.870
 we immediately started to see 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.930
 lots of sites and there are 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.620
 online possibility to buy shoes 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.270
 whether they are cultured free or ecological, however 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.920
 very often cruelty free shoes 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.019
 they are not necessarily also 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.780
 ecological and ecological shoes 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.900
 many times they are not elegant enough 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.400
 for a ceremony with a sooner or later ad 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.469
 a natural products fair there 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.719

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.949
 impressed by the beauty of these shoes 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.950
 and from the particularity of this 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.140
 material that reveals itself to the touch 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.840
 soft and also very flexible 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.420
 limpe bed is the brin brand of a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.550
 historic Marche shoe factory that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.680
 dates back to the fifties and 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.690
 which now has the latest generation 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.320
 decided to start producing shoes 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.690
 ecological 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.670
 in fact, these shoes are ecological 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.500
 from all points of view because they are 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.530
 ecological materials that are 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.229
 used as the sub and precisely risks

 to help in kenaf and they are ecological 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.130
 also in the other components because of 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.530
 do the soles for example come 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.510
 used bees bioplastic 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.930
 completely 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.150
 amendable and instead to assemble them all 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.520
 how many parts of the shoe are not used 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.500
 the water catches it all with one 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.410
 great attention of 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.270

 really really comfortable these semi laces 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.410
 which are made of jute while all the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.990
 rest of the shoe is done exactly 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.970
 as with any normal shoe of 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:55.459
 skin or skin the soles instead are 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.650
 in this material which is a plastic 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.670
 very biodegradable and very resistant 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.280
 this model chosen for me that a 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.050
 a very sweet model also in the name 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.160

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.380
 really pretty dancers too 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.420
 these are ris disorders you see 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.350
 that the upper is all cork 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.350
 on the outside 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.180
 the interior instead is of fabric as well as 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.189
 other profiles and also these are 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.209
 very soft flexible estimates can be made 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:32.939
 just see even from the video 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.959
 the sole instead is always plastic 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:42.120
 biodegradable but this floral print 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:43.769
 very pretty flower bed 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.739
 this is a belt of choice for alex 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.939
 made up bass in the profiles while the 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:55.319
 part the central part of hemp and ai 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:57.599
 holes made this way while instead 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:02.459
 the metal buckle also this a 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:06.959
 this really very pretty accessory 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:09.090
 instead it is a little cloth bag with the 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.389
 game logo peletto the snail that 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.849
 contains a clutch always of sub eris 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.139
 therefore also cork of one 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.630
 incredible softness I wish that 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.220
 could touch her because she really didn't 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.139
 you can believe but when you touch it you 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:30.750
 understands how inside it is always 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:32.880
 of this hemp fabric then a 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.500
 natural material and put it inside 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.349
 this accessory which is a 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.680
 bracelets always made of cork with 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.419
 this precisely cork string which 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.280
 on the back maybe you don't see well but 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:50.130
 very reminiscent of the skin and these two 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.840
 the closure with a button a 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.470
 pressure and these two elements of 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.139
 metal with rhinestones 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.040
 I find it adorable it's beautiful between 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.950
 the other these two elements can be 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.900
 even move you have you can move 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.710
 at will and arrange them where you are 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.090
 want it is beautiful I love it 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.590
 small bag the outlook for use 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.660
 allow troops but marry like 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.790
 wallet as a cell phone holder and you can 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:20.040
 also use this to contain the 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:22.440
 more busy objects among other things sells 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.380
 online they have a limited shop in their 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.570
 site and has been questioning on the plus point 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.370
 because it is extremely comfortable to be able to 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.360
 buy from home without moving 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.300
 a finger 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.860
 but to buy shoes of course 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.260
 it's not that simple because you have to 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.830
 understand the measure well and therefore them 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.169
 in fact they made a lot of tables 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.720
 intuitive very simple though 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.270
 can allow point to find the 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.289
 own number precisely taking 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.990
 simply 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.149
 he asks therefore we put all of us 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.999
 references of their site that I think 

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:58.800
 also a lot for the aesthetic is a lot 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:00.719
 simple to understand is not a site 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.119
 difficult and we all become 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.789
 references in the infobox so same as 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:07.619
 interested in these ecological products 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.619
 natural in others very beautiful elegant 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:12.119
 you can take a look 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:14.159
 also for this video is everything we hope 

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:16.499
 to have given you by the monsters the profits that 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.180
