00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
largest initiative ever committed to a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.790 
largest initiative ever committed to a
single<00:00:19.310> disease<00:00:19.600> PEPFAR<00:00:20.600> and<00:00:23.650> when<00:00:24.650> people

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
through because I it was just such an

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.250 
through because I it was just such an
enormous<00:00:33.910> what<00:00:34.910> they<00:00:35.120> call<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.390> be<00:00:35.660> Hank<00:00:35.900> a<00:00:36.080> big

hairy<00:00:36.530> audacious<00:00:36.739> goal<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:38.860> from<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:39.980> purely

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
hairy audacious goal and from a purely

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.549 
hairy audacious goal and from a purely
political<00:00:40.960> viewpoint<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.019> weren't<00:00:42.350> going<00:00:42.470> to
