00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
has some zealot bombs in them that's
what<00:01:52.770> they're<00:01:52.890> called<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.549> basically

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
what they're called because basically

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.380 
what they're called because basically

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you on unload them so they they get hit

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.580 
you on unload them so they they get hit
by<00:01:57.570> mines<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.950> tanks<00:01:59.369> flash<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.880> they<00:01:59.969> die<00:02:00.180> I

it's<00:02:13.920> not<00:02:14.100> very<00:02:14.310> good<00:02:14.700> because<00:02:15.390> probes<00:02:15.990> our

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
it's not very good because probes our

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
minds don't attack worker units and so

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.860 
minds don't attack worker units and so
it'd<00:02:21.510> only<00:02:21.660> be<00:02:21.810> splash<00:02:22.500> from<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.040> tanks<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
it'd only be splash from the tanks and a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.510 
it'd only be splash from the tanks and a
