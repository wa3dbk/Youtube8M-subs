are<00:00:26.619> just<00:00:26.800> some<00:00:26.950> hackle<00:00:27.400> fibers<00:00:27.790> want<00:00:28.660> those

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
are just some hackle fibers want those

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.240 
are just some hackle fibers want those
to<00:00:29.020> be<00:00:29.050> about<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.529> length<00:00:29.650> of<00:00:29.860> the<00:00:29.919> shank<00:00:30.160> of

to be about the length of the shank of
the<00:00:30.310> hook<00:00:30.460> I<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.869> roughly<00:00:32.169> measure<00:00:32.380> those

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
the hook I just roughly measure those

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.840 
the hook I just roughly measure those
out<00:00:33.300> tie<00:00:34.300> them<00:00:34.540> in<00:00:34.690> right<00:00:35.079> at<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.260> back<00:00:38.850> next

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850

draw<00:00:40.989> those<00:00:41.199> hackle<00:00:41.620> fibers<00:00:41.949> up<00:00:42.129> I'm<00:00:42.430> going<00:00:42.579> to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
draw those hackle fibers up I'm going to

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.490 
draw those hackle fibers up I'm going to
split<00:00:42.940> them<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:45.070> two<00:00:45.250> even<00:00:45.640> clumps<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:47.320> going

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
split them to two even clumps I'm going

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:59.310 
split them to two even clumps I'm going
to<00:00:48.149> split<00:00:49.149> them<00:00:49.359> with<00:00:49.390> my<00:00:49.660> thread

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.900 

just<00:00:59.980> like<00:01:00.160> so

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.460 

it<00:01:04.360> doesn't<00:01:04.600> have<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.780> be<00:01:04.870> perfect<00:01:05.290> just

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
it doesn't have to be perfect just

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.730 
it doesn't have to be perfect just
enough<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.800> kind<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:05.980> split<00:01:06.250> those<00:01:07.740> tail

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
enough to kind of split those tail

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.840 
enough to kind of split those tail
fibers<00:01:09.220> up<00:01:11.730> take<00:01:12.730> my<00:01:12.880> thread<00:01:13.090> forward<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:14.850> can

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
fibers up take my thread forward I can

fibers up take my thread forward I can
trim<00:01:16.120> out<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.480> excess<00:01:18.630> next<00:01:19.630> thing<00:01:19.750> we're

the body just enough to cover the thread
I'd<00:03:03.940> be<00:03:04.090> real<00:03:04.270> careful<00:03:04.540> not<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.050> put<00:03:05.980> too<00:03:06.010> much

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.710 

wing<00:03:34.910> there<00:03:35.210> I'm<00:03:35.900> going<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.140> measure<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.470> hackle

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
wing there I'm going to measure a hackle

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.980 
wing there I'm going to measure a hackle
want<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.840> hackle<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.260> be<00:03:39.380> just<00:03:39.650> slightly

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.080 
want the hackle to be just slightly
smaller<00:03:41.990> than<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.790> wing

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
smaller than the wing

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:51.140 
smaller than the wing
I<00:03:45.130> like<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.280> wing<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.670> stand<00:03:46.970> up

I get to the head I just capture the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:59.280 
I get to the head I just capture the
hackle

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.790 

pull<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.950> out<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.100> there<00:05:00.570> trim<00:05:01.570> out<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.800> excess

fibers

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.989 

it's<00:05:16.650> always<00:05:16.800> going<00:05:17.009> to<00:05:17.069> be<00:05:17.159> a<00:05:17.280> few<00:05:17.580> errant

00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:17.999 
it's always going to be a few errant

it's always going to be a few errant
hackle<00:05:18.539> fibers<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.110> just<00:05:20.419> trim<00:05:21.419> those<00:05:21.569> out<00:05:21.840> of

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
hackle fibers you just trim those out of

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.029 
hackle fibers you just trim those out of
the<00:05:22.020> way<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.900> now<00:05:25.080> gently<00:05:25.499> brush<00:05:25.770> everything

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
the way and now gently brush everything

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:37.000 
the way and now gently brush everything
back<00:05:27.080> so<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.139> can<00:05:28.199> clean<00:05:28.590> up<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:29.039> head<00:05:29.219> region

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.640 

now<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.910> last<00:05:38.120> thing<00:05:38.390> to<00:05:38.540> do<00:05:38.720> is<00:05:40.210> dub<00:05:41.210> the<00:05:41.650> head

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
now the last thing to do is dub the head

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.000 
now the last thing to do is dub the head
