00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
sitting on a bench it's kind of

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.920 
sitting on a bench it's kind of
depressed<00:00:27.400> and<00:00:27.849> she's<00:00:28.210> upset<00:00:28.509> that<00:00:28.570> she

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
hasn't been targeted for a pure heart

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.620 
hasn't been targeted for a pure heart
crystal<00:00:30.759> yet<00:00:30.849> she's<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.150> only<00:00:31.300> one<00:00:31.450> of<00:00:31.570> the

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
crystal yet she's the only one of the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.480 
crystal yet she's the only one of the
girls<00:00:31.810> that<00:00:31.869> hasn't<00:00:32.230> been<00:00:32.380> so<00:00:33.070> she<00:00:33.130> thinks

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490 
girls that hasn't been so she thinks

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.220 
girls that hasn't been so she thinks
she's<00:00:33.700> not<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:34.090> good<00:00:34.390> enough<00:00:34.570> person<00:00:34.810> if<00:00:35.110> the

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
she's not a good enough person if the

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.290 
she's not a good enough person if the
monsters<00:00:35.560> won't<00:00:35.650> target<00:00:36.040> her<00:00:36.160> he's<00:00:37.000> like<00:00:37.120> well

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
monsters won't target her he's like well

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.700 
monsters won't target her he's like well
that's<00:00:37.450> not<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.810> best<00:00:37.990> logic<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.590> you

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
that's not the best logic and you

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.100 
that's not the best logic and you
probably<00:00:38.950> shouldn't<00:00:39.550> be<00:00:39.700> making<00:00:40.570> yourself<00:00:40.810> a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
probably shouldn't be making yourself a

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.260 
probably shouldn't be making yourself a
bigger<00:00:41.260> target<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.770> these<00:00:41.890> monsters<00:00:42.280> so<00:00:43.240> I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
bigger target to these monsters so I

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.670

rescuer and realizes oh we're gonna meet
you're<00:01:30.189> behind<00:01:30.429> me<00:01:30.640> but<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.119> need<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.420> transform

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
you're behind me but I need to transform

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.779 
you're behind me but I need to transform
so<00:01:32.499> she<00:01:32.560> pulls<00:01:32.829> out<00:01:32.979> her<00:01:33.159> compact<00:01:33.609> and

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
so she pulls out her compact and

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.880 
so she pulls out her compact and
transforms<00:01:34.359> right<00:01:34.569> in<00:01:34.689> front<00:01:34.869> of<00:01:34.990> them<00:01:35.140> then

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
transforms right in front of them then

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.169 
transforms right in front of them then
