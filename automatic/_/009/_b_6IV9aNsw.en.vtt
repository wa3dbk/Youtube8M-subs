00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
vibrato the snow here but my first

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
vibrato the snow here but my first
finger<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:43.979> put<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:45.149> part<00:01:45.509> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
finger on it and then put this part of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.679 
finger on it and then put this part of
my<00:01:45.780> hand<00:01:46.049> back<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.240> acts<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
my hand back like that so it acts as a

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.460 
my hand back like that so it acts as a
kind<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.430> fulcrum<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:51.020> this<00:01:52.020> action<00:01:54.470> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
kind of fulcrum for this this action and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.050 
kind of fulcrum for this this action and
the<00:01:55.710> way<00:01:55.829> I've<00:01:56.040> always<00:01:56.219> done<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.909> go

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the way I've always done it is to go

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.620 
the way I've always done it is to go
down

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:12.830 

by<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:07.789> some<00:02:08.789> friends<00:02:09.179> will<00:02:09.539> go<00:02:09.690> back<00:02:11.840> let's

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
a big method remember you can get the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:59.720 
a big method remember you can get the
right<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.390> any<00:02:51.569> finger<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:59.010> that's<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
right of any finger so that's like a

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.160 
right of any finger so that's like a
score<00:03:00.060> method<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.480> vibrato<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:03.170> recently

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
score method of vibrato and recently

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.440 
score method of vibrato and recently
I've<00:03:04.290> learned<00:03:04.530> another<00:03:04.829> method<00:03:05.420> where<00:03:06.420> you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
I've learned another method where you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.050 
I've learned another method where you
can<00:03:06.630> get<00:03:06.750> for<00:03:06.959> brato<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.560> your<00:03:07.709> bands<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.970> is

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
can get for brato on your bands this is

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.590 
can get for brato on your bands this is
from<00:03:09.329> watching<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:10.049> video<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.940> young<00:03:12.180> Eric

Clapton talking about his gibson guitar

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.289 
Clapton talking about his gibson guitar
and<00:03:15.450> i<00:03:15.540> put<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> link<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.950> at<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.639> side

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
and i put a link to that in at the side

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.360 
and i put a link to that in at the side
and<00:03:19.069> what<00:03:20.069> he's<00:03:20.280> doing<00:03:20.519> he's<00:03:20.970> doing<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.480> band

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.559 

again<00:03:26.370> some<00:03:26.609> burrata<00:03:26.910> at<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.420> end

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.970 

now<00:03:34.569> I<00:03:34.599> found<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:35.080> quite<00:03:35.349> difficult<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.769> do

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
now I found this quite difficult to do

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.520 
now I found this quite difficult to do
and<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:40.030> best<00:03:40.330> way<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.780> learn<00:03:41.050> that<00:03:41.319> I<00:03:41.440> will

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
and the best way to learn that I will

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.180 
and the best way to learn that I will
actually<00:03:41.620> put<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> link<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.180> novotel<00:03:43.750> teacher

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
actually put a link to a novotel teacher

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.759 
actually put a link to a novotel teacher
called<00:03:45.190> Justin<00:03:45.790> sanic<00:03:46.390> oh<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.959> he's<00:03:47.530> got<00:03:47.739> a

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.559 
called Justin sanic oh and he's got a
really<00:03:47.920> brilliant<00:03:48.160> video<00:03:48.519> on<00:03:48.819> how<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.060> do<00:03:49.360> that

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
really brilliant video on how to do that

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.800 
really brilliant video on how to do that
I<00:03:49.900> think<00:03:50.470> he<00:03:50.980> explains<00:03:51.849> it<00:03:52.030> better<00:03:52.209> than<00:03:52.720> I

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
I think he explains it better than I

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.770 
I think he explains it better than I

i'd<00:06:17.430> say<00:06:17.640> get<00:06:18.330> for<00:06:18.540> broto<00:06:18.780> any<00:06:19.500> way<00:06:19.860> you<00:06:19.920> can

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
i'd say get for broto any way you can

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.880 
i'd say get for broto any way you can
any<00:06:21.090> method<00:06:21.480> that<00:06:21.630> works<00:06:21.870> for<00:06:22.170> you<00:06:22.230> and<00:06:22.530> go

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
any method that works for you and go

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.940 
any method that works for you and go
with<00:06:23.070> that<00:06:23.250> but<00:06:23.850> later<00:06:24.030> on<00:06:24.240> you<00:06:24.420> might<00:06:24.540> want<00:06:24.840> to

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
with that but later on you might want to

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.860 
with that but later on you might want to
look<00:06:25.950> at<00:06:26.160> developing<00:06:26.760> different<00:06:27.240> types<00:06:27.660> of

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
look at developing different types of

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.340 
look at developing different types of
vibrato<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:29.220> i<00:06:30.000> think<00:06:30.570> i'll<00:06:30.720> leave<00:06:30.960> be

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
vibrato and i think i'll leave be

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.170 
vibrato and i think i'll leave be
pushing<00:06:31.740> an<00:06:31.830> answer<00:06:32.310> till<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.700> next<00:06:32.880> lesson

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
pushing an answer till the next lesson

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.710 
pushing an answer till the next lesson
and<00:06:33.650> so<00:06:34.650> we'll<00:06:35.430> just<00:06:35.580> keep<00:06:35.760> that<00:06:35.940> a<00:06:36.000> vibrato

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
and so we'll just keep that a vibrato

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.560 
and so we'll just keep that a vibrato
and<00:06:37.230> good<00:06:37.740> luck<00:06:37.860> with<00:06:37.920> that<00:06:38.100> and<00:06:38.520> if<00:06:39.270> you<00:06:39.420> look

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
and good luck with that and if you look

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.340 
and good luck with that and if you look
at<00:06:39.690> one<00:06:39.840> way<00:06:40.020> advanced<00:06:40.410> lessons<00:06:41.040> but<00:06:41.580> I<00:06:42.350> have

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
at one way advanced lessons but I have

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.850 
at one way advanced lessons but I have
got<00:06:43.380> a<00:06:43.740> really<00:06:44.100> huge<00:06:44.730> practice<00:06:45.390> routine<00:06:45.900> to<00:06:46.230> to

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
got a really huge practice routine to to

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.370 
got a really huge practice routine to to
start<00:06:47.190> learning<00:06:47.370> to<00:06:47.610> get<00:06:48.360> been<00:06:48.600> vibrato<00:06:48.990> all

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
start learning to get been vibrato all

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.440 
start learning to get been vibrato all
around<00:06:49.650> the<00:06:49.770> neck<00:06:49.980> it's<00:06:50.370> quite<00:06:50.580> difficult<00:06:50.850> but

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
around the neck it's quite difficult but

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.530 
around the neck it's quite difficult but
but<00:06:51.990> give<00:06:52.320> that<00:06:52.500> a<00:06:52.530> go<00:06:52.770> okay<00:06:53.730> so<00:06:53.790> thanks<00:06:54.480> for
