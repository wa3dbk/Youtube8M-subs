I<00:03:56.219> should<00:03:57.219> have<00:03:57.310> done<00:03:57.780> builds<00:03:58.780> where<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.379> know

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
I should have done builds where you know

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.879 
I should have done builds where you know
the<00:04:00.549> Nestea<00:04:00.909> built<00:04:01.349> where<00:04:02.349> I<00:04:02.379> just<00:04:02.499> kind<00:04:02.769> of

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
the Nestea built where I just kind of

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.080 
the Nestea built where I just kind of
put<00:04:04.859> like<00:04:05.859> I<00:04:06.010> spit<00:04:06.280> creep<00:04:06.489> with<00:04:06.609> this<00:04:06.730> overlord

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090

that<00:04:09.400> would<00:04:09.489> have<00:04:09.579> been<00:04:09.609> really<00:04:09.909> fun<00:04:09.939> my<00:04:10.299> best

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
that would have been really fun my best

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.949 
that would have been really fun my best
build<00:04:10.840> against<00:04:11.230> us

build against us

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.690 
build against us
I'm<00:04:13.959> not<00:04:14.079> sure<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.290> would<00:04:15.280> have<00:04:15.340> been<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.489> cool

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
I'm not sure that would have been a cool

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.699 
I'm not sure that would have been a cool
build<00:04:15.909> though<00:04:18.449> hmm<00:04:19.449> all<00:04:20.410> right<00:04:20.440> you're<00:04:20.620> taking

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
build though hmm all right you're taking

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.700 
build though hmm all right you're taking
all<00:04:20.979> four<00:04:21.220> gas<00:04:21.400> at<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.669> same<00:04:21.729> time<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.389> I

all four gas at the same time and I
don't<00:04:23.710> understand<00:04:24.190> your<00:04:24.310> build<00:04:28.470> why<00:04:29.470> you

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
don't understand your build why you

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.499 
don't understand your build why you
don't<00:04:30.160> have<00:04:30.430> enough<00:04:30.699> to<00:04:30.880> sustain<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.300> I

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
don't have enough to sustain that I

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:41.430 
don't have enough to sustain that I
don't<00:04:31.750> think<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:39.419> don't<00:04:40.419> know<00:04:40.539> obviously<00:04:41.289> it's

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
don't think I don't know obviously it's

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.170 
don't think I don't know obviously it's
some<00:04:41.620> sort<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.860> cheese<00:04:42.099> then<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.430> suppose<00:04:45.180> these

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
are you're gonna have such good games

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:24.370 
are you're gonna have such good games
man<00:04:54.240> why'd<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.389> have<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.509> go<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:55.780> cheese
