 Now we will include more details for you 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.100
 I'll tell you about this phone 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.689
 Here it turns on while it is samsung galaxy s4 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.180
 mini 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:51.170
 very good at having a super screen 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:54.649
 omelette 4 3 inch 540 by 960 expansion to 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:58.079
 gsm and umts battery communication standards 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:02.159
 1900 from my purchase of very 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.460
 good battery android 4 2 very 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.649
 good honestly but the process 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.310
 dual core 1 of 7 hertz 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.810
 which is quite natural for such 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.950
 phone speeds 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.190
 100 amazing here is the memory of the phone 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.989
 8 gigabytes of flash card support 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.599
 64 gigabytes of RAM and a half 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.319
 gigabyte here listen one and a half 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.330
 gigabyte this is generally a camera 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.790
 he has 2 megapixels in front 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.890
 Above, yes, and cameras for photos 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.959
 8 megapixels from his communications 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.599
 bluetooth wifi gps and infrared 100 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.690
 I can say more about these two 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:51.440
 phones problems with these phones then 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:55.440
 with a screen with a camera that found another 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.750
 honestly if i would choose between 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.700
 these two 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.940
 Of course I would choose a phone number 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.660
 samsung galaxy s4 mini 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.440
 because less is more functionality though 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.980
 with smaller size, more functionality 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.349
 it is not always get the more 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.180
 what's the performance of this phone to you 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:25.200
 very good galaxy gio he's good yes 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.519
 no question there and its advantages to android on 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.420
 more new there RAM and the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.810
 like a creative like a cat crying to 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.350
 honestly 512 this is just nothing here 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.769
 but galaxy s4 mini is really good 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.769
 phone we recommend s4 mini 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.280
 Well, as they say , decide for yourself 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.440

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.709
