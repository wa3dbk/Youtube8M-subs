00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
normally would um except I made them a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.660 
normally would um except I made them a
little<00:01:18.060> bit<00:01:18.299> larger<00:01:19.049> probably<00:01:20.009> I'd<00:01:20.220> say<00:01:20.430> twice

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
little bit larger probably I'd say twice

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.120 
little bit larger probably I'd say twice
the<00:01:20.909> size<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.420> normally<00:01:21.509> make<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> then

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the size that I normally make and then

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.179 
the size that I normally make and then
I'm<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.460> kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.330> rounded<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.049> at<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> top

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
I'm just kind of rounded them at the top

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.300 
I'm just kind of rounded them at the top
here<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:27.270> make<00:01:27.509> kind<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.680> almost<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
here to make kind of like almost a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.330 
here to make kind of like almost a
teardrop<00:01:29.820> shape<00:01:30.439> kind<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.920> for<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
teardrop shape kind of like for the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.660 
teardrop shape kind of like for the
dress<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.770> dipped<00:01:35.340> him<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
dress and then and I dipped him in the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
dress and then and I dipped him in the
chocolate<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.780> cut<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.140> these<00:01:37.409> little

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
chocolate and we cut out these little

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.609 
chocolate and we cut out these little
and<00:01:38.869> princess<00:01:40.670> figurines<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.939> guess<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.619> some

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and princess figurines I guess on some

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.100 
and princess figurines I guess on some
cardstock<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.240> cut<00:01:45.390> those<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> then

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
cardstock so just cut those out and then

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.980 
cardstock so just cut those out and then
when<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.799> still<00:01:46.920> wet<00:01:47.329> we<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.600> placed

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
when this was still wet we just placed

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.810 
when this was still wet we just placed
them<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.680> top<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.439> added<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:52.860> sprinkles<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
them on top and added some sprinkles and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.090 
them on top and added some sprinkles and
glitter<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:55.079> tied<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> little<00:01:55.920> bow<00:01:56.040> on

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
glitter and then tied a little bow on

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.350 
glitter and then tied a little bow on
the<00:01:56.280> top<00:01:57.469> so<00:01:58.469> yeah<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.909> they<00:02:00.149> look

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the top so yeah that is what they look

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230 
the top so yeah that is what they look
like<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.219> wanted<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> show<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.909> guys
