00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:24.609
 [Music] 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.220
 now back to family I bring you two 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.559
 two first gift gifts 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.539
 javi moyano dear mate a great 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:37.809
 actor that also fixed by where with 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.699
 family and friends and good javi has 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.309
 two qualities several many surely 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.899
 besides very good actor by the way that 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.970
 Brunette so wonderful that you give her come 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.350
 of the real job his daughter 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.659
 I will continue to be right now in a series 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.329
 which is called shoulder bag and are demands 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.180
 of the script then with full or without hair 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.100
 they are very handsome already has that quality of 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.259
 know a lot about the rich lage and many of 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.500
 crafts and today the second gift is 

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:04.540
 what brings us that are the flowers of 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.610
 organza a special gift from javier 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.000
 for women truth yes I already believe 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.439
 yes because the organza flower is a 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.810
 preciousness once it is done 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:17.680
 because you can give it a thousand 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.650
 applications and so that aside 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.870
 that you are already beautiful in itself 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:28.120
 precious good organza then 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.130
 let's start let's like the recipe for 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.590
 cook the ingredients it is clear that 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.970
 if this tells me that javi is the material 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.010
 included so to speak I 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.110
 it is organza fabric organza 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.660
 and because the organza and not any other 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.330
 fabric because then because the organza has 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.520
 a very very very express characteristic and 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.100
 very special that they do not have other fabrics and 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.860
 is that the heat once we apply it 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.869
 the heat is wrinkled in a way that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.920
 perfectly imitates what would be the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.290
 petals of a flower for rose a carnation 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.030
 or something similar like the movement 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.820
 it is shown walking then we put you 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.800
 details of what variety of occasions of 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.810
 circumstances we can use them or 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.170
 to make them clear, let's start with it 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.150
 here we have one to see this one is 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.160
 cut into squares but we're not going to 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.800
 Doing this would correspond to the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.220
 result of this number this has brought 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.680
 to javi a telita cut in squares 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.709
 which corresponds to that form of flowers 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.010
 but let's make one that corresponds to 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.400
 is 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.349
 yes because according to cut the organza well 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.060
 will later have the appearance of 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.110
 the flower is or petal more 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.019
 rounded or more petals more weevil 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.930
 more compact more homogeneous now what 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.519
 we teach in practice would be with I think 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.510
 we go in the almost rounded shape and this one 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.510
 is with a little bit more 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.510
 exact 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.849
 because walking is how the 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:06.489
 I walk perfectly our 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:08.920
 viewers arrive and we start to operate 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.470
 of boys and girls are going to have 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.099
 well I have not told you that we take the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.319
 organza and we make two folds of 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.320
 so that there is a small square and 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.630
 in the corner just 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.210
 opposite to the fold 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.890
 we make the form that subsequently 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.840
 is going to have the petal meaning the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.580
 we round up a little bit I put it that way 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.820
 camera so that it looks perfectly 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.280
 everything well once we unfolded it you see 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.320
 that we no longer have the corners played 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.570
 but we have it uniquely rounded and 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.460
 exclusively to get to this step 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.960
 The only thing we should do 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.990
 would be 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.450
 a triangular hole effectively 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.970
 on each of the sides that we're not going 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.860
 to do because we already have already 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.450
 brought from home the debris I already have 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.390
 here a lot 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.150
 this is like that and we are gaining clear time 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.370
 that we have to see in different sizes 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.960
 not like that and just if for them 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.390
 the first man caves man 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.880
 logically I'm going to make the big the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.530
 big because it would be the basis on which 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.530
 you have to build the rest 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:27.050
 prepared but the preparations go to 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.850
 final so that it shrinks so to say some 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.830
 how many spectators we see how it 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.540
 ago let's see the sample with the fire 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.280
 what I told you earlier that the 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.560
 organza has this feature so 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.840
 great is that with the heat it wrinkles 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.980
 so that it imitates superbly what 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.140
 It would be a petal of a rose Look I will 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.710
 approached that yes not too much because if not 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.780
 it wrinkles a lot you see how the edges are 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.560
 they are eating little they are shrinking 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.419
 cool 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.419
 yes yes yes yes this is good 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:03.200
 light clear clear clear is justito give it 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.720
 the little touch because if we pass or not 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.060
 we arrived because it is not as beautiful as 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.490
 then it will be for your faces 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.830
 for your neck to regulate or if 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.380
 you have to go to a party anyway 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.000
 that give a lot of utility to this 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.000
 craft this is 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.169
 well, since it is clear that if not 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.370
 we finish in a moment because we are 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.210
 fast to silvia you'll see 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.520
 I have brought a craft 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.800
 with which you can give a lot of play and 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.759
 at home so we do not get bored at weekends 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.449
 of week 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:42.090
 and this we put here 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.759
 and then what do you have to do? 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.710
 let's put in let's go if we have a 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.319
 jewel tarbes and we're going to put a 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.880
 little girl a ring for example for example 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.190
 let's do the drill because the 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.990
 ring if it's important let's do it 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.500
 best serves remittance with this scissor well 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.920
 because scissors gives us a little more 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:07.810
 of margin so that the width of the ring 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.670
 gives us the width of the sheet would be the 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.280
 scissors 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:15.110
 we take to do the drilling myself 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.139
 three english subjects please 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.289
 we put it here in the center 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:23.569
 we make a small drill to see God 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:26.539
 mine to see if I can because this at home 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:29.029
 it tastes very good but the things of the 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.909
 live television and others I am 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:34.430
 supporting a little so that now already already 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:36.949
 and you want to say this is we get to the 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.439
 you see it and now we can put it 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.110
 the air ring that is valid if my 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:44.200
 assistant of love subject with it 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.440
 now we teach him now 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.960
 exactly as it appears by the 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.030
 other side 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:57.860
 it's a little patience and it 's 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:00.020
 see how beautiful you see it well 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.510
 ring around here and with that we have 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.930
 got this to get to this step 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:09.050
 get to this step not fouling then to 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.630
 that Miss lady put it on 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:15.200
 around the neck and go very precious 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.700
 well hung challenge also from a 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.400
 boring quadrant at home that re 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.200
 we encourage with that he really hears wikis and 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.270
 more thanks no thanks to you no 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.920
 could teach us to do more things with 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.480
 the organza flowers and with many other 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:32.080
 promised and more clear 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:37.220
 [Laughs] 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.220
