00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.490
 when the 'great has about 4 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.650
 we make more drink in the central wall 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.780
 of the bowel appears the 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.610
 pulmonary call the look and 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.090
 location of this leads pulmonary 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.289
 depend on the increase of retinoic acid 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.820
 it increases the transcription factor 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.460
 of the x 4 that induces the formation of 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.430
 buds the continuation of growth and 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.860
 the differentiation of the cougars 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.830
 when the diverticulum expands caudal 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.170
 mind the class esophageal track crests 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.840
 or stop to form static is the 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.660
 esophageal 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.100
 which divides the trachea and the yolks 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.100
 lung and esophagus 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.010
 each of these buds are enlarged to 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.620
 form the main neighborhoods right 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.660
 left after the right way three 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.240
 secondary bronchi while the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.100
 left formed the flames with 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.010
 Polka dots expand inside the cavity 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.710
 of the body forming the channels 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.920
 peritoneal peritoneal cavities 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.400
 but achieve pleura estimates 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.140
 visceral and I believe in the palette and its 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.110
 time the space between the parietal pleura 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.110
 and they will tell you that is the pleural cavity 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.580
 as development continues the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.370
 Secondary gills are divided 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.280
 dichotomous way and form 10 bronchi 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.340
 tertiary in the right lung and 8 in 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.070
 the left towards the end of the sixth 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.610
 approximately 17 months have been formed 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.720
 subdivisions and to before birth 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.070
 there are about 6 additional illusions 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.990
 towards the seventh month of prenatal life 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.060
 the bronchioles divide without 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.030
 interruption in channels more and more 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.820
 numerous and small called the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.090
 canicular period and supply 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.830
 vascular increases steadily 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.290
 terminal bronchi are divided to 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.920
 form the bronchi the respiratory ones and 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.560
 each of these is divided in turn into 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.640
 salivary ducts coming to an end 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.790
 in terminal bags 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.040
 the cells that cover the bags are 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.830
 they become thinner so that the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.590
 Surrounding circular capillaries protect 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.440
 inside the sacks to the dollars 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.140
 building the barrier to hair fear 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.300
 epithelial cells by violating this 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.300
 type two produce are quite 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.420
 without this thick layer is not the front of 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.300
 surfactant the alveoli would collapse 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.099
 During expiration, it is estimated that 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.080
 the moment of birth are only 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.660
 present the sixth part of the number 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.489
 total of the violated as the adult the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.780
 rest of albiol or is formed during 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.780
 first 10 years of life
