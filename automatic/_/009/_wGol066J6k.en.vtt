00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
especially Call of Duty and all these

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.279 
especially Call of Duty and all these
clips<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.629> from<00:00:51.780> hacked<00:00:51.960> lobbies<00:00:52.260> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
clips are just from hacked lobbies that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.229 
clips are just from hacked lobbies that
I<00:00:52.440> joined<00:00:52.710> into<00:00:53.100> other<00:00:53.610> players<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> game

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
I joined into other players in the game

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.639 
I joined into other players in the game
we're<00:00:54.480> hacking<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.140> pretty<00:00:55.289> much<00:00:55.410> why

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
we're hacking and that's pretty much why

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.260 
we're hacking and that's pretty much why
the<00:00:55.710> lobby<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.160> hacked<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> hacker

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the lobby is hacked I'm not a hacker

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.939 
the lobby is hacked I'm not a hacker
though<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.750> hack<00:00:58.050> lobbies<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:58.800> hack

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
though I don't hack lobbies I don't hack

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.349 
though I don't hack lobbies I don't hack
the<00:00:59.129> game<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.699> whatsoever

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the game at all whatsoever

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.420 
the game at all whatsoever
I<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.899> wanted<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> clarify<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
I just wanted to clarify that and in

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.039 
I just wanted to clarify that and in
this<00:01:02.579> Lobby<00:01:02.789> guys<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.180> tried<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:03.780> Moab

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
this Lobby guys I tried to go from Moab

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.359 
this Lobby guys I tried to go from Moab
but<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.439> some<00:01:04.589> reason<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> highest<00:01:05.189> kill

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
but for some reason the highest kill

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.340 
but for some reason the highest kill
streak<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.700> got<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.060> 6<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.200> pretty

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
streak I got was like 6 it's just pretty

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.539 
streak I got was like 6 it's just pretty
difficult<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.979> people<00:01:08.250> had<00:01:08.369> like

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
difficult because people had like

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.190 
difficult because people had like
unlimited<00:01:08.850> grenade<00:01:09.420> launchers<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.020> stuff

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
unlimited grenade launchers and stuff

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.660 
unlimited grenade launchers and stuff
like<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> highest<00:01:11.220> kill<00:01:11.430> streak<00:01:11.610> I

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
like that so the highest kill streak I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.609 
like that so the highest kill streak I
got<00:01:11.850> was<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.119> 6<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.720> pretty<00:01:13.290> much<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
got was like 6 so pretty much all you

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.050 
got was like 6 so pretty much all you
guys<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:13.950> seeing<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.400> some<00:01:14.520> clips<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
guys are seeing is just some clips a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.300 
guys are seeing is just some clips a
couple<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> kills<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.200> me<00:01:16.650> super

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
couple of kills that I get me super

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
couple of kills that I get me super
jumping<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.790> stuff<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.630> pretty

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
jumping and stuff like that so pretty

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.510 
jumping and stuff like that so pretty
much<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.500> hacks<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.890> were<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.310> game

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
much the hacks that were in this game

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
much the hacks that were in this game
was<00:01:20.670> unlimited<00:01:20.970> ammo<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.080> guys<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:22.470> I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
was unlimited ammo as you guys can see I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.140 
was unlimited ammo as you guys can see I
never<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> reload<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.460> gun<00:01:23.670> once<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.060> this

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
never have to reload my gun once in this

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
never have to reload my gun once in this
entire<00:01:24.420> clip<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.020> also<00:01:25.320> there's<00:01:25.650> super<00:01:26.009> jump

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
entire clip and also there's super jump

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.649 
entire clip and also there's super jump
so<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.430> could<00:01:26.549> jump<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.939> 50<00:01:27.299> feet<00:01:27.479> off<00:01:27.630> of

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
so you could jump like 50 feet off of

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.300 
so you could jump like 50 feet off of
the<00:01:27.810> ground<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:28.680> also<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.220> were

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the ground and then also there were

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.999 
the ground and then also there were
60,000<00:01:30.119> XP<00:01:30.570> per<00:01:30.810> kill<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.560> those<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
60,000 XP per kill so those are just the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.710 
60,000 XP per kill so those are just the
three<00:01:32.220> hacks<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.970> lobby<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.329> think<00:01:33.600> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
really get that but what I thought was

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.310 
really get that but what I thought was
really<00:01:53.820> cool<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.329> game<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> super

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
really cool about this game is the super

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.170 
really cool about this game is the super
jump<00:01:55.500> feature<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.100> pretty<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.030> get

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
jump feature so pretty much you can get

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.399 
jump feature so pretty much you can get
on<00:01:57.329> top<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.570> parts<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> map<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.229> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
on top of parts of the map that you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.080 
on top of parts of the map that you
would<00:01:58.500> never<00:01:58.619> usually<00:01:58.829> get<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.880> so

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
would never usually get get on to so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.859 
would never usually get get on to so
that<00:02:00.240> was<00:02:00.360> pretty<00:02:00.509> cool

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that was pretty cool

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.460 
that was pretty cool
and<00:02:00.990> hope<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.290> guys<00:02:01.500> enjoyed<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.009> peace<00:02:02.280> out
