pretty much down to you know that
routine<00:02:08.820> for<00:02:09.000> myself<00:02:09.530> some<00:02:10.530> people<00:02:10.800> may<00:02:10.890> not

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
routine for myself some people may not

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.190 
routine for myself some people may not
be<00:02:11.220> able<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:12.090> much<00:02:12.450> some<00:02:12.780> people<00:02:12.810> made

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
be able to do as much some people made

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.570 
be able to do as much some people made
you<00:02:13.350> more<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:14.400> all<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.940> personal<00:02:16.580> preference

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
you more it's all a personal preference

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.510 
you more it's all a personal preference
and<00:02:17.790> what<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.270> find<00:02:18.450> works<00:02:18.750> for<00:02:19.020> you

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
and what you find works for you

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.740 
and what you find works for you
you<00:02:20.850> can<00:02:20.970> kind<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.209> see<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> different

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
you can kind of see the different

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.690 
you can kind of see the different
motions<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.170> I'm<00:02:22.320> going<00:02:23.040> through<00:02:23.070> I'm<00:02:23.580> not

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
motions that I'm going through I'm not

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.120 
motions that I'm going through I'm not
going<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.910> talk<00:02:24.030> about<00:02:24.270> them<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.450> whole<00:02:24.630> lot

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
going to talk about them a whole lot

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.940 
going to talk about them a whole lot
basically<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.930> premise<00:02:28.140> behind<00:02:28.290> them<00:02:28.740> is

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
basically the the premise behind them is

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.500 
basically the the premise behind them is
you're<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:30.270> through<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.480> range<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.900> motion

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
you're going through a range of motion

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.850 
you're going through a range of motion
the<00:02:33.510> actual<00:02:33.959> motion<00:02:34.140> isn't<00:02:34.530> necessarily

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
the actual motion isn't necessarily

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.050 
the actual motion isn't necessarily
important<00:02:35.370> you're<00:02:35.520> just<00:02:35.700> trying<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.940> get

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
important you're just trying to get

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.960 
important you're just trying to get
blood<00:02:36.270> flow<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.750> arm<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:38.130> different

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
blood flow to the arm in different

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.090 
blood flow to the arm in different
directions<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.630> wake<00:02:40.350> all<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.620> muscles<00:02:40.950> up

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
directions and wake all the muscles up

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.479 
directions and wake all the muscles up
in<00:02:41.280> there<00:02:43.100> sometimes<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.190> gotta<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.459> a

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
in there sometimes you gotta have a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.979 
in there sometimes you gotta have a
little<00:02:44.670> bit<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.820> fun<00:02:45.000> kind<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:45.600> I'm<00:02:45.750> doing

my forearm stuff like that so I feel

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.800 
my forearm stuff like that so I feel
ready<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.010> throw<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> baseball<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.940> I'm<00:03:15.600> not

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
putting extra stress on muscles that may

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.630 
putting extra stress on muscles that may
not<00:03:18.600> be<00:03:18.780> ready<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.110> go<00:03:19.290> when<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.830> first<00:03:20.430> step

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
not be ready to go when you first step

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.000 
not be ready to go when you first step
out<00:03:20.820> there<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.290> pick<00:03:22.290> up<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.500> baseball<00:03:22.709> to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
out there and pick up a baseball to

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.100 
out there and pick up a baseball to
start<00:03:23.250> warming<00:03:23.610> up<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:24.000> definitely<00:03:24.870> believe<00:03:25.049> in

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
start warming up I definitely believe in

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.170 
start warming up I definitely believe in
warming<00:03:25.680> up<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.980> throw<00:03:26.250> instead<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.880> throwing

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
warming up to throw instead of throwing

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.930 
warming up to throw instead of throwing
to<00:03:27.510> warm<00:03:27.690> up<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.110> there's

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
to warm up and there's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.110 
to warm up and there's
a<00:03:29.770> big<00:03:30.770> difference<00:03:30.890> between<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.640> but<00:03:31.910> I

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
a big difference between that but I

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.720 
a big difference between that but I
guess<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.570> is<00:03:32.750> for<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.470> different<00:03:34.430> video

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
guess that is for a different video

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.620 
guess that is for a different video
probably<00:03:35.300> but<00:03:36.050> anyway<00:03:36.530> that's<00:03:37.430> uh<00:03:37.670> that's<00:03:38.390> the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
probably but anyway that's uh that's the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.990 
probably but anyway that's uh that's the
