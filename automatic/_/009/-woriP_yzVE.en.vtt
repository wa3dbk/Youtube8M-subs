00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.170
 In addition to modern fitness classes too 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.730
 that should be boring 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.740
 drop by thaiboxes 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.470
 also in the brandenburger gladiator 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.860
 Academy has been trained one of the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.419
 the oldest martial arts in the world 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.489
 I respect this with great respect 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.210
 first happen from the edge before it 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.260
 also starts for me 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.879
 yes I have a bit here now 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.070
 watched while thaiboxing and I am 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.230
 quite impressed yes why is 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.150
 Part of the box is a good sport 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:52.000
 yes because it is quite complete martial arts 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.550
 So it started from the whole 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.200
 motor skills that one to do 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.750
 needed about the conditions of this 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.700
 the responsiveness is trained and 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.380
 Of course, also the 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.439
 self-defense factor of this 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.970
 sport that looks pretty hard 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.189
 from what those behind me are doing 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.750
 I'm curious, I'll jog and jog 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.960
 everybody can swim that 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.219
 he is what hard guys I will 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.549
 you have to see me first now 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.549
 to prove 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.830
 So on the fight 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.320
 quite as fast as it gets 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.659
 not because warming must be from 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.590
 trade on all fours down ours 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.229
 on the ground 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.670
 push ups sit ups and back up and up 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.670
 all at a pace 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.700
 So my respect 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.690
 the warming got me done 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.690
 and now it's just getting started 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.439
 it can actually start now 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.729
 but a trifle is still missing 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.530
 scheine schooner first and then the 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.909
 boxing gloves now I am really 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.219
 stadler 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.590
 are next to the classic box set 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.810
 even third allows but the basics 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 are particularly important at the beginning 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.950
 I am also a short explanation 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.019
 directly full but it does not count 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.760
 only strength and endurance when thaiboxing 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.760
 is always the head asked 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.510
 typical is also the logic entry with 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.700
 the shin bone to the thigh while 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.530
 it's still pretty harmless to me 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.790
 looks like it is the other already 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.790
 pretty hard on the thing 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.190
 That was just part of the technology program 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.650
 I am already neat 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.060
 sweaty but it is still pretty much 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.370
 Well, how are things going to continue? 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.319
 Now we link the techniques 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.230
 with each other so you have now 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.270
 the beginning so had the basics and the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.430
 we now connect with each other so that 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.510
 then someday be combination 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.709
 depending on the craft degree 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.470
 but has already reached 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.480
 next to it accordingly easier or 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.730
 complicated, we are now one 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.380
 keep it simple but from the of 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.970
 conditional part is already 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.820
 After that, we will become exhausting 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.720
 another 20 minutes of power and 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.720
 Make condition circle 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.940
 then there is another 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.670
 impression arises I still have 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.959
 neat power trainer markus I have to 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.959
 unfortunately already say goodbye 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.800
 but now max training is taking over 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.800
 can therefore continue 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.050
 thaiboxing is always the whole 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.910
 Body used to train who is 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.450
 So just pump it out 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.180
 want 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.640
 that belongs right here I like it 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.050
 In any case, really good 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.090
 the motives for the training are 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.770
 but not very different 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.610
 only the fitness and the competition stand 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.470
 downtown 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.720
 many means part of boxing 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.970
 self-defense with a high 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.040
 But sport does not help 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.280
 because it requires a long training 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.930
 a lot of technology and club strategy in 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.910
 Thailand are the Thai boxers even 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.470
 right idols burst as 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.020
 Martial arts for others here 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.000
 playing football pays really there 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.860
 so 84 is not only younger worth 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.290
 trained by the parents against certain 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.850
 through and yes exactly on the market place 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.230
 The tournaments of crowds is also 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.130
 really tourist attraction 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.040
 time training person unfortunately I have to with 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.050
 say I come out big field 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.660
 In any case, do not come from the training 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.590
 but have a little break up 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.590
 every case demands 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.400
 Now it's time to start again 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.919
 the thirds by plugging it up 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.520
 any case without the pain plug 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.180
 But I'm pretty good, I'm now 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.919
 ready for the final phase 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.699
 that everything was totally easy here and now 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.699
 still pulled the power 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.419
 I can really do the last exercise 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.889
 just so the training tilts 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.810
 thank god, too, the end 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.490
 Anyway, I'm just hanging out in the 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.490
 ropes and I'm totally exhausted 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.810
 after last stretching exercises 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:40.030
 has to be adopted by team and I am 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.830
 really satisfied that was up 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.050
 every case the heart to training what i 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.250
 but I've participated so far 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.500
 super satisfied i feel right 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.730
 good because it was really fun next to 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.790
 the whole effort 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.920
 It was a cool troupe my conclusion is 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.300
 So I think boxing is part of the game 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.940
 a sport of the one for everyday life 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.090
 strengthens and therefore a great of me 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.020
 rating and finally nothing for 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.150
 Weichier and I'm not a sissy 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.670
 who wants to box thai himself but has 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.190
 thinks he is a sissy no problem 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:16.830
 you do not have to be fit before you come 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.830
 because you will get fit if we stay
