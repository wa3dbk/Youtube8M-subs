dryer<00:02:47.560> they're<00:02:48.010> not<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.370> expensive<00:02:49.230> my<00:02:50.230> blow

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
dryer they're not that expensive my blow

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.789 
dryer they're not that expensive my blow
dryer<00:02:50.769> was<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.340> 10<00:02:51.670> pounds<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.799> that's

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
dryer was like a 10 pounds so that's

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.550 
dryer was like a 10 pounds so that's
just<00:02:54.040> one<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.459> basic<00:02:54.910> things<00:02:54.940> I'd<00:02:55.330> say

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
just one of the basic things I'd say

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.960 
just one of the basic things I'd say
once<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.739> get<00:02:56.890> pick<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.250> drop<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.760> know<00:02:57.850> what

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
once you get pick and drop you know what

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.240 
once you get pick and drop you know what
pick<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.299> drop<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:59.019> basically<00:02:59.530> it's<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
pick and drop is and basically it's the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.520 
pick and drop is and basically it's the
hair<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.670> braided<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.450> then<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.780> stops<00:03:02.170> here

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
hair is braided and then it stops here

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.880 
hair is braided and then it stops here
the<00:03:03.310> third<00:03:03.519> pick<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.880> drop<00:03:03.970> because<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:05.019> think

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
the third pick and drop because I think

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130 
the third pick and drop because I think
I<00:03:05.980> look<00:03:06.130> young<00:03:06.400> with<00:03:06.670> braids<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.989> is

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
I look young with braids and this is

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.780 
I look young with braids and this is

drop extensions and this just works so
well<00:05:31.290> for<00:05:31.470> me<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:32.580> smells<00:05:32.910> gorgeous<00:05:33.210> and

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
well for me and it smells gorgeous and

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.370 
well for me and it smells gorgeous and
it's<00:05:34.770> just<00:05:35.130> it<00:05:35.760> makes<00:05:35.970> your<00:05:36.120> hair<00:05:36.300> more

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
it's just it makes your hair more

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.500 
it's just it makes your hair more
moisturize<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.770> every<00:05:38.160> time<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.030> have<00:05:39.210> any

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
moisturize and every time you have any

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.060 
moisturize and every time you have any
kind<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:39.870> style<00:05:40.080> you<00:05:40.500> should<00:05:40.530> always<00:05:40.740> try<00:05:41.010> and

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
kind of style you should always try and

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.770 
kind of style you should always try and
moisturize<00:05:41.580> your<00:05:41.729> scalp<00:05:42.030> and<00:05:42.300> this<00:05:42.510> is

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
moisturize your scalp and this is

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.650 
moisturize your scalp and this is
probably<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.860> most<00:05:44.340> handy<00:05:44.850> way<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:45.210> I<00:05:45.300> do<00:05:45.360> it

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
probably the most handy way that I do it

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.630 
probably the most handy way that I do it
other<00:05:46.169> people<00:05:46.350> choose<00:05:46.530> to<00:05:46.860> use<00:05:47.040> olive<00:05:47.280> oil

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
other people choose to use olive oil

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.000 
other people choose to use olive oil
spray<00:05:48.150> that's<00:05:48.390> also<00:05:48.780> very<00:05:48.990> good<00:05:49.140> spray<00:05:49.530> so

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
spray that's also very good spray so

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.529 
spray that's also very good spray so
just<00:05:50.310> have<00:05:50.460> my<00:05:50.580> hair<00:05:50.789> done<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:51.180> don't<00:05:51.360> really

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
just have my hair done I don't really

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.409 
just have my hair done I don't really
have<00:05:51.690> much<00:05:51.900> dirt<00:05:52.620> build-up<00:05:53.039> at<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.280> front<00:05:53.580> but

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
have much dirt build-up at the front but

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.420 
have much dirt build-up at the front but
that<00:05:54.930> will<00:05:55.140> eventually<00:05:55.650> come

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
that will eventually come

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.370 
that will eventually come
and<00:05:56.520> so<00:05:56.820> what<00:05:57.030> I<00:05:57.060> do<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:57.690> I<00:05:57.840> use<00:05:58.170> this

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
and so what I do is I use this

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.210 
and so what I do is I use this
alcohol-based<00:05:59.040> substance<00:05:59.970> and<00:06:00.420> I<00:06:00.870> use<00:06:01.260> cotton

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
alcohol-based substance and I use cotton

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.660 
alcohol-based substance and I use cotton
pads<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:03.030> what<00:06:03.810> I<00:06:03.840> do<00:06:03.960> is<00:06:04.230> I<00:06:04.320> just<00:06:04.560> clean<00:06:05.430> the

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
pads and what I do is I just clean the

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.030 
pads and what I do is I just clean the
front<00:06:06.000> of<00:06:06.210> it<00:06:06.420> and<00:06:06.660> literally<00:06:07.500> all<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.860> dirt

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
front of it and literally all the dirt

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.310 
front of it and literally all the dirt
comes<00:06:08.370> out<00:06:08.580> for<00:06:09.150> me<00:06:09.270> that's<00:06:09.480> my<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.750> best<00:06:10.080> way

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
comes out for me that's my the best way

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.490 
comes out for me that's my the best way
to<00:06:10.350> do<00:06:10.650> it<00:06:10.860> I<00:06:11.760> also<00:06:12.150> find<00:06:12.600> that<00:06:12.750> you<00:06:13.050> can<00:06:13.260> wash

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
to do it I also find that you can wash

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.890 
to do it I also find that you can wash
it<00:06:13.770> but<00:06:14.010> sometimes<00:06:14.340> your<00:06:15.150> hair<00:06:15.360> just<00:06:15.600> gets<00:06:15.750> a

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
it but sometimes your hair just gets a

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.720 
it but sometimes your hair just gets a
bit<00:06:15.930> messy<00:06:16.530> and<00:06:16.740> it's<00:06:17.340> just<00:06:17.490> too<00:06:17.580> much<00:06:17.610> work

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
bit messy and it's just too much work

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.550 
bit messy and it's just too much work
it's<00:06:18.240> just<00:06:18.360> for<00:06:18.840> me<00:06:18.930> it's<00:06:19.080> a<00:06:19.110> lot<00:06:19.290> more<00:06:19.410> easy

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
it's just for me it's a lot more easy

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.350 
it's just for me it's a lot more easy
just<00:06:19.830> to<00:06:19.950> get<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.220> cotton<00:06:20.520> pads<00:06:20.730> and<00:06:20.940> the

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
just to get the cotton pads and the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.180 
just to get the cotton pads and the
alcohol-based<00:06:21.810> substance<00:06:22.500> and<00:06:22.740> before<00:06:23.100> you

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
alcohol-based substance and before you
