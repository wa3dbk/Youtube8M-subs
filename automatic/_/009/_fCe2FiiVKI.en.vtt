00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
i think the multiplayer is really cool

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.880 
i think the multiplayer is really cool
so<00:02:56.130> i<00:02:56.160> might<00:02:56.610> get<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.270> that<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:58.140> next

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
