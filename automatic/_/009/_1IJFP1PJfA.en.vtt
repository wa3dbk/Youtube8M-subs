the seven year anniversary of Katrina
it's<00:00:07.560> pretty<00:00:07.890> ironic<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.490> we're<00:00:08.610> also

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
it's pretty ironic that we're also

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.910 
it's pretty ironic that we're also
dealing<00:00:09.090> with<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.690> hurricane<00:00:10.170> landfall<00:00:10.410> of

dealing with the hurricane landfall of

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.280 
dealing with the hurricane landfall of
Isaac<00:00:11.790> as<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.120> begins<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.480> move<00:00:12.719> into<00:00:13.139> the

Isaac as it begins to move into the
coastal<00:00:13.620> parishes<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.370> Plaquemines

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330

terrebonne and La Fouche it is quite

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.170 
terrebonne and La Fouche it is quite
common<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.890> center<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.160> hurricanes<00:00:20.820> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
common for the center of hurricanes to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.870 
common for the center of hurricanes to
deviate<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:22.109> multiple<00:00:22.710> directions<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:23.580> they

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
deviate in multiple directions as they

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.609 
deviate in multiple directions as they
start<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.269> interact<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> coastline<00:00:25.350> and

start to interact with the coastline and

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
start to interact with the coastline and
that<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.099> exactly<00:00:26.490> what<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.090> dealing<00:00:27.269> with

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that is exactly what we are dealing with

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.140 
that is exactly what we are dealing with
this<00:00:27.689> morning<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:28.650> Isaac<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.970> has<00:00:30.119> been

apparent west southwest motion but

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.760 
apparent west southwest motion but
overall<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.690> storm<00:00:36.899> should<00:00:37.170> continue<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
overall the storm should continue to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.500 
overall the storm should continue to
move<00:00:37.920> more<00:00:38.190> toward<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> west<00:00:38.760> north<00:00:38.969> west<00:00:39.210> or

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
move more toward the west north west or

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260 
move more toward the west north west or
Northwest<00:00:39.780> over<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> next<00:00:40.559> 24<00:00:40.920> hours<00:00:41.059> but<00:00:42.059> the

Northwest over the next 24 hours but the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.850 
Northwest over the next 24 hours but the
ford<00:00:42.510> motion<00:00:42.840> should<00:00:43.110> continue<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.620> be

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
ford motion should continue to be

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
ford motion should continue to be
relatively<00:00:44.190> slow<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:45.300> currently<00:00:45.660> moving

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
relatively slow it's currently moving

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.660 
relatively slow it's currently moving
west-northwest<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.680> seven<00:00:47.129> miles<00:00:47.280> per<00:00:47.430> hour

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
west-northwest at seven miles per hour

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.330 
west-northwest at seven miles per hour
so<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.660> addition<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.440> storm<00:00:49.680> surge<00:00:49.920> threat

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so in addition to the storm surge threat

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
so in addition to the storm surge threat
which<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.670> rather<00:00:50.879> high<00:00:51.180> right<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:51.480> there

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
which is rather high right now there

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.150 
which is rather high right now there
will<00:00:52.680> also<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.399> risk<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.820> inland<00:00:54.360> flooding

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
will also be the risk of inland flooding

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.680 
will also be the risk of inland flooding
however<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.399> main<00:00:56.550> risk<00:00:56.879> at<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.480> current

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
however the main risk at this current

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.869 
however the main risk at this current
hour<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> risk<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.859> deadly<00:00:59.309> storm<00:00:59.609> surge

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
hour is the risk of deadly storm surge

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.939

able to hold the waters back but that is

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.789 
able to hold the waters back but that is
certainly<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> concern<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.780> officials<00:01:19.530> down

and even at this current our it looks as

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.729 
and even at this current our it looks as
though<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.060> latest<00:02:15.390> observation<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.170> Paluxy

though the latest observation a Paluxy
is<00:02:16.950> starting<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> more<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.540> out<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.840> the

is starting to be a more so out of the
east-southeast<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:20.940> should<00:02:21.180> allow

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
east-southeast and so this should allow

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.119 
east-southeast and so this should allow
for<00:02:21.720> some<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.110> storm<00:02:22.410> surge<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.040> able

for some of the storm surge to be able

going to happen later on this morning so

extending<00:03:32.040> well<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.519> north<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.880> east<00:03:33.060> of

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
the center across Mississippi Alabama

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.280 
the center across Mississippi Alabama
and<00:03:35.549> even<00:03:36.239> possibly<00:03:36.599> as<00:03:36.780> far<00:03:36.989> east<00:03:37.019> as

Pensacola<00:03:38.209> already<00:03:39.209> over<00:03:39.569> 300,000<00:03:40.530> people

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650

Pensacola already over 300,000 people
are<00:03:41.069> without<00:03:41.280> power<00:03:41.489> across<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.510> state<00:03:42.720> of

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.140 
are without power across the state of
Louisiana<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:44.190> think<00:03:44.459> those<00:03:44.579> numbers<00:03:44.970> will

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
Louisiana and I think those numbers will

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.569 
Louisiana and I think those numbers will
drastically<00:03:45.540> rise<00:03:46.169> within<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.829> next<00:03:47.099> day<00:03:47.370> as

those hurricane-force wind gusts do

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.949 
those hurricane-force wind gusts do
