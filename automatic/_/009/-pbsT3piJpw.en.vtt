live view back to the viewfinder now we

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.080 
live view back to the viewfinder now we
did<00:03:12.750> use<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.350> on<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.920> a77<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.790> found<00:03:14.940> that

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
did use it on the a77 and we found that

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.180 
did use it on the a77 and we found that
it<00:03:15.210> lagged<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.630> lot<00:03:15.810> but<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.320> a99<00:03:16.740> it<00:03:16.980> seems

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
it lagged a lot but on the a99 it seems

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.030 
it lagged a lot but on the a99 it seems
to<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.460> doing<00:03:17.610> just<00:03:17.880> about<00:03:18.570> right<00:03:18.990> so<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.890> can
