 got up early to watch 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.860
 cartoons before school and you were born 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.690
 after those glorious times 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.149
 from a young age watch video bloggers on 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.980
 youtube these two things are so far from each other 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.360
 friend but at the same time so similar 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.970
 youtube or TV let's figure it out 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.370
 history the first televisions appeared in 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.899
 America in the thirties of the 20th century and were 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.270
 great rarity at that time people 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.980
 looked at them as a curiosity about them 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.840
 showed films and broadcasts from 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.030
 activities with time this little 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.250
 cinema became available not only to the elite 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.000
 society and soon stood almost in 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.890
 every home 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.079
 television has become part of people's lives 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.479
 the scheme was going before him in the evenings 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.740
 watched movies news concerts 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.869
 sports programs 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.670
 American broadcasters tracked 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.920
 interests of the audience and always tried 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.420
 give them what they don't want don't forget 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.030
 at the same time promote interests 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.450
 state continued until 2005 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.760
 of the year 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.260
 and then youtube appeared and started 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.390
 slowly entice young 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.250
 TV viewers to their side first 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.970
 videos on YouTube couldn't boast 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.680
 quality 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.330
 it was just downloaded 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.189
 user amateur videos 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.960
 Of course such content could not 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.119
 compete with television on 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.100
 which showed programs and shows shot 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.080
 professional but why tv 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.909
 still was the main means of leisure 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.400
 for lovers of something to see but here 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.290
 2010 comes in Russia appear 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.390

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.549
 which views by the way are active 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.670
 invite you to the show but it looks like 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.549
 strange and then you yourself know the reviews 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.759
 school games video viral videos 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.560
 bleeds play in the log for some 5 years we 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.360
 so accustomed to all this that even 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.810
 I do not remember when the last time included 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.810

 will see the transfer for housewives in the keys 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.050
 after a couple of hours and stumble upon 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.690
 cartoons for children and in the evening necessarily 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.670
 show scandalous talk show what's going on 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.740
 at night I never knew could 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.340
 see out seems twisted some old 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.110
 films 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.030
 TV schedule specifically 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.590
 composed in such a way that the target 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.020
 the audience was at home at the beginning 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.580
 got in and could see him but 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.690
 watch the show on tv and not 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.850
 skip a single series 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.800
 it's some kind of magic impossible to live 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.660
 on TV schedule for him 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.300
 have to adapt if you want 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.310
 keep track of all the ups and downs of the plot on 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.810
 youtube videos are uploaded by users 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.090
 and it doesn't matter if the viewer is ordinary 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.890
 published their sit-arounds in the kitchen with

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.800
 time when it is convenient for him weighty 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.050
 advantage however the opportunity to choose 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.450
 any video limits getting new 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.430
 previously unknown information switching 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.840
 channels on the tv we could always accidentally 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.910
 stumbled upon an interesting show 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.769
 which we are unlikely to watch 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.700
 would become but what you can leave 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.430
 video on pause 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.320

 eagerly awaited advertising on tv 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.430
 to go to the kitchen for a sandwich 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.830
 only so tele could put 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.110
 to pause and then briefly and on yutyube 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.280
 just try inserting video ads and 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.680
 will start jumped and hid different 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.739
 formats you went out on the main channels 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.080
 always made a high-quality room decorations 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.940
 viewers many cameras aimed at 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.950
 program participants and before 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.660
 broadcast another issue in 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.600
 the frame is serious work on 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.280
 preparing for it is written the script 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.620
 The theme of make-up artist and costume designers 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.690
 prepares content-leading content for 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.299
 televisions are done by professionals and then 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.100
 what they do generously sponsored exactly 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.650
 so on TV we can see 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.340
 nice picture and what this can 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.019
 counter blogger with youtube 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.640
 many YouTube videos are filmed on 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.799
 ordinary amateur camera 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.019
 but or on iphone at best on 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.000
 SLR and for recording you tv play or 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.889
 movie reviews don't even need this 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.169
 only a microphone will be enough 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.210
 bandikama the quality of these videos is like 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.520
 the authors did not try hard in many ways 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.380
 inferior to stm programs but despite 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.000
 This video on youtube use where 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.470
 in high demand among young audiences

 what's the secret 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.850
 our favorite video bloggers are always with us 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.470
 on the same wavelength they communicate with us in 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.810
 comments speak simple 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.760
 language and even record video responses to 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.290
 questions for us as you can 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.330
 imagine that on telly 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.910
 turn on that evening in the first channel 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.400
 atom ivan urgant sits his room with 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.690
 camera on your outstretched hand and telling 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.430
 something about television 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.229
 although it would be interesting prospects 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.880
 ask any young man when 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.130
 you last watched tv and 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.960
 see how he tries in vain to remember 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.669
 before the internet completely replaced 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.190
 television now its mostly 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.600
 only older people watch 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.580
 perfectly aware of this broadcaster 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.070
 working hard to develop their 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.810
 sites and download entire releases of gear 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.820
 on youtube that's where they use 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.800
 certain demand but it is only 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.270
 temporary measure because your format 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.639
 programs in the form in which it is 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.740
 now it is gradually becoming new
