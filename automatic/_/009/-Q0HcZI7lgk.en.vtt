00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
will bulk up for the winter even though

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.029 
will bulk up for the winter even though
we<00:01:27.420> don't<00:01:27.600> go<00:01:27.720> into<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> full-blown<00:01:28.350> winter

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
we don't go into a full-blown winter

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.120 
we don't go into a full-blown winter
pattern<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.960> does<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.320> still<00:01:31.619> bulk<00:01:31.860> up

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
pattern here does they still bulk up

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.999 
pattern here does they still bulk up
they<00:01:32.460> still<00:01:33.030> store<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.630> food<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.860> we're

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
they still store up on food so we're

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
they still store up on food so we're
gonna<00:01:35.100> throw<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.460> we're<00:01:35.729> gonna<00:01:35.850> pitch<00:01:36.750> this

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
gonna throw this we're gonna pitch this

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.530 
gonna throw this we're gonna pitch this
time<00:01:37.140> than<00:01:37.320> half<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.590> inch<00:01:37.650> worm<00:01:38.420> along<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
time than half an inch worm along the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
time than half an inch worm along the
river<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.280> we'll<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.579> what

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
river here and we'll just see what

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.200 
river here and we'll just see what
happens

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
happens

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.899 
happens
maybe<00:01:42.930> they'll<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.430> not

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
maybe they'll actually get it and not

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.480 
maybe they'll actually get it and not
just<00:01:45.149> play<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.079> mrs.<00:01:46.710> white<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.340> one

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
just play with it mrs. white that one

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460 
just play with it mrs. white that one
did<00:01:47.780> they<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:48.840> want<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> give<00:01:49.170> him<00:01:49.229> free

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
did they don't want to give him free

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:02.250 
did they don't want to give him free
strikes<00:01:49.770> cuz<00:01:50.009> three<00:01:50.220> strikes<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.670> your<00:01:50.820> house

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:16.480 

oh<00:02:10.080> he's<00:02:11.080> little

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:30.020 

but<00:02:17.060> he<00:02:17.150> ate<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:21.100> we<00:02:22.100> choke<00:02:22.460> that<00:02:22.670> thing

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.100 

he's<00:02:31.030> little<00:02:31.390> bit<00:02:31.660> heated

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
he's little bit heated

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.290 
he's little bit heated
just<00:02:33.100> because<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.520> throw<00:02:33.730> on<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> ten<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.270> a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
just because you throw on a ten and a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.000 
just because you throw on a ten and a
half<00:02:34.420> inch<00:02:34.720> worm<00:02:35.020> it's<00:02:35.230> not<00:02:35.380> gonna<00:02:35.530> exclude

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
half inch worm it's not gonna exclude

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.750 
half inch worm it's not gonna exclude
you<00:02:36.400> from<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.670> smaller<00:02:36.970> fish<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.490> really

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
you from the smaller fish but I really

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.270 
you from the smaller fish but I really
think<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.330> going<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.750> increase<00:02:44.280> your

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
think it is going to increase your

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:58.150 
think it is going to increase your
chances<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.880> getting<00:02:45.940> bigger<00:02:46.390> fish

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.920 

now<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.700> probably<00:03:00.000> won't<00:03:00.180> catch<00:03:00.420> many<00:03:00.720> much

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
now you probably won't catch many much

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.410 
now you probably won't catch many much
smaller<00:03:01.350> than<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.710> one<00:03:05.120> which<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.270> you're

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
smaller than that one which if you're

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.000 
smaller than that one which if you're
fishing<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.780> tournament<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.380> okay<00:03:07.710> there's<00:03:07.950> a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
fishing a tournament is okay there's a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:30.699 
fishing a tournament is okay there's a
majority<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.820> fishermen<00:03:09.480> catch<00:03:10.490> keepers

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:39.970 

oh<00:03:32.920> it's<00:03:33.920> a<00:03:34.069> giant<00:03:38.620> remember<00:03:39.620> I<00:03:39.650> said<00:03:39.890> before

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
oh it's a giant remember I said before

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.830 
oh it's a giant remember I said before

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
bad not much smaller yeah he can get

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.420 
bad not much smaller yeah he can get
smaller

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.789 

he<00:03:46.430> thought<00:03:46.730> he<00:03:47.090> was<00:03:47.239> bigger<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:50.599> big<00:03:50.810> one<00:03:51.109> the
