00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 a good friend asked me if I should go 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 his taxi hedge would come to look for you 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.360
 it wasn't that busy 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.080
 and is not difficult in two cases 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 that your mistake is one 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.800
 they would be well fertilized with 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.949
 an organic fertilizer 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.920
 as one and they should also be good 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.380
 be pruned of which is now the big one 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.279
 look wrong here you see above 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.980
 wider than at the bottom and why is there 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.469
 miss it for the very simple reason that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.110
 the light is not good to the bottom of cancer 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.410
 a she gradually 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.010
 the bottom of the likes is like us 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.960
 pruning then we mainly go this morning 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.960
 lots away you see 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:00.510
 So we go indeed reverse 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.510
 they like breakers than above 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.950
 now you will say she will be at the top 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.380
 anyway bald now basically you can yew 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.810
 until pruning on the stems then takes 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.000
 a year two years for them to be really beautiful 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.620
 and hedge will form but sometimes it is 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.470
 necessary if it has really become too wide 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.350
 that you watch out with toxic insight 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.030
 taxis in all parts toxic except 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.350
 flesh of the berries but forget 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.360
 grandmother 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.840
 she is always toxic and she is especially 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.270
 toxic crazy enough for horses 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.030
 so in addition to a few the we never one 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 yew hedge plan something that is toxic 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.759
 is often also a medicine and so you can 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.509
 you usually do after mid-June 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.520
 prunings of yew entry 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.040
 on the internet you will certainly find your good there 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.330
 addresses for because then taxol sees 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.280
 already a toxic substance in texas and taxol 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.640
 that is a very good one 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.970
 anti-cancer drug 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.610
 had no fish can also be very useful 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.780
 uses avento 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.950
 but again we put them at the top 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.930
 narrower tapered pruning 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.930
 we call that and I will continue with it now
