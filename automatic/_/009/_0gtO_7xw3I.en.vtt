00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
this one was 1760 and I think theirs is

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.449 
this one was 1760 and I think theirs is
probably<00:03:17.880> over<00:03:18.180> 28<00:03:18.870> 23<00:03:19.410> yeah<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.100> it's<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.340> few

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
probably over 28 23 yeah so it's a few

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.150 
probably over 28 23 yeah so it's a few
dollars<00:03:20.610> cheaper<00:03:20.910> but<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.989> quality<00:03:22.709> isn't<00:03:22.860> as

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
dollars cheaper but the quality isn't as

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.280 
dollars cheaper but the quality isn't as
soft<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:24.060> was<00:03:24.239> brandy<00:03:24.510> melville<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.930> don't<00:03:25.110> think

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
soft I was brandy melville I don't think

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.900 
soft I was brandy melville I don't think
like<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:25.650> still<00:03:25.860> pretty<00:03:26.070> soft<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:26.549> it's<00:03:26.760> not

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
like it's still pretty soft but it's not

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.229 
like it's still pretty soft but it's not
as<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:28.260> not<00:03:28.350> as<00:03:28.530> soft<00:03:29.160> as<00:03:29.519> brandy<00:03:29.940> so

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
as like it's not as soft as brandy so

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.449 
as like it's not as soft as brandy so
but<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.049> don't<00:03:31.200> work<00:03:31.470> yeah<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.040> it's<00:03:32.130> cheaper

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
but it don't work yeah and it's cheaper

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.690 
but it don't work yeah and it's cheaper
so<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.730> guess<00:03:32.940> for<00:03:33.390> Less<00:03:34.170> softness<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.459> spend

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
so I guess for Less softness you spend

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.789 
so I guess for Less softness you spend
less<00:03:35.790> money<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.049> last<00:03:37.260> place<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.560> we're

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
less money and the last place that we're

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.110 
less money and the last place that we're
going<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.980> show<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.519> video<00:03:38.700> is

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
going to show you in this video is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.390 
going to show you in this video is
actually<00:03:39.350> something<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.530> we<00:03:40.620> both<00:03:40.859> got<00:03:41.100> sent

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
actually something that we both got sent

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.160 
actually something that we both got sent
to<00:03:41.459> us<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.030> we<00:03:42.150> figured<00:03:42.480> we<00:03:42.630> would<00:03:42.750> split<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.109> up

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
to us so we figured we would split it up

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.569 
to us so we figured we would split it up
between<00:03:43.230> both<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.769> our<00:03:43.890> videos<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.400> show<00:03:44.519> you
