00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.900
 the only light that you can control and is 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.849
 indispensable to do so to obtain 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.580
 desired decorative results in your 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.650
 home is the artificial one unlike 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.590
 the natural one obviously with lighting 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.419
 appropriate create environments and aids 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.670
 define the activities that you develop 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.800
 in different areas of your home not 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.439
 It's the same light you need to 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.449
 work and not hurt your sight that stops 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.730
 a TV room that allows you to see 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.830
 ok the screen in the dining room by 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.480
 example the ideal is to have a source that 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.670
 garment over the table and that the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.949
 illuminate can be one or several lamps 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.799
 It depends on the style and size of the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.199
 dining room should not be too low for 

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:47.659
 do not impede a good conversation between 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.059
 the guests and they have to be a design 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.850
 that does not bother the eye on the other hand 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.890
 in the room the ideal is a lamp 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.379
 central to give general lighting 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.720
 and better if you have a good design 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.790
 You can also combine it with some 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.530
 other luminaries that create a climate more 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.780
 nice and that you can be 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.520
 driving in the workplace is 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.140
 convenient to have a general light for 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.300
 all the environment that allows you to work 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.220
 without straining the view 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.410
 in the reading areas you can 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.570
 accompany them with additional lights 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.410
 nothing but original design 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.420
 we have general light here and in the kitchen 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.830
 additional light that does not bother the eye 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.280
 in the areas of manipulation of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.280
 food the stove or washing is 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.010
 also the natural light to which you can 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.160
 invite you to be part of your house you can 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.380
 manipulate opening closing or opening 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.500
 windows and spaces in general with 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.680
 glasses and chairs curtains walls and 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.930
 other elements and eye I say manipulate 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.900
 but never control like the artificial 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.480
 and as they say good lighting 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.480
 you should not see yourself but feel
