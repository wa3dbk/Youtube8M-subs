00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
I still like it from it looks to spite

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.679 
I still like it from it looks to spite
the<00:01:20.460> fact<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.700> has<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> true<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.270> trigger<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the fact that has a true for trigger and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.190 
the fact that has a true for trigger and
finger<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:23.220> true<00:01:24.030> trigger<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.840> handle

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
finger or a true trigger and you handle

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.399 
finger or a true trigger and you handle
that's<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.680> meant<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.890> say<00:01:25.979> finger<00:01:26.729> ah

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
that's what I meant to say finger ah

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.649 
that's what I meant to say finger ah
alright<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> fact<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.270> even<00:01:30.479> though

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
alright so I the fact that even though

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.450 
alright so I the fact that even though
shoots<00:01:30.930> disks<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.590> still<00:01:31.829> pretty<00:01:31.979> cool

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
