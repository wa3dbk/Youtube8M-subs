00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
so now I'm hitting for a little bit more

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:08.710 
so now I'm hitting for a little bit more
damage<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:05.360> was<00:02:05.540> my<00:02:05.750> thought<00:02:07.450> career

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
damage that was my thought career

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:20.460 
damage that was my thought career
bring<00:02:09.020> me<00:02:09.200> my<00:02:09.380> items<00:02:17.950> deny<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.220> sucker<00:02:19.520> this

bring me my items deny that sucker this

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.500 
bring me my items deny that sucker this
surprisingly<00:02:21.470> having<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.160> range<00:02:22.940> creeps<00:02:23.300> as

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
surprisingly having to range creeps as

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.550 
surprisingly having to range creeps as
opposed<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.900> one<00:02:24.170> actually<00:02:25.120> significantly

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
opposed to one actually significantly

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.780 
opposed to one actually significantly
increases<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.590> amount<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:28.010> damage<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.700> it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
increases the amount of damage and it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.140 
increases the amount of damage and it
makes<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.120> quite<00:02:29.480> difficult<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.670> last<00:02:31.880> hit

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
makes it quite difficult to the last hit

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:46.800 
makes it quite difficult to the last hit
it's<00:02:32.930> actually<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> pain<00:02:33.440> in<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.590> ass

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.780 

just<00:02:47.410> get<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.770> over<00:02:47.980> with<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.430> little<00:02:48.459> bit

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
just get this over with a little bit

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:08.570 
just get this over with a little bit
faster<00:02:54.630> agreed

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:16.990 

my<00:03:09.210> sentiments<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:10.050> well

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.970 

so<00:03:17.570> be<00:03:17.780> it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.990 

forward

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.089 

silent<00:03:32.000> as<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.330> mist

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
so again pretty much the stacking damage

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.190 
so again pretty much the stacking damage
so<00:03:40.349> that<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.500> hit<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> bird<00:03:41.310> even<00:03:41.849> more<00:03:42.330> speaking

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
