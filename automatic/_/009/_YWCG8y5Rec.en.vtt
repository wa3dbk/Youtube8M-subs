00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
all off if this is a project I'm trying

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.550 
all off if this is a project I'm trying
to<00:00:14.250> get<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.429> control<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:15.049> but<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.170> got<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.410> come

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
to get in control of but we got to come

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560 
to get in control of but we got to come
up<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.710> ideas<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:18.180> looks<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.510> would

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
up with ideas and I looks like it would

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.090 
up with ideas and I looks like it would
be<00:00:18.630> kind<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.990> cool<00:00:19.199> than<00:00:19.470> some<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> West

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
be kind of cool than some of the West

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.769 
be kind of cool than some of the West
Coast<00:00:20.369> YouTube<00:00:20.760> guys<00:00:21.000> work<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:21.900> it's

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.859 

but<00:00:27.779> basically<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.849> Pirtle<00:00:30.390> winery

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
but basically this is it's Pirtle winery

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.240 
but basically this is it's Pirtle winery
it's<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.439> part<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.800> wine<00:00:31.980> cellar

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
but we're also looking at doing a bunker

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.060 
but we're also looking at doing a bunker
or<00:00:36.540> bunker<00:00:37.020> style<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> we've<00:00:40.980> got

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
or bunker style on it and so we've got

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.690 
or bunker style on it and so we've got
to<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.430> some<00:00:41.670> sort<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> big<00:00:42.590> monolithic

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
to do is some sort of a big monolithic

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.110 
to do is some sort of a big monolithic
steel<00:00:44.700> door<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> hillside<00:00:46.260> type<00:00:46.590> thing<00:00:47.120> I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
steel door in the hillside type thing I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.020 
steel door in the hillside type thing I
can<00:00:48.809> handle<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.649> welding<00:00:50.190> work<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
can handle the the welding work on that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.380 
can handle the the welding work on that
I<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.600> handle<00:00:51.840> metal<00:00:52.140> fabrication<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.920> that

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
I can handle metal fabrication on that

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.510 
I can handle metal fabrication on that
what<00:00:54.390> we're<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.840> looking<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
what we're going to be looking for is to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.319 
what we're going to be looking for is to
have<00:00:56.960> full<00:00:57.960> winemaking<00:00:58.829> facility<00:00:59.520> inside<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
have full winemaking facility inside and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.399 
have full winemaking facility inside and
then<00:01:00.420> storage<00:01:00.899> racks<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:02.660> but<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.320> know

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
then storage racks and but that you know

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.660 
then storage racks and but that you know
would<00:01:04.559> involve<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.129> bit<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> plumbing

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
would involve a little bit of plumbing

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.969 
would involve a little bit of plumbing
which<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:06.570> he'll<00:01:06.720> specialize<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
which I think he'll specialize in and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.640 
which I think he'll specialize in and
you<00:01:08.520> know<00:01:08.610> work<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> project<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.720> I'm

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you know work on the project but I'm

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.980 
you know work on the project but I'm
gonna<00:01:11.070> shoot<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> video<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
we've got an opportunity on this capsule

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.289 
we've got an opportunity on this capsule
project<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:28.500> carry<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.250> forward<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.820> our<00:01:30.000> end

container quasi bunker or cellar thing
the<00:01:38.070> added<00:01:38.850> aspect<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.350> has<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.070> be

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the added aspect of this is it has to be

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.810 
the added aspect of this is it has to be
kind<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.420> medieval<00:01:42.930> fantasy<00:01:43.350> style<00:01:44.070> artwork

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
kind of a medieval fantasy style artwork

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.929 
kind of a medieval fantasy style artwork
aspect<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.460> we're<00:01:47.460> looking<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.909> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
aspect to it so we're looking for a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.609 
aspect to it so we're looking for a
little<00:01:48.090> bit<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.329> self<00:01:48.570> sufficiency<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.380> here

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
little bit of self sufficiency in here

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.200 
little bit of self sufficiency in here
right<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.520> being<00:01:50.729> used<00:01:50.909> for

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
right now it's being used for

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.139 
right now it's being used for
construction<00:01:51.689> storage<00:01:52.820> but<00:01:53.820> we'll<00:01:54.030> be

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
construction storage but we'll be

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.810 
construction storage but we'll be
looking<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:54.689> some<00:01:54.840> ideas<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.619> us

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
looking for some ideas on us

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.680 
looking for some ideas on us
I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:58.230> I<00:01:58.970> think<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.510> of<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
I think I think this is one of the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.750 
I think I think this is one of the
doorframes<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.680> made<00:02:02.100> or<00:02:02.520> bought

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
doorframes that was made or bought

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.610 
doorframes that was made or bought
somewhere<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.480> they<00:02:03.570> decided<00:02:03.930> not<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> use<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
somewhere and they decided not to use it

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.500 
somewhere and they decided not to use it
or<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.070> use<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.490> I'm<00:02:05.790> gonna<00:02:06.120> end

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
or going to use it but I I'm gonna end

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.440 
or going to use it but I I'm gonna end
up<00:02:06.750> using<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.350> doorframe<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.130> think<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:09.000> on

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
up using that doorframe I think on on
