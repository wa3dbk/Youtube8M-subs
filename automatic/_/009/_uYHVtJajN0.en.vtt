00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.990
 I'll show you a night here 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.880
 Zwo grief 5 TDI me so this Togo 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.379
 Odil 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.379
 the special thing about the vehicle is that's percent 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.879
 with hydrogen betrayal 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.089
 but not completely with should hydrogen but 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.869
 Hydrogen Dr 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.369
 was produced directly on board 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.480
 does not need to be stored 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 but only doctors and is produced 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.630
 because it is needed 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 the electrolysis cell is in the trunk 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.980
 in the back 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 Lindenthal 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 9 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.090
 so misses the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.290
 Electric these cells 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 It starts to work when the engine is started 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.670
 to the right 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.210
 the corresponding water tank with 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 only the popular in the water 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.119
 integrated percent occupies where to solve these water level messages 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540
 Photo Marieke Kregel good about Mandic valve 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.750
 and we want 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.750
 the Electronic 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.150
 we see the tubes above 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.110
 over the hoses becomes the hydrogen 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080
 led forward 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.220
 and correspond 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.220
 I want at the intake manifold 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.220
 the fashion too 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.400
 we see the engine has started now 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400
 and the electrolysis cell start to work 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 That will be possible 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.240
 it would be good survey and produce more opium or fed 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.400
 shall be 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.880
 around the savings and even 30 percent 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 so calculate 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.080
 that's how it will be when you are short 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080
 forward into the engine compartment 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 where the man is during Westerwelle 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.269
 Bushels rise 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.269
 it is significantly reduced 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.539
 she allows the 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.559
 v that will 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.449
 and that if we are here now 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.449
 see more 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.329
 we see from the outbreak 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.639
 wanted to do this 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.639
 but they do not break loose 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.579
 Great US Bank Her Movie 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.729
 Percent arises but 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.729
 What we have 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.639
 now it's stuck again we hold a piece of white paper Windtner 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.639
 were 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.909
 So you can see 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.219
 the blood is not even black 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:55.149
 nothing at all 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.589
 the potters would be gracing 0 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.959
 the Hartz IV values ​​as other toxic substances 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.919
 Today, they are adorned with hydrogen 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.559
 to zero 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.919
 and the co2 value would adorn itself 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.799
 so fuel the sweet savings from the crash gate so 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.299
 and that's what happened because they're good 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.249
 with Oliver Zille 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.289
 Photo p in the product areas 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.309
 the electrolysis cell 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:33.519
 works as long as the engine is running 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.759
 and was happy accordingly 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.449
 again 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.250
 the food 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.090
 like right now 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.090
 if the engine 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.159
 was made 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.590
 right 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.000
 on the line so here to the water 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.319
 are also a setback in the title fight 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.539
 that is necessary to 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.669
 build the pressure around the neck of the turbocharger 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.169
 not to let go to the water tank
