00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
was unbelievable just the amount of

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.019 
was unbelievable just the amount of
information<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:23.130> there<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.850> actually

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
information that's there and I actually

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.170 
information that's there and I actually
learned<00:00:24.300> something<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.859> here

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
learned something on this this one here

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.179 
learned something on this this one here
this<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.689> Neil<00:00:28.199> van<00:00:28.410> Niekerk<00:00:28.800> showed<00:00:29.039> me

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
this here Neil van Niekerk showed me

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.550 
this here Neil van Niekerk showed me
this<00:00:29.310> little<00:00:29.490> technique<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.050> he

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
this little technique here this is he

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.319 
this little technique here this is he
calls<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.920> black<00:00:32.130> thing<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.730> literally

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
calls it the black thing and literally

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.630 
calls it the black thing and literally
all<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> piece<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.200> neoprene<00:00:34.640> black

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
all it is is a piece of neoprene black

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.889 
all it is is a piece of neoprene black
neoprene<00:00:36.260> it<00:00:37.260> she's<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
neoprene it she's going up up up and

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.840 
neoprene it she's going up up up and
it's<00:00:39.899> got<00:00:40.170> two<00:00:40.680> hair<00:00:40.950> bands<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.399> holding<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
it's got two hair bands on it holding it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.270 
it's got two hair bands on it holding it
on<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.239> they<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.660> pulled<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:42.989> over<00:00:43.110> ok<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
on and they just pulled it over ok but

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.639 
on and they just pulled it over ok but
what<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.550> does<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.329> when<00:00:46.110> you're<00:00:46.260> bouncing

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
what this does is when you're bouncing

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.010 
what this does is when you're bouncing
your<00:00:46.680> flash<00:00:46.950> around<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.820> keeps<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
your flash around it keeps it out of

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.959 
your flash around it keeps it out of
other<00:00:49.230> people<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> eyes<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.850> you're

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
other people the eyes so like if you're

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.490 
other people the eyes so like if you're
standing<00:00:51.210> next<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> mother<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
standing next to like the mother the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.930 
standing next to like the mother the
bride<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> you're<00:00:52.980> shooting<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> bridegroom

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
bride and you're shooting the bridegroom

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.500 
bride and you're shooting the bridegroom
it<00:00:54.809> keeps<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.770> away<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.129> her<00:00:56.969> eyes<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.420> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it keeps it away from her eyes so it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.930 
it keeps it away from her eyes so it
doesn't<00:00:57.809> bounce<00:00:57.899> into<00:00:58.199> her<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.820> I'm

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
doesn't bounce into her so but what I'm

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.369 
doesn't bounce into her so but what I'm
here<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> talk<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.899> little<00:01:01.230> bit

here to talk to you about a little bit

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.750 
here to talk to you about a little bit
is<00:01:02.149> how<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> use<00:01:03.780> bounce<00:01:04.199> light<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:05.070> fill<00:01:05.640> your

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is how to use bounce light to fill your

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.870 
is how to use bounce light to fill your
images<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> let<00:01:08.040> me<00:01:08.130> put<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
images so let me put this on here to the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.320 
images so let me put this on here to the
camera<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.240> show<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.119> little

camera and show you and just a little

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.950 
camera and show you and just a little
bit<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.869> lighting<00:01:14.720> basically<00:01:15.720> there's

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
bit about lighting basically there's

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
bit about lighting basically there's
three<00:01:16.200> types<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.740> light<00:01:16.890> you've<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.220> broad

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
three types of light you've got broad

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.210 
three types of light you've got broad
light<00:01:17.939> short<00:01:18.600> light<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.020> flat<00:01:19.590> light<00:01:19.799> that's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
light short light and flat light that's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.920 
light short light and flat light that's
kind<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> three<00:01:20.880> sort<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.479> portrait

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
kind of the three sort of portrait

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
kind of the three sort of portrait
lights<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.619> broad<00:01:23.280> lighting<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.670> basically

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
lights so broad lighting is basically

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880 
lights so broad lighting is basically
like<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.780> were<00:01:24.960> three<00:01:25.200> cores<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> camera

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
like if I'm were three cores the camera

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.440 
like if I'm were three cores the camera
you're<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> light<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> broad<00:01:27.180> side<00:01:27.390> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you're going to light the broad side of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.179 
you're going to light the broad side of
the<00:01:27.570> face<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.140> broad<00:01:28.380> lighting<00:01:28.770> short

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the face so that's broad lighting short

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
the face so that's broad lighting short
lighting<00:01:29.549> I'm<00:01:29.810> three-quarters<00:01:30.810> camera<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
lighting I'm three-quarters camera you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.020 
lighting I'm three-quarters camera you
would<00:01:31.680> light<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.130> short<00:01:32.549> side<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> face

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
would light the short side of the face

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
would light the short side of the face
so<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.659> shadow<00:01:33.900> side<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.380> light<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.890> site

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so the shadow side you light this site

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
so the shadow side you light this site
and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.579> flatlining<00:01:36.000> obviously<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and then flatlining obviously is to the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.870 
and then flatlining obviously is to the
face<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.270> pretend<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.840> are<00:01:40.880> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
face so I'm going to pretend you are the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.240 
face so I'm going to pretend you are the
subject<00:01:42.119> I'm<00:01:42.420> lighting<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.350> what<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.130> going

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
subject I'm lighting so what I'm going

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.819 
subject I'm lighting so what I'm going
to<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:45.420> se<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:46.110> pan<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.590> here

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
to do and if se you can pan up here

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.020
