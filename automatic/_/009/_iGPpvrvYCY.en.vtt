00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.010
 try to persuade jurors to take a 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.560
 Good note, how is it?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.640
 very light in the mouth 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.239
 contracted in which also the court 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.160
 that book also david book affinity 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.989
 with the horse is also very important 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.300
 important a good animal center 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.700
 if you have not you will not have to 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.500
 sunken a horse is already only the fifth 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.110
 national level is so much more difficult to 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.640
 champion on the track has noticed 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.660
 over that time with each passing year 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.700
 it gets harder 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.400
 osmar goes on evolving opinion is just going 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.780
 evolving there also becomes more difficult 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400
 my tenth national for me is a 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.709
 privilege to be here working as the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.019
