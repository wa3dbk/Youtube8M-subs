00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.290
 so it's true that the lady of 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.390
 brassempouy she is so all 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.410
 books everyone knows the face 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.670
 but nobody knows the village 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.470
 many imagine that the lady of 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.090
 brassempouy she is in dordogne and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.350
 it's true that the scale that the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.640
 site for a few years with the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 creation of the lady's house and then 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.590
 today from the bow and to the park the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.570
 will in fact she is to have the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.370
 tools to bring audiences back to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.280
 brassempouy develop the site and the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.170
 to develop the image of the village and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.220
 the lady will have to cents this house so 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.870
 twelve years later she went well 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.180
 developed she needed a 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 complement of activity allowing 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.090
 receive school groups from 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.220
 family recreation centers 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.690
 so it's true that families 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.040
 groups of children will find their 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.559
 account with all that is workshops 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.140
 activities related to prehistory 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.399
 but for adults especially 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.780
 the elderly is a parent who 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.460
 will allow to wander war 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.870
 panels to discover the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.190
 digital applications so that's 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.309
 finally part is addressed to all 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.309
 public 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.250
 not happy 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.439
 as you said the president 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.659
 and it's basically the d it's true that 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.820
 culture and tourism owns on this tempo 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.190
 a major asset and the rights site 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.509
 cndd and if I brought in the staff 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.360
 it's because the first of things 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.220
 that I want to do and that I have to do 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.659
 it's to emphasize their commitment to 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.960
 have participated in recent days in 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.909
 preparations for this day it is necessary that 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.159
 everyone is aware that beyond 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.060
 of what they are asked they are animated 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.670
 of a passion 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.880
 so they understood that they were at 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.649
 startup and a nice operation they 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.049
 accepted the challenge but they accepted 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.090
 beyond her asking them what they 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.369
 do their free time to create you 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 little clips here they are always a 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.590
 far from the challenges ahead 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.030
 they are not afraid to get dirty this morning 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.870
 for you to go pick up drifts 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.769
 I want to thank you on behalf of the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.569
 community of communes thank you very much 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.519
 the will actually the department 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.989
 today is to bring back 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.890
 collections that were discovered in 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.560
 the 1980s and 2004s by the teams 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.840
 led by henri delporte then dominique 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.070
 gambier franÃ§ois board so the idea is 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.930
 that these collections that went to 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.870
 saint-germain-en-laye may return 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.549
 in the moors be conditioned to study 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.630
 and actually serve for a whole bunch of 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.400
 scientific publications 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.720
 the brassens caves where they were 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.000
 searched in the 19th century 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.680
 in the 20th century today excavations 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.780
 are interrupted but there is still 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.150
 archaeological levels to search 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.290
 so to study the names we know and we 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
 currently works at the moment 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.390
 on the return of researchers on brassens 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.390
 wire rack 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.459
 that's the mark if it's also the 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.849
 heaven the pyrite to have cassis from the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.319
 killing in both cases you go 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.049
 to arrive we will provide you with a tablet 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.299
 digital that will allow you to already 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.640
 bli but especially especially the totems 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.129
 and so inquire and of course 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.099
 some points on the fire the tools the 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.950
 climate etc and then well you're going 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.319
 have an application that will tell you 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.090
 here is she hours workshop fire workshop 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.709
 trimmings and so you can come with 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.450
 your children and you even try yourself 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.660
 different techniques of 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.660
 prehistory 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.129
 I simply do not have the 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.950
 project in fact of the lady's house 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.700
 which is which interested me enormously 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.609
 I had almost worked 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.120
 previously in another arched at 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.069
 park that is more implanted because 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.690
 much older is precisely this 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.970
 which interested me here in brassempouy and 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.230
 well it's the project makes the projects 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.660
 because there are several there arc 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.250
 and the parquet the first phase we are going 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.549
 say of the project around the house of the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.200
 lady 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.359
 but there is also the museum that goes 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.669
 enlarge the caves also which 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.150
 will open to the public from 2 to 2 to 3 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:12.190
 years so that's really actually 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.480
 an effervescence around around this 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.489
 site which is a prehistoric site 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.079
 major because it's here that has been 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.359
 carved the lady of grace a little who is 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.250
 still the oldest known face 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.620
 we have the oldest representation of 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.440
 face to the world that gorgeous and more 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.900
 so that's really all that who me who 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.220
 brought me to simple brax yes we have a 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.910
 very good team a very good spirit 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.460
 equipped with 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.680
 and as we are a small team we 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.660
 does everything and mediation is that a 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.830
 part of our work but it's 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.160
 also the most interesting part 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.450
 because to teach people how to 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.960
 that's how we do a fake that can 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.240
 look 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.770
 I do it every day but it's 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.490
 every day as exciting I want 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.750
 to say it's magic 5 magical side I 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.529
 speak to you about fire but I will speak to you 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.399
 not the same way from there 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:59.839
 of sculpture painting too 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:02.209
 here and more here brew Puglia 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:04.009
 it is still a site of sculptures 

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:06.079
 because that's where we found the 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.549
 more round of paleolithic statuettes 

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:10.429
 it's not nothing it's really a site 

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:14.439
 archaeological a very important 

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:14.439
 important to point out here
