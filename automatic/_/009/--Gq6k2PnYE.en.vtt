its own signature frequency wise so when

we talk about frequencies like that that

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.750 
we talk about frequencies like that that
are<00:03:28.370> intelligent<00:03:29.800> it<00:03:30.800> makes<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.220> lot<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.459> sense

than mind over matter the doctor

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.650 
than mind over matter the doctor
welcomes<00:03:36.770> those<00:03:37.010> claims<00:03:37.400> if<00:03:37.820> they<00:03:38.000> say<00:03:38.240> mind

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
welcomes those claims if they say mind

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.370 
welcomes those claims if they say mind
over<00:03:38.990> matter<00:03:40.360> then<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.720> means<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:42.170> their

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
over matter then it means that their

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.680 
over matter then it means that their
minds<00:03:42.739> are<00:03:42.920> open<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.700> accept<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.209> eternal

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690

mind<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.739> behind<00:03:45.950> existence<00:03:46.989> so<00:03:47.989> people

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
mind that is behind existence so people

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.920 
mind that is behind existence so people
use<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.650> argument<00:03:49.100> as<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.250> negative<00:03:49.780> but<00:03:50.780> it's

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
use that argument as a negative but it's

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.750 
use that argument as a negative but it's
such<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> hopeful<00:03:51.739> thing<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.190> hear<00:03:52.370> from<00:03:52.580> those

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
such a hopeful thing to hear from those

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.699 
such a hopeful thing to hear from those
people<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.510> what's<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.840> Catholic<00:03:54.230> Church<00:03:54.470> say
