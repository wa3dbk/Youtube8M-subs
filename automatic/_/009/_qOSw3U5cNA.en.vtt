00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.820
 We are pleased to be with you in 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.310
 direct from our fields the periods 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.260
 of flowering and fruiting occupy a 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.570
 Our producers at the end of March 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.489
 at the beginning of June discover the gestures 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.900
 temporary that mark their day to day in 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.210
 this video 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.310
 at the end of winter after the big 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.680
 cold the producers proceed to the 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.870
 tip of the tree select the branches of 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.270
 fruit and eliminate future buds too 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.830
 abundant is about controlling the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.370
 amount of fruit to prevent it from 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.600
 break the branches and the tree runs out 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.070
 It is also a way of offering a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.340
 maximum sunlight to future 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 apples the objective is to favor the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.330
 coloring of the witness fruit of the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.490
 gustatory wealth and to ensure a 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.560
 regular production in quality than in the 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.450
 moment of the harvest presents a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.860
 wide diversity of caliber in terms of 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.200
 Fruit 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.300
 flowering is a major challenge for 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.430
 the success of a good harvest for 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.380
 pollinate apple trees by nature 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 auto sterile producers have 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.490
 planted in the field other varieties of 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.470
 apple trees called pollinators that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.690
 bloom at the same time the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.600
 inflorescence of the apple tree consists of 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.420
 five flowers called corimbo the flower 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.490
 central is the first to open its 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.680
 Life span is staggered between 2 and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.950
 10 days in a short period for the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950
 formalization 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.560
 the domestic bees sometimes bumblebees 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.060
 are the main agents of a 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 successful pollination 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.210
 escaped and from the hives placed the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.490
 proximity of the field by the beekeeper 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.530
 they went from flower to flower appreciating the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.530
 abundant apple pollen and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.900
 nutritious 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.940
 to protect future apples the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.510
 producers practice sexual cooking 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.500
 using a pheromone splitter 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.509
 implemented before the start of 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.819
 period of reproduction of the capsa mite 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.800
 this method prevents the main plague 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.870
 of the apple dock and then 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.690
 proliferate a preventive solution 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:27.020
 sustainable and non-destructive that preserves 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:28.580
 biodiversity when the fruit starts 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.680
 to grow and develop 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.930
 producers proceed to clarify or 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.360
 qualitative remove apples other 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.600
 deformed or damaged to optimize the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.880
 distribution of the best fruit the number 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.400
 optimal fruit per branch is determined 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.170
 depending on the diameter of this 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.090
 the quality of the apple its thickness and its 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.190
 sugar index are intimately 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.470
 related to tree nutrition 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.290
 and it's secured by the floor and the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.450
 photosynthesis producers control and 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.970
 bring essential nutrients to your 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.980
 growth if necessary thanks to 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.450
 sensors located on the ground that send 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.550
 the information to a box of 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.620
 blessing also regulate irrigation by 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.480
 drip that allows them to distribute without 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.160
 no wasting the amounts of water 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.080
 essential for development 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.080
 harmonious of the tree and the fruit 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.870
 a selective and efficient pruning a 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.989
 pollination careful and optimized a 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.030
 protected fortification and followed 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.579
 producers multiply day after day 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.890
 actions and attentions animated by a 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.689
 objective to ensure the development of a 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.099
 quality fruit that corresponds to the 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.099
 ping lady certification
