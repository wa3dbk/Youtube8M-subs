well it's got a nice feel to it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.300 
well it's got a nice feel to it
especially<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.290> curve<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.680> there<00:01:47.100> for

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
especially that curve right there for

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.249 
especially that curve right there for
your<00:01:47.369> next<00:01:47.700> finger<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.329> even<00:01:48.479> go

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
your next finger or you can even go

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.410 
your next finger or you can even go
inverted<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.920> feel<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.270> make

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
inverted I feel that as this would make

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690 
inverted I feel that as this would make
a<00:01:51.450> good<00:01:51.720> tactical<00:01:52.680> knife<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> needed<00:01:53.579> to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
what kind of steel this is does not give

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860 
what kind of steel this is does not give
me<00:02:11.280> any<00:02:11.430> information

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
me any information

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.820 
me any information
on<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.590> steel<00:02:14.300> there<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.360> no<00:02:15.830> actual

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
on the kind of steel there is no actual

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.949 
on the kind of steel there is no actual
guard<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.849> plate<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.510> curve<00:02:18.750> kind

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
guard to the plate but this curve kind

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.050 
guard to the plate but this curve kind
of<00:02:19.019> serves<00:02:19.200> as<00:02:19.319> that's<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.739> way<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.790> won't

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
of serves as that's that way you won't

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.839 
of serves as that's that way you won't
run<00:02:22.050> up<00:02:22.230> onto<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> edge<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.099> knife<00:02:23.250> this

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
run up onto the edge of the knife this

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.780 
run up onto the edge of the knife this
also<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> good<00:02:24.900> water<00:02:25.200> rigid<00:02:26.040> resistant

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
also is a good water rigid resistant

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.460 
also is a good water rigid resistant
protectant<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:27.690> even<00:02:27.930> when<00:02:28.050> your<00:02:28.170> hands<00:02:28.410> are

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
protectant so even when your hands are

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.740 
protectant so even when your hands are
wet<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.459> will<00:02:29.640> retain<00:02:30.269> your<00:02:30.390> grip<00:02:30.569> on<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
wet you will retain your grip on the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.190 
wet you will retain your grip on the
knife

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
knife

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.640 
knife
you<00:02:31.500> got<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.769> jimping<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:33.110> which<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.379> kind

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
you got the jimping here which is kind

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.130 
you got the jimping here which is kind
of<00:02:34.739> aggressive<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:36.060> got<00:02:37.370> pretty<00:02:38.370> medium

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
of aggressive it's got pretty medium

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.100 
of aggressive it's got pretty medium
traction<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.739> only<00:02:40.950> thing<00:02:41.099> is<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.220> may<00:02:42.110> slide

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
traction the only thing is you may slide

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.259 
traction the only thing is you may slide
up<00:02:43.230> under<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> blade<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.549> it's<00:02:45.090> never

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
up under the blade but it's never

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.940 
up under the blade but it's never
happened<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.569> me<00:02:45.630> before<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.560> really<00:02:46.829> don't

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
happened to me before and I really don't

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.479 
happened to me before and I really don't
see<00:02:47.430> any<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:49.560> happening<00:02:50.040> anytime<00:02:50.280> soon

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
see any that happening anytime soon

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.039 
see any that happening anytime soon
because<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> blade<00:02:51.299> doesn't<00:02:51.480> actually<00:02:51.660> start

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
because the blade doesn't actually start

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.350 
because the blade doesn't actually start
until<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.769> bottom<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.700> stage<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.209> there

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
until the bottom of that stage in there

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.900 
until the bottom of that stage in there
so<00:02:54.510> even<00:02:54.720> if<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.319> kind<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.620> ride<00:02:55.829> up<00:02:56.010> you're

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
so even if you do kind of ride up you're

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.300 
so even if you do kind of ride up you're
gonna<00:02:57.450> notice<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.260> before<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.680> actually<00:02:58.799> cut

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
gonna notice it before you actually cut

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.970 
gonna notice it before you actually cut
yourself<00:02:59.610> on<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.970> serration<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.980> it's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
yourself on the serration it so it's

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.039 
yourself on the serration it so it's
definitely<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.579> very<00:03:02.910> cool<00:03:03.450> looking<00:03:03.840> knife

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
definitely a very cool looking knife

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.979 
definitely a very cool looking knife
