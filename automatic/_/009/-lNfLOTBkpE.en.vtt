00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.420
 he started playing games with 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.530
 the professional team of laval 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.450
 we feel he was in the process of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.439
 reveal and as he still has a 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.900
 very interesting profile has a lot 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.859
 attackers also from this profile there and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.689
 of that level so it seemed to us 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.369
 urgent to position ourselves 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.730
 so there is a double satisfaction the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.739
 feeling of recruiting a future 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.410
 talent for tomorrow and at the same time the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.930
 did our project begin to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.000
 get fit to grow and for 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.410
 that I thank the President for being 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.270
 listened to his requests 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.600
 we hope wholeheartedly that very soon he 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.070
 will become the successful striker of the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.719
 losc as we always hoped and we 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.870
 is very happy to see him 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.220
 to join precisely to pose his profile 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.650
 his profile is really very interesting 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.119
 and he has a great ability to adapt 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 and we hope he will be able to 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.330
 to perform quickly is a boy who 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 is who and who is very mobile who is 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 technically good who is extremely 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.689
 interesting especially ogeu for 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.280
 prepare the actions a good player from 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:29.430
 head that scores goals even though I 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.900
 think with what he will learn here 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.479
 he will still score more 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.479
 the scorers born must have the obsession 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.150
 to end up in in the 18 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.009
 meters to put the balloons at 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.079
 background but hey we saw him score two 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.320
 great goals and especially very 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.509
 interesting in preparation of 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.890
 actions and then able to play foot 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.350
 left able to play right foot good 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.640
 head game he goes pretty fast compared 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.280
 at its big size 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.829
 it's really a profile that here the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.270
 that's what we hoped to have 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.700
 was great when the coach did it 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.680
 seen on the montages that we realized 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.380
 when he read his report 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.420
 was immediately seduced so that's 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.510
 the interesting side because when one has to 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.160
 total adherence of the coach the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.370
 things can obviously go to go 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.370
 faster
