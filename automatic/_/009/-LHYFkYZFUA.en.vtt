00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
it worked we did it the power of a

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.080 
it worked we did it the power of a
Bakugan<00:02:01.119> in<00:02:02.119> a<00:02:02.150> cybernetic<00:02:03.080> body<00:02:03.729> we<00:02:04.729> created

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
Bakugan in a cybernetic body we created

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.330 
Bakugan in a cybernetic body we created
a<00:02:05.509> new<00:02:05.869> Bakugan<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:08.330> can't<00:02:08.660> be<00:02:09.340> Vestals

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
a new Bakugan it can't be Vestals

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.000 
a new Bakugan it can't be Vestals
creating<00:02:10.910> Bakugan<00:02:11.480> but<00:02:12.290> why<00:02:12.560> father<00:02:13.040> why<00:02:18.010> man

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
creating Bakugan but why father why man

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.640 
creating Bakugan but why father why man
security<00:02:19.760> here<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.030> tighter<00:02:20.330> than<00:02:20.590> shuns<00:02:21.590> Jean

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
security here is tighter than shuns Jean

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.170 
security here is tighter than shuns Jean
we<00:02:24.650> won't<00:02:24.860> even<00:02:24.980> get<00:02:25.250> close<00:02:25.489> with<00:02:25.880> all<00:02:26.030> those

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
we won't even get close with all those

we won't even get close with all those
guards<00:02:26.660> around<00:02:27.340> wait<00:02:28.340> look<00:02:28.760> over<00:02:28.940> there

you see that just what I thought huh the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.580 
you see that just what I thought huh the
battle<00:02:48.420> arena<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:48.989> dimension

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
battle arena and the dimension

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.300 
battle arena and the dimension
controller<00:02:50.069> seem<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.489> be<00:02:50.610> synchronized

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
controller seem to be synchronized

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.759 
controller seem to be synchronized
synchronized<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.200> what<00:02:55.379> you<00:02:55.470> wanted

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
synchronized so this is what you wanted

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.000 
synchronized so this is what you wanted
to<00:02:55.890> check<00:02:56.160> out<00:02:56.370> son<00:02:57.230> yeah<00:02:58.230> we'll<00:02:58.830> take

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
to check out son yeah we'll take

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.009 
to check out son yeah we'll take
advantage<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.819> link<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.330> destroy<00:03:00.810> the

advantage of that link to destroy the
dimension<00:03:01.470> controller<00:03:01.920> let's<00:03:02.700> get<00:03:02.880> out<00:03:02.940> of

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
dimension controller let's get out of

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.449 
dimension controller let's get out of
here<00:03:03.209> first<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.900> then<00:03:04.050> I'll<00:03:04.200> explain<00:03:04.650> maybe

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
here first and then I'll explain maybe

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.820 
here first and then I'll explain maybe
we<00:03:05.760> should<00:03:05.970> wait<00:03:06.120> until<00:03:06.390> meter<00:03:06.810> gets<00:03:07.170> back<00:03:07.440> I

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
we should wait until meter gets back I

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.940 
we should wait until meter gets back I
can't<00:03:08.280> believe<00:03:08.430> she<00:03:08.790> ditched<00:03:09.120> us<00:03:09.360> like<00:03:09.599> that
