00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.930
 we will prepare pancakes authentic 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.360
 ingredients that we need are for 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 about 20 units approximately one 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200
 cup and a half of common flour 3 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 teaspoons and a half of baking powder 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.060
 or yeast for biscuits a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.120
 teaspoon of salt a tablespoon 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.100
 big sugar a cup and a quarter of 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.590
 milk an egg three tablespoons of 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.380
 melted butter and maple syrup 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.750
 of chocolate honey marmalade whipped cream 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.899
 or fresh fruit or whatever you want for 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 accompany and we will start by taking a 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.280
 big bowl to which we are going to put a 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.260
 strainer or sieve to sift the flour 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.649
 the baking powder or yeast for 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.649
 biscuits salt and finally sugar 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.940
 If we sieve it like that, we're going to take 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.830
 much less and also we will have the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.830
 more homogeneous pancake batter 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.910
 we add the egg 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.130
 and we're going to put the butter that 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.310
 we had melted previously and that already 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:15.400
 it's not hot and finally we're going to 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.620
 add the cup and quarter of milk 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.920
 the cup that we use as a reference has 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.300
 250 milliliters of capacity and are cups 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.910
 actually very easy to find 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.030
 almost everyone has a glass cup at home 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.110
 who has this ability 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.150
 with some rods we will beat it 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.190
 well we strongly 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.619
 we went to a jar and then we could 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.140
 throw it better in the pan and make the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.140
 shape of the pancakes but here we are going to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.750
 let the dough rest between 10 minutes and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.420
 half an hour for the flour to grow and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.780
 the mass thickens 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.909
 After time, we put a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.030
 little pan with a little bit of 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.240
 Butter 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.520
 and we are going to distribute it well and we are going to 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.220
 throw our first pancake that so 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.250
 general does not usually work because the only thing 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.230
 what it does is settle the heat of the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.959
 pan well but it is quite fried 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.390
 so this one serves us we discard that 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.900
 we have leftover dough and we have already started 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.610
 throwing the squibs of dough trying 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.670
 that are always more or less the same 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.250
 quantity and the pan we have it to fire 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.690
 medium strong to know when you 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.879
 we have to turn around we have to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.580
 see that it bubbles all the mass of the 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:37.000
 pancake as you see in the picture when 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.849
 let's see that it bubbles well for everything 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.629
 we turn around quickly and we have it 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.200
 about 30 seconds we see that it swells by 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.200
 center 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.770
 and then we will take it out 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.770
 as we go on doing more and more 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.569
 they will go out better and better according to 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.270
 we go doing their thing is that the 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.790
 put one on top of another on a plate 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.800
 so that they keep the heat and for 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.050
 last we put a goop of 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.550
 butter and we bathe them well of syrup 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.250
 of maple that is like us 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.069
 they like we serve them immediately and 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.190
 As you can see, we made our pancakes 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.709
 or authentic American pancakes that have 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.650
 it was great and that the truth 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.410
 We have taken this recipe from the channel 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.110
 food guys and if we loved you 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.880
 We can recommend 100% this channel and 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.680
 this recipe because the truth is that 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.680
 they are delicious
