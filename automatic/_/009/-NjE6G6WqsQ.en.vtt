00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.649
 our research ship our researchers 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.139
 discover an archive legendary 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.910
 stories of an ancient civilization 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.059
 with a few literary attacks 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.859
 we to our our culture and the and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.390
 the spread of our values ​​adjusted 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.140
 the morals of our citizens are increasing 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.320
 1 percent 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:28.849
 very nice we had an anomaly 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.849
 also appear from time to time 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.510
 then I would ship with this now 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:49.360
 we want that a little bit smaller 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:53.799
 fly in this neighborhood and with 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:59.049
 With this we discover this system 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.049
 class 9 planet but again radioactive 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.820
 finished 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.700
 ok civilizational breakthrough on the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.110
 earth 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.740
 We have an innovation center 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.979
 built very nice and we have the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.600
 Environmental adaptation perfects strangers 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.470
 worlds bring new challenges 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.690
 for industrial and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.820
 agricultural trade other soils 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.040
 different climate other gravity all 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.840
 this has an impact on how and what 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.880
 We build with this new technology 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.860
 we'll get the challenge in better 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.899
 the handle 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.700
 civilian civil production 10 so on 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.399
 planets military production spaceships 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.950
 ten points becomes stronger and research becomes 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.140
 climb ten points and the beautiful 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.140
 bonus without having to expand 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.610
 how long will the scene take before addition 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.200
 research is only two weeks then 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.880
 we should explore them next 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:12.630
 around our traditional research lab 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:18.390
 replace and stronger research laboratory 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.060
 to have innovation center on the earth 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.140
 finished now comes 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.800
 Entertainment network around our morality 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.800
 to hold up 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.930
 class 11 berlin commutes 1 but again 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.930
 special 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.510
 Let's go there and see 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:58.530
 next mining module delivers its 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.530
 production capabilities to earth 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.960
 done the scene research is done 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.060
 nobody likes the term xeno research 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.680
 but it was the only thing on the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.290
 we understand a few customers 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.270
 Extra tourism research had become 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.640
 most buzz fingers and some 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.850
 brainwraps broken well now we 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.470
 We are now on the way 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.450
 we no longer have things for our own 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.580
 explore the world but for the world 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.280
 entire galactic civilization of the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.560
 terrans of this technology are like that 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.180
 they are designed in many ways 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.360
 different worlds or environments 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.650
 even in very different pointed 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.220
 sensitive to the aqua dome applied 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.220
 can be 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.210
 this game has an automatism 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.800
 this improved research lab 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.730
 will automatically be upgraded as soon as the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:59.500
 Production capacity on planets free 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:01.750
 Astronomy is only one week then 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.250
 we should do that 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.620
 So we can planets on the mini 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.180
 Show map which is not so 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.819
 But much sense does then have the 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.389
 everything only a week 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:22.740
 and xeno biology is good too 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:27.050
 It took one week up there 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.050
 there is no planet left to check 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:39.060
 class 7 but water or special 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.130
 planets currently astronomy 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.449
 perfected with our sensors 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.380
 We can stars throughout 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.360
 see galaxy 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.490
 Unfortunately not the planets but that 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.050
 planets will be different from now on 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.120
 which we believe to be of high quality 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.290
 will be on the mini-map from now 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.290
 something highlighted 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.000
 and we explore the scene biology 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.880
 this allows us to better the environment 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.380
 study animals because that's what 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.840
 in the colonization of new worlds 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.840
 help and bring new remedies 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.980
 perfected the scene and biology 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.210
 we have a better one now 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.370
 understanding how life is on 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.840
 different planets we work 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.730
 have also started the infrastructure 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.690
 to build up the new animals and 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.490
 plants to use 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.170
 on which we conquer others 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:39.440
 planets do not encounter any improvement 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:43.670
 is a basic research then so 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.490
 let's take a look at new drive technologies 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.940
 maybe we should have two retirees 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.480
 explore around small hyper drive too 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:59.290
 to have 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:59.290
 to get more space in the ships 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.000
 entertainment network on the earth 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.620
 finished now becomes a market center 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.280
 built 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.660
 we see that our money too 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.660
 decreases and that huge 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:26.310
 42 is our money - right now 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.310
 more - if we introduce this espionage 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.220
 8 percent is quite good 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.740
 but this minus is unhealthy for us 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.960
 It does not get it fixed yet 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.990
 never mind that now first 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.540
 we urgently need the trade 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.210
 okay there is nothing left there is one 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:25.180
 anomaly 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:28.180
 there also nothing is it called the 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.129
 explore that down there and the 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.770
 we'll send it now too 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:35.860
 Let's go here 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:41.770
 up here to explore and the 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:44.199
 we now automate to research 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.759
 and explore for example 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:50.759
 also to mine a lady 

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.759
 finished 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:08:04.140
 What do we have there? We are ours 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:06.500
 stuffed animals okay so far up to this 

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.500
 time
