00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.980 
so difficult as I thought would be when
it<00:01:53.340> happened<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.000> Becky<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.659> would<00:01:54.840> know

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
it happened that Becky as you would know

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.630 
it happened that Becky as you would know
when<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> see<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:55.799> happen<00:01:56.190> you<00:01:56.220> don't<00:01:56.429> know

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
when you see it happen you don't know

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
when you see it happen you don't know
how<00:01:56.819> serious<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.569> I<00:01:57.960> knew<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.259> was<00:01:58.409> serious

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
how serious it is I knew it was serious

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.059 
how serious it is I knew it was serious
but<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.340> had<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.690> didn't<00:02:01.289> even<00:02:01.409> enter<00:02:01.560> my<00:02:01.799> mind

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
but I had it didn't even enter my mind

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.010 
but I had it didn't even enter my mind
at<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.429> point<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:03.090> he<00:02:03.330> would<00:02:03.659> be<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.840> for

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
at that point that he would be out for

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.899 
at that point that he would be out for
the<00:02:04.409> entire<00:02:04.709> year<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.429> thought<00:02:05.729> well

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the entire year you know I thought well

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.340 
the entire year you know I thought well
maybe<00:02:05.940> it's<00:02:06.299> something<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.810> will<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.289> him

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
maybe it's something that will get him

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.509 
maybe it's something that will get him
back<00:02:07.409> by<00:02:07.830> by<00:02:08.640> December<00:02:09.149> January<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:10.310> once<00:02:11.310> I

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
heard that he was out for the year I

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.440 
heard that he was out for the year I
knew<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.250> were<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.519> some<00:02:14.760> degree<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.330> trouble

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
knew we were in some degree of trouble

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.750 
knew we were in some degree of trouble
all<00:02:15.900> last<00:02:16.200> year<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.500> knew<00:02:16.769> I<00:02:17.040> would<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.459> able<00:02:17.700> to

play on this year's team and that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.479 
play on this year's team and that
thought<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.799> helped<00:02:20.040> carry<00:02:20.280> me<00:02:20.459> through

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.759 
thought really helped carry me through
the<00:02:20.790> year<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.239> was<00:02:22.109> definitely<00:02:22.500> worth<00:02:22.709> the

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
the year it was definitely worth the

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:23.150
