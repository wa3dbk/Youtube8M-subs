you<00:00:00.179> see<00:00:00.359> on<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:00.690> photo<00:00:01.260> I<00:00:01.380> have<00:00:03.799> look<00:00:04.799> at<00:00:04.920> the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
you see on this photo I have look at the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.930 
you see on this photo I have look at the
bottle<00:00:05.990> here<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.160> can<00:00:08.309> see<00:00:08.490> there's<00:00:08.880> a

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
bottle here and you can see there's a

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.419 
bottle here and you can see there's a
radial<00:00:09.300> demarcation<00:00:09.900> line<00:00:10.230> where<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.250> see

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
radial demarcation line where you see

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.629 
radial demarcation line where you see
some<00:00:11.730> color<00:00:12.030> variants<00:00:12.860> here<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
some color variants here that is the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.950 
some color variants here that is the
plastic<00:00:15.320> dome<00:00:16.520> which<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.850> bow<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.390> this

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
plastic dome which is the bow of this

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.310 
plastic dome which is the bow of this
class<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.439> submarine<00:00:19.920> under<00:00:20.850> which<00:00:21.109> resides<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
class of submarine under which resides a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.730 
class of submarine under which resides a
spherical<00:00:22.859> array<00:00:23.600> with<00:00:24.600> sonar<00:00:24.960> transducers

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
spherical array with sonar transducers

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.400 
spherical array with sonar transducers
that's<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.880> characteristics<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.869> most

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
that's a characteristics of most

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.089 
that's a characteristics of most

submarines now mm what we're going to do
to<00:00:36.210> represent<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.940> I<00:00:39.260> first<00:00:40.260> identified

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
to represent that is I first identified

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.889 
to represent that is I first identified
the<00:00:41.040> center<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.730> put<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> small<00:00:42.329> hole<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the center and I put a small hole in the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.979 
the center and I put a small hole in the
bow<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.500> now<00:00:44.390> what<00:00:45.390> I've<00:00:45.510> done<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.719> I've

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
bow here now what I've done is I've

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.680 
bow here now what I've done is I've
taken<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.410> set<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.850> outside<00:00:47.850> calipers<00:00:48.420> I've

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
taken the set of outside calipers I've

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
taken the set of outside calipers I've
modified<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.260> by<00:00:49.530> sharpening<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:51.649> ends<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
modified it by sharpening the ends of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.360 
modified it by sharpening the ends of
each<00:00:53.760> blade<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.590> we're<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> use<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.280> as

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
each blade and we're going to use it as

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.700 
each blade and we're going to use it as
a<00:00:56.399> compass<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:58.079> reason<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.379> use<00:00:58.410> an

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
a compass and the reason I use an

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.639 
a compass and the reason I use an
outside<00:00:58.920> set<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.850> because<00:01:00.780> its<00:01:00.989> shape<00:01:01.079> lends

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
outside set is because its shape lends

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.520 
outside set is because its shape lends
itself<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.699> usage<00:01:03.149> see<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> have

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
itself to this usage see what I have

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
itself to this usage see what I have
here<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> compass<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:07.110> you'll

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
here it's now a compass but you'll

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.580 
here it's now a compass but you'll
negotiate<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:08.220> almost<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.729> angle<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> I'm

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
negotiate this almost right angle so I'm

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.740 
negotiate this almost right angle so I'm

the final scribe line this is just a
