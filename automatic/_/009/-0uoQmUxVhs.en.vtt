but this is something that I just got
from<00:00:15.700> Amazon<00:00:16.330> I<00:00:17.320> think<00:00:17.710> I<00:00:17.830> might<00:00:18.040> try<00:00:18.220> to<00:00:18.310> do<00:00:18.520> a

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
from Amazon I think I might try to do a

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.420 
from Amazon I think I might try to do a
little<00:00:18.790> bit<00:00:18.970> more<00:00:19.180> of<00:00:19.300> these<00:00:19.510> things<00:00:20.430> because

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
cameras pointing to us I can't be behind

doing<00:01:17.840> them<00:01:17.990> box<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.410> so<00:01:18.560> hopefully

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
doing them box and so hopefully

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.340 
doing them box and so hopefully
everything<00:01:19.610> stays<00:01:19.970> in<00:01:20.240> focus<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.780> in<00:01:21.080> frame

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
everything stays in focus and in frame

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.190 
everything stays in focus and in frame
so<00:01:21.830> but<00:01:22.750> continuing<00:01:23.750> on

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
so but continuing on

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.830 
so but continuing on

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
so that is its packaging not very good

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:41.430

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
I believe it's 0 through 12 it also has

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.020 
I believe it's 0 through 12 it also has
the<00:02:07.850> three<00:02:10.480> special<00:02:11.480> online<00:02:12.430> version<00:02:13.430> books

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
the three special online version books

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.810 
the three special online version books
that<00:02:14.450> had<00:02:14.720> some<00:02:15.620> special<00:02:15.890> infinite<00:02:16.459> comics

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
that had some special infinite comics

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.860 
that had some special infinite comics
there<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:18.500> also<00:02:18.650> has<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.630> versus<00:02:20.630> X

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
there it is and it also has a versus X

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.009 
there it is and it also has a versus X
and<00:02:21.410> I<00:02:21.860> believe<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.100> was<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.780> limited<00:02:23.780> series

and I believe that was a limited series

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.640 
and I believe that was a limited series
of<00:02:24.380> six<00:02:24.680> issues<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:26.690> have<00:02:27.049> not<00:02:27.380> actually
