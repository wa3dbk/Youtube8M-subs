00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 We also wanted to give them a framework in 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.740
 which some previous concepts in 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.320
 those who put together the list one of the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.150
 concepts is that they should be the majority 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.280
 of the holders of the tie is 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.740
 a matter of contract with with the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 Korean provision is a bit we do not 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.700
 they asked for that so a little the list 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.860
 aimed to maintain that 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.350
 It should also serve to gather the 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.210
 before the match with the 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.070
 September games is the only 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.950
 opportunity that we have 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.900
 for being our only match also if 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.420
 had to do any test some 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.280
 try or see some alternative not 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.530
 we could miss the opportunity the list 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.079
 also contemplate this alternative 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.940
 see something else 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.980
 vargas is not on the list is true 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.350
 talked to him of course because 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.080
 we want it to be good to recover 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.809
 I worked train I actually trained 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.070
 here a few days he had to travel no no 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.930
 is living a very circumstance 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.200
 special we are trying to encourage them 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.970
 hold it but good no no it's not in 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.890
 conditions of being summoned do not know no 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.840
 he has been summoned that is the truth Juan 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.000
 When I arrived, you asked me to 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.820
 capital or do not remember 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.380
 so a lot of things have happened that are not 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.020
 have been good for him or good for 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.820
 we have tried we have 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.690
 endeavored to death for helping him because 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.890
 after recovering it 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.930
 convinced that it is the best option 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.700
 that we have for more than they are 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.250
 appearing some variants that 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.110
 we have to start seeing but it's 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.030
 going through a difficult moment of which no 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.070
 we are very sorry about this, I think that 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.170
 overcome in some problems I think 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.940
 which is let's say again in a good 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.670
 moment but is paying what is 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.180
 that was not right and he is aware of 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.370
 that and good if we can help it we go 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 to help but the effort no doubt what 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.510
 have to do get a club play 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.770
 they are in condition and above all 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.530
 train us what we have 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.540
 already recommended in some way so that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.580
 be in the best possible shape 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.070
 today the situation is this and he took a 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.229
 decision regarding this situation 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.910
 We will see later how they are 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.209
 I had the weekend was four days 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.650
 Brazil now I spoke shift YotÃºn 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.020
 he was playing with a muscle injury 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.730
 but he has been in the bank the last 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.090
 party is able to travel not 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.150
 will have more problem 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.790
 I also spoke with Ramirez and with a dream 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.920
 to which with warriors of course 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.349
 which is also n with him with the ability 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.670
 link was in the concentration stem 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.810
 and the matches played very well the three 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.190
 warriors you may have seen 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.379
 that came out at 62 minutes and so on 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.180
 I was very happy because of the link that I 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.720
 I think it 's a big game cachito had 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.560
 a good performance too 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.670
 we share the things that I wanted 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.680
 share with them prior to the trip and 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.570
 well the truth is that it was a very 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.550
 happy to have gone made an effort 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.800
 important because you have to move in a 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.690
 very large city traveling to the countryside 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.790
 to see match and concentration in 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.080
 stadiums and others but I'm very happy to 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.090
 have gone 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.160
 I have also taken contact with a 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.500
 number of players who have spoken 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.140
 lately these days and it's all good 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.570
 is a little trying to take this 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.790
 trip in korea to get together and 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.380
 talk about what's coming and how much 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.030
 chance we have and how much there is 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.030
 play in these September games
