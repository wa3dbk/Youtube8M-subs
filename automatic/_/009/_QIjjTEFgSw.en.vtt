like a wheel that looks like your old
bicycles<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.930> hard<00:02:59.230> rubber<00:02:59.469> wheel<00:02:59.799> and<00:03:00.189> it<00:03:00.579> just

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
bicycles a hard rubber wheel and it just

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.599 
bicycles a hard rubber wheel and it just
slides<00:03:01.030> up<00:03:01.359> and<00:03:01.450> down<00:03:01.659> that<00:03:02.650> wheel<00:03:02.950> too<00:03:03.400> very

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
slides up and down that wheel too very

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.240 
slides up and down that wheel too very
8-speed<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.629> very<00:03:04.810> simple

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
8-speed so it's a very simple

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.610 
8-speed so it's a very simple
transmission<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:07.930> one<00:03:08.139> belt<00:03:08.379> you

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
transmission and there is one belt you

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.509 
transmission and there is one belt you
can<00:03:08.799> see<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.939> drives<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.450> from<00:03:10.689> the<00:03:10.840> engine

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
can see that drives that from the engine

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.400 
can see that drives that from the engine
no<00:03:12.519> gearbox<00:03:12.549> here<00:03:13.709> very<00:03:14.709> simple<00:03:15.069> design
