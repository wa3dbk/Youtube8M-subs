Narrator: March the 22nd has
been designated as "World Water

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.300
Day" by the United Nations.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.300
In this week's In Focus
segment, we take a look at

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.150
water, a resource that a
billion people on the planet

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.650
can't get easy access to, and
the challenges of getting it

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.090
are becoming more difficult
because of global

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.630
climate change.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.510
As we see in this report from
the rugged region of Southern

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.320
Ethiopia, drought is drying
up wells, threatening

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.380
an ancient way of life
and fueling conflicts.
