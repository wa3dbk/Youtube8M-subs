okay here is the new mind lab Excalibur

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.910 
okay here is the new mind lab Excalibur
-<00:00:35.120> on<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> underwater<00:00:36.690> detector<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.650> go

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
- on the underwater detector that can go

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.860 
- on the underwater detector that can go
down<00:00:37.950> about<00:00:38.310> 200<00:00:38.760> feet<00:00:39.360> literally<00:00:41.480> it's<00:00:42.480> scuba

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
down about 200 feet literally it's scuba

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.530 
down about 200 feet literally it's scuba
diving<00:00:44.630> and<00:00:45.630> say<00:00:45.960> multi<00:00:46.410> frequency<00:00:47.040> detector

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
diving and say multi frequency detector

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.840 
diving and say multi frequency detector
meaning<00:00:48.540> that<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:50.180> puts<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.720> think<00:00:52.730> 17<00:00:53.730> or

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
meaning that it puts out I think 17 or

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.439 
meaning that it puts out I think 17 or
18<00:00:54.150> different<00:00:54.650> frequencies<00:00:55.650> and<00:00:56.300> let's<00:00:57.300> say

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
18 different frequencies and let's say

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.520 
18 different frequencies and let's say
get<00:00:57.660> down<00:00:57.839> really<00:00:58.230> deep<00:00:58.589> -<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.400> is<00:01:00.410> just<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
get down really deep - this is just a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.570 
get down really deep - this is just a
beautiful<00:01:01.860> detector<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:03.629> battery<00:01:04.290> pack<00:01:04.580> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
beautiful detector this battery pack and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.880 
beautiful detector this battery pack and
that's<00:01:05.970> got<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> charger<00:01:06.870> muted<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.620> it<00:01:07.740> right

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that's got the charger muted on it right

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.250 
that's got the charger muted on it right
now<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.490> plug<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> charger<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
now you just plug in the charger and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.530 
now you just plug in the charger and
this<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> unique<00:01:11.580> setup<00:01:11.909> these<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
this is the unique setup these are the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.490 
this is the unique setup these are the
sealed<00:01:12.870> plugs<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.480> plug<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.200> it's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
sealed plugs you just plug this in it's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.000 
sealed plugs you just plug this in it's
got<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> special<00:01:17.250> rubber<00:01:17.490> seal<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
got a special rubber seal you can see it

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.510 
got a special rubber seal you can see it
right<00:01:20.190> there<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:21.080> then<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.440> you<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.890> buff

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
right there and then just you just buff

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.040 
right there and then just you just buff
that<00:01:23.550> on<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.360> tighten<00:01:24.690> it<00:01:24.870> down<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
that on there and tighten it down and

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.620 
that on there and tighten it down and
you've<00:01:25.440> got<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> sealed<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:27.030> well<00:01:29.630> I've

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you've got it sealed really well I've

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.940 
you've got it sealed really well I've
been<00:01:30.750> charging<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.410> about<00:01:31.560> an<00:01:31.680> hour<00:01:31.770> now

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
been charging it for about an hour now

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.720 
been charging it for about an hour now
but<00:01:32.360> discrimination<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.540> pinpoint<00:01:34.730> really

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
but discrimination and pinpoint really

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.390 
but discrimination and pinpoint really
neat<00:01:35.850> threshold<00:01:36.480> a<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.920> different<00:01:38.250> than

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
neat threshold a little different than

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.960 
neat threshold a little different than
what<00:01:38.520> I'm<00:01:38.640> used<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.940> with<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.830> Explorer<00:01:40.970> se

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
what I'm used to with the Explorer se

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.570 
what I'm used to with the Explorer se
Pro<00:01:43.250> volume<00:01:45.380> sensitivity<00:01:46.380> I've<00:01:47.010> still<00:01:47.280> got<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
Pro volume sensitivity I've still got to

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.570 
Pro volume sensitivity I've still got to
get<00:01:47.760> used<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.960> what<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.440> how<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.190> scale

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
get used to what that how the scale

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.080 
get used to what that how the scale
works<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.120> this<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:52.290> discrimination<00:01:53.190> it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
works for this and discrimination it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.880 
works for this and discrimination it
reminds<00:01:54.450> me<00:01:54.600> something<00:01:54.900> of<00:01:55.230> like<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.680> mind

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
reminds me something of like the mind

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.610 
reminds me something of like the mind
lab<00:01:56.130> cult<00:01:56.660> that<00:01:57.660> I<00:01:57.720> have<00:01:58.110> which<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.330> another

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
lab cult that I have which is a another

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.720 
lab cult that I have which is a another
vintage<00:02:01.700> detector<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.540> actually<00:02:03.900> the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
vintage detector it's it's actually the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.229 
vintage detector it's it's actually the
musketeer<00:02:05.730> cult<00:02:06.620> model<00:02:07.620> but<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.759> really

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
musketeer cult model but it's really

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.110 
musketeer cult model but it's really
neat<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:10.370> the<00:02:11.370> way<00:02:11.519> they<00:02:11.730> did<00:02:11.940> their

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
neat because the way they did their

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.270 
neat because the way they did their
circuitry<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.019> with<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.470> kind<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.739> coils<00:02:14.069> and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
circuitry and with the kind of coils and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.820 
circuitry and with the kind of coils and
technology<00:02:14.819> they<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.150> my<00:02:15.870> lab<00:02:16.200> stuff<00:02:16.590> gets

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
technology they have my lab stuff gets

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.600 
technology they have my lab stuff gets
you<00:02:16.980> down<00:02:17.160> really<00:02:17.610> deep<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.190> has<00:02:20.340> just

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
you down really deep and it has just

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.360 
you down really deep and it has just
amazing<00:02:21.150> detecting<00:02:21.900> abilities<00:02:22.379> so<00:02:22.890> that's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
amazing detecting abilities so that's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.309 
amazing detecting abilities so that's
why<00:02:23.519> I've<00:02:23.670> really<00:02:24.060> settled<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.599> mine<00:02:24.840> lab<00:02:25.080> is

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
why I've really settled on mine lab is

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.350 
why I've really settled on mine lab is
my<00:02:25.760> choice<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:27.060> detector<00:02:27.830> these<00:02:28.830> are<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:30.090> cost

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
my choice of detector these are the cost

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.989 
my choice of detector these are the cost
headphones<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.260> they're<00:02:31.499> literally<00:02:32.249> bolted

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:32.999 
headphones and they're literally bolted

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.940 
headphones and they're literally bolted
to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.949 
to
this<00:02:35.370> thing<00:02:35.700> here<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> mean<00:02:36.450> they<00:02:36.599> don't<00:02:36.690> come

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
this thing here I mean they don't come

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.410 
this thing here I mean they don't come
off<00:02:36.989> at<00:02:37.319> all<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.010> they<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.610> stay<00:02:38.819> with<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.180> so

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
off at all so they just stay with you so

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.949 
off at all so they just stay with you so
you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.260> wear<00:02:40.530> these<00:02:40.680> underwater<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:44.959> I'm

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
you can wear these underwater and I'm

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.320 
you can wear these underwater and I'm
just<00:02:46.260> not<00:02:46.440> sure<00:02:46.470> what<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.310> think<00:02:47.340> how<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:48.120> is

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
just not sure what to think how this is

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.479 
just not sure what to think how this is
all<00:02:48.480> going<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.780> pan<00:02:49.019> out<00:02:49.230> getting<00:02:49.980> used<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.310> it

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
all going to pan out getting used to it

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.370 
all going to pan out getting used to it
but<00:02:51.080> I'm<00:02:52.080> planning<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.739> trip<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> Lake<00:02:53.310> Tahoe<00:02:53.489> to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
but I'm planning a trip to Lake Tahoe to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
friends to go out and check all this out

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.449 
friends to go out and check all this out
but<00:03:15.299> an<00:03:15.930> amazing<00:03:16.260> detector<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.010> mean<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.310> can

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
but an amazing detector I mean you can

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.360 
but an amazing detector I mean you can
literally<00:03:17.760> just<00:03:18.030> take<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.360> underwater<00:03:19.370> and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
literally just take it underwater and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.990 
literally just take it underwater and
I'm<00:03:20.610> just<00:03:20.819> very<00:03:20.910> impressed<00:03:21.569> very<00:03:22.670> glad<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.700> got

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
I'm just very impressed very glad I got

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.210 
I'm just very impressed very glad I got
it<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.349> before<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.440> price<00:03:25.650> went<00:03:25.950> up<00:03:26.010> with

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
it and before the price went up with

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.729 
it and before the price went up with
inflation<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.819> everything<00:03:27.560> $1,200

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
inflation and everything $1,200

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.970 
inflation and everything $1,200
so<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.720> think<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.930> worthwhile<00:03:31.110> buy<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.500> got<00:03:31.829> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
so I think a worthwhile buy I got the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.580 
so I think a worthwhile buy I got the
10-inch<00:03:32.670> coil<00:03:33.030> by<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.299> way<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.510> decided<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.440> go

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
10-inch coil by the way I decided to go

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.920 
10-inch coil by the way I decided to go
with<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.920> bigger<00:03:35.130> coil<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:36.540> get<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.720> little

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
with the bigger coil to get a little

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.580 
with the bigger coil to get a little
more<00:03:37.049> depth<00:03:37.319> out<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.970> I'll<00:03:39.269> be

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
more depth out of it so I'll be

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.069 
more depth out of it so I'll be
definitely<00:03:40.590> out<00:03:41.269> giving<00:03:42.269> this<00:03:42.389> a<00:03:42.450> try<00:03:42.569> real

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079
