00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
stay bored I won't set off so it could

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:07.570 
stay bored I won't set off so it could
happen<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:58.240> want<00:02:59.240> me<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.420> cut<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.170> time<00:03:06.580> yeah

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
happen it want me to cut the time yeah

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.280 
happen it want me to cut the time yeah
in<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.910> back<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.360> start<00:03:08.630> angling<00:03:08.900> in<00:03:09.140> more

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
in the back you start angling in more

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.930 
in the back you start angling in more
downwards<00:03:11.410> okay<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:13.100> then<00:03:13.250> once<00:03:13.490> I<00:03:13.580> have<00:03:13.610> my

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
downwards okay and then once I have my

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.520 
downwards okay and then once I have my
guideline<00:03:14.390> which<00:03:14.570> is<00:03:14.720> considered<00:03:15.140> my<00:03:15.260> little

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
guideline which is considered my little

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.740 
guideline which is considered my little
mohawk<00:03:15.890> then<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:16.820> would<00:03:17.000> come<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.390> from<00:03:17.630> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
mohawk then I would come in from the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:29.449 
mohawk then I would come in from the
back

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.860
