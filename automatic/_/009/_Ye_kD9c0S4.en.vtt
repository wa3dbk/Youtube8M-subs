were we were like wha what just happened
did<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.409> anything<00:01:16.679> that's<00:01:16.920> kind<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
did we not get anything that's kind of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.050 
did we not get anything that's kind of
unfortunate<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:18.630> um<00:01:18.929> damn<00:01:19.889> guys<00:01:20.279> we<00:01:20.639> got<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
unfortunate but um damn guys we got to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.809 
unfortunate but um damn guys we got to
exotics<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.139> pretty<00:01:22.439> sweet<00:01:22.819> the

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
exotics which was pretty sweet the

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:26.169 
exotics which was pretty sweet the
ironic<00:01:24.389> part<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.049> he<00:01:25.469> needed<00:01:25.679> the

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
ironic part is that he needed the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.730 
ironic part is that he needed the
knucklehead<00:01:27.179> radar<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.020> needed<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.439> Monte

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
knucklehead radar and I needed a Monte

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.359 
knucklehead radar and I needed a Monte
Carlo<00:01:29.060> but<00:01:30.060> no<00:01:30.389> it<00:01:31.259> obviously<00:01:31.829> gives<00:01:32.099> us<00:01:32.249> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
Carlo but no it obviously gives us the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.709 
Carlo but no it obviously gives us the
duplicates<00:01:32.849> but<00:01:33.029> hey<00:01:33.149> I<00:01:33.179> can't<00:01:33.539> complain

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
duplicates but hey I can't complain

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.889 
duplicates but hey I can't complain
though<00:01:34.079> those<00:01:34.289> are<00:01:34.319> good<00:01:34.529> exotics<00:01:35.039> plus<00:01:35.939> they

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
though those are good exotics plus they

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.870 
though those are good exotics plus they
can<00:01:37.139> now<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.439> discarded<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.099> exotic<00:01:38.490> shards

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
can now be discarded for exotic shards

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.519 
can now be discarded for exotic shards
so<00:01:38.969> now<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.689> duplicate<00:01:39.840> exotic

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:40.529 
so now if you get a duplicate exotic

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:43.730 
so now if you get a duplicate exotic
don't<00:01:41.099> worry<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.579> an<00:01:41.670> exotic<00:01:42.060> shard<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> it's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
don't worry it's an exotic shard so it's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 
don't worry it's an exotic shard so it's
I<00:01:43.859> guess<00:01:43.889> it's<00:01:44.219> all<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:45.029> I'm<00:01:45.299> moving

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
I guess it's all right now I'm moving

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.279 
I guess it's all right now I'm moving
into<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.929> second<00:01:46.349> one<00:01:46.499> I<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.700> nice<00:01:48.090> little

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
into the second one I do a nice little

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.159 
into the second one I do a nice little
wave<00:01:49.289> here<00:01:50.039> a<00:01:50.189> double<00:01:51.090> wave<00:01:51.240> actually<00:01:51.569> and

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:52.169 
wave here a double wave actually and

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:54.349 
wave here a double wave actually and
that<00:01:52.740> pops<00:01:53.009> up<00:01:53.189> right<00:01:53.219> there<00:01:53.490> somebody<00:01:54.119> got<00:01:54.270> an
