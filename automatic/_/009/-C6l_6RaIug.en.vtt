00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
central tower to the north which can be

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
accessed best by walking over the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
connecting wall to the east you can also

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.340

walk over the connecting wall to the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.350 
walk over the connecting wall to the
west<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:55.100> this<00:02:55.280> means<00:02:55.550> you<00:02:55.730> have<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.000> cut<00:02:56.210> your

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
west but this means you have to cut your

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.750 
west but this means you have to cut your
way<00:02:56.570> through<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.870> spiderweb<00:02:57.350> which<00:02:58.130> responds

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
way through a spiderweb which responds

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.890 
way through a spiderweb which responds
insanely<00:02:59.270> fast<00:02:59.600> which<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:00.500> be<00:03:00.620> very<00:03:00.920> annoying

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
insanely fast which can be very annoying

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.510 
insanely fast which can be very annoying
sometimes<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.110> takes<00:03:03.350> up<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.680> 10<00:03:04.010> times<00:03:04.220> or

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
sometimes it takes up to 10 times or

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.520 
sometimes it takes up to 10 times or
something<00:03:04.760> it's<00:03:05.480> completely<00:03:06.110> random

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
something it's completely random

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.360 
something it's completely random
it<00:03:07.780> gets<00:03:08.780> pretty<00:03:09.020> aggravating<00:03:09.890> if<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.220> have

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
it gets pretty aggravating if you have

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.780 
it gets pretty aggravating if you have
to<00:03:10.520> do<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.760> every<00:03:11.090> five<00:03:11.330> minutes<00:03:11.750> or<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.790> each

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
to do it every five minutes or so each

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.030 
to do it every five minutes or so each
floor<00:03:14.180> contains<00:03:14.630> one<00:03:14.900> or<00:03:15.050> two<00:03:15.230> giant<00:03:15.590> spiders

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
floor contains one or two giant spiders

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.100 
floor contains one or two giant spiders
but<00:03:16.490> if<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.760> keep<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.180> rotating<00:03:17.390> response

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
but if you keep on rotating response

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.080 
but if you keep on rotating response
it's<00:03:18.470> usually<00:03:18.710> just<00:03:18.950> one<00:03:19.430> by<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.700> time<00:03:19.910> you

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
it's usually just one by the time you

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.070 
it's usually just one by the time you
get<00:03:20.210> back<00:03:20.420> which<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.560> best<00:03:21.770> in<00:03:21.950> my<00:03:22.070> opinion

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
get back which is the best in my opinion

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.810 
get back which is the best in my opinion
usually<00:03:24.080> when<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.320> fight<00:03:24.680> two<00:03:24.920> giant<00:03:25.310> spires<00:03:25.580> at

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
usually when I fight two giant spires at

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.000 
usually when I fight two giant spires at
the<00:03:25.910> same<00:03:26.120> time<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.600> end<00:03:27.050> up<00:03:27.200> wasting<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.680> couple

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
the same time I end up wasting a couple

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
train while I was hunting here I gained

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.610 
train while I was hunting here I gained
around<00:03:41.290> 180<00:03:42.290> K<00:03:42.560> experience<00:03:43.160> per<00:03:43.370> hour

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
around 180 K experience per hour

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.110 
around 180 K experience per hour
sometimes<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.800> had<00:03:45.950> peaks<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.550> little<00:03:46.850> over

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
sometimes I had peaks of a little over

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.470 
sometimes I had peaks of a little over
200<00:03:47.570> K<00:03:47.780> but<00:03:48.320> usually<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:48.920> was<00:03:49.130> just<00:03:49.190> around<00:03:49.700> 180

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
200 K but usually it was just around 180

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.800 
200 K but usually it was just around 180
K<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:52.280> was<00:03:52.520> with<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.970> stamina<00:03:53.360> happy<00:03:53.660> hour

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
K this was with the stamina happy hour

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.070 
K this was with the stamina happy hour
so<00:03:54.350> without<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.860> this<00:03:55.070> would<00:03:55.250> mean<00:03:55.400> around<00:03:56.080> 120

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
so without it this would mean around 120

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.190 
so without it this would mean around 120
K<00:03:57.230> experience<00:03:57.770> per<00:03:57.980> hour<00:03:58.660> this<00:03:59.660> is<00:03:59.840> certainly
