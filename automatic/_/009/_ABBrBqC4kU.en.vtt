00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.730
 Apr of the game show you how to have the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.550
 north clan name on black ops the of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.570
 know everything i'm going to show you that if 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.060
 to you do it like that it will not go 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.439
 so here we can dude our 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.390
 not turned in gold so if I'm doing arrow 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.020
 right on me at the top of the screen it is 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.420
 not in gold first of all to have the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.239
 corner you're going to have to be in a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.120
 clan that is minimum a level 10 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.219
 blackhawks authors 2 either on mw3 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.340
 then when you are in this clan 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.530
 you will go to barracks so 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.770
 even less boring I am leader of the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.780
 prototype clan so level 50 will be the w3 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.640
 is currently at level 7 but that's 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.079
 increases or the movie time you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.830
 look for a club to you can post the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.340
 nature on our clan pocket then 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.380
 you go on when you're in a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.290
 clan you go to the chlorine page and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.430
 look what's the name clan here we 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.340
 we launched this pro with 1 0 here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.159
 you entrance and you see he 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.220
 still not become gold he stays there 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.790
 always normal when you put this 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.520
 amount him when your plan what you 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.369
 will you go either play a game 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.020
 what is he going to automatically 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.280
 or then you go to the menu 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.630
 in the main menu so like a 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.970
 app on black ops of you have to go 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.250
 either in the field or in zombies 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 and then you go back here is a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.060
 once it's done you go back into 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.560
 multiplayer menu you go online and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.049
 the nail closes the clan name a 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.600
 always in yellow in fine gold color 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.939
 we wait about ten seconds more 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.040
 or less the time it gets up to date 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.200
 and here we can see big screen 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.530
 that my plan became gold then 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.530
 after that 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.740
 here you can clearly write 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.790
 anything so I'll read test and 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.200
 everything you write will be in gold 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.150
 that's it but every time you 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.459
 quit game you have your console 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.300
 what are you going to do each time 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.630
 handing over having handed the clan look of the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.100
 Clan for it to again become gold here 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.900
