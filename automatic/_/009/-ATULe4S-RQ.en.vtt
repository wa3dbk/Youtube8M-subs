00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
off in this car let's see what that does

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.180 
off in this car let's see what that does
for<00:04:22.640> me

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
for me

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:32.000 
for me
not<00:04:24.820> going<00:04:25.030> anywhere<00:04:25.390> fast<00:04:25.750> that's<00:04:26.020> for<00:04:26.140> sure

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.850 

whoops<00:04:36.780> Decker<00:04:37.780> engineers<00:04:38.320> tell<00:04:38.560> me<00:04:38.710> they

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
whoops Decker engineers tell me they

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.650 
whoops Decker engineers tell me they
don't<00:04:39.010> do<00:04:39.220> much<00:04:39.430> instrumented<00:04:40.150> testing<00:04:40.510> out

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
don't do much instrumented testing out

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.930 
don't do much instrumented testing out
here<00:04:40.900> at<00:04:40.960> AET<00:04:41.500> it's<00:04:42.100> more<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.430> an<00:04:42.520> organic

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
here at AET it's more of an organic

here<00:04:52.390> in<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:52.570> woods<00:04:52.720> today<00:04:53.110> we've<00:04:53.650> got<00:04:53.770> an<00:04:53.920> MDX

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
here in the woods today we've got an MDX

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.270 
here in the woods today we've got an MDX
this<00:04:55.300> isn't<00:04:55.630> hard<00:04:55.960> core<00:04:56.260> or<00:04:56.470> Land<00:04:56.770> Rover<00:04:57.070> room

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
but this is about as hard as you'd ever

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.040 
but this is about as hard as you'd ever
push<00:04:59.440> an<00:04:59.770> MDX<00:05:00.280> in<00:05:00.400> real<00:05:00.580> life<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.210> they've<00:05:01.870> got

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
push an MDX in real life and they've got

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.470 
push an MDX in real life and they've got
some<00:05:02.200> good<00:05:02.440> ups<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:02.950> downs<00:05:03.130> here<00:05:03.370> some<00:05:03.670> fairly

do's<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:19.300> you<00:05:20.110> can<00:05:20.260> see<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.560> structure<00:05:20.800> feels

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
do's and you can see the structure feels

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.060 
do's and you can see the structure feels
very<00:05:21.370> tight<00:05:22.410> without<00:05:23.410> hearing<00:05:23.650> any<00:05:23.740> creaking

well<00:05:34.939> we<00:05:35.030> saved<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.360> best<00:05:35.389> part<00:05:35.930> of<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.229> test

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
well we saved the best part of the test

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.709 
well we saved the best part of the test
track<00:05:37.370> here<00:05:37.759> for<00:05:38.180> last

00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:40.999 
that's the autocross course the acura

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:43.779 
that's the autocross course the acura
engineers<00:05:41.479> will<00:05:41.719> admit<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:42.800> this<00:05:43.219> is<00:05:43.279> by<00:05:43.550> far

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
engineers will admit that this is by far

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.570

their most favorite part of the AET

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.540 
their most favorite part of the AET
facility<00:05:47.419> because<00:05:48.289> here<00:05:48.650> is<00:05:48.770> where<00:05:49.370> it<00:05:49.460> all

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
facility because here is where it all

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.779 
facility because here is where it all
comes<00:05:49.789> together<00:05:50.080> it's<00:05:51.080> a<00:05:51.259> snow-covered<00:05:52.039> Road

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
comes together it's a snow-covered Road

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.450 
comes together it's a snow-covered Road
course<00:05:53.120> basically<00:05:53.629> it<00:05:54.229> allows<00:05:54.469> them<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:55.039> test

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
course basically it allows them to test

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.179 
course basically it allows them to test
the<00:05:55.580> chassis<00:05:55.849> setup<00:05:56.199> in<00:05:57.199> pretty<00:05:57.740> good<00:05:57.860> safety

00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:58.189 
the chassis setup in pretty good safety

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.480 
the chassis setup in pretty good safety
here<00:05:58.580> it's<00:05:59.270> very<00:05:59.719> slippery<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:00.460> actually<00:06:01.460> a

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
here it's very slippery and actually a

I'm<00:06:28.680> going<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:28.860> put<00:06:29.010> vehicle's<00:06:29.490> ability<00:06:29.640> sit

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
I'm going to put vehicle's ability sit

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.440 
I'm going to put vehicle's ability sit
back<00:06:30.450> on<00:06:30.780> and<00:06:31.590> already<00:06:31.950> raining<00:06:32.790> in<00:06:33.090> the<00:06:33.210> car

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
back on and already raining in the car

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.400 
back on and already raining in the car
I've<00:06:34.050> got<00:06:34.110> my<00:06:34.380> foot<00:06:34.680> now<00:06:34.890> flat<00:06:35.700> on<00:06:35.940> the<00:06:36.030> floor

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
I've got my foot now flat on the floor

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.810 
I've got my foot now flat on the floor
but<00:06:37.410> this<00:06:37.620> is<00:06:37.770> how<00:06:37.950> grandma<00:06:38.400> would<00:06:38.550> like<00:06:38.700> to

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
but this is how grandma would like to

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.630 
but this is how grandma would like to
drive<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.270> TL<00:06:39.600> very<00:06:39.990> comfortably<00:06:40.470> go<00:06:41.400> into<00:06:41.610> a

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
drive the TL very comfortably go into a

drive the TL very comfortably go into a
corner<00:06:41.910> here<00:06:42.060> there's<00:06:42.180> a<00:06:42.210> little<00:06:42.300> bit<00:06:42.450> of<00:06:42.510> ice

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630
