00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 I will try 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.269
 we were 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.129
 now today I decided to 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.010
 to make video that was asked me to 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.110
 a few times on the networks 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.279
 social mainly instagram so if 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.860
 you do not follow me on instagram 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:30.609
 so you should today I go up 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:32.840
 my time routine has to cover 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.660
 maximum coverage jean having it 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.809
 kissed so it's me I'm a 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.339
 person that for some time my 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.050
 poor really better I have a lot 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.690
 fewer acts actually I have a kind has 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.820
 could really be a button here and there 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.329
 once in a while but I have 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.280
 a lot of acne scars then 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.570
 I really try to treat those who 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.699
 really were playing an improvement of 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.469
 mountain but it's really a 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.180
 process that is super long does that my 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.960
 tanned skin still a lot of 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.220
 acne scars then I would like 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.990
 but as camouflage her the most 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.780
 possible without a dollar king or if I 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.130
 find to whom the fact that today I 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.250
 shows as completed and then I think 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.929
 really that's a good way to 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.670
 to do because I find that this is 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.189
 just the only word that comes to me is 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.060
 jean flores l'esm I think it's done 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.490
 really not too much makeup but it 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.960
 camou really ready for anything 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490
 but what is sad about acne is 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.170
 are harder and camouflage others 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.729
 but I really think it's going to be able 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.079
 look is that they have either acne 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.400
 acne scars just a red 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.780
 to prevent a person what has a lot 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.970
 good players too in the face 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.220
 so I would ask you to eat this 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.380
 amount and I 'm wondering about 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.460
 my eyes my eyebrows and my lips but 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.420
 actually my eyes it's really not 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.009
 great thing I wish winga liner at 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.210
 you that's enough does not work I 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.549
 once put six students to do a 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.009
 so end up all I would have 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.090
 used it for my face my eyes my 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.530
 sources lifts me everything must be in 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.469
 the first of a must so what is 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.090
 you want to know you're going to see the 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.680
 gift that his sisters does that if ever 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.180
 you have questions or and it was 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.030
 not in the comments or if you 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.320
 have other stuff or the mistake and that 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.820
 whether for me or to help others 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.470
 people who have more things to 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.000
 camouflage 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.560
 so I really hope it's okay 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.299
 help for me is also at the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.200
 video 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.580
 so what first I start with 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.100
 apply 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.380
 a base that is the perfection of the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.330
 benefit then by matthew lee 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.370
 blender and I applied my background 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.880
 complexion that has remained fabulous 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.910
 covergirl 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.230
 the best technique is really the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.510
 trot humanoids young and deloitte 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.960
 to go fast but it's sure ahead 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.060
 quick 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.830
 it's really peace efforts that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.380
 it's not all the pockets that 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.660
 absorbs the product but which product is 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.890
 would find mass on your skin 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.720
 track and go gradually so 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.960
 to apply or adam to apply 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.970
 after that I used a word cash m 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.100
 of docks in front said that I applied 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.020
 to places that need more than 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.580
 coverage so I applied it with my 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.550
 fingers who said take a brush 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.530
 which is shekels cosmetics then i have 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.970
 really go quietly south 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.440
 go fast because having done but this 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.180
 time to go quietly this is the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.280
 better technique cap remains act 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.080
 take my bus ribes lÃ¤nder for not 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.120
 that it seems too techno laziness 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.470
 or in groups with with my old 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.850
 mill on his part is really pop I 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.370
 do this on both sides of my face on 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.280
 case because I emit mons near home 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.930
 them benteke then I apply them his 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.340
 face if I reach so I ask you 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.660
 not but I'm really waiting for my face 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.519
 be more hawk at all then I have a 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.380
 little little applied of mates who is the 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.680
 high definition carrier of make up for 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.390
 ever 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.130
 I took the main watch 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.950
 my eyes for my stamp but otherwise I have 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.900
 a little paul in the network my face 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.140
 then I take a browser this one 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.209
 it's him from Annabelle and then I 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.470
 does the same farewell technique I 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.730
 thought bondage to have him with me the 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.870
 people but also on a little everyone 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.239
 it's about giving a little bit of 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.730
 color and then after that I take a blush 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.350
 who from nix all your questions on board 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.600
 a wrong step I do not say names anymore 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.550
 everything but it's really a clown 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.010
 allure I would like it even after this 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.930
 that I loved my eliminator so with 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.670
 a brush like this day these two 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.040
 schemas that it's my favorite universe 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.480
 make all the difference so here we go 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.080
 it's not more complicated than that for 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.080
 ride up 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:22.189
 so 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.430
 no 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.260
 so that's all I do 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.480
 to cover all the possible 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.919
 my imperfections 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.060
 I really hope it made 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.840
 years that my death is really the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.120
 best way I learned with 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.310
 the author with acquirers as a 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.800
 well camouflaged all imperfections 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.080
 the trick is really to take his 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.340
 time in having said it with yes it was me 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.560
 really took up time because my 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.150
 nose you pick up speed but that's 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.620
 important to have time to do this 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.500
 quickly otherwise it's really the same 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.040
 who have me personally not sure 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.150
 that it seems too much but samarie but good 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.350
 so that's it I really feel that 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.910
 I had but do not forget what the 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.630
 video it was 10 to see soon 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.630
