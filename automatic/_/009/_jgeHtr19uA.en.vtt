00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.090
 the river suffers marking the presence 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.910
 Brazilian press conference 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.920

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.900
 Adrian speaks fine how it is 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.430
 coming to Rio de Janeiro after 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.860
 an excellent victory there in bell already 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.800
 raised the Brazilian fans how 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.680
 is going on here in January to prohibit 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.399
 confident and know that the rio de janeiro 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.140
 step that I always liked to compete 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.780
 before it was in Santa Catarina and moved to 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.030
 rio de janeiro was here that I 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.389
 I got great victory 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.639
 I have good memories and also 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.710
 confident motivated after my victory 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:53.600
 in bells I know that here is another event 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.389
 another story 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.260
 I know the big stars will compete 

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:02.479
 this edict of difficulty but I hope 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.110
 give my best and I got my 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:08.270
 always within the frame and adriano you 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.400
 it's not pro junior thing won an event 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.010
 that in the river that passed through the recreation 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.850
 of the large had in the post ended in the 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.320
 copa d'or 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.110
 not wanting to know what wave you 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.640
 prefers but the waves the two zones are 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.200
 fun chance of thigh while 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.940
 point guard but what do you think 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.640
 fits in your surf 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:31.760
 I think it will depend a lot on the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.010
 conditions, of course, where will it be 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.250
 the test is going to be the best 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.340
 counting day is a very positive side 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.110
 I believe I fall in the post everything crooked 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.110
 bad scramble is not a better option 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.210
 with certainty the event in other beaches 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.560
 we put on our difficult ones we have 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.659
 a chance to talk on equal terms 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.359
 with the best 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.969
 has a good condition for me 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.549
 independent of the beach that is 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.490
 the proof I hope the waves are good and 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.810
 that is the best option of the day beauty 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.490
