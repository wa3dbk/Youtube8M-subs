a win so I guess I'm pretty happy going
to<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> next<00:00:23.369> game<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.789> noticed<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.439> guys

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
to the next game I noticed that you guys

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.099 
to the next game I noticed that you guys
didn't<00:00:25.949> do<00:00:26.189> much<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.820> typical<00:00:27.150> TSM<00:00:27.720> early

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
didn't do much of the typical TSM early

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.470 
didn't do much of the typical TSM early
aggression<00:00:28.529> well<00:00:29.189> generally<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:29.939> actually

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
aggression well generally we actually

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.749 
aggression well generally we actually
invade<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> lot<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.500> try<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> get<00:00:32.250> upwards<00:00:32.520> but

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
invade a lot and try to get upwards but

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
invade a lot and try to get upwards but
I<00:00:32.820> can't<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.180> kind<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> zone<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
I can't we kind of like the zone up and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.690 
I can't we kind of like the zone up and
then<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.800> didn't<00:00:34.980> even<00:00:35.070> say<00:00:35.250> anything<00:00:35.280> into

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
then we didn't even say anything into

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.880 
then we didn't even say anything into
like<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.059> minute<00:00:36.210> ten<00:00:36.420> seconds<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.440> we

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
like one minute ten seconds so we

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
like one minute ten seconds so we
actually<00:00:38.040> wanted<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> eat<00:00:38.520> Ward<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.940> get

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
actually wanted to eat Ward up get

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.360 
actually wanted to eat Ward up get
Ward's<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.170> fail<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.190> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
Ward's up but we fail to do that and you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.500 
Ward's up but we fail to do that and you
kind<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.610> got<00:00:41.730> punished<00:00:41.910> early<00:00:42.239> game<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
kind of got punished early game I

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.430 
kind of got punished early game I
definitely<00:00:42.719> thought<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.140> were<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.320> trouble

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
definitely thought we were in trouble

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.830 
definitely thought we were in trouble
because<00:00:43.710> mid<00:00:44.430> lane<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.820> lost<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.180> lot<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.570> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
because mid lane just lost a lot and it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.389 
because mid lane just lost a lot and it
could<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> very<00:00:46.440> big<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:46.920> bags<00:00:47.219> can

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
could be a very big because bags can

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.840 
could be a very big because bags can
actually<00:00:47.910> grow<00:00:48.480> min<00:00:48.750> carry<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.700> its<00:00:50.700> really

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
actually grow min carry and its really

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.600 
actually grow min carry and its really
bad<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.469> thought<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.649> could<00:00:53.219> farm<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
bad so I just thought I could farm and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.810 
bad so I just thought I could farm and
probably<00:00:53.850> try<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.539> ki<00:00:54.870> guess<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.680> want<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> talk

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
probably try to ki guess I want to talk

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.150 
probably try to ki guess I want to talk
about<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:57.390> quirky<00:00:57.960> fiddlesticks<00:00:58.590> pick<00:00:58.890> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
philologist beers and his passive

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.210 
philologist beers and his passive
actually<00:01:14.340> lowers<00:01:15.090> mr<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.740> yeah<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.100> really

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
actually lowers mr so yeah it's really

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
actually lowers mr so yeah it's really
strong<00:01:17.400> together<00:01:17.840> fergie<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.869> actually

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
strong together fergie is actually

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.620 
strong together fergie is actually
really<00:01:19.439> Opie<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.070> feet<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.000> match<00:01:21.299> because

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
really Opie and feet that match because

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.590 
really Opie and feet that match because
of<00:01:21.930> try<00:01:22.080> boys<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:24.240> percenter

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
of try boys I think is a one percenter

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600 
of try boys I think is a one percenter
when<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> win<00:01:25.320> percentage<00:01:25.799> why<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.220> seven

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
when I win percentage why not like seven

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.899 
when I win percentage why not like seven
percent<00:01:26.939> after<00:01:27.170> Triforce<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> buck<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
percent after Triforce was a buck so

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.179 
percent after Triforce was a buck so
it's<00:01:30.150> actually<00:01:30.390> pretty<00:01:30.479> big<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.829> now<00:01:32.009> your

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it's actually pretty big and now your

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.520 
it's actually pretty big and now your
next<00:01:32.340> match<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.610> against<00:01:33.360> OMG<00:01:33.869> they're<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
next match is against OMG they're a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
next match is against OMG they're a
really<00:01:35.070> strong<00:01:35.400> team<00:01:35.930> what<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.079> guys

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
doing to prepare for that matchup we're

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.819 
doing to prepare for that matchup we're
probably<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.900> going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.200> try<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> play<00:01:40.710> our

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
probably just going to try to play our

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.289 
probably just going to try to play our
best<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.400> don't<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.030> much

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
best like we don't have that much

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.660 
best like we don't have that much
preparation<00:01:42.540> we're<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.229> gonna<00:01:43.399> ban<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.579> we

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
preparation we're just gonna ban what we

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.630 
preparation we're just gonna ban what we
think<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.000> right

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
think is right

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.580 
think is right
yes<00:01:47.120> who<00:01:47.810> would<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:47.990> say<00:01:48.260> is<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.409> biggest

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
yes who would you say is the biggest

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.660
