some money to try to really hurt Sony or

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.430 
some money to try to really hurt Sony or
Microsoft<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:02.209> what<00:03:02.660> happens<00:03:03.140> if<00:03:03.290> this

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
Microsoft and what happens if this

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.860 
Microsoft and what happens if this
becomes<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:04.040> thing<00:03:04.280> what<00:03:04.520> happens<00:03:04.910> if<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.270> is

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
becomes a thing what happens if this is

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.699 
becomes a thing what happens if this is
offered<00:03:06.410> by<00:03:06.560> other<00:03:06.590> places<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.940> think

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
offered by other places so I think

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.990 
offered by other places so I think
ddosing<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:09.920> whatever<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.610> want<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.820> call<00:03:10.940> it

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
ddosing and whatever you want to call it

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.180 
ddosing and whatever you want to call it
denial<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.660> service<00:03:12.050> attacks<00:03:12.440> these<00:03:13.040> are

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
denial of service attacks these are

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.920 
denial of service attacks these are
going<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.370> become<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.700> regular<00:03:13.940> thing<00:03:14.150> guys<00:03:14.600> and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
going to become a regular thing guys and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.190 
going to become a regular thing guys and
I<00:03:15.200> think<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.560> gaming<00:03:16.630> company<00:03:17.630> Sony<00:03:18.019> and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
I think the gaming company Sony and

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.620 
I think the gaming company Sony and
Microsoft<00:03:18.370> maybe<00:03:19.370> even<00:03:19.640> Nintendo<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.390> valve

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
Microsoft maybe even Nintendo and valve

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.080 
Microsoft maybe even Nintendo and valve
and<00:03:20.959> all<00:03:21.140> these<00:03:21.530> other<00:03:21.590> places<00:03:22.100> are<00:03:22.610> going<00:03:23.030> to

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
and all these other places are going to

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.570 
and all these other places are going to
have<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.450> really<00:03:23.930> sit<00:03:24.200> down<00:03:24.440> maybe<00:03:25.010> even<00:03:25.250> come

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
have to really sit down maybe even come

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.000 
have to really sit down maybe even come
together<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.209> figure<00:03:26.959> out<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.170> way<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.709> stop

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
together and figure out a way to stop

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.880 
together and figure out a way to stop
this<00:03:28.730> I've<00:03:29.450> said<00:03:29.780> my<00:03:29.959> piece<00:03:29.989> on<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.560> lizard
