00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.440 
whatever but he didn't tell me the truth
about<00:02:06.330> their<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.410> hair<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.400> cons<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
about their the hair here we go cons the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.450 
about their the hair here we go cons the
hair<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.820> thin<00:02:11.820> it's<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.690> thin<00:02:12.990> mind<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.130> this

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
hair is thin it's so thin mind you this

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.290 
hair is thin it's so thin mind you this
is<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.650> about<00:02:16.920> three<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.270> half

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
is this is about three and a half

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.970 
is this is about three and a half
bundles<00:02:19.110> with<00:02:20.360> three<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.480> four<00:02:21.750> tracks<00:02:22.740> on

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
bundles with three to four tracks on

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.010 
bundles with three to four tracks on
each<00:02:23.190> braid<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:27.390> Beehive

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
each braid and I have the the Beehive

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.850 
each braid and I have the the Beehive
technique<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.390> that's<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.540> lot<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.750> hair<00:02:31.110> you

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
technique so that's a lot of hair you

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.380 
technique so that's a lot of hair you
would<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.670> lot<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.940> hair<00:02:33.090> because

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
would think it's a lot of hair because

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.990 
would think it's a lot of hair because
actually<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:35.100> whole<00:02:35.310> bunch<00:02:35.490> hair<00:02:35.790> left

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
actually I have a whole bunch hair left

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.530 
actually I have a whole bunch hair left
because<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.230> bundles<00:02:37.710> are<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:39.210> bundles

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
because the bundles are so the bundles

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.650 
because the bundles are so the bundles
of<00:02:39.660> hair<00:02:40.020> there<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.860> long<00:02:41.160> like<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.940> two

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
of hair there so long like it's two

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.380 
of hair there so long like it's two
bundles<00:02:43.110> honestly<00:02:43.710> two<00:02:44.370> levels<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.880> hair<00:02:45.150> will

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
bundles honestly two levels of hair will

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.090 
bundles honestly two levels of hair will
give<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> full<00:02:45.900> weave<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.440> if<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:46.890> want

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
give you a full weave and if you want

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.490 
give you a full weave and if you want
some<00:02:47.400> extra<00:02:47.700> volume<00:02:48.030> than<00:02:48.870> two<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.290> half

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
some extra volume than two and a half

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.420 
some extra volume than two and a half
but<00:02:50.280> two<00:02:51.180> bundles<00:02:51.570> give<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.960> full<00:02:52.170> weave

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
but two bundles give you a full weave

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.699 
but two bundles give you a full weave
but<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.610> my<00:02:53.760> case<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:54.480> got<00:02:55.260> three<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> half

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
but in my case I got three and a half

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.070 
but in my case I got three and a half
and<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.060> all<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.240> got<00:02:57.360> I'm<00:02:57.840> gonna<00:02:57.990> turn

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
pieces in the back somewhere if I can

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.520 
pieces in the back somewhere if I can
fit<00:03:44.910> them<00:03:45.000> because<00:03:45.330> like<00:03:45.480> i<00:03:45.600> said<00:03:45.630> i<00:03:46.050> have

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
one or two more pieces so I can have

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.640 
one or two more pieces so I can have
that<00:03:59.850> whole<00:04:00.120> little<00:04:00.330> full<00:04:00.750> long<00:04:01.080> effect<00:04:01.470> at
