00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.889
 Today I am Marco Aurelio Shannon of info online and today I will show you the 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.160
 performance of this video card that gtx two names five from India up 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.600
 of her who is considered the fastest in the world and made a little Santa Jan 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.800
 now when it was released there masÃ­a this is the biggest fair of technology of the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.990
 United States, this board is a reference version made by 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.910
 video shows manufacturers models 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.930
 so it comes without a very sophisticated finish just with this cover 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.649
 eraser 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.289
 but rather those whose gigantic like every plate made by guinness 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.699
 This one is big, she's got two ex-votos in the office. 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:53.210
 Heck she has two law entries and comes with hdmi no need not use one 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.120
 Adapter for you to connect to the TV with high resolution lights up with a 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:00.089
 machine with intel platform 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.680
 the processor is a quad-core qnn 00 from 2 thousand to 4 gigahertz 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.100
 the memory of 4 gigabytes of three 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.830
 and I thanked for 250g jigs here in the ECU infolab I understand this machine was 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 awesome in the most synthetic minds 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.900
 with 3dmark vantage which is the best work performace with 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.040
 ungrateful in 13 she scored 16 thousand points is more or less double 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.870
 than other boards of the web and also advanced have already done here 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.740
 and in the games there is no discussion to gtx 2 9 5 is even better score than the people 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.630
 have you seen 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.729
 she was able to run the heavier games like this one the call of dutty 5 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.899
 with an average of 75 frames per second is more than enough for you places 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.980
 all settings in paulo 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.270
 and even more absurd was her performance with the crisis 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.030
 the whole plate suffers too much proof of this game more than 100 models of the day made mv 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.730
 this with one foot in the back at about 36 frames per second 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.840
 This plate came to overcome the claw of 4 8 7 0 x 2 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.780
 which used to be the fastest board made by TV 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.709
 so this is a model even if it is for those who want to kick the bucket buy 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.940
 a plate prater for several years if you are interested she has not yet 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.330
 is for sale in Brazil but is preparing to spend about two thousand reais
