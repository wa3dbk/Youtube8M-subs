00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030 

it's<00:01:09.930> part<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.140> nature<00:01:11.440> of<00:01:11.470> practice

it's part of the nature of practice
you've<00:01:12.540> got<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.630> be<00:01:13.720> quick<00:01:13.870> careful<00:01:14.320> about

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
you've got to be quick careful about

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.920 

here<00:01:19.329> we<00:01:19.509> approach<00:01:20.020> for<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.799> bridge

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
here we approach for the bridge

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.900 
here we approach for the bridge
first<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.710> all<00:01:22.770> turn<00:01:23.010> on<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.280> course<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.760> got

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
first we all turn on the course you got

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.260 
first we all turn on the course you got
to<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.120> careful<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.870> because<00:01:24.900> offa<00:01:25.350> me

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
to be very careful here because offa me

it's<00:01:28.710> advice<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.460> very<00:01:30.090> steady

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.450 

now<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.090> can<00:01:35.330> see<00:01:35.540> we're<00:01:35.750> using<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:36.400> 13,000<00:01:37.400> RPM

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
now you can see we're using a 13,000 RPM

up until this point in practice we have

up until this point in practice we have
been<00:01:43.259> only<00:01:43.350> taken<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.070> 12,000<00:01:45.229> trying<00:01:46.229> to
