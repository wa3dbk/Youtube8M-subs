00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.110 

okay<00:00:38.839> for<00:00:39.079> our<00:00:39.109> this<00:00:39.670> box<00:00:40.670> we're<00:00:40.910> going<00:00:41.000> to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
okay for our this box we're going to

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.229 
okay for our this box we're going to
start<00:00:41.780> with<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.079> color<00:00:42.289> side<00:00:42.379> up<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.579> cold<00:00:44.089> in

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
start with the color side up and cold in

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.200 
start with the color side up and cold in
thirds<00:00:44.480> turn<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:45.559> over<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:45.979> then<00:00:46.370> fold<00:00:46.729> these

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
thirds turn it over and then fold these

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.000 
thirds turn it over and then fold these
corners<00:00:47.420> in<00:00:47.809> along<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.320> one-third<00:00:48.649> marks

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
corners in along the one-third marks

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.930 
corners in along the one-third marks
then<00:00:49.609> I'm<00:00:49.729> going<00:00:49.969> to<00:00:50.979> fold<00:00:51.979> one<00:00:52.489> more<00:00:52.519> time

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
then I'm going to fold one more time

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.180 
then I'm going to fold one more time
against<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:53.600> triangle<00:00:54.850> like<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.859> so<00:00:57.859> for

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
against this triangle like so and so for

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
against this triangle like so and so for
each<00:00:58.339> corner

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.700 

you're<00:01:02.210> just<00:01:02.359> folding<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:02.780> corner<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.379> the

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
you're just folding the corner to the

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.740 
you're just folding the corner to the
very<00:01:03.890> middle<00:01:04.189> and<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:04.789> don't<00:01:04.850> have<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.089> mark<00:01:05.420> but

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
very middle and I don't have a mark but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.410 
very middle and I don't have a mark but
you<00:01:06.100> if<00:01:07.100> you'd<00:01:07.220> like<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.490> market<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.060> make

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
you if you'd like the market to make

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.850 
you if you'd like the market to make
sure<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:08.780> absolutely<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.320> center<00:01:09.649> you<00:01:09.740> can

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
sure it's absolutely the center you can

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.830 
sure it's absolutely the center you can
do<00:01:10.009> that<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.960> have<00:01:12.200> those<00:01:12.409> marked<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.840> then

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
do that and have those marked and then

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.889 
do that and have those marked and then
I'm<00:01:15.830> going<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.690> fold<00:01:17.690> this<00:01:18.580> to<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.729> middle<00:01:20.090> so

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
I'm going to fold this to the middle so

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.180 
I'm going to fold this to the middle so
I'm<00:01:20.990> going<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.170> take<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.409> edge<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.590> fold<00:01:22.100> it

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
I'm going to take the edge and fold it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.620 
I'm going to take the edge and fold it
to<00:01:22.340> my<00:01:22.490> one-third<00:01:22.970> mark<00:01:23.270> there<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:26.390> know<00:01:26.450> if

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
to my one-third mark there you know if

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.350 
to my one-third mark there you know if
you<00:01:26.720> invert<00:01:27.049> this<00:01:27.380> like<00:01:27.590> most<00:01:27.799> boxes<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.970> can

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
you invert this like most boxes you can

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.529 
you invert this like most boxes you can
have<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.289> pattern<00:01:31.280> on<00:01:31.429> the<00:01:31.610> inside<00:01:31.909> of<00:01:32.360> the

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
have the pattern on the inside of the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.809 
have the pattern on the inside of the
box<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:33.319> just<00:01:33.470> reverse<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:34.549> give<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.729> a

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
box and so just reverse it and give it a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.359 
box and so just reverse it and give it a
try<00:01:34.970> see<00:01:35.330> if<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.450> like<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:35.959> better<00:01:36.130> okay<00:01:37.130> now

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
try see if you like that better okay now

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.710 
try see if you like that better okay now
that<00:01:37.490> I've<00:01:37.610> got<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:37.819> folded<00:01:38.299> I'm<00:01:38.420> going<00:01:38.630> to

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
that I've got that folded I'm going to

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.130 
that I've got that folded I'm going to
fold<00:01:38.899> once<00:01:39.170> more<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:41.000> line<00:01:41.179> just<00:01:41.600> created

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
fold once more to the line just created

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.760 
fold once more to the line just created
so<00:01:42.859> this<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.130> gonna<00:01:43.250> be<00:01:43.430> my<00:01:43.609> rim<00:01:44.469> and<00:01:45.469> this<00:01:45.590> will

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
so this is gonna be my rim and this will

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.459 
so this is gonna be my rim and this will
hide<00:01:46.009> or<00:01:46.369> conceal<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.630> raw<00:01:47.899> edge<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.409> the

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
hide or conceal the raw edge of the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.940 
hide or conceal the raw edge of the
paper

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
paper

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.149 
paper
so<00:01:49.579> this<00:01:50.030> particular<00:01:50.289> paper<00:01:51.289> doesn't<00:01:51.859> print

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
so this particular paper doesn't print

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.679 
so this particular paper doesn't print
clear<00:01:52.579> to<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.789> edge<00:01:52.909> because<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.329> came<00:01:53.539> out<00:01:53.659> of

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
clear to the edge because it came out of

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.109 
clear to the edge because it came out of
my<00:01:53.840> laser<00:01:54.049> printer<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:55.189> so<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.909> will

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
my laser printer and so this will

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.459 
my laser printer and so this will
conceal<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:56.750> edge<00:01:56.929> and<00:01:57.109> see<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.439> at<00:01:57.560> all<00:01:59.469> same

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
conceal that edge and see it at all same

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.310 
conceal that edge and see it at all same
thing<00:02:00.649> on<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:00.920> side<00:02:01.119> look<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.270> there<00:02:02.509> and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
thing on this side look it there and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.709 
thing on this side look it there and
then<00:02:03.560> it's<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.920> little<00:02:04.039> hard<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.369> see<00:02:04.700> but<00:02:05.000> with

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
then it's a little hard to see but with

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.660 
then it's a little hard to see but with
this<00:02:05.840> pattern<00:02:06.079> paper<00:02:06.409> but<00:02:06.799> I'm<00:02:07.070> also<00:02:07.249> going<00:02:07.579> to

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
this pattern paper but I'm also going to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.080 
this pattern paper but I'm also going to
fold<00:02:08.170> exactly<00:02:09.170> across<00:02:10.100> from<00:02:10.609> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
fold exactly across from the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.560 
fold exactly across from the
intersections<00:02:11.840> where<00:02:12.049> this<00:02:12.850> paper<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.420> mean

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
intersections where this paper is I mean

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.569 
intersections where this paper is I mean
I<00:02:14.750> could<00:02:14.900> open<00:02:15.049> it<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.310> little<00:02:16.370> bit

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
I could open it up it's a little bit

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.809 
I could open it up it's a little bit
easier<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.880> see<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:19.630> sense<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.019> creating<00:02:21.380> a

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
easier to see a sense of just creating a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.420 
easier to see a sense of just creating a
perfect<00:02:22.819> square<00:02:23.000> on<00:02:23.329> those<00:02:23.600> corners

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.500 

before<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.460> crease<00:02:28.760> I'm<00:02:28.970> just<00:02:29.150> checking<00:02:29.390> to

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
before I crease I'm just checking to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.810 
before I crease I'm just checking to
make<00:02:29.570> sure<00:02:29.690> I'm<00:02:29.930> not<00:02:29.980> exceeding<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.220> amount

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
make sure I'm not exceeding the amount

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
make sure I'm not exceeding the amount
what<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.690> wanted<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.050> fold<00:02:40.420> there<00:02:41.420> we<00:02:41.480> go<00:02:41.630> so

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
what I wanted to fold there we go so

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.210 
what I wanted to fold there we go so
I've<00:02:41.930> got<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.320> pattern<00:02:44.770> fold<00:02:45.770> these<00:02:45.950> back

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
I've got that pattern fold these back

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.530 
I've got that pattern fold these back
the<00:02:46.580> way<00:02:46.700> they<00:02:46.880> were<00:02:51.790> now<00:02:52.790> what<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.090> want<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.420> do

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
the way they were now what I want to do

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.790 
the way they were now what I want to do
is<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.780> want<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.460> I<00:02:55.600> want<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.990> basically<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.530> X

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
is I want a I want it basically that X

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.920 
is I want a I want it basically that X
across<00:02:58.760> this<00:02:59.150> in<00:02:59.450> square<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:00.860> can<00:03:01.250> just

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
across this in square so you can just

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.840 
across this in square so you can just
take<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.140> edge<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:04.070> go<00:03:04.340> straight<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
take the edge and go straight to the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.140 
take the edge and go straight to the
corner<00:03:05.410> make<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.620> crease<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.670> then<00:03:07.880> same

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
corner make that crease and then same

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:22.750 
corner make that crease and then same
thing<00:03:08.180> on<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.540> other<00:03:08.570> side<00:03:21.130> take<00:03:22.130> my<00:03:22.370> corner

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
thing on the other side take my corner

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.270 
thing on the other side take my corner
pull<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.810> right<00:03:23.960> to<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.820> opposite<00:03:26.330> corner<00:03:27.050> and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
pull it right to the opposite corner and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.500 
pull it right to the opposite corner and
crease<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.640> I'm<00:03:28.700> not<00:03:28.880> going<00:03:29.150> through<00:03:29.390> the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
crease and I'm not going through the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.140 
crease and I'm not going through the
outside<00:03:29.990> of<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.440> box<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.310> one<00:03:31.730> square

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
outside of the box just that one square

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.600 
outside of the box just that one square
in<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.390> middle<00:03:35.680> sure<00:03:36.709> I'm<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.070> little<00:03:37.400> bit<00:03:37.489> off

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
in the middle sure I'm a little bit off

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.160 
in the middle sure I'm a little bit off
here<00:03:37.910> let's<00:03:38.150> see<00:03:38.239> if<00:03:38.300> I<00:03:38.390> can<00:03:38.540> fix<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.900> just<00:03:38.989> a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
here let's see if I can fix it just a

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.740 
here let's see if I can fix it just a
little<00:03:39.410> bit<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:40.760> go<00:03:40.910> slow<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.330> accurately

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
little bit you go slow and accurately

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:58.209 
little bit you go slow and accurately
you<00:03:42.050> get<00:03:42.260> another<00:03:42.590> box<00:03:42.800> every<00:03:43.459> time

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.520 

this<00:03:59.219> is<00:03:59.370> what<00:03:59.579> we're<00:03:59.730> gonna<00:03:59.790> do<00:04:00.200> okay<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.379> I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
this is what we're gonna do okay so I

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.229 
this is what we're gonna do okay so I
just<00:04:01.950> have<00:04:02.129> a<00:04:02.159> little<00:04:02.340> error<00:04:02.579> there<00:04:02.639> so<00:04:02.999> I

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
just have a little error there so I

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.390 
just have a little error there so I
didn't<00:04:03.870> follow<00:04:04.019> my<00:04:04.109> diagram<00:04:04.650> we're<00:04:05.310> gonna

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
didn't follow my diagram we're gonna

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.489 
didn't follow my diagram we're gonna
flip<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.909> base<00:04:06.090> over<00:04:06.599> I'm<00:04:07.019> gonna<00:04:07.139> flip<00:04:07.349> this

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:07.499 
flip the base over I'm gonna flip this

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.470 
flip the base over I'm gonna flip this
over<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:07.920> when<00:04:08.730> we're<00:04:08.849> finished<00:04:09.030> with<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.299> box

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
over so when we're finished with the box

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.849 
over so when we're finished with the box
this<00:04:09.719> is<00:04:09.780> gonna<00:04:09.989> be<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.170> inside<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.709> you'll

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
this is gonna be the inside so you'll

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.399 
this is gonna be the inside so you'll
see<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.129> pattern<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.719> bottom<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.349> the

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
see the pattern and the bottom of the

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.410 
see the pattern and the bottom of the
box<00:04:13.590> will<00:04:13.799> just<00:04:13.980> be<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.129> white<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:14.819> you<00:04:15.209> can<00:04:15.329> do

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
box will just be the white so you can do

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.539 
box will just be the white so you can do
it<00:04:15.450> either<00:04:15.599> way<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.840> want<00:04:16.139> but<00:04:16.310> this<00:04:17.310> wasn't

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
it either way you want but this wasn't

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.969 
it either way you want but this wasn't
paying<00:04:17.820> attention<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.239> my<00:04:18.419> diagram<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.889> what

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
paying attention to my diagram so what

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.650 
paying attention to my diagram so what
we're<00:04:20.099> gonna<00:04:20.160> do<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.699> we're<00:04:21.000> gonna<00:04:21.060> take<00:04:21.449> our

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
we're gonna do is we're gonna take our

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.360 
we're gonna do is we're gonna take our
base<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.830> fold<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.550> up<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:24.060> then<00:04:25.190> follow<00:04:26.190> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
base and fold it up and then follow the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.370 
base and fold it up and then follow the
same<00:04:26.610> exact<00:04:26.940> procedure<00:04:29.750> actually<00:04:30.750> one<00:04:31.169> side

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
same exact procedure actually one side

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.120 
same exact procedure actually one side
of<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.590> X<00:04:31.770> here's<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.400> other<00:04:32.520> side<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.740> I'm

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
of the X here's the other side and I'm

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.879 
of the X here's the other side and I'm
just<00:04:35.340> gonna<00:04:35.490> fold<00:04:35.759> this<00:04:35.970> down<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.660> make<00:04:36.780> a

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
just gonna fold this down to make a

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.320 
just gonna fold this down to make a
crease<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:39.169> then<00:04:40.400> once<00:04:41.400> again<00:04:41.520> I'm<00:04:42.150> just

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
crease and then once again I'm just

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.390 
crease and then once again I'm just
going<00:04:42.509> to<00:04:42.539> Pete<00:04:42.780> this<00:04:42.930> now<00:04:43.169> back<00:04:44.160> from<00:04:44.340> the

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
going to Pete this now back from the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.839 
going to Pete this now back from the
beginning<00:04:44.729> so<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.210> was<00:04:45.300> very<00:04:45.750> easy<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.169> fold<00:04:46.349> it

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
beginning so it was very easy to fold it

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.870 
beginning so it was very easy to fold it
at<00:04:47.849> this<00:04:48.120> point<00:04:52.190> what<00:04:53.190> we're<00:04:53.310> gonna<00:04:53.400> do<00:04:53.699> is

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
at this point what we're gonna do is

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.600 
at this point what we're gonna do is
we're<00:04:54.030> gonna<00:04:54.090> fold<00:04:54.479> this<00:04:54.780> tip<00:04:55.320> underneath<00:04:56.099> the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
we're gonna fold this tip underneath the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.070 
we're gonna fold this tip underneath the
underlying<00:04:58.130> rim<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.610> it<00:05:00.030> will<00:05:00.210> conceal<00:05:00.570> the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
underlying rim and it will conceal the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.089 
underlying rim and it will conceal the
raw<00:05:01.259> edge<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.669> will<00:05:02.789> make<00:05:02.940> a<00:05:02.970> nice<00:05:03.180> little

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
raw edge and it will make a nice little

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.279 
raw edge and it will make a nice little
diamond<00:05:05.099> shape<00:05:05.250> or<00:05:05.880> color<00:05:06.240> here<00:05:06.870> at<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.050> end

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
diamond shape or color here at the end

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:13.420 
diamond shape or color here at the end
of<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:08.280> box

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.879 

if<00:05:14.389> you<00:05:14.570> want<00:05:14.750> you<00:05:14.900> can<00:05:15.020> reverse<00:05:15.380> fold<00:05:15.740> this

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
if you want you can reverse fold this

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.129 
if you want you can reverse fold this
first<00:05:16.580> if<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:16.940> want<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.180> see<00:05:17.479> exactly<00:05:17.840> where

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
first if you want to see exactly where

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.670 
first if you want to see exactly where
that<00:05:18.290> crease<00:05:18.770> is<00:05:18.919> going<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.130> be<00:05:20.650> we've<00:05:21.650> got

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
that crease is going to be we've got

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.700 
that crease is going to be we've got
basically<00:05:22.160> concealed<00:05:22.669> this<00:05:22.910> little<00:05:23.240> edge

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
basically concealed this little edge

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.409 
basically concealed this little edge
underneath<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:26.570> it'll<00:05:27.199> you<00:05:27.620> know<00:05:27.710> kind<00:05:27.949> of

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
underneath and it'll you know kind of

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.510 
underneath and it'll you know kind of
secure<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.539> box<00:05:29.720> it'll<00:05:30.110> make<00:05:31.039> it<00:05:31.190> so<00:05:31.340> it<00:05:31.400> will

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
secure the box it'll make it so it will

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.070 
secure the box it'll make it so it will
flop<00:05:32.090> open<00:05:32.300> very<00:05:32.690> easily<00:05:34.090> there's<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.270> end<00:05:35.449> of

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
flop open very easily there's the end of

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.469 
flop open very easily there's the end of
the<00:05:36.229> box<00:05:36.850> there<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:37.940> same<00:05:38.120> thing<00:05:38.300> on<00:05:38.360> the

other side see there make it a little

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.620 
other side see there make it a little
bit<00:05:39.979> easier

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.620

a tiny opposed to edge right here

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.519 
a tiny opposed to edge right here
because<00:06:50.419> you<00:06:50.449> can<00:06:50.659> see<00:06:50.839> wherever<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:51.229> edge<00:06:51.349> of

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:51.529 
because you can see wherever the edge of

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:55.149 
because you can see wherever the edge of
the<00:06:51.589> paper<00:06:51.800> was<00:06:52.129> but<00:06:52.460> if<00:06:52.550> you<00:06:53.949> bolt<00:06:54.949> the

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:55.159 
the paper was but if you bolt the

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.209 
the paper was but if you bolt the
opposite<00:06:55.699> way<00:06:56.180> from<00:06:56.779> the<00:06:56.870> beginning<00:06:57.069> it'll<00:06:58.069> be

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.219 
opposite way from the beginning it'll be

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:00.939 
opposite way from the beginning it'll be
the<00:06:58.610> pattern<00:06:58.879> on<00:06:59.180> the<00:06:59.330> outside<00:06:59.360> and<00:07:00.259> white<00:07:00.889> on

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
the pattern on the outside and white on

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.939 
the pattern on the outside and white on
the<00:07:01.249> inner<00:07:01.520> side<00:07:01.969> and<00:07:01.999> then<00:07:02.539> this<00:07:03.379> will<00:07:03.620> be<00:07:03.740> all

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949 
the inner side and then this will be all

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.769 
the inner side and then this will be all
white<00:07:04.310> so<00:07:04.580> you<00:07:04.610> can<00:07:04.729> can't<00:07:05.120> actually<00:07:05.300> see<00:07:05.629> that

00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:05.779 
white so you can can't actually see that

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:06.909 
white so you can can't actually see that
