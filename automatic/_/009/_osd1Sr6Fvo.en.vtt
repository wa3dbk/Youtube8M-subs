00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello the galley it is passed to this same if the saint germain in laye 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.730
 lhc and prince karim aga who is outclassed rogers certainly 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.130
 christophe willem told how to finally book paris saint germain 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.159
 is only negative effects on the spot 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.159
 so first time I came to saint-jean-de-monts the year 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.849
 I live the mutineers continued on Monday 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.759
 a city near here the games of the sogerma internet race to the sun 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.380
 in the center 1500 that of my twitter change by means of rods of offshoots the 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.570
 25 year old woman whose principle is simple well shot by a kite and 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.890
 and then I worked as a politician can feel my brother 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.260
 there one way is to tackle another opinion 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.670
 you said I will work 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.420
 she outperformed well before that I noticed that it disturbs 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.300
 i loved eddy marnay before cooking sunday remember everything 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.880
 cooking a bit more than usual 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.230
 I loved it I do not really know what I wanted to do in the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.200
 emilie food is done 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.560
 plus some showers 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.739
 the baker 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.739
 I made a small visit to the school jean-zay in saying 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.730
 yes I really flashed on the pastry this creation 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.160
 as for the material and so on but from there I really I got 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.500
 immersed in this craft right away the map 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.619
 first the pastry 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.540
 even for a few years 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.230
 and then very quickly 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.400
 after three-four between my apprenticeship I discovered the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.050
 chocolate then there it was a real revelation 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.010
 both by a witness of the scene because what are you 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.140
 tony m 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.570
 obama at the mouth 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.910
 because chocolate is finished 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.850
 a material that is at once 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.420
 full of delicacy and sensuality and us when we touch chocolate 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.320
 liquid with humans have stopped 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.600
 sl it's a sensation fast enough 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.460
 to define 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.630
 the most - stop all his sensibilities light 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.060
 but I saw right away 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.260
 in addition I learned for this profession of chocolatier teeth 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.520
 in Paris who 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.600
 at the time was not very well known because over 25 years of that is the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.160
 chocolate house 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.410
 that's why i worked with robert bareille his founders of this 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.400
 White House really did give and pass on this passion for chocolate 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.639
 fnaca all we can create tastes 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.239
 where to install them 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.219
 the textures all that was really for me a real revelation 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.739
 very very early 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 halak is a space was you doing now here 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.590
 especially see to choose the raw materials 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.449
 we want to prove that it can provide a roof every day 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.659
 I do a lot of mixtures of red chosen especially I do not know I do 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.589
 no injury fixation 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.929
 in addition to using the club tassel is already there 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.639
 as I move a lot 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.969
 I choose according to what I know it's not the same I pollute more 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.109
 white as india 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.109
 the announced by the vine announced towards the station saint-lazare 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.309
 for this purpose 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:01.689
 because if you reject it no new fat 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.680
 sign on it was the good news to its growth 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.969
 when you vote 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.969
 to see you for example we will learn something 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.739
 still happen in front of 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.459
 it does not hurt you have a headache I did not feel bad at 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.759
 find my lands 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.989
 moreira martin a good chocolate you're not sick you did 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.969
 finish on a good chocolate me a good chocolate dessert that does not make 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.009
 sick soon our colleagues on monday 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.009
 just good 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.949
 prove it the hat that live to disgust 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.000
 dakar between the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.009
 sugar was necessary to chocolate 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.849
 because I would say that simple sugar 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.189
 the chocolate seasoning I think it's a good trottier point is 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.319
 obviously leading chocolate status in two balanced pits 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.839
 it is throughout the year to note the creation of the enclosure 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.439
 that's what I'm looking for it's that right balance 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.930
 between the choice of chocolate raw materials 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.219
 and then all there is adding if they have users 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:55.859
 but not finished 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.749
 cherry bank have all their aromas 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:01.749
 it has been dug up but deplores fresh so they are six 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.339
 without much humility but really readers 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.790
 all this is important why not a good roast chicken without a word for them 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.930
 drives and palavas the grenadiers gave the hug one is broke down 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.500
 these elements earth saturday 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.739
 for my part I do not hear anything saying that 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:18.699
 but you have to do it 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.120
 a strong country for the taste to do it 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.789
 allard it looks very interesting I loved singing
