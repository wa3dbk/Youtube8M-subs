tessellation computing as good as and
video<00:03:10.970> cards<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.599> this<00:03:11.780> game<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:11.959> optimized

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
video cards so this game is optimized

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.490 
video cards so this game is optimized
for<00:03:12.709> Nvidia<00:03:13.640> guards<00:03:13.970> that's<00:03:14.209> why<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.599> get<00:03:14.810> so

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
for Nvidia guards that's why we get so

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.270 
for Nvidia guards that's why we get so
much<00:03:15.680> little<00:03:15.950> FPS<00:03:16.430> because<00:03:17.300> tessellation<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
much little FPS because tessellation the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.400 
much little FPS because tessellation the

best resolution tessellation value is s

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.350 
best resolution tessellation value is s
is<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.700> high<00:03:22.910> as<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:23.989> say<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.880> I<00:03:26.180> am

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
is so high as you can say that so I am

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.660 
is so high as you can say that so I am
going<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.720> be<00:03:26.780> setting<00:03:27.049> it<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.290> 16x<00:03:27.799> to<00:03:28.099> show

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
going to be setting it to 16x to show

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.690 
going to be setting it to 16x to show
you<00:03:28.730> there<00:03:29.209> are<00:03:29.420> two<00:03:29.780> phones<00:03:30.170> but<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.370> can

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
you there are two phones but you can

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.289 
you there are two phones but you can
decrease<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.420> X<00:03:32.840> well<00:03:33.560> into<00:03:34.010> X<00:03:34.190> +<00:03:34.430> 4<00:03:34.640> X<00:03:34.790> +<00:03:34.940> 6<00:03:35.120> X

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
decrease it to X well into X + 4 X + 6 X

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.500 
decrease it to X well into X + 4 X + 6 X
I<00:03:35.420> saw<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:37.069> hair<00:03:37.340> just<00:03:37.790> got<00:03:38.060> messed<00:03:38.329> up
