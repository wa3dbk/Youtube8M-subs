00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
also because it has the glitter in it

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.770 
also because it has the glitter in it
you're<00:02:15.700> gonna<00:02:15.790> want<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.120> make<00:02:16.300> sure<00:02:16.600> that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
you're gonna want to make sure that

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.020 
you're gonna want to make sure that
you're<00:02:16.930> adding<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.320> little<00:02:17.620> bit<00:02:17.770> more<00:02:17.920> than<00:02:18.880> you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
you're adding a little bit more than you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.050 
you're adding a little bit more than you
had<00:02:19.180> previously<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:20.020> black<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.790> go<00:02:21.940> ahead

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
had previously with black so go ahead

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.400 
had previously with black so go ahead
and<00:02:22.210> layer<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.080> coat<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.940> then<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:26.200> all

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
the shadows they obviously dry pretty

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.490 
the shadows they obviously dry pretty
instantly<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.080> go<00:02:29.170> ahead<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.410> keep

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.580 

make<00:02:55.120> sure<00:02:55.270> with<00:02:55.510> your<00:02:55.810> shatter<00:02:56.230> you're

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
make sure with your shatter you're

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.710 
make sure with your shatter you're
always<00:02:56.800> putting<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.820> lid<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.180> immediately

always putting the lid on immediately

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.290 
always putting the lid on immediately
after<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.500> the<00:03:00.070> shade<00:03:00.400> doesn't<00:03:00.760> dry<00:03:00.910> up<00:03:01.090> and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
after so the shade doesn't dry up and

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.490 
after so the shade doesn't dry up and
you<00:03:01.360> can<00:03:01.510> see<00:03:01.660> they've<00:03:01.960> already<00:03:02.140> started

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
you can see they've already started

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.470 
you can see they've already started
shattering<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.220> they<00:03:03.970> show<00:03:04.180> through<00:03:04.450> a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
shattering and they show through a

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.270 
shattering and they show through a
little<00:03:04.870> bit<00:03:05.050> with<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.380> pastel<00:03:05.830> shades

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.470 
mermaids tears here's an up close look
on<00:03:46.130> four<00:03:46.400> different<00:03:46.520> ways<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.820> wear<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.180> shatter

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
on four different ways to wear a shatter

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.940 
on four different ways to wear a shatter
on<00:03:47.690> top<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.050> Pirates<00:03:48.350> collection<00:03:48.770> and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
on top of the Pirates collection and

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.910 
on top of the Pirates collection and
other<00:03:49.250> OPI<00:03:49.610> shade<00:03:50.230> first<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.500> can<00:03:51.620> go<00:03:51.710> ahead

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
other OPI shade first you can go ahead

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.470 
other OPI shade first you can go ahead
and<00:03:52.070> take<00:03:52.250> four<00:03:52.550> of<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.760> shades<00:03:52.790> from<00:03:53.270> the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
and take four of the shades from the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.870 
and take four of the shades from the
collection<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.170> go<00:03:54.410> ahead<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.980> polish<00:03:55.550> those

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
collection and go ahead and polish those

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.630 
collection and go ahead and polish those
on<00:03:56.180> kind<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.050> in<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.560> grid<00:03:57.860> pattern<00:03:58.220> underneath

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
on kind of in a grid pattern underneath

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.160 
on kind of in a grid pattern underneath
and<00:03:58.940> then<00:03:59.150> go<00:03:59.240> ahead<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.540> put<00:03:59.630> shatter<00:03:59.840> over

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
and then go ahead and put shatter over

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.110 
and then go ahead and put shatter over
it<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:00.770> you<00:04:00.830> have<00:04:01.220> shatter<00:04:01.550> in<00:04:01.790> four<00:04:02.030> different

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
it so you have shatter in four different

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.040 
it so you have shatter in four different
shades<00:04:02.510> showing<00:04:02.990> through<00:04:04.630> next<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:05.810> can<00:04:05.930> go

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
shades showing through next you can go

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.720 
shades showing through next you can go
ahead<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.230> take<00:04:06.440> shatter<00:04:06.740> and<00:04:07.070> instead<00:04:07.610> of

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
ahead and take shatter and instead of

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.760 
ahead and take shatter and instead of
applying<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.210> top<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.630> bottom<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:09.110> can<00:04:09.470> apply

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
applying it top to bottom you can apply

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.620 
applying it top to bottom you can apply
it<00:04:09.830> diagonally<00:04:10.580> across<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:11.000> nail<00:04:11.210> so<00:04:11.510> it

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
it diagonally across the nail so it

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.660 
it diagonally across the nail so it
makes<00:04:11.810> more<00:04:12.020> of<00:04:12.080> like<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.320> zig<00:04:12.650> zaggy<00:04:12.920> kind<00:04:13.400> of

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
makes more of like a zig zaggy kind of

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.780 
makes more of like a zig zaggy kind of
separation<00:04:14.360> as<00:04:14.510> opposed<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:16.549> straight

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
separation as opposed to the straight

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.030 
separation as opposed to the straight
up-and-down<00:04:17.120> lines<00:04:17.630> it's<00:04:17.930> you're<00:04:18.620> used<00:04:18.830> to

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
up-and-down lines it's you're used to

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.150 
up-and-down lines it's you're used to
another<00:04:19.970> way<00:04:20.239> is<00:04:20.480> just<00:04:20.989> applying<00:04:21.590> shatter<00:04:21.950> on

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
another way is just applying shatter on

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.850 
another way is just applying shatter on
the<00:04:22.280> tip<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:23.390> if<00:04:23.480> you<00:04:23.600> have<00:04:23.840> an<00:04:24.140> ice<00:04:24.320> cream<00:04:24.620> base

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
the tip so if you have an ice cream base

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.880 
the tip so if you have an ice cream base
and<00:04:25.250> then<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.700> shatter<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.600> has<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.530> nice

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
and then the shatter it has a nice

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.230 
and then the shatter it has a nice
texture<00:04:28.370> contrast<00:04:29.920> and<00:04:30.920> lastly<00:04:31.430> instead<00:04:32.090> of

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
texture contrast and lastly instead of

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.960 
texture contrast and lastly instead of
as<00:04:32.390> mentioned<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.050> applying<00:04:33.650> shatter<00:04:34.550> from

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
as mentioned you applying shatter from

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.150 
as mentioned you applying shatter from
top<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.240> bottom<00:04:35.440> you<00:04:36.440> can<00:04:36.590> go<00:04:36.680> ahead<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:37.010> apply

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
top to bottom you can go ahead and apply

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.130 
top to bottom you can go ahead and apply
