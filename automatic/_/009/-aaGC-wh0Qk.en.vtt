00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 yeah lately any game with 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.440
 the mention of the walking dead reminds 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.590
 item xii and it quotes success 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.200

 it certainly sounds loud but it is here 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.650
 This is not about graphics developers and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.590
 go labs say a game process 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.529
 There are already games that boast about their 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.630
 realism of the zombie apocalypse, they say everything is like 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.210
 in reality but in reality we see either 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.020
 poor implementation of the idea or not that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.629
 arcade 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.090
 state of dk stakes on logic 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.520
 happening for example when real 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.320
 the invasion of zombies man will not scorch 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.660
 in all directions with an infinite supply 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.510
 patrons in most cases he doesn't 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.969
 will find a clothing store weapons like this 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 happens in other games or to sit in 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.859
 random car he won't have her 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.340
 first put together i hope you understand about 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.710
 than me 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.140
 toy state of the wild we will see the reality 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.450
 present zombie apocalypse when 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 the character will be exhausted to weaken and 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.140
 tired but it does not mean that the state of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.939
 such a clone of daisy 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.750
 adair love will make the game they 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.120
 professional trainer 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.030
 cars are the main means of transportation 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.820
 our hero in one case a car can 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.430
 become a means of salvation in another coffin 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.650
 on wheels however you can always you 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.350
 insure your partner but no one 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.140
 forbids being a lone wolf big 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.400
 the role is played by the building and their fortifications 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.590
 some time 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.350
 from a small simple house you can 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.050
 build a good fortress you can 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.830
 leave there your stockpiles of weapons and 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.080
 cars 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.630
 also do not forget about others 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.330
 survivors in all homes can go and 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.660
 search them well if you know what 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.970
 I 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.060
 at the moment it is known that the game will be 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.350
 produced as a single 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.600
 multiplayer mode of its setting 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.390
 will be available later on the official 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.400
 data for this is already preparing the server on 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.210
 Based on the above, you can do 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.550
 the conclusion that it is optics, a mixture of sensors 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.830
 and year 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.360
