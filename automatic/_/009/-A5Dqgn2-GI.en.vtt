00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
the story he'll watch the shed up the

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.230 
the story he'll watch the shed up the
shutout<00:06:11.690> only<00:06:12.440> comes<00:06:12.710> into<00:06:13.099> play<00:06:13.460> when<00:06:14.090> the

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
shutout only comes into play when the

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.999 
shutout only comes into play when the
bats<00:06:14.419> on<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:14.930> ground<00:06:15.139> the<00:06:15.349> ball<00:06:15.470> hits<00:06:15.710> there
