00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.360 
core clocked at something I'll check
that<00:00:33.260> 2.6<00:00:34.260> maybe<00:00:34.710> gigahertz<00:00:35.040> um<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:37.710> had<00:00:37.980> 4

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
that 2.6 maybe gigahertz um it had 4

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360 
that 2.6 maybe gigahertz um it had 4
gigs<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.760> ddr2<00:00:39.469> 800<00:00:40.469> megahertz<00:00:40.739> or<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> minute

gigs of ddr2 800 megahertz or a minute

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
gigs of ddr2 800 megahertz or a minute
but<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.610> stuck<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.899> RAM<00:00:43.050> from<00:00:43.200> my<00:00:43.350> old

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
but I stuck in the RAM from my old

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.190 
but I stuck in the RAM from my old
machine<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.309> 8<00:00:44.670> mega<00:00:45.149> 8<00:00:45.450> gigabytes<00:00:45.960> of

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
ddr2 800 megahertz Ram so now that's

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.830 
ddr2 800 megahertz Ram so now that's
what's<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.850> even<00:00:51.719> though

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
what's going on with this even though

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
what's going on with this even though
this<00:00:52.020> machine<00:00:52.440> officially<00:00:52.949> does<00:00:53.100> not<00:00:53.250> support

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
this machine officially does not support

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
of RAM it does in fact work so if you

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.290 
of RAM it does in fact work so if you
ever<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.579> does<00:00:59.789> support

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
ever have one of these it does support

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
ever have one of these it does support
it<00:01:00.480> well<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> doesn't<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.260> support<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.129> but

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it well it doesn't like support it but

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.270 
it well it doesn't like support it but
it<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.149> run<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.690> fine<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.830> no<00:01:04.949> issues

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
it can run it just fine with no issues

it can run it just fine with no issues
it's<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.420> nice<00:01:06.600> graphics<00:01:07.260> card

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470

it's got a really nice graphics card
it's<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.100> bit<00:01:08.310> old<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.909> pretty<00:01:09.330> powerful

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it's a bit old but it's pretty powerful

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.719

connect it and it also has support for
SLI<00:01:22.950> which<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.549> nice<00:01:35.600> then<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.720> stuck<00:01:37.049> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
SLI which is really nice then I stuck in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.710 
SLI which is really nice then I stuck in
and<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.860> already<00:01:38.009> had<00:01:38.280> an<00:01:38.520> wireless<00:01:39.479> card

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and then it already had an wireless card

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.480 
and then it already had an wireless card
which<00:01:39.960> has<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> broken<00:01:40.500> antenna<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.310> works

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
which has a broken antenna but it works

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.840 
which has a broken antenna but it works
just<00:01:41.579> fine

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just fine

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.020 
just fine
um<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> main<00:01:44.340> reason<00:01:44.729> why<00:01:44.850> they

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
um and then the main reason why they

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.940 
um and then the main reason why they
probably<00:01:45.360> tossed<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.750> thing<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.110> there's<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
probably tossed this thing out there's a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.920 
probably tossed this thing out there's a
CPU<00:01:47.369> fan<00:01:48.140> if<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.409> were<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.070> stop<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.240> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
CPU fan if I were to stop this here you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.300 
CPU fan if I were to stop this here you
will<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.829> missing<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.280> couple

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
will see that it's missing a couple

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.149 
will see that it's missing a couple
blades<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.570> screwed<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.740> tight<00:01:56.009> as

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
blades but I screwed it down as tight as

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.480 
blades but I screwed it down as tight as
possible<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.880> doesn't<00:01:57.149> vibrate<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.750> all

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
possible so it doesn't vibrate at all

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.649 
possible so it doesn't vibrate at all
just<00:01:59.490> some<00:01:59.670> minor<00:01:59.909> vibrations<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.570> it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
just some minor vibrations but it

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.209 
just some minor vibrations but it
doesn't<00:02:00.899> make<00:02:00.990> any<00:02:01.110> loud<00:02:01.439> noises<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.100> it's

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
doesn't make any loud noises so it's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.240 
doesn't make any loud noises so it's
fine<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:03.360> then<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> had<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.869> replace<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
fine and then I had to replace the the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.340 
fine and then I had to replace the the
rear<00:02:05.430> fan<00:02:05.759> which<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.509> thing<00:02:06.780> because

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
rear fan which was this thing because

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.650 
rear fan which was this thing because
it's<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:08.220> sticky<00:02:08.759> stuck<00:02:09.330> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it's like it's really sticky stuck and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.809 
it's like it's really sticky stuck and
there's<00:02:10.379> causing<00:02:10.739> system<00:02:11.069> fan<00:02:11.250> failure<00:02:11.640> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
there's causing system fan failure so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.290 
there's causing system fan failure so
I'm<00:02:11.910> gonna<00:02:12.030> squirt<00:02:12.360> some

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
I'm gonna squirt some

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.960 
I'm gonna squirt some
wd-40<00:02:13.990> in<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.460> running<00:02:15.640> again

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
wd-40 in that and get that running again

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
fresh install we wouldn't know so it's

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.770

um<00:03:44.070> but<00:03:45.070> yeah<00:03:45.250> that's<00:03:45.430> basically<00:03:45.550> it<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.630> this

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
um but yeah that's basically it so this

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.020 
um but yeah that's basically it so this

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
line might turn into a home theater PC

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.690 
line might turn into a home theater PC
for<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.360> area<00:03:49.720> over<00:03:49.959> there<00:03:50.140> or<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.890> don't<00:03:51.610> know

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
for the area over there or I don't know

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.320 
for the area over there or I don't know
what<00:03:51.820> I'm<00:03:51.910> gonna<00:03:52.090> do<00:03:52.300> with<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.480> but<00:03:53.190> yeah

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
now what's gonna replace the CPU fence

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.600 
now what's gonna replace the CPU fence
with<00:03:58.090> this<00:03:58.330> one<00:03:58.540> from<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.920> computer<00:04:00.370> but<00:04:00.550> I

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
with this one from that computer but I

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.970 
with this one from that computer but I
realized<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.270> is<00:04:01.330> actually<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.980> 92

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
realized that this is actually a 92

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.460 
realized that this is actually a 92
millimeter<00:04:03.430> fan<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.000> one<00:04:04.120> in<00:04:04.270> there<00:04:04.470> by

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
millimeter fan and the one in there by

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.610 
millimeter fan and the one in there by
my<00:04:05.650> foot<00:04:05.920> there's<00:04:06.130> an<00:04:06.250> 80<00:04:06.430> millimeter<00:04:06.880> fan<00:04:07.620> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
my foot there's an 80 millimeter fan and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.660 
my foot there's an 80 millimeter fan and
it<00:04:08.800> doesn't<00:04:09.070> fit<00:04:09.280> also<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.820> has<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.080> weird<00:04:11.670> 5-pin

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
it doesn't fit also it has a weird 5-pin

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.030 
it doesn't fit also it has a weird 5-pin
connector<00:04:12.700> an<00:04:13.239> orphan<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.530> does<00:04:14.890> not

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
connector an orphan so that does not

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.199 
connector an orphan so that does not
work<00:04:16.739> but<00:04:17.739> yeah<00:04:18.340> I'm<00:04:18.459> probably<00:04:18.669> gonna<00:04:18.880> order<00:04:19.090> a
