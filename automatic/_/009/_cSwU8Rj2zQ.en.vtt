00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.630
 Imagine 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.380
 multi-storey house without a roof or veranda 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.200
 or bath 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.260
 Agree to the sight of sad snow rain 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.510
 all head cold and unpleasant means 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.930
 what happens without quality reliable 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.580
 the roof in our life is nowhere but here 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.289
 what does quality show 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.650
 experiment and our correspondent 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.689
 the truth is somewhere near about how 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.399
 produced ondulin roofing sheets we 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.710
 already shows now it's time 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.960
 test this material for strength and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.969
 reliability for comparison we take a sheet 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.370
 metal tiles and profile iron 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.739
 let's find out which roof is best 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.520
 stand there 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.800
 first test of strength for the experiment 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.860
 we use a pipe half meter long 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.370
 and the ball weighing 1 kilogram ball run 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.949
 perpendicular to the ground in the edge 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.629
 metal profile from hitting the right sheet and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.629
 metal tiles remain noticeable 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.420
 dents after the first rain these places 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.060
 begin to fry but ondulin at least 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.560
 what are the balls of the pipe 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.210
 it's all nice but better 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.130
 conduct an experiment hereby 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 tool but even hammer punch 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.450
 ondulin was not so easy to be 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.260
 assume that the strength test passed 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.750
 successful second fire test resilience 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.660
 Imagine if the burning hit the roof 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.390
 ferrer and a rare occasion in the New Year 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.340
 holidays on the idea of such a flame this 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.010
 the material should catch fire all the same 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.440
 cellulose is not metal but as we see it 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.350
 there is no worst thing that can 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:54.370
 happen is hot coals hit on 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:55.690
 try to add it to the roof of your house 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.490
 ignition liquids 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:08.440
 ondulin really stand look at 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:10.840
 hot coals did not fit ondulin there 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.970
 slightly melted but retained its shape 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.240
 however for the following experiments we 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.709
 have to take a new sheet usually roofing 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.780
 moisture in places where 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.330
 installed fasteners now we will check 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.840
 whether ondulin will leak in that place where 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.370
 nails hammered 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.500
 3 test water tightness for mounting 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.360
 Ondulin sheets and use special 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.190
 nails with plastic plugs 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.530
 it not only protects roofs 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.239
 leaks but also looks neat on 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.550
 actually the secret of water sustainability 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.250
 ondulina is simple bitumen which is impregnated 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.910
 sheet as if welded nail and water 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.440
 just can't get under the roof 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.220
 what do we clearly see that instead of without 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.630
 insults and nails there is not one for swelling 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.150
 besides ondulin unlike 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.640
 metal roof significantly reduces 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.200
 noise from falling water 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.000
 ondulin better noise reduction because of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.489
 first he's thicker stuff in 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.500
 compared to metal it is 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.190
 multi - component material coming off there 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.680
 composed 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.880
 it is cellulose i.e. by themselves these 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.940
 materials are 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.730
 noise absorbing while metal 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.590
 much louder well then ondulin with 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.080
 passed the test of fire 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.280
 water and even hammer and deservedly 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.280
 gets copper pipes
