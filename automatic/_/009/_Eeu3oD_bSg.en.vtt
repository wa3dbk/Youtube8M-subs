00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.640
 hi to all the boys I am emilio 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.380
 room 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.509
 mania 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.419
 and today word videorecensioni of this 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.419
 excellent speaker of all being able to news 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.180
 he has been looking for a radio one for a while 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.100
 good water resistant speaker 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.390
 quality I finally found this 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 device 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.989
 be careful though it is water resistant 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.210
 it is not said that you can immerse it 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.100
 in the water it simply resists the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.690
 splash so avoid bathing 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.159
 this speaker is not limited to just 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.170
 let us listen to the music but also 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.239
 another hidden gift that is short 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.610
 I will show first but let's talk about the 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.140
 content of the package which is limited 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:07.340
 simply with a cable with which 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 we can recharge it through a special one 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:30.409
 door I can here are instructions 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:31.399
 basic that they could honestly also 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.780
 to do without 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.420
 the operation in fact quite 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.420
 intuitive that is simply enough 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:45.020
 turn it on by holding on to this 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.329
 button to the sound we could connect it 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.740
 via bluetooth to the device I use 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:54.219
 my iphone for simplicity 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.219
 here it is 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.500
 here now the device is already 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.380
 connected is ready for use now 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:21.850
 through the appropriate buttons we could 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:24.310
 put early change song by holding 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.180
 held down 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.150
 the back button and forward increase by 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.650
 volume that I have to say surprised me in 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.280
 as for power 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.000
 because my only doubt was really 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.860
 the volume was high enough to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.980
 allow listening in the shower e 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.200
 I must say that it is quite high though 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.330
 is more we increase the volume of the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.140
 quality 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.060
 decreases but a function more than a 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.560
 this device is given by 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.239
 possibility to receive and carry out 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:08.049
 calls included a microphone 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.510
 which will allow us to talk on the phone 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.950
 our how they work in practice if 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.780
 we hold this button down him 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.980
 will automatically carry out the last one 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:25.330
 call because we did in mine 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.480
 If the 119 just to hang up 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.850
 simply press evelyn hunted 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.730
 to answer the same thing if there 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.380
 they call just press the e button 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.709
 speaking another way is that of 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.739
 double key ie if we press two 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.420
 sometimes it is activated siri therefore theoretically 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:53.220
 We could also send a message 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.220
 now I don't know what he understood but 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:01.120
 perfect goes well what about guys 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.950
 certainly among the strengths of 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.709
 this device we find the good 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.970
 general construction quality la 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.600
 possibility to make and receive 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.850
 call a high volume I have to say 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.510
 does his job properly 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.400
 this sucker that allows us to 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.690
 apply it to smooth walls such as can 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.850
 be the shower cubicle or for example 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.320
 this is a glass splinter and I have to 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.190
 say 28 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.660
 he also does his duty 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.380
 last point in favor but no less 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.979
 important the price the price indeed is 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.740
 of only 19 euros 19 euros is possible 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.949
 buy it on amazon oe bay 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.580
 But let's move on to the negative sides 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:52.160
 one of these in my opinion is 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.940
 excessive recharging time indeed 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.620
 to recharge it one hundred percent 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.960
 we need a full six hours of 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:05.740
 recharge for a range that fluctuates 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:08.570
 between three and four hours but having said that 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.610
 obviously over 10 m 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.410
 the device does not work but this 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.740
 it's more of a technology limit 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.990
 bluetooth which is of the device itself 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.210
 so summing up I find this 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.250
 device is great for everyone 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.990
 who want to listen to some music a 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.880
 sea ​​or in the shower 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.400
 especially considering the excellent 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.750
 value for money a design 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.000
 I have to say pretty much nothing cute 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.080
 I hope this video was there 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.729
 useful if you want if you have inquiries 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.070

 follow us his techmania and the next 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:07.040
