st it's got a little bit shorter
wheelbase<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.780> designed<00:00:34.140> more<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.350> actual

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
wheelbase it's designed more for actual

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.830

racing with that shorter wheelbase it's

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.990 
racing with that shorter wheelbase it's
got<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> better<00:00:37.230> turn<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.680> ratio<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.640> well<00:00:38.820> as

got a better turn in ratio as well as

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729 
got a better turn in ratio as well as
just<00:00:39.180> better<00:00:39.360> handling<00:00:39.750> overall<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
just better handling overall it's a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.170 
just better handling overall it's a
little<00:00:40.920> bit<00:00:41.040> redesigned<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.789> based<00:00:41.969> off<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
little bit redesigned and based off of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.420 
little bit redesigned and based off of
our<00:00:42.450> buggy<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.289> it's<00:00:43.590> actually<00:00:43.829> quite<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> bit

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
our buggy so it's actually quite a bit

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.270 
our buggy so it's actually quite a bit
stronger<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.120> very<00:00:45.840> well<00:00:46.020> balanced<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.100> we

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
stronger and very well balanced and we

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.380 
stronger and very well balanced and we
take<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> empower<00:00:47.820> point<00:00:47.999> comes<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.269> there

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
take the empower point comes in there

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.889 
take the empower point comes in there
the<00:00:48.809> coming<00:00:49.109> stock<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.879> XDM<00:00:50.879> 24/7<00:00:51.629> which

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the coming stock is that XDM 24/7 which

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.360 
the coming stock is that XDM 24/7 which
has<00:00:52.050> been<00:00:52.199> real<00:00:52.379> reliable<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:52.980> us<00:00:53.100> everybody

great power now whether it be a pro kit
version<00:00:57.469> we<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.499> thinking<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.100> pro<00:00:59.280> kit

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
version we are thinking about a pro kit

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.950 
version we are thinking about a pro kit
version<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.390> hasn't<00:01:00.569> been<00:01:00.780> officially

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
version that hasn't been officially

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110 
version that hasn't been officially
decided<00:01:01.469> yet<00:01:01.710> we're<00:01:02.010> dealing<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> ready

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
to run first of all but there's always

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.170 
to run first of all but there's always
hope<00:01:04.800> for<00:01:05.100> another<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.489> all<00:01:05.820> right<00:01:05.940> sounds

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
hope for another one all right sounds

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
hope for another one all right sounds
good<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:06.420> let's<00:01:06.570> talk<00:01:06.720> crawler<00:01:07.050> well<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
good now let's talk crawler well the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.160 
good now let's talk crawler well the
crawler<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.550> new<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.880> us<00:01:08.909> we've<00:01:09.570> decided<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
crawler is new for us we've decided that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.370 
crawler is new for us we've decided that
the<00:01:10.740> market<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.190> definitely<00:01:12.260> allowing<00:01:13.260> an

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the market is definitely allowing an

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.380 
the market is definitely allowing an
extra<00:01:13.620> problem<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.040> come<00:01:14.190> into<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.210> what

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
extra problem to come into it and what

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
extra problem to come into it and what
we've<00:01:15.540> decided<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.650> basically<00:01:17.010> come<00:01:17.400> out

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
we've decided is to basically come out

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.340 
we've decided is to basically come out
with<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.760> unlimited<00:01:18.120> class<00:01:18.330> or<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.870> supersize

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
with the unlimited class or a supersize

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
with the unlimited class or a supersize
class<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.880> aluminum<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.900> can

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
class this one is all aluminum you can

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.780 
class this one is all aluminum you can
see<00:01:22.140> from<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.410> articulation<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.250> has<00:01:23.400> quite<00:01:23.760> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
see from the articulation it has quite a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510 
see from the articulation it has quite a
bit<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.230> maneuverability<00:01:25.230> but<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
bit of maneuverability but it's going to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.400 
bit of maneuverability but it's going to
be<00:01:26.700> stock<00:01:27.120> with<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.510> aluminum<00:01:27.870> gearbox<00:01:28.230> is

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
be stock with the aluminum gearbox is

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.650 
be stock with the aluminum gearbox is
all<00:01:28.620> aluminum<00:01:28.830> linkages<00:01:29.490> aluminum<00:01:30.420> wheels

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
all aluminum linkages aluminum wheels
