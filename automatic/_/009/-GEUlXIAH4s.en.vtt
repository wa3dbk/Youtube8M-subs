00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.589
 hello guys if a blog 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.019
 then today we talk about altintop 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.240
 then it must be left if you know all 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:18.570
 what is the practice of installing 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.869
 operating systems apple up on pc 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 then I immediately repeat what I mentioned 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.289
 I will speak and simply for purpose 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.640
 informative 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:33.600
 the practice of outing torch is illegal 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.460
 by contract it was the license with 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.460
 end user from apple 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.149
 then 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.480
 m the last work station that exit from 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.480
 apple 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.729
 the spectacular in many respects but 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.920
 always in some ways in val e con 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.570
 what it costs anyway we'll talk about it 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.019
 in another video 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.960
 now surely the thing that you there 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.030
 the most striking is the design and everyone 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.280
 those who obviously will want to use a 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.130
 computer with mac operating system 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.350
 the first thing they want to have of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:24.610
 equal if not exactly the same is really 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 the design is obviously see you a little 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.409
 please 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.930
 ok of course there is already one in germany 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.409
 who has already done a hackintosh with 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.409
 using apple in the last churches 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.909
 aluminum obviously did n't use these 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.579
 things because they haven't been yet 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.189
 produced by other users little in 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.950
 aluminum as they had already been made with 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.950
 mac pro from the previous band from 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:02.780
 powermac g5 the one in aluminum up to 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:07.079
 mac pro 2012 the end result was 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.840
 now let's talk a little bit about how it is 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.720
 been made read something up up 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.860
 various sites 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.850
 now we can see the motherboard 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.800
 here the motherboard who is a gigabyte 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.750
 later I will put all the registration 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.610
 components that have been used however 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:33.410
 to the motherboard first of all is a 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:35.420
 lap bike i say ok but gb processor a 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.280
 intel core i3 dual core 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.730
 obviously it will never be like a processor 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.050
 of the pro absolutely 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.330
 however we can absolutely complain 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.770
 also an intercorre seven without 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.850
 no problem at all 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:03:00.090
 no core asl in 4770 k and 16 gb of ram 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:01.590
 ddr3 roberto prose of 22 network principals 4 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.510
 usb ports 3 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.670
 here we can see a 256gb ssd 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.490
 from samsung there are those from a land 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.680
 of this format a hard disk of the 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.960
 seagate always those little ones 2 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.110
 inches 5 there are also of this format 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.680
 I also believe in a land 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.760
 I assume normal hard drives for 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.680
 data storage 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.640
 all connections obviously on 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.640
 started 36 gb 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.370
 just the power supply has somehow 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:41.260
 stuck under in the middle of writes 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:45.510
 Hard disk mattresses is a very thing 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:49.480
 very curious very beautiful of course for 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.310
 for the hacker apple fan green not that 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.870
 you can afford is aesthetics 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.870
 phenomenal of a mac pro 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.650
 in this case, not even performance 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.680
 because to have more performance o 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.540
 less like me though you have to have a 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.790
 excellent mother scheme certainly at least 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:13.269
 a one a tx one then a gigabyte 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.860
 latest generation with 0 87 chipset 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.600
 that anyway this too 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.850
 however obviously here video here you can 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.060
 please with aesthetics even if you 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:27.320
 I say it is a hell in 4770 k 16 gb 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.810
 ddr3 a byte border hard drive 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.270
 storage up to one terabyte is not 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.750
 not bad 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.580
 absolutely this mac pro was 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.580
 made with a basket 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.930
 you can very well buy on amazon 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.470
 for thirty goals at $ 20 30 more or 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.860
 less 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:55.080
 then I'll put the link below in 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:57.630
 description however is really curious 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.730
 this thing then brings you done with 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.260
 a basket emptied inside ie it did 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.840
 own mail 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.700
 then they built the structure for the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.139
 to fix on the motherboard with i 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.820
 spacers as you can see here 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.010
 supports for ssd 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.870
 in short I did a good job if you want 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.580
 have fun putting the link back in 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.740
 description of the site there 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.240
 maybe both in English and in Italian ve 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.949
 it puts two td together, they summarize a bit as it is 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.949
 been made this mac pro is like 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:34.159
 you can achieve it by wanting this 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:37.180
 hackintosh can definitely be one 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.180
 very funny thing 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.590
 constructive was there 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.200
 plus you can very well have a problem 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.900
 boys or will return soon with 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.630
 other videos we will surely talk about 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.850
 also of apple we will talk about mac 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:06:00.810
 pro is a bit more so a little more like 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:09.000
 say detailed is a great car and 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:11.490
 in the next videos we'll talk about it after that 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.039
 greetings 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.949
 and no boys to the next version 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:19.889
 in blogs it's all if you enjoyed it 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.420
 video you like and if you like 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.990
