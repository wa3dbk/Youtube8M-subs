00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
application so I annotate PDF is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.520 
application so I annotate PDF is
currently<00:00:33.390> as<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.930> recording<00:00:34.110> in

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
currently as of this recording in

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.400 
currently as of this recording in
February<00:00:34.980> 2012<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.090> ten-dollar<00:00:36.780> application

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
February 2012 a ten-dollar application

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.869 
February 2012 a ten-dollar application
like<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:37.980> other<00:00:38.100> applications<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.850> will

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
like some other applications it will

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
like some other applications it will
from<00:00:39.450> time<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> time<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:40.050> go<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.530> special

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
from time to time I think go on special

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.560 
from time to time I think go on special
so<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.460> kind<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.730> watch<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.300> but

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so you can kind of watch for that but

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.569 
so you can kind of watch for that but
what<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.320> would<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.710> go<00:00:43.829> ahead<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.309> is

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
what I would like to go ahead and do is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.810 
what I would like to go ahead and do is

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
is going to I think kind of still have

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.910 
is going to I think kind of still have
that<00:03:50.480> separated<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.230> maybe<00:03:51.410> somebody<00:03:51.769> could

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
that separated so maybe somebody could

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.710 
that separated so maybe somebody could
remove<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.459> if<00:03:52.610> they<00:03:52.730> were<00:03:52.790> using<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.299> fancier

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
remove it if they were using a fancier

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.160 
remove it if they were using a fancier
PDF<00:03:54.200> program<00:03:55.390> really<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.510> only<00:03:56.690> way<00:03:56.930> that<00:03:56.959> I

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
PDF program really the only way that I

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.830 
PDF program really the only way that I
have<00:03:57.470> done<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:57.830> is<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.280> flattened<00:03:58.880> way<00:03:59.060> the

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
have done it is the flattened way the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.509 
have done it is the flattened way the
squashed<00:04:00.170> way<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:00.830> that's<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.190> center

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
squashed way and that's the center

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.449 
squashed way and that's the center
option<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.840> so<00:04:03.530> I'm<00:04:03.920> gonna<00:04:04.070> go<00:04:04.220> ahead<00:04:04.340> and

option and so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.100 
option and so I'm gonna go ahead and
click<00:04:04.700> on<00:04:04.760> that<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.660> what<00:04:05.810> it's<00:04:05.930> going<00:04:05.959> to

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110
