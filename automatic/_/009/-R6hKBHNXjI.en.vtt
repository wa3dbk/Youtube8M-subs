00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
strange really the first thing about it

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.380 
strange really the first thing about it
is<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:49.990> very<00:01:50.560> oily<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.729> can<00:01:51.969> definitely

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
is it's very oily you can definitely

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.349 
is it's very oily you can definitely
tell<00:01:52.840> in<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.159> plastic<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.819> it<00:01:54.939> feels<00:01:55.179> quite

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
tell in the plastic that it feels quite

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.849 
tell in the plastic that it feels quite
oily<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:56.079> little<00:01:56.409> bit<00:01:56.729> sticky<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:59.619> thing

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
oily a little bit sticky and this thing

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.550 
oily a little bit sticky and this thing
is<00:02:00.039> going<00:02:00.219> to<00:02:00.280> be<00:02:00.459> terrible<00:02:01.090> for<00:02:01.560> collecting

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
is going to be terrible for collecting

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.289 
is going to be terrible for collecting
hair<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.810> dust<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.229> crap<00:02:05.649> on<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.039> so<00:02:06.340> it's

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
hair and dust and crap on it so it's

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.440 
hair and dust and crap on it so it's
possible<00:02:07.569> if<00:02:08.009> after<00:02:09.009> if<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.970> rinse<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.360> under

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
possible if after if you rinse it under

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.050 
possible if after if you rinse it under
a<00:02:10.629> tap<00:02:10.899> or<00:02:11.170> something<00:02:11.530> like<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.730> might

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
a tap or something like that it might

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.900 
a tap or something like that it might
not<00:02:13.269> be<00:02:13.330> as<00:02:13.599> bad<00:02:13.870> but<00:02:14.290> at<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> moment<00:02:14.910> it's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
not be as bad but at the moment it's

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.479 
not be as bad but at the moment it's
quite<00:02:16.150> strange<00:02:16.950> second<00:02:17.950> thing<00:02:18.129> this<00:02:18.280> isn't

move they've not got anything in them

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.509 
move they've not got anything in them

because it's like there's a little boy

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.159 
because it's like there's a little boy
when<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:40.000> got<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.239> out<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.450> box<00:03:40.660> it<00:03:40.900> felt

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
when I got it out of the box it felt

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.629 
when I got it out of the box it felt
like<00:03:41.349> it<00:03:41.560> had<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.769> little<00:03:41.980> cube<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:44.340> some<00:03:45.340> kind

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
like it had a little cube of some kind

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.189 
like it had a little cube of some kind

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.250 

but<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.459> still<00:03:59.640> see<00:03:59.879> our<00:03:59.909> sticky<00:04:00.780> is<00:04:01.049> the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
characters in the Doctor Who episode

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.969 
characters in the Doctor Who episode
kind<00:04:35.160> of<00:04:35.479> they<00:04:36.479> this<00:04:36.870> orbit<00:04:37.260> Raiders<00:04:37.740> like

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
kind of they this orbit Raiders like

kind of they this orbit Raiders like
innocent<00:04:38.370> little<00:04:38.940> creatures<00:04:39.449> in<00:04:39.479> a<00:04:39.660> way<00:04:39.810> but

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
innocent little creatures in a way but

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.750 
innocent little creatures in a way but
they're<00:04:41.180> basically<00:04:42.180> harvested<00:04:42.870> from<00:04:43.760> human

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
they're basically harvested from human

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.999 
they're basically harvested from human
fat<00:04:45.210> it's<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:46.580> weird<00:04:47.580> sort<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:47.970> concept<00:04:48.510> really

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
fat it's a weird sort of concept really

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.990 
fat it's a weird sort of concept really
but<00:04:50.840> yeah<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:52.470> can<00:04:52.710> be<00:04:52.830> pulled<00:04:53.099> around<00:04:53.280> it's

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
but yeah it can be pulled around it's

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.920 
but yeah it can be pulled around it's
not<00:04:54.180> very<00:04:54.389> much<00:04:54.599> to<00:04:54.810> say<00:04:54.990> about<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.470> really

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
not very much to say about it really

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:06.460 
not very much to say about it really
that's<00:05:00.889> pretty<00:05:01.889> much<00:05:02.160> it

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.770 

so<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:07.550> does<00:05:07.700> seem<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:08.030> be<00:05:08.120> able<00:05:08.270> to<00:05:08.330> take<00:05:08.480> a<00:05:08.510> bit

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
so it does seem to be able to take a bit

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:18.240 
so it does seem to be able to take a bit
of<00:05:08.870> abuse

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.000 

stick<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.400> home

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.930 

all<00:05:25.010> right

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
all right

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.290 
all right
