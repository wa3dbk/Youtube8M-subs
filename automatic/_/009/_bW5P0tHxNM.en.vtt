actually<00:00:52.379> agree<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.910> fact<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
actually agree with but the fact that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.369

although he will get the ball taking off

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.670 
although he will get the ball taking off
him<00:00:57.360> he's<00:00:57.719> not<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> end<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.410> his<00:00:58.559> ass
