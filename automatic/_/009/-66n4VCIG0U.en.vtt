a<00:01:54.990> superstar<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.799> game<00:01:56.009> which<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.700> think

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
a superstar in this game which I think

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.880 
a superstar in this game which I think
he<00:01:57.090> might<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.299> able<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> achieve<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:58.409> he<00:01:58.649> wins

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
he might be able to achieve if he wins

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.429 
he might be able to achieve if he wins
this<00:01:59.070> fight<00:01:59.869> obviously<00:02:00.869> he<00:02:00.960> has<00:02:01.110> Freddie

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
this fight obviously he has Freddie

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.139 
this fight obviously he has Freddie
Roach's<00:02:01.680> corner<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.490> he's<00:02:02.610> working<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
Roach's corner I think he's working a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.359 
Roach's corner I think he's working a
lot<00:02:03.299> better<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:03.719> Freddie<00:02:03.899> Roach<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.829> think

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
lot better with Freddie Roach I do think

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.190 
lot better with Freddie Roach I do think
that's<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.640> big<00:02:05.880> plus<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.719> Freddie<00:02:06.930> Roach

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
that's a big plus to have Freddie Roach

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.999 
that's a big plus to have Freddie Roach
in<00:02:07.409> your<00:02:07.530> corner

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
in your corner

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.639 
in your corner
when<00:02:08.099> Freddie<00:02:08.250> Roach<00:02:08.549> already<00:02:09.060> knows<00:02:09.470> what<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
when Freddie Roach already knows what to

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.979 
when Freddie Roach already knows what to
do<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.250> what<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.580> takes<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.090> defeat<00:02:12.480> Miguel

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
do and what it takes to defeat Miguel

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.649 
do and what it takes to defeat Miguel

ripping those body hooks Chavez Jr uh
he's<00:02:59.670> gonna<00:02:59.940> he's<00:03:00.209> gonna<00:03:00.359> he's<00:03:00.659> gonna<00:03:00.810> tear

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
him up you know I look at Chavez Jr and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.960 
him up you know I look at Chavez Jr and
I<00:03:03.359> see<00:03:03.599> him<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> week<00:03:04.349> skinny<00:03:04.859> body<00:03:05.159> and<00:03:05.549> I

I see him with a week skinny body and I

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.849 
I see him with a week skinny body and I
think<00:03:06.239> Miguel<00:03:06.510> Cotto<00:03:06.750> that's<00:03:07.530> an<00:03:07.709> advantage

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
think Miguel Cotto that's an advantage

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.860 
think Miguel Cotto that's an advantage
for<00:03:08.370> Miguel<00:03:08.609> Cotto<00:03:08.790> me<00:03:09.120> girl<00:03:09.269> code<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.599> fast

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
for Miguel Cotto me girl code is fast

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.110 
for Miguel Cotto me girl code is fast
enough<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.290> get<00:03:10.440> inside<00:03:10.859> go<00:03:11.549> for<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.879> body

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
enough to get inside go for that body

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.180 
enough to get inside go for that body
and<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.019> do<00:03:13.079> think<00:03:13.500> he<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.799> actually

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
and then I do think he can actually

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.280 
and then I do think he can actually
knock<00:03:14.400> Chavez<00:03:14.819> Jr<00:03:14.849> out<00:03:15.269> by<00:03:15.510> going<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.049> body

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
knock Chavez Jr out by going to the body

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.319 
knock Chavez Jr out by going to the body
he<00:03:17.099> could<00:03:17.280> also<00:03:17.400> go<00:03:17.639> for<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:17.910> head<00:03:18.060> shots

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
he could also go for the head shots

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.140 
he could also go for the head shots
Miguel<00:03:18.660> Cotto<00:03:18.980> he's<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.010> fast<00:03:20.370> fighter<00:03:20.699> he's

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
Miguel Cotto he's a fast fighter he's
