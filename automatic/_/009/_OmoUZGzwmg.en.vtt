village now we're moving on with our
experiment<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:05.700> basically<00:00:06.270> put<00:00:06.839> our

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
experiment we basically put our

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.410 
experiment we basically put our
containers<00:00:07.470> together<00:00:07.760> now<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:08.820> have<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> talk

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
containers together now we have to talk

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.410

order it now baking soda everybody's got

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.030 
order it now baking soda everybody's got
some<00:01:53.340> why<00:01:54.299> baking<00:01:54.750> soda<00:01:55.020> because<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.590> works<00:01:55.799> as

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
some why baking soda because it works as

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.850 
some why baking soda because it works as
an<00:01:56.159> electrolyte<00:01:57.020> yes<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.770> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
an electrolyte yes all we have to do is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.340 
an electrolyte yes all we have to do is
add<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.159> bit<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.640> baking<00:01:59.909> soda<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
add a little bit of baking soda to the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.359 
add a little bit of baking soda to the
water<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.969> not<00:02:03.119> ordinary<00:02:03.390> water<00:02:04.369> it's

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
water and it's not ordinary water it's

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.609 
water and it's not ordinary water it's
distilled<00:02:06.329> drinking<00:02:07.110> water

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619

distilled drinking water
yes<00:02:07.979> distilled<00:02:08.489> water<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.030> we're<00:02:09.119> going

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
yes distilled water is what we're going

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.160 
yes distilled water is what we're going
to<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.479> we're<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.810> use<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> little

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
to use we're going to use a little

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.630 
to use we're going to use a little
baking<00:02:10.530> soda<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.510> going<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:13.050> work

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
baking soda and it's going to work

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.320 
baking soda and it's going to work
now<00:02:14.680> why<00:02:15.680> distilled<00:02:16.250> water<00:02:16.460> again<00:02:16.940> well<00:02:17.180> you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
now why distilled water again well you
