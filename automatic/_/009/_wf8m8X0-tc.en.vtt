of the risk of being cated around and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.340 
of the risk of being cated around and
stuff<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.659> much<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.200> any

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
stuff like that you know much like any

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.249

the<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.829> non-gaap<00:01:41.310> closer<00:01:41.640> kind<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.360> not<00:01:42.540> slow

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the the non-gaap closer kind of not slow

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.399 
the the non-gaap closer kind of not slow
but<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.770> sluggish<00:01:44.070> bruisers<00:01:44.960> or<00:01:45.960> Garren's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
but more sluggish bruisers or Garren's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.510 
but more sluggish bruisers or Garren's
always<00:01:46.619> had<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.829> sort<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.280> moving

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
always had like sort of good moving

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.280 
always had like sort of good moving
speed<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.149> then<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.869> you'd<00:01:49.049> run<00:01:49.259> into

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
speed and then you know you'd run into

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.359 
speed and then you know you'd run into
the<00:01:49.560> queue<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.060> see<00:01:51.299> i<00:01:51.329> don't<00:01:51.479> know

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
the queue as you can see i don't know

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.780 
the queue as you can see i don't know
it's<00:01:53.369> only<00:01:54.590> 55<00:01:55.590> move<00:01:55.860> basement<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.520> store<00:01:56.759> but

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it's only 55 move basement in store but

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.260 
it's only 55 move basement in store but
it<00:01:56.969> feels<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.810> most<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.380> lot<00:01:58.590> slower<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.520> I'm

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it feels the most a lot slower one I'm

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.880 
it feels the most a lot slower one I'm
always<00:02:00.540> very<00:02:00.750> sensitive<00:02:01.409> sort<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
always very sensitive sort of the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.709 
always very sensitive sort of the
movement<00:02:02.310> speed<00:02:02.549> changes<00:02:03.030> think<00:02:03.270> these<00:02:03.600> are

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
movement speed changes think these are

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.670 
movement speed changes think these are
the<00:02:03.750> two<00:02:03.899> things<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.200> I've<00:02:04.320> always<00:02:04.500> been

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the two things that I've always been

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.289 
the two things that I've always been
sensitive<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.579> range<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
sensitive to it's like range and

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.990 
sensitive to it's like range and
movement<00:02:06.750> speed<00:02:07.340> I'm<00:02:08.340> soon<00:02:08.610> because<00:02:08.879> they're

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
movement speed I'm soon because they're

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.820 
movement speed I'm soon because they're
not<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.509> these<00:02:09.690> very<00:02:10.140> obvious<00:02:10.619> damage

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
not know these very obvious damage

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
not know these very obvious damage
numbers<00:02:11.250> or<00:02:11.580> people<00:02:11.819> tend<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.030> freak<00:02:12.270> out

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
numbers or people tend to freak out

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
numbers or people tend to freak out
about<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
about the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.160 
about the
these<00:02:13.500> are<00:02:13.650> much<00:02:13.770> more<00:02:13.950> subtle<00:02:14.340> nerves<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.900> I

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
these are much more subtle nerves so I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.540 
these are much more subtle nerves so I
don't<00:02:16.350> know<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.130> know<00:02:17.250> you're

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
don't know you know you know you're

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.280 
don't know you know you know you're
never<00:02:17.610> gonna<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:18.120> have<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.540> 340

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
never gonna just have you know 340

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.810 
never gonna just have you know 340
movement<00:02:20.010> speed<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> whole<00:02:20.370> game<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.730> always

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
movement speed the whole game and always

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.460 
movement speed the whole game and always
I'm<00:02:21.060> running<00:02:21.330> around<00:02:21.390> without<00:02:21.570> boots<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.350> a

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
I'm running around without boots just a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.130 
I'm running around without boots just a
showcase<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> differences<00:02:23.700> right<00:02:23.880> now

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
showcase with the differences right now

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.650 
showcase with the differences right now
but<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.440> also<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.710> keep<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:25.980> mind<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
but you also have to keep in mind the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.810 
but you also have to keep in mind the
the<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.020> percent<00:02:28.380> movement<00:02:28.770> bonus<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.430> also

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
the the percent movement bonus is also

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.520 
the the percent movement bonus is also
you<00:02:30.210> know<00:02:30.300> not<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.660> effective<00:02:31.050> not<00:02:31.500> just

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
you know not as effective not just

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.140 
you know not as effective not just
because<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.250> five<00:02:32.370> percent<00:02:32.700> lower<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.030> also

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
because it's five percent lower but also

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.390 
because it's five percent lower but also
it<00:02:33.330> has<00:02:33.450> less<00:02:33.630> scale<00:02:33.960> off<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.380> because<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
it has less scale off of because the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.000 
it has less scale off of because the
base<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.640> lower<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.360> bring<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:37.320> owned<00:02:37.650> you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
base is lower I bring just owned you

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.200 
base is lower I bring just owned you
know<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.610> don't<00:02:38.730> know<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.740> really<00:02:41.220> again

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
know I don't know and I I really again

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.820 
know I don't know and I I really again
once<00:02:42.450> again<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.660> haven't<00:02:42.810> really<00:02:43.170> fully<00:02:43.470> come

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
once again I haven't really fully come

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.380 
once again I haven't really fully come
to<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:43.980> conclusion<00:02:44.160> about<00:02:44.550> my<00:02:44.790> thoughts<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.270> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
to a conclusion about my thoughts on the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.630 
to a conclusion about my thoughts on the
new<00:02:45.420> Garen<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.950> very<00:02:47.130> least<00:02:47.220> he<00:02:47.370> seems

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
new Garen at the very least he seems

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.180 
new Garen at the very least he seems
good<00:02:47.940> I'm<00:02:48.120> Garon's<00:02:48.480> always<00:02:48.780> gonna<00:02:48.960> go<00:02:49.170> um<00:02:49.410> yes

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
good I'm Garon's always gonna go um yes

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.440 
good I'm Garon's always gonna go um yes
the<00:02:50.370> problem<00:02:50.670> was<00:02:50.760> he<00:02:50.880> was<00:02:51.000> always<00:02:51.150> just<00:02:51.300> kind

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
the problem was he was always just kind

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.970 
the problem was he was always just kind
of<00:02:51.540> boring<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.080> no<00:02:52.200> one<00:02:52.320> wanted<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.620> play<00:02:52.680> him

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
of boring and no one wanted to play him

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.820 
of boring and no one wanted to play him
he's<00:02:53.180> always<00:02:54.180> been<00:02:54.300> very<00:02:54.360> very<00:02:55.170> strong<00:02:55.650> in

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
he's always been very very strong in

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.010 
he's always been very very strong in
lane<00:02:56.120> even<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.210> old<00:02:57.390> gear<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.780> like<00:02:57.870> that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
lane even the old gear and like that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.510 
lane even the old gear and like that
just<00:02:58.110> kind<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.350> what<00:02:58.470> he<00:02:58.530> did<00:02:58.710> you<00:02:58.890> would<00:02:59.250> walk

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520

extent<00:03:14.490> trundle<00:03:15.110> champions<00:03:16.110> like<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:18.410> um<00:03:19.410> so

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
extent trundle champions like that um so

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.000 
extent trundle champions like that um so
yeah<00:03:21.090> my<00:03:21.450> primary<00:03:21.990> experience<00:03:22.290> with<00:03:22.560> him<00:03:22.650> was

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
yeah my primary experience with him was

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.030 
yeah my primary experience with him was
on<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> PBE<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.820> played<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> few<00:03:24.450> games<00:03:25.040> all

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
on the PBE I played a few games all

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.830 
on the PBE I played a few games all
right<00:03:26.220> over<00:03:26.550> there<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.940> that's<00:03:27.180> generally

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
right over there and that's generally

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.020 
right over there and that's generally
speaking<00:03:28.110> not<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.410> very<00:03:28.860> good<00:03:28.980> gauge<00:03:29.790> of

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
speaking not a very good gauge of

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.250 
speaking not a very good gauge of
balance<00:03:32.180> sunni<00:03:33.180> because<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.750> skill<00:03:33.959> level<00:03:34.230> is

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
balance sunni because the skill level is

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.600 
balance sunni because the skill level is
so<00:03:34.500> all<00:03:34.650> over<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.980> place<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.280> Garrett<00:03:35.550> is

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
so all over the place and Garrett is

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.810 
so all over the place and Garrett is
such<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.880> simple<00:03:36.180> champion<00:03:36.900> still<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:38.040> you

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
such a simple champion still that you

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.490 
such a simple champion still that you
know<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.030> didn't<00:03:39.540> need<00:03:39.660> huge<00:03:40.140> amounts<00:03:40.170> of

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
know I I didn't need huge amounts of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.870 
know I I didn't need huge amounts of
expertise<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.130> could<00:03:41.250> just<00:03:41.400> go<00:03:41.520> because<00:03:41.760> i'm<00:03:41.850> a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
expertise I could just go because i'm a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.970 
expertise I could just go because i'm a
top<00:03:42.120> lane<00:03:42.330> man<00:03:42.540> right<00:03:42.750> i<00:03:42.959> could<00:03:43.620> just<00:03:43.709> go<00:03:43.890> off

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
top lane man right i could just go off

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.800 
top lane man right i could just go off
sort<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.250> my<00:03:44.370> general<00:03:44.970> top<00:03:45.209> lane<00:03:45.420> knowledge

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
sort of my general top lane knowledge

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
slaughter them and i've had relatively

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.620

good<00:03:50.400> results<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.850> them<00:03:51.000> on<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.270> normal

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
good results of them on the normal

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.970 
good results of them on the normal
server<00:03:51.870> as<00:03:52.020> well<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.290> few<00:03:52.440> times<00:03:52.620> i<00:03:52.800> have

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
server as well the few times i have

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.460 
server as well the few times i have
played<00:03:53.220> them<00:03:53.450> but<00:03:54.450> it's<00:03:54.900> not<00:03:55.080> enough<00:03:55.200> already

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
played them but it's not enough already

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.350 
played them but it's not enough already
come<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.800> any<00:03:55.890> firm<00:03:56.160> conclusions<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:57.030> yeah<00:03:57.330> I

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
come to any firm conclusions so yeah I

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.290 
come to any firm conclusions so yeah I
don't<00:03:57.420> know<00:03:57.600> these<00:03:58.140> are<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.350> nerves<00:03:58.730> um<00:03:59.730> they

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
don't know these are the nerves um they

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.680 
don't know these are the nerves um they
did<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.230> can't<00:04:02.190> say<00:04:02.550> they<00:04:02.790> don't<00:04:02.940> seem<00:04:03.300> entirely

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
did I can't say they don't seem entirely

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.440 
did I can't say they don't seem entirely
warranted<00:04:04.320> but<00:04:05.190> we'll<00:04:05.820> see<00:04:05.970> what<00:04:06.060> happens<00:04:06.150> if

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
warranted but we'll see what happens if

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.720 
warranted but we'll see what happens if
these<00:04:06.989> go<00:04:07.200> through<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.770> nerve<00:04:08.010> him<00:04:08.190> more<00:04:08.400> they

seemingly<00:04:22.169> minor<00:04:22.470> movement<00:04:22.800> speed<00:04:23.190> changes

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550
