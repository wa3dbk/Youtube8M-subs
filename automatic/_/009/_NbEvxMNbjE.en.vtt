a bat top because I don't know if I like
it<00:00:16.710> better<00:00:16.920> or<00:00:17.460> not<00:00:18.289> when<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.350> opened<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
cat came out but we'll open it right now

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.230 
cat came out but we'll open it right now
I'm<00:00:23.070> going<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> set<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> camera<00:00:23.789> down<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
I'm going to set the camera down for a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.529 
I'm going to set the camera down for a
little<00:00:24.390> bit<00:00:27.439> all<00:00:28.439> right<00:00:29.090> this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.179> fairly<00:00:30.390> easy

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
little bit all right this is fairly easy

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.540 
little bit all right this is fairly easy
I<00:00:31.250> just<00:00:32.250> pretty<00:00:32.430> much<00:00:33.170> clamp<00:00:34.170> these<00:00:34.440> took<00:00:35.430> it

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
I just pretty much clamp these took it

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.580 
I just pretty much clamp these took it
off<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.500> then<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:38.070> push<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.610> button<00:00:38.640> out

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
off and then just push the button out

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.310 
off and then just push the button out
well<00:00:40.590> there's<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> there's<00:00:41.370> clips<00:00:41.820> I'll<00:00:42.690> see

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
well there's a there's clips I'll see

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.760 
well there's a there's clips I'll see
them<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.530> there<00:00:44.510> focus<00:00:48.200> there<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.620> go

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
them right there focus there we go

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
them right there focus there we go
there's<00:00:50.460> clips<00:00:50.760> right<00:00:50.969> there<00:00:51.289> just<00:00:53.390> push<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
there's clips right there just push it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.979 
there's clips right there just push it
down<00:00:54.949> that's<00:00:55.949> easier<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.489> pop<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.329> also<00:00:57.719> got

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
down that's easier to pop out I also got

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.099 
down that's easier to pop out I also got
a<00:00:58.020> hex<00:00:58.350> gate<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> i<00:01:00.090> could<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.329> quarter<00:01:00.719> circle

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
a hex gate so i could do quarter circle

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.680 
a hex gate so i could do quarter circle
moves<00:01:01.350> better<00:01:01.789> hopefully<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.120> actually

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
moves better hopefully that actually

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.480 
moves better hopefully that actually
works<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.460> far<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> has<00:01:06.320> but<00:01:07.320> uh

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
works out for me so far it has but uh

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
works out for me so far it has but uh
yeah<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.150> pretty<00:01:09.930> simple

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
yeah it was it was pretty simple

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.609 
yeah it was it was pretty simple
to<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.659> yeah<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.080> see<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> put

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to do this yeah as you can see I put

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.429 
to do this yeah as you can see I put
spinal<00:01:14.070> back<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.580> I'm<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.509> smile

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
spinal back there I'm not really smile

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.240 
spinal back there I'm not really smile
is<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:17.000> main<00:01:18.710> but<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.950> wanted

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is not my main but I just wanted

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370 
is not my main but I just wanted
something<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.270> matches<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.930> green<00:01:22.140> button

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
something that matches the green button

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.130 
something that matches the green button
and<00:01:22.680> whatnot<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.670> actually<00:01:24.659> printed<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and whatnot so I actually printed this

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:35.660 
and whatnot so I actually printed this
out<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:28.340> officemax<00:01:30.619> spy<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> 8<00:01:32.909> x<00:01:33.390> 0<00:01:33.950> 13<00:01:34.950> 8<00:01:35.490> x

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
out at officemax spy like a 8 x 0 13 8 x

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.539 
out at officemax spy like a 8 x 0 13 8 x
13<00:01:36.060> i<00:01:36.090> believe<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.570> 30<00:01:36.780> x<00:01:36.960> 8<00:01:37.460> however<00:01:38.460> you

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
13 i believe for 30 x 8 however you

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
13 i believe for 30 x 8 however you
 say<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.960> care

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
 say that I don't care

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.090 
 say that I don't care

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
enough to know as you can see it's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.380 
enough to know as you can see it's
spinal<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.420> lights<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:46.939> plug<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
spinal and it lights up plug it in I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.969 
spinal and it lights up plug it in I
don't<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.960> will<00:01:49.140> work<00:01:49.200> plugging<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
don't know if this will work plugging it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
don't know if this will work plugging it
into<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.729> ps4<00:01:51.180> oh<00:01:52.430> yeah<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.520> does<00:01:53.700> look<00:01:53.970> at

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
into the ps4 oh yeah it does look at

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.000 
into the ps4 oh yeah it does look at
that<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:57.170> there<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.229> go<00:01:58.290> green<00:01:59.009> buttons

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
that so there you go green buttons

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.140 
that so there you go green buttons
pretty<00:02:01.760> cool<00:02:02.530> yeah<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:04.370> thought<00:02:04.790> I'd<00:02:04.940> show
