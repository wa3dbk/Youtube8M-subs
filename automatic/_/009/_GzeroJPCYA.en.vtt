rim<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.120> think<00:01:40.330> that's<00:01:40.510> kind<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.840> nails<00:01:41.140> both

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470

the<00:01:41.620> inertial<00:01:42.040> scrolling<00:01:42.190> being<00:01:42.760> like<00:01:42.940> the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
the inertial scrolling being like the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.240 
the inertial scrolling being like the
amount<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.020> momentum<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.860> inertial

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
amount of momentum and the inertial

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.760 
amount of momentum and the inertial
scrolling<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:45.820> then<00:01:45.970> also<00:01:46.180> we've<00:01:47.170> mailed<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
scrolling and then also we've mailed the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.370 
scrolling and then also we've mailed the
fact<00:01:48.010> that<00:01:48.130> even<00:01:48.910> before<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.570> page<00:01:50.230> is

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
fact that even before the page is

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.420 
fact that even before the page is
unloading<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.070> should<00:01:51.250> show<00:01:51.400> that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
unloading you should show that

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.970 
unloading you should show that
checkerboard<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.300> kind<00:01:52.480> of<00:01:52.540> gives<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:53.650> user<00:01:53.680> a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
checkerboard it kind of gives the user a

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.100 
checkerboard it kind of gives the user a
sense<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.550> something<00:01:54.970> is<00:01:55.060> happening<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.900> I

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
sense that something is happening and I

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.300 
sense that something is happening and I
think<00:01:56.290> it<00:01:56.380> works<00:01:56.530> very<00:01:56.590> well<00:01:56.800> you<00:01:57.010> don't<00:01:57.160> want

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
think it works very well you don't want

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.040 
think it works very well you don't want
it<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.550> slow<00:01:58.090> down<00:01:58.270> you'll<00:01:58.540> want<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:58.750> stop<00:01:59.020> you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
it to slow down you'll want to stop you

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.500 
it to slow down you'll want to stop you
don't<00:01:59.290> want<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.500> get<00:01:59.680> Lahey<00:01:59.890> it's<00:02:00.880> always<00:02:01.240> too

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
don't want to get Lahey it's always too

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.000 
don't want to get Lahey it's always too
I<00:02:01.780> haven't<00:02:01.960> seen<00:02:02.080> slow<00:02:02.380> down<00:02:02.590> at<00:02:02.710> all<00:02:02.770> and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
I haven't seen slow down at all and

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.340 
I haven't seen slow down at all and
that's<00:02:03.130> really<00:02:03.340> important

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
that's really important

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.770 
that's really important
it's<00:02:05.890> supposed<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.340> support<00:02:06.610> html5<00:02:07.000> video

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780
