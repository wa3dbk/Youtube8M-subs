00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.200 

alright<00:00:00.329> here's<00:00:00.570> the<00:00:00.750> rocket<00:00:00.960> stove<00:00:02.210> it's

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
alright here's the rocket stove it's

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.599 
alright here's the rocket stove it's
working<00:00:03.780> good<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.890> I'll<00:00:05.100> tell<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.430> heat

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
working good and I'll tell you the heat

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.860 
working good and I'll tell you the heat
coming<00:00:05.940> out<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.210> here<00:00:06.359> that's<00:00:06.569> where<00:00:06.779> you

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
coming out of here that's where you

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.530 
coming out of here that's where you
would<00:00:07.020> cook<00:00:07.259> out<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.910> see<00:00:08.910> if<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.090> can<00:00:09.210> do<00:00:09.300> this

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
would cook out of see if I can do this

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.400 
would cook out of see if I can do this
that's<00:00:10.139> what<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:10.650> got<00:00:10.830> going<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:12.139> and<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.230> can

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
that's what we got going on and you can

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
that's what we got going on and you can
see<00:00:13.620> down<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:14.040> here<00:00:15.619> that's<00:00:16.619> how<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:16.920> works

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
see down in here that's how that works

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.630 
see down in here that's how that works
so<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:20.430> air<00:00:20.580> sucking<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:23.269> really<00:00:24.269> well

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
so the air sucking in here really well

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.029 
so the air sucking in here really well
nothing's<00:00:26.640> coming<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.920> that's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
nothing's coming out here and that's

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.439 
nothing's coming out here and that's
where<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.400> all<00:00:29.519> being<00:00:29.820> burned<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.240> right

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
where it's all being burned is right

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.850 
where it's all being burned is right
down<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.840> there<00:00:32.540> okay<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.600> then<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.380> idea<00:00:34.770> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
down in there okay so then the idea is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
down in there okay so then the idea is
that<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:36.570> barrel<00:00:38.000> would<00:00:39.000> fit<00:00:39.329> over<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.719> top

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that that barrel would fit over the top

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.630 
that that barrel would fit over the top
of<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.530> piece<00:00:41.190> right<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.520> that<00:00:44.520> would

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
of that piece right here and that would

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.400 
of that piece right here and that would
create<00:00:44.969> some<00:00:45.149> combustion<00:00:45.930> there<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.289> you'd

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
create some combustion there and you'd

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.660 
create some combustion there and you'd
have<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:46.710> exhaust<00:00:47.010> down<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
have your exhaust down here at the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220 
have your exhaust down here at the
bottom<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.270> where<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.480> pipe<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.930> there

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
bottom kind of where that pipe is there

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.790 
bottom kind of where that pipe is there
and<00:00:49.920> we'd<00:00:50.070> go<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.430> bench<00:00:51.530> that's<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> whole

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and we'd go to a bench that's the whole

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.270 
and we'd go to a bench that's the whole
idea<00:00:52.829> behind<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:54.620> you've<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> nice<00:00:56.039> little

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
idea behind it you've got a nice little

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
idea behind it you've got a nice little
clean-out<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:57.090> there<00:00:59.780> that's<00:01:00.780> working

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
clean-out right there that's working

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.090 
clean-out right there that's working
good<00:01:02.120> that's<00:01:03.120> awesome

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
good that's awesome

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.510 
good that's awesome
it's<00:01:05.100> hot<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:06.960> also<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.369> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it's hot so you can also use this if you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.130 
it's hot so you can also use this if you
had<00:01:08.670> say<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> terracotta<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:10.049> bit

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
had say the terracotta up a little bit

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
had say the terracotta up a little bit
higher<00:01:10.409> which<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.490> should<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.729> there

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
higher which is what it should be there

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
higher which is what it should be there
I<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.810> put<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.229> pipe<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.799> needed

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
I just put that pipe because I needed

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.580 
I just put that pipe because I needed
that<00:01:14.250> much<00:01:14.430> more<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> draft<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> go

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
that much more to get the draft to go

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.350 
that much more to get the draft to go
but<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.740> had<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> pipe<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.640> through

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
but if I had the pipe up there through

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
but if I had the pipe up there through
the<00:01:18.450> terracotta<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.140> there<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.430> could

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the terracotta up there you could

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.570 
the terracotta up there you could
actually<00:01:20.759> cook<00:01:21.090> off<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.369> of<00:01:23.369> course

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
actually cook off of that and of course

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.859 
actually cook off of that and of course
you're<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.600> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you're not going to have all of this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
you're not going to have all of this
square<00:01:25.229> you're<00:01:25.439> gonna<00:01:25.530> cover<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.130> with

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
square you're gonna cover that up with

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.030 
square you're gonna cover that up with
masonry<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.299> make<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> into<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> mass<00:01:28.530> unit

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
masonry and and make it into a mass unit

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.710 
masonry and and make it into a mass unit
and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.250> that's<00:01:29.430> gonna<00:01:29.610> heat<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.360> see

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and then that's gonna heat up to see

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.469 
and then that's gonna heat up to see
eventually<00:01:31.619> by<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> end<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> night<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
eventually by the end of the night if I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.450 
eventually by the end of the night if I
cook<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.079> all<00:01:34.229> night<00:01:34.439> long<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.189> going

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
cook this all night long this is going

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580 
cook this all night long this is going
to<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:36.000> hot<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.350> what's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
to be really hot and that is what's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
to be really hot and that is what's
gonna<00:01:39.590> produce<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.920> heat<00:01:41.479> for<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> long

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
gonna produce your heat for a long

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.429 
gonna produce your heat for a long
period<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.229> time<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> mean<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.350> we

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
period of time see and so I mean if we

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.109 
period of time see and so I mean if we
cook<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.130> night<00:01:47.340> long<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.880> put<00:01:47.970> some

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
cook this all night long and put some

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.510 
cook this all night long and put some
sticks<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:48.689> really<00:01:48.930> got<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
sticks in there really got it going and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.050 
sticks in there really got it going and
had<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> exhaust<00:01:51.240> out<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> bench<00:01:53.060> then

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
had it exhaust out here to a bench then

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.100 
had it exhaust out here to a bench then
the<00:01:54.270> bench<00:01:54.570> would<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.759> core<00:01:57.110> would

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the bench would and in the core would

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.310 
the bench would and in the core would
let<00:01:59.100> heat<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> rest<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> night

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
let heat out for the rest of the night

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.429 
let heat out for the rest of the night
in<00:02:01.740> theory<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:03.479> anyway<00:02:03.780> that's<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.049> rocket

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
in theory so anyway that's the rocket

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.319 
in theory so anyway that's the rocket
stove<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.030> said<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
stove and what and then like I said you
