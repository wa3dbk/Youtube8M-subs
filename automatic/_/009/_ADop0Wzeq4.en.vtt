00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
ninety seven point four percent of a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.099 
ninety seven point four percent of a
year<00:00:22.529> ago<00:00:22.619> placed<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.939> feedlots<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.660> January

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
year ago placed in feedlots in January

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.890 
year ago placed in feedlots in January
1.8<00:00:25.980> 25<00:00:26.730> million<00:00:28.070> 98.2<00:00:29.070> percent<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.910> marketed

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
1.8 25 million 98.2 percent and marketed

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.100 
1.8 25 million 98.2 percent and marketed
in<00:00:31.019> January<00:00:31.850> 1.7<00:00:32.899> 74<00:00:33.899> million<00:00:34.370> 10<00:00:35.570> 2.1<00:00:36.570> percent

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.660 
in January 1.7 74 million 10 2.1 percent
so<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> pretty<00:00:38.340> positive

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
so I think it's a pretty positive

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
so I think it's a pretty positive
reports<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:40.050> probably<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
reports it's probably not going to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.850 
reports it's probably not going to
affect<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.160> market<00:00:41.340> very<00:00:41.790> much<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.860> we

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
affect the market very much because we

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.729 
affect the market very much because we
had<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> such<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> surge<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.390> cash<00:00:46.140> live<00:00:46.410> cattle

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
had a such a surge in cash live cattle

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.160 
had a such a surge in cash live cattle

that<00:00:54.500> this<00:00:55.820> is<00:00:56.820> pretty<00:00:57.149> much<00:00:57.300> built<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that this is pretty much built into the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.709 
that this is pretty much built into the

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.649 
very much key reason why Packers
do<00:04:24.949> a<00:04:24.979> lot<00:04:25.219> more<00:04:25.280> cattle<00:04:25.879> in<00:04:25.969> January<00:04:26.389> and<00:04:26.419> will

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:26.659 
do a lot more cattle in January and will

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.100 
do a lot more cattle in January and will
continue<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.080> do<00:04:27.289> so<00:04:27.319> so<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:28.610> think<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.389> cattle

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
continue to do so so I think that cattle

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.689 
continue to do so so I think that cattle
feeders<00:04:30.469> 30<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.159> 60<00:04:31.490> days<00:04:31.520> ago<00:04:32.919> perhaps<00:04:33.919> so<00:04:34.370> I

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
feeders 30 to 60 days ago perhaps so I

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.050 
feeders 30 to 60 days ago perhaps so I
were<00:04:35.689> hopeful<00:04:36.199> but<00:04:36.439> really<00:04:37.159> didn't<00:04:37.580> see<00:04:37.849> how

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
were hopeful but really didn't see how

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.540 
were hopeful but really didn't see how
we<00:04:38.120> could<00:04:38.479> get<00:04:38.659> a<00:04:38.719> $92<00:04:39.710> market<00:04:40.189> an<00:04:40.279> early

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
we could get a $92 market an early

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.999 
we could get a $92 market an early
februari<00:04:41.029> and<00:04:41.870> that's<00:04:42.080> exactly<00:04:42.259> where<00:04:42.770> at

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
februari and that's exactly where at

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.540 
februari and that's exactly where at
today<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:44.150> cattle<00:04:44.419> on<00:04:44.509> feed<00:04:44.539> report<00:04:45.550> is

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
today and the cattle on feed report is

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.749 
today and the cattle on feed report is
almost<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.419> background<00:04:47.870> event<00:04:48.229> but<00:04:48.669> they're<00:04:49.669> in

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
almost a background event but they're in

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.600 
almost a background event but they're in
good<00:04:50.240> shape<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.779> the<00:04:50.840> feedlots<00:04:51.289> in<00:04:51.919> market

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
good shape and the feedlots in market

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.820 
good shape and the feedlots in market
terms<00:04:52.909> and<00:04:53.360> we'll<00:04:54.110> just<00:04:54.229> have<00:04:54.319> to<00:04:54.499> see<00:04:54.529> how<00:04:54.770> the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
terms and we'll just have to see how the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.309 
terms and we'll just have to see how the
rest<00:04:54.919> of<00:04:55.159> the<00:04:55.249> month<00:04:55.400> goes<00:04:55.749> that's<00:04:56.749> all<00:04:57.050> for

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:57.319 
rest of the month goes that's all for

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.810 
rest of the month goes that's all for
this<00:04:57.409> month<00:04:57.469> thank<00:04:57.949> you<00:04:58.810> right
