00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
buckle will not close because this hole

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.620 
buckle will not close because this hole
in<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:29.530> 1<00:02:29.920> centimeter<00:02:30.550> too<00:02:30.819> far<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.330> way

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
in it is 1 centimeter too far this way

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.900 
in it is 1 centimeter too far this way
so<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.590> hole<00:02:32.800> doesn't<00:02:33.099> match<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:33.430> with<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
so the hole doesn't match up with the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.720 
so the hole doesn't match up with the
pin<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.840> there's<00:02:35.019> no<00:02:35.170> way<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.470> locking<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.519> in

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
pin so there's no way of locking this in

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.210 
pin so there's no way of locking this in
the<00:02:36.819> scabbard<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.810> scabbard<00:02:41.140> also<00:02:41.709> hangs<00:02:41.980> on

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
the scabbard the scabbard also hangs on

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.630 
the scabbard the scabbard also hangs on
an<00:02:42.370> angle<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.959> this<00:02:44.590> means<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.099> Banat<00:02:45.519> is

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
an angle this this means the Banat is

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.720 
an angle this this means the Banat is
more<00:02:45.819> like<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.150> fallout<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:47.049> lost

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
more like the fallout and be lost

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.070 
more like the fallout and be lost
especially<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:48.880> this<00:02:49.060> one<00:02:49.330> with<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.540> defective

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
especially on this one with a defective

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:58.080 
especially on this one with a defective
buckle<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.650> doesn't<00:02:50.980> close<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:57.459> conclusion

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
buckle it doesn't close in conclusion

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.449 
buckle it doesn't close in conclusion
this<00:02:58.900> bayonet<00:02:59.440> gave<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.950> Czechoslovakian

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.180 
this bayonet gave the Czechoslovakian

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
soldier something they could not count

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.699 
soldier something they could not count
