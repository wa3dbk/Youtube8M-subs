satellite or what some refer to as the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.900 
satellite or what some refer to as the
Dark<00:00:10.110> Knight<00:00:10.290> satellite<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:11.010> refer<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.820> this

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
Dark Knight satellite I refer to this

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.060 
Dark Knight satellite I refer to this
object<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.570> have<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:13.559> can't<00:00:13.799> really<00:00:13.950> see

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
object that I have you can't really see

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.740 
object that I have you can't really see
it<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.549> picture<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.179> let<00:00:15.299> me<00:00:15.330> go<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> this

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
it in this picture but let me go to this

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.170 
it in this picture but let me go to this
one<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.170> I've<00:00:16.440> circled<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.250> refer<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> this

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
one and I've circled it I refer to this

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.410 
one and I've circled it I refer to this
as<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.359> UFO<00:00:18.900> because<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.410> me<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.039> UFO<00:00:20.609> now

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
as a UFO because to me this is a UFO now

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.060 
as a UFO because to me this is a UFO now
that's<00:00:21.720> picture<00:00:22.140> right<00:00:22.350> there<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.710> taken

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that's picture right there was taken

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.269 
that's picture right there was taken
from<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.330> fairly<00:00:24.330> decent<00:00:24.359> distance<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.560> mean

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
from a fairly decent distance I mean

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.650 
from a fairly decent distance I mean
that<00:00:26.460> that's<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.789> distance<00:00:27.150> right<00:00:27.420> there

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that that's a distance right there

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
that that's a distance right there
considering<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.800> picture<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.250> taken

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
considering that this picture was taken

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
considering that this picture was taken
from<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> space<00:00:30.060> station<00:00:30.109> so<00:00:31.109> let's<00:00:31.289> look<00:00:31.470> at

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
from the space station so let's look at

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.590 
from the space station so let's look at
that<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> second<00:00:32.759> sit<00:00:33.030> back<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.239> take<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that for a second sit back and take a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.500 
that for a second sit back and take a
look<00:00:33.719> at<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.649> object<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.280> huge<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:36.329> let

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
look at that that object is huge now let

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.049 
look at that that object is huge now let
me<00:00:36.540> go<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.899> next<00:00:37.140> picture<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:38.460> some

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
me go to this next picture now some

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.389 
me go to this next picture now some
people<00:00:39.350> say<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> Dark<00:00:41.190> Knight

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
people say that this is the Dark Knight

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.700 
people say that this is the Dark Knight
satellite<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> same<00:00:43.050> object<00:00:43.530> i

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
satellite also it's the same object i

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.670 
satellite also it's the same object i
believe<00:00:44.750> it's<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> different<00:00:46.590> angle

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
believe it's just from a different angle

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
believe it's just from a different angle
different<00:00:47.250> views<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.640> we're<00:00:47.820> seeing<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
different views so we're seeing it a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.910 
different views so we're seeing it a
little<00:00:48.450> bit<00:00:48.690> different<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.559> could<00:00:49.739> see

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
little bit different but we could see

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100 
little bit different but we could see
the<00:00:50.070> Sun<00:00:50.370> reflecting<00:00:51.239> off<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.420> back<00:00:51.719> end<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the Sun reflecting off the back end of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.950 
the Sun reflecting off the back end of
it<00:00:52.230> over<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.910> clearly<00:00:54.239> has<00:00:54.660> some

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it over here so it's clearly has some

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.639 
it over here so it's clearly has some
sort<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.379> metallic<00:00:55.980> structure<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
sort of metallic structure to it so the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
sort of metallic structure to it so the
next<00:00:58.859> image<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.760> image<00:00:59.910> right<00:01:00.210> here

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
next image this is an image right here

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.599 
next image this is an image right here
this<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.750> taken<00:01:01.079> from<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.320> fair<00:01:02.010> distance<00:01:02.399> as

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
this was taken from a fair distance as

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.030 
this was taken from a fair distance as
well<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.379> very

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
well and we can see that it's a very

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.570 
well and we can see that it's a very
sizable<00:01:05.610> object<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.990> let<00:01:07.799> me<00:01:07.830> skip<00:01:08.340> this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
sizable object now let me skip this

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.440 
sizable object now let me skip this
picture<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:11.240> people<00:01:12.240> tell

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
picture this one right here people tell

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.630 
picture this one right here people tell
me<00:01:12.479> oh<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.229> seat<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.070> seat<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> was

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
me oh that's a seat it's a seat that was

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.929 
me oh that's a seat it's a seat that was
ejected<00:01:14.970> from<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> space<00:01:15.659> station<00:01:15.979> well<00:01:16.979> tree

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
ejected from the space station well tree

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.190 
ejected from the space station well tree
of<00:01:18.060> might<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> tell<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.840> that's<00:01:18.960> not

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
of might is going to tell you that's not

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.929 
of might is going to tell you that's not
a<00:01:19.259> seat<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.920> ejected<00:01:20.250> from<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> space

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
a seat that was ejected from the space

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.920 
a seat that was ejected from the space
station<00:01:20.970> again<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.170> object<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> fairly

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
station again that object is at a fairly

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.660 
station again that object is at a fairly
decent<00:01:24.930> distance<00:01:25.560> away<00:01:25.950> from<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.310> space

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
decent distance away from the space

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.920 
decent distance away from the space
station<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:28.259> sizable<00:01:29.420> if<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.750> back

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
station and it's sizable if you go back

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.109 
station and it's sizable if you go back
to<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.320> first<00:01:32.040> couple<00:01:32.280> pictures<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.030> mean

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to the first couple pictures I mean

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
to the first couple pictures I mean
those<00:01:33.570> those<00:01:33.900> pictures<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.320> miles<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> miles

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
those those pictures are miles and miles

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.039 
those those pictures are miles and miles
away<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.670> would<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.240> seat<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.750> space

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
away we would not see a seat in space

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
away we would not see a seat in space
like<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.130> kind<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.610> floating<00:01:38.970> around

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
like that just kind of floating around

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.300 
like that just kind of floating around
and<00:01:39.509> hang<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.100> little

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and hang it out so here it is a little

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
and hang it out so here it is a little
bit<00:01:41.520> closer<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.470> there's

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
bit closer here we can see that there's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.069 
bit closer here we can see that there's
all<00:01:43.890> kinds<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.549> structure<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.600> symmetry

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
all kinds of structure and symmetry

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.740 
all kinds of structure and symmetry
going<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.500> within<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.040> thing<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
going on within this thing it's not a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.230 
going on within this thing it's not a
seat<00:01:49.340> you're<00:01:50.340> never<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> sell<00:01:51.060> me<00:01:51.210> on

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
seat you're never going to sell me on

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
seat you're never going to sell me on
the<00:01:51.420> fact<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.079> seat<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.100> let's<00:01:53.310> look

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the fact that it's a seat so let's look

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.450 
the fact that it's a seat so let's look
at<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.259> one<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.770> almost<00:01:56.070> looks

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
at this one this one it almost looks

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.440 
at this one this one it almost looks
like<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.869> wing<00:01:58.399> this<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> another<00:01:59.820> angle<00:02:00.270> as

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
like a wing this is another angle as

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.749 
like a wing this is another angle as
slightly<00:02:01.320> different<00:02:01.829> angles<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
slightly different angles so we see it

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.149 
slightly different angles so we see it
differently<00:02:02.969> again<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.380> next<00:02:04.619> image<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
differently again now this next image is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520 
differently again now this next image is
the<00:02:05.280> image<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.840> has<00:02:07.020> me<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
the image that I'm that it has me the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.999 
the image that I'm that it has me the
most<00:02:08.479> captivated<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.470> image<00:02:10.830> right

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
most captivated because this image right

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
most captivated because this image right
here<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.489> me<00:02:11.700> I'm<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.540> next

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
here to me I'm going to go to this next

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.550 
here to me I'm going to go to this next
one<00:02:13.050> in

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
one in

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.610 
one in
has<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.950> same<00:02:14.190> image<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> collage<00:02:15.200> now<00:02:16.200> this

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
has the same image in a collage now this

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.830 
has the same image in a collage now this
image<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.190> bottom<00:02:17.489> left<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
image on the bottom left if it's the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.510 
image on the bottom left if it's the
previous<00:02:19.260> image<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.739> just<00:02:19.980> flipped<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.370> over

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
previous image I just flipped it over

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.440 
previous image I just flipped it over
upside<00:02:20.970> down<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:23.220> looks<00:02:23.550> exactly<00:02:23.910> like<00:02:24.180> this

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
upside down it looks exactly like this

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.809 
upside down it looks exactly like this
image<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.050> top<00:02:25.260> left<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.800> collage<00:02:26.250> now

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
image on the top left of collage now

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.640 
image on the top left of collage now
this<00:02:27.030> image<00:02:27.300> on<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> top<00:02:27.750> left<00:02:28.020> was<00:02:28.200> taken<00:02:28.530> by

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
this image on the top left was taken by

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.190 
this image on the top left was taken by
the<00:02:28.709> helio<00:02:29.069> viewer<00:02:29.370> satellites<00:02:30.000> same<00:02:30.930> with

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the helio viewer satellites same with

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.680 
the helio viewer satellites same with
the<00:02:31.830> image<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.370> right<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.269> was<00:02:33.360> taken

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the image on the right so it was taken

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.170 
the image on the right so it was taken
with<00:02:33.840> Soho<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.560> all<00:02:34.950> those<00:02:35.130> satellites<00:02:36.030> we

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
with Soho and all those satellites we

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.460 
with Soho and all those satellites we
have<00:02:36.360> up<00:02:36.510> there<00:02:36.690> for<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> helio<00:02:37.230> viewer

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
have up there for the helio viewer

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.949 
have up there for the helio viewer
project<00:02:38.040> now<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.970> object<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.660> bottom

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
project now this object on the bottom

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.020 
project now this object on the bottom
left<00:02:40.170> looks<00:02:40.440> just<00:02:40.769> like<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.130> object<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
left looks just like the object on the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.540 
left looks just like the object on the
top<00:02:42.780> left<00:02:43.050> right<00:02:43.769> down<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> little

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
top left right down to the little

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.330 
top left right down to the little
adapter<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.840> has<00:02:45.989> underneath<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
adapter that it has underneath it on the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.330 
adapter that it has underneath it on the
pic<00:02:47.519> on<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:49.080> picture<00:02:49.380> on<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.500> bottom<00:02:49.950> you

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
pic on the picture on the bottom you

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.309 
pic on the picture on the bottom you
know<00:02:50.459> we're<00:02:50.940> facing<00:02:51.180> two<00:02:51.569> different<00:02:51.900> ways<00:02:52.049> if

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
know we're facing two different ways if

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.780 
know we're facing two different ways if
I'm<00:02:52.470> eard<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.860> image<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.310> would<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.610> almost

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
I'm eard the image it would be almost

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.059 
I'm eard the image it would be almost
the<00:02:54.060> same<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:54.660> if<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> take<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.769> the

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
the same but if you take this and the

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.100 
the same but if you take this and the
one<00:02:56.250> on<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.489> top<00:02:56.519> right<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.209> compare<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.049> to

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
one on the top right and compare it to

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.530 
one on the top right and compare it to
the<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.739> bottom<00:02:58.769> left<00:02:59.370> those<00:03:00.090> also

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
the one on the bottom left those also

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.509 
the one on the bottom left those also
look<00:03:00.750> like<00:03:00.900> they<00:03:01.049> can<00:03:01.230> match<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.220> what<00:03:02.400> is

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
look like they can match up so what is

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.300 
look like they can match up so what is
this<00:03:02.730> thing<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> satellite<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.010> UFO

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
this thing is it a satellite is it a UFO

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.910 
this thing is it a satellite is it a UFO
what's<00:03:06.239> going<00:03:06.569> on<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.959> don't<00:03:07.500> think<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.769> we

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
what's going on I don't think that we

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.800 
what's going on I don't think that we
could<00:03:08.069> have<00:03:08.160> put<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.400> satellite<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.970> big<00:03:09.569> up

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
could have put a satellite that big up

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.809 
could have put a satellite that big up
in<00:03:09.959> orbit<00:03:10.349> unless<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:10.799> did<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.069> in<00:03:11.160> pieces<00:03:11.459> and

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
in orbit unless we did it in pieces and

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.949 
in orbit unless we did it in pieces and
built<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:12.900> orbit<00:03:13.319> so<00:03:13.890> did<00:03:14.700> we<00:03:14.880> put<00:03:15.330> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
built it in orbit so did we put the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.140 
built it in orbit so did we put the
pieces<00:03:16.200> up<00:03:16.530> there<00:03:16.769> for<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.280> project<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:18.000> did

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
pieces up there for this project and did

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.390 
pieces up there for this project and did
we<00:03:18.329> actually<00:03:18.570> do<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.200> project<00:03:19.440> or<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.280> this

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
we actually do this project or is this

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.640 
we actually do this project or is this
part<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.880> Star<00:03:21.150> Wars<00:03:21.329> system<00:03:21.840> that

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
part of the Star Wars system that

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.819 
part of the Star Wars system that
apparently<00:03:23.609> went<00:03:23.940> out<00:03:24.060> with<00:03:24.299> Reagan<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.900> I

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
apparently went out with Reagan and I

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.710 
apparently went out with Reagan and I
know<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.160> didn't<00:03:26.430> go<00:03:26.579> out<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:27.329> just<00:03:27.540> went

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
know it didn't go out it just went

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.170
