00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
it's a really cool-looking pedal I mean

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.660 
it's a really cool-looking pedal I mean
I<00:00:58.570> just<00:00:58.600> love<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.020> color<00:00:59.230> of<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.739> one<00:01:00.579> of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
I just love the color of it and one of

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.190 
I just love the color of it and one of
the<00:01:00.730> features<00:01:01.030> that's<00:01:01.059> really<00:01:01.600> handy<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:02.020> me

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
the features that's really handy to me

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.170 
the features that's really handy to me
is<00:01:02.410> that<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.739> on/off<00:01:03.100> switch<00:01:03.399> is<00:01:03.640> right<00:01:04.000> back

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
is that the on/off switch is right back

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.400 
is that the on/off switch is right back
here<00:01:04.390> in<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.539> back<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.050> you<00:01:05.080> can<00:01:05.289> either

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
here in the back so you can either

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.340 
here in the back so you can either
switch<00:01:05.770> it<00:01:05.920> on<00:01:06.039> with<00:01:06.190> your<00:01:06.310> toe<00:01:06.550> right<00:01:07.350> switch

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
switch it on with your toe right switch

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.480 
switch it on with your toe right switch
an<00:01:08.470> on<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.740> off<00:01:08.770> with<00:01:08.920> your<00:01:09.039> toes<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:09.460> you

an on and off with your toes so you

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.420 
an on and off with your toes so you
leave<00:01:09.910> your<00:01:09.940> setting<00:01:10.600> on<00:01:11.380> your<00:01:11.440> pedal<00:01:11.950> exactly

leave your setting on your pedal exactly

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.580 
leave your setting on your pedal exactly
the<00:01:12.550> way<00:01:12.640> you<00:01:12.700> want<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.119> or<00:01:13.330> if<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.350> want<00:01:14.380> to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
and operate the pedal what the pedal

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.150 
and operate the pedal what the pedal

controls is the speed of the effect and

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.249 
controls is the speed of the effect and
there's<00:01:24.850> an<00:01:24.970> intensity<00:01:25.390> knob<00:01:25.690> that's<00:01:25.930> on<00:01:26.140> the

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.940 
switch when you put it in vibrato mode
what<00:01:31.720> you've<00:01:31.840> done<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.170> taken<00:01:32.530> out<00:01:32.679> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
what you've done is taken out the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.859 
what you've done is taken out the
original<00:01:33.670> signal<00:01:33.880> so<00:01:34.179> you<00:01:34.270> only<00:01:34.479> have<00:01:34.630> the

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
original signal so you only have the

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.380 
original signal so you only have the
modulated<00:01:35.440> signal<00:01:35.470> alone<00:01:35.950> by<00:01:36.190> itself<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.849> you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
modulated signal alone by itself and you

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.609 
modulated signal alone by itself and you
can<00:01:37.509> see<00:01:37.630> right<00:01:37.780> next<00:01:37.959> to<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.170> there's<00:01:38.500> a

sound you're used to the sound that I

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.650 
sound you're used to the sound that I
used<00:01:44.470> in<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.740> intro<00:01:45.069> and<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:46.030> modern<00:01:46.270> mode

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
control on the side as well I like it

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.630 
control on the side as well I like it
slightly<00:01:53.470> boosted<00:01:54.130> that's<00:01:54.280> where<00:01:54.429> I've<00:01:54.520> got

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
slightly boosted that's where I've got

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.850 
slightly boosted that's where I've got
it<00:01:54.759> set<00:01:54.970> right<00:01:55.000> now<00:01:55.209> I'm<00:01:55.509> running<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.319> in<00:01:56.500> front

of<00:01:57.099> a<00:01:57.220> distortion<00:01:57.610> pedal<00:01:57.759> so<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.989> know<00:01:59.110> it's

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
of a distortion pedal so you know it's

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.449 
of a distortion pedal so you know it's
driving<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.679> pedal<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> little<00:02:00.130> harder<00:02:00.429> a

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:39.729 

all<00:02:31.099> right<00:02:31.220> here<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.640> engaged<00:02:38.560> that's<00:02:39.560> set

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
all right here it is engaged that's set

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.170 
all right here it is engaged that's set
to<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.860> little<00:02:40.099> bit<00:02:40.190> faster<00:02:40.580> speed<00:02:40.849> setting

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
to a little bit faster speed setting

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:55.490 
to a little bit faster speed setting
let's<00:02:41.330> get<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.569> all<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> way<00:02:41.810> up<00:02:42.019> here

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.780 

right<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.680> there's<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.980> lot<00:02:57.129> of<00:02:57.159> range<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
right so there's a lot of range in the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.059 
right so there's a lot of range in the
speed<00:02:58.030> control<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:59.349> treadle<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.739> really

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
speed control and the treadle is really

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.190 
speed control and the treadle is really
smooth<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.939> stays<00:03:01.299> in<00:03:01.329> place<00:03:01.569> which<00:03:02.049> is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
smooth and it stays in place which is

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.380 
smooth and it stays in place which is
great<00:03:02.590> which<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.189> another<00:03:03.430> great<00:03:03.849> reason<00:03:04.060> for

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
great which is another great reason for

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.780 
great which is another great reason for
this<00:03:04.450> little<00:03:04.659> indented<00:03:05.260> switch<00:03:05.530> here<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
this little indented switch here the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.569 
this little indented switch here the
indicator<00:03:07.239> light<00:03:07.569> right<00:03:08.140> there<00:03:08.430> blinks<00:03:09.430> at

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
indicator light right there blinks at

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.360 
indicator light right there blinks at
the<00:03:09.879> speed<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.989> treadle<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.769> set<00:03:12.010> at<00:03:12.189> and

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
the speed that the treadle is set at and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.610 
the speed that the treadle is set at and
interestingly<00:03:12.849> enough<00:03:13.239> with<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.260> intensity

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
interestingly enough with the intensity

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.410 
interestingly enough with the intensity
