this review is on the Invisalign three
Internet<00:00:05.850> control<00:00:06.210> module<00:00:06.690> for<00:00:06.930> security

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
Internet control module for security

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.669 
Internet control module for security
systems<00:00:07.799> works<00:00:08.790> with<00:00:08.970> iPhone<00:00:09.650> Android<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
systems works with iPhone Android and

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.209 
systems works with iPhone Android and
Blackberry<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.840> use<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.139> my<00:00:13.230> iPhone<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.099> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
Blackberry I use it on my iPhone and it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.340 
Blackberry I use it on my iPhone and it
works<00:00:14.370> really<00:00:14.849> well<00:00:15.000> there's<00:00:15.660> no<00:00:15.780> app<00:00:15.929> for<00:00:15.960> it

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
works really well there's no app for it

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.080 
works really well there's no app for it
so<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.369> save<00:00:17.690> a<00:00:18.690> web<00:00:19.439> link<00:00:19.710> to

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
so what you do is you save a web link to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.340 
so what you do is you save a web link to
iZON<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:22.130> you<00:00:23.130> save<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.840> save<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.019> link<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
iZON and you save a save the link to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.810 
iZON and you save a save the link to
your<00:00:25.439> home<00:00:25.650> page<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.189> looks<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.460> an<00:00:26.670> app

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
your home page so it looks like an app

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.849 
your home page so it looks like an app
and<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.420> works<00:00:27.510> really<00:00:27.810> well<00:00:27.960> lets<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.619> arm

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and it works really well lets you arm

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.659 
and it works really well lets you arm
your<00:00:29.630> your<00:00:30.630> alarm<00:00:31.050> system<00:00:31.130> away<00:00:32.130> from<00:00:32.309> home

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
your your alarm system away from home

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.979 
your your alarm system away from home
you<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.149> check<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> status<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.610> so<00:00:35.989> I'm

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you can check the status and so I'm

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.360 
you can check the status and so I'm
posting<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.469> video<00:00:37.800> because<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.100> couldn't

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
posting this video because I couldn't

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.119 
posting this video because I couldn't
find<00:00:38.610> any<00:00:39.510> reviews<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.559> bought<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
find any reviews but I bought it and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.880 
find any reviews but I bought it and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
just go to your alarm control box like

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.539 
just go to your alarm control box like
on<00:01:15.360> mine<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.409> it'll<00:01:16.680> tell<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.040> which<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
on mine and it'll tell you which one you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.219 
on mine and it'll tell you which one you
have<00:01:18.770> something<00:01:19.770> else<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.040> want<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> point<00:01:20.610> out

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
have something else I want to point out

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.960 
have something else I want to point out
what's<00:01:22.229> included<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.130> box<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
what's included in the box you get the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.899 
what's included in the box you get the
module<00:01:24.439> mounting<00:01:25.439> pins<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.100> installation

module mounting pins and installation
guide<00:01:27.140> installation<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.650> pretty<00:01:28.890> easy<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
guide installation was pretty easy the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
guide installation was pretty easy the
hardest<00:01:29.970> part<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> probably<00:01:30.750> routing<00:01:31.350> your

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
hardest part is probably routing your

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.429 
hardest part is probably routing your
your<00:01:32.430> ethernet<00:01:32.880> cable<00:01:33.299> from<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.570> router<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
your ethernet cable from your router to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.160 
your ethernet cable from your router to
your<00:01:34.680> cable<00:01:35.100> box<00:01:35.460> that's<00:01:35.820> probably<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
your cable box that's probably the the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
your cable box that's probably the the
most<00:01:37.200> time-consuming<00:01:37.619> part<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.850> you've

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
most time-consuming part but if you've

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.569 
most time-consuming part but if you've
done<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.299> before<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.159> easy<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
done that before you know it's easy and

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.560 
done that before you know it's easy and
if<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> haven't<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.619> an<00:01:43.619> easy<00:01:43.860> thing<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.220> do

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
if you haven't it's an easy thing to do

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.469 
if you haven't it's an easy thing to do
if<00:01:45.570> you're<00:01:46.229> prepared<00:01:46.710> for<00:01:47.040> it

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
if you're prepared for it

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.080 
if you're prepared for it
designed<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.630> Canada<00:01:49.049> made<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.470> Taiwan<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.939> let

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
designed in Canada made in Taiwan so let

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.960 
designed in Canada made in Taiwan so let
me<00:01:51.149> show<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.329> what<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.659> looks<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.049> installed

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
me show you what it looks like installed

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.080 
me show you what it looks like installed
so<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> saw<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> video<00:01:54.420> online<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:56.700> shows<00:01:56.939> you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
so I saw a video online and it shows you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.670 
so I saw a video online and it shows you
you<00:01:57.210> use<00:01:57.829> three<00:01:58.829> pins<00:01:59.780> to<00:02:00.780> make<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:01.439> board

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you use three pins to make your board

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770 
you use three pins to make your board
nice<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.159> stable<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.670> my<00:02:02.850> box<00:02:03.210> doesn't<00:02:03.540> have

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
nice and stable but my box doesn't have

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.280 
nice and stable but my box doesn't have
enough<00:02:04.020> holes<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.969> pretty

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
enough holes in it so it's a pretty

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.380 
enough holes in it so it's a pretty
small<00:02:07.290> box<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.209> here

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
small box but you can see right here

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.510 
small box but you can see right here
it's<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.929> module<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.379> already<00:02:10.649> connected<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
it's the module is already connected and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.910 
it's the module is already connected and
I<00:02:11.610> made<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> work<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.170> not

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I made it work so it's not

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.760 
I made it work so it's not
to<00:02:14.190> set<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.849> here<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.810> location<00:02:16.170> isn't<00:02:16.530> as

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
to set up in here the location isn't as

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.240 
to set up in here the location isn't as
ideal<00:02:17.670> as<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.000> would<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.660> be<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:19.250> it's

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
ideal as I would like it to be but it's

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.979 
ideal as I would like it to be but it's
still<00:02:20.340> there

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
still there

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.350 
still there
these<00:02:21.989> are<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.260> wires<00:02:22.440> let<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.400> connect<00:02:23.790> one

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
these are the wires let you connect one

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.470 
these are the wires let you connect one
two<00:02:24.900> three<00:02:25.410> four<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:26.760> pretty<00:02:26.970> easy<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
two three four so it's pretty easy and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.770 
two three four so it's pretty easy and
pretty<00:02:27.540> basic<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.290> had<00:02:28.440> some<00:02:28.650> leftover<00:02:29.010> wire

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
pretty basic I had some leftover wire

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.229 
pretty basic I had some leftover wire
that<00:02:30.780> was<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.350> my<00:02:31.500> alarm<00:02:31.920> box<00:02:32.239> that's

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
that was in here in my alarm box that's

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.150 
that was in here in my alarm box that's
over<00:02:33.420> here<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:33.690> snipped<00:02:34.680> off<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.890> little

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
over here I just snipped off a little

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.020 
over here I just snipped off a little
piece<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.750> connected<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:38.190> how<00:02:38.700> does<00:02:38.760> it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
piece and connected it so how does it

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.509 
piece and connected it so how does it
does<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.390> work<00:02:39.569> good<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:41.100> know<00:02:41.190> what's<00:02:41.400> my

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
does it work good you know what's my

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.820 
does it work good you know what's my
opinion<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.390> think<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.440> works<00:02:43.590> really

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
opinion of it I think it works really

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.710 
opinion of it I think it works really
well<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.130> get<00:02:44.400> text<00:02:44.730> messages<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.300> can<00:02:45.510> also

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
well I get text messages you can also

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.540 
well I get text messages you can also
set<00:02:45.959> up<00:02:45.989> for<00:02:46.230> email<00:02:46.620> alerts<00:02:46.769> there's<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.370> bunch

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
set up for email alerts there's a bunch

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.420 
set up for email alerts there's a bunch
of<00:02:47.670> options<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.330> control<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.400> mine<00:02:50.400> I

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
of options you can control like mine I

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.880 
of options you can control like mine I
have<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.850> set<00:02:51.120> up<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.690> if<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.410> alarm<00:02:52.680> goes

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890

off I get a text message my wife and I
do<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.830> have<00:02:55.950> multiple<00:02:56.100> users<00:02:56.430> you

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
do so you can have multiple users you

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.110 
do so you can have multiple users you
can<00:02:57.269> set<00:02:57.709> restrictions<00:02:58.709> for<00:02:59.100> temporary<00:02:59.700> users

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
can set restrictions for temporary users

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.220 
can set restrictions for temporary users
so<00:03:00.360> let's<00:03:00.540> say<00:03:00.660> you're<00:03:00.780> going<00:03:00.810> out<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.110> town

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
so let's say you're going out of town

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.949 
so let's say you're going out of town
and<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:02.610> want<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.269> your<00:03:03.390> neighbors<00:03:03.750> set

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
up in there and you know and then when

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.350 
up in there and you know and then when
you<00:03:07.410> get<00:03:07.530> back<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.160> remove<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.940> access

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
you get back you can remove the access

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.420 
you get back you can remove the access
that<00:03:09.420> they<00:03:09.690> have<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:11.010> your<00:03:11.190> alarm

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
system so you can there's a lot of

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.259 
system so you can there's a lot of
options<00:03:14.730> there<00:03:15.410> as<00:03:16.410> far<00:03:16.620> as<00:03:16.730> different<00:03:17.730> other

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
options there as far as different other

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.000 
options there as far as different other
options<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.810> haven't<00:03:19.170> on<00:03:19.350> your<00:03:19.500> system<00:03:19.859> you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
options you haven't on your system you

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.930 
options you haven't on your system you
can<00:03:20.190> label<00:03:20.910> zones<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:22.350> if<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.459> get<00:03:23.609> an<00:03:23.700> alarm

mine set up so that if any of the window

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.090 
mine set up so that if any of the window
is<00:03:30.209> open<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.600> get<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.780> text<00:03:31.170> message<00:03:31.200> regardless

self<00:03:54.380> monitoring<00:03:55.380> system<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.390> I'd<00:03:57.390> recommend

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
self monitoring system so I'd recommend

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.109 
self monitoring system so I'd recommend
it
