00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
Knights of Cybertron who were like these

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.340 
Knights of Cybertron who were like these
people<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.540> ancestors<00:01:58.320> of

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
people like the ancestors of

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 
people like the ancestors of
Cybertronians<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.399> they<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.450> there

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
Cybertronians and they think that there

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.870 
Cybertronians and they think that there
is<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> map<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.469> came<00:02:02.070> out<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> matrix<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
is a map that came out the matrix and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.020 
is a map that came out the matrix and
they<00:02:02.939> think<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.780> map<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
they think that that's the map to the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.809 
they think that that's the map to the
Knights<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.149> Cybertron<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.350> he's<00:02:08.220> trying<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
Knights of Cybertron so he's trying to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.430 
Knights of Cybertron so he's trying to
assemble<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.179> group<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.720> place<00:02:10.140> that's

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
assemble a group in this place that's

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.470 
assemble a group in this place that's

to the original Ark and he takes

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.969 
to the original Ark and he takes
basically<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.530> nap<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.340> sets<00:05:18.300> his<00:05:18.449> timer<00:05:18.919> for<00:05:19.919> a

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
and look at the covers for this issue

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.939 
and look at the covers for this issue
weird<00:05:40.699> thing<00:05:40.939> is<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.599> covers<00:05:41.929> that<00:05:42.080> focus<00:05:42.800> on

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
weird thing is the covers that focus on

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.579 
weird thing is the covers that focus on
a<00:05:42.979> specific<00:05:43.129> character<00:05:43.729> are<00:05:44.229> weird<00:05:45.229> because

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:45.589 
a specific character are weird because

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.549 
thing about as first of all they're all
earth<00:05:58.219> designs<00:05:58.669> and<00:05:59.259> they've<00:06:00.259> all<00:06:00.439> been

00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:00.559 
earth designs and they've all been

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:02.409 
earth designs and they've all been

believe by spike who's in this universe

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.149 
believe by spike who's in this universe
a<00:06:07.819> military<00:06:08.300> general<00:06:08.749> so<00:06:09.379> they<00:06:09.469> all<00:06:09.589> leave<00:06:09.860> on

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:10.159 
a military general so they all leave on

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.730 
a military general so they all leave on
earth<00:06:10.689> sent<00:06:11.689> also<00:06:12.050> some<00:06:12.229> Cybertron's

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
earth sent also some Cybertron's

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.909 
earth sent also some Cybertron's
restored<00:06:13.599> but<00:06:14.599> either<00:06:15.110> way<00:06:15.439> they're<00:06:15.679> still

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
restored but either way they're still

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.230 
restored but either way they're still
cool<00:06:16.129> and<00:06:16.990> it<00:06:18.009> shows<00:06:19.009> for<00:06:19.459> out<00:06:19.639> of<00:06:19.789> I<00:06:19.939> believe

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
cool and it shows for out of I believe

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.119 
cool and it shows for out of I believe
there's<00:06:20.539> six<00:06:20.929> characters<00:06:21.439> that<00:06:21.619> have<00:06:21.949> been

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:22.129 
there's six characters that have been

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:25.419 
there's six characters that have been
confirmed<00:06:22.550> to<00:06:22.819> be<00:06:22.939> part<00:06:23.659> of<00:06:23.779> the<00:06:24.649> ship<00:06:24.889> at<00:06:25.219> this

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:25.429 
confirmed to be part of the ship at this

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:27.549 
confirmed to be part of the ship at this
point<00:06:25.699> but<00:06:26.329> I<00:06:26.569> only<00:06:26.869> showed<00:06:27.110> these<00:06:27.319> ones

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:27.559 
point but I only showed these ones

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:29.049 
point but I only showed these ones
because<00:06:27.769> these<00:06:27.919> were<00:06:28.279> the<00:06:28.490> only<00:06:28.610> ones<00:06:28.849> of<00:06:28.969> the

00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:29.059 
because these were the only ones of the

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:31.929 
because these were the only ones of the
previous<00:06:29.479> design<00:06:30.319> I<00:06:30.349> presume<00:06:30.860> since<00:06:31.519> chrome

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:31.939 
previous design I presume since chrome

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:33.759 
previous design I presume since chrome
dome<00:06:32.119> and<00:06:32.300> rerun<00:06:32.719> this<00:06:32.989> their<00:06:33.289> first<00:06:33.499> time

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:33.769 
dome and rerun this their first time

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:36.339 
dome and rerun this their first time
appearing<00:06:34.129> I<00:06:34.309> believe<00:06:34.569> here's<00:06:35.569> the<00:06:35.659> I<00:06:36.079> think

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
appearing I believe here's the I think
