00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.500
 I told you guys 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.110
 Now I'll do mine here for you if 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 do not use flash video recorder 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 I'm recording but it does not have any 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.480
 problem opening here in the middle people 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:27.990
 will have the part of the recording people 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.750
 touch here to record 6 of aggravation 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.840
 who will ask for any video that will be 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.200
 run here the part of the benchmark 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.160
 people see when it happens that the average 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.170
 of the species that we will be able to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.020
 run our video in case of 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.020
 amount of 35 points and is known in the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 HD resolution and was recorded on hd 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.390
 same video cef invente will have several 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.430
 settings 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 just have a detail view know if 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.710
 happened on the video or when it was 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.590
 recording but it happens but it was a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.510
 test instead you select here teaching and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.270
 when you get back to that one it gets all black 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.130
 they can see if he speaks here I 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.409
 I'm going to be in jail for a while 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.950
 came back normal because this happens 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.280
 because it's not your video card is 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.500
 running this small-screen recording 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 these screen settings in case it is 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.939
 recording the program and it does not support 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.860
 for many things 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.380
 so we change it like we do 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.720
 take only for the black to look like a 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.880
 static screen developer locates 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.329
 here the water that will have something like 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.250
 with deactivating layers of hardware or 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.700
 use the gpu for a button on the screen 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.250
 things like that playing here this 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.320
 I'll show you how to do it. 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.200
 open here a game opened the zen good hdl e 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.420
 You can probably 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.549
 game or he will release today will stay 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.200
 static an image it will turn black 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.350
 I do not know what I'm recording here now. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.350
 maybe you'll live a maceio thing 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.280
 but I'll touch the knot but here it's okay 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.060
 slow things like that 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.370
 You may not come anyway or 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.890
 you may not be opening the game and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.360
 open the screen the image becomes 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.959
 intensity 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.620
 I'm playing but the fight was never 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:34.780
 did nothing in turn we will have 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.830
 in gpu developer settings 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.290
 for the composition on the screen 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.510
 automatically back to the game 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.959
 You can watch them play quietly. 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:51.519
 Then I can play without having any 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:57.190
 problem with the display of the video here 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.180
 My game coming back here for you. 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.450
 can see that it carries everything 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.040
 Do not give it or anything because 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.900
 we came to gpu with the position of 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.319
 the same thing you select the 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.450
 things and they appear quietly 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.160
 good people this is how you will record one 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.950
 disc in cash any doubt does not 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.989
 can comment on the will of our channel 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.600
