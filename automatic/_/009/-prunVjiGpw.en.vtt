overnight fuzzy mice don't they move

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.710 
overnight fuzzy mice don't they move
just<00:01:27.130> enough<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.640> entice<00:01:27.940> them<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:28.360> not<00:01:28.510> so

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
just enough to entice them but not so

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.470 
just enough to entice them but not so
much<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.080> scare<00:01:29.290> them<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.560> intimidate<00:01:30.010> them

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
so that way they do get started feeding

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.670 
so that way they do get started feeding
relatively<00:01:33.940> easily<00:01:34.120> if<00:01:34.900> you<00:01:35.140> have<00:01:35.320> troubles
