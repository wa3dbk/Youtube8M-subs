again<00:05:47.200> now<00:05:47.560> let's<00:05:47.770> talk<00:05:47.890> about<00:05:48.010> the<00:05:48.250> cons<00:05:48.550> now

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
again now let's talk about the cons now

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.820 
again now let's talk about the cons now
if<00:05:49.180> you<00:05:49.330> did<00:05:49.600> have<00:05:49.810> sharing<00:05:50.350> options

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
if you did have sharing options

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.530 
if you did have sharing options
obviously<00:05:51.040> you<00:05:51.370> will<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:51.820> know<00:05:51.910> uploading<00:05:52.510> to

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
obviously you will you know uploading to

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.540 
obviously you will you know uploading to
facebook<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.470> twitter<00:05:54.040> and<00:05:54.280> stuff<00:05:54.400> like<00:05:54.490> that

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
facebook and twitter and stuff like that

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.790 
facebook and twitter and stuff like that
but<00:05:54.940> does<00:05:55.180> that<00:05:55.240> mean<00:05:55.360> that<00:05:55.630> you<00:05:56.080> can<00:05:56.410> only<00:05:56.590> do

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
but does that mean that you can only do

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.830 
but does that mean that you can only do
that<00:05:56.950> through<00:05:57.010> Wi-Fi<00:05:57.460> and<00:05:58.090> if<00:05:58.419> that<00:05:58.450> means<00:05:58.720> you

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
that through Wi-Fi and if that means you

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.210 
that through Wi-Fi and if that means you
can<00:05:58.930> only<00:05:59.050> do<00:05:59.200> that<00:05:59.320> through<00:05:59.380> Wi-Fi<00:05:59.740> that

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
can only do that through Wi-Fi that

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.550 
can only do that through Wi-Fi that
means<00:06:00.400> you<00:06:00.610> have<00:06:00.790> to<00:06:00.820> be<00:06:01.150> your<00:06:01.630> most<00:06:01.840> likely<00:06:02.290> at

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
means you have to be your most likely at

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.940 
means you have to be your most likely at
home<00:06:03.310> in<00:06:04.000> a<00:06:04.060> way<00:06:04.390> so<00:06:04.450> if<00:06:05.169> you're<00:06:05.350> at<00:06:05.440> home<00:06:05.500> you

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
home in a way so if you're at home you

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.230 
home in a way so if you're at home you
can<00:06:06.010> just<00:06:06.340> you<00:06:06.640> know<00:06:06.729> throw<00:06:06.880> it<00:06:07.030> on<00:06:07.120> your

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
can just you know throw it on your

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.510 
can just you know throw it on your
computer<00:06:07.330> to<00:06:08.260> upload<00:06:08.560> it<00:06:08.710> so<00:06:08.979> does<00:06:09.160> that<00:06:09.220> mean

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
computer to upload it so does that mean

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.050 
computer to upload it so does that mean
there<00:06:10.060> have<00:06:10.300> 3g<00:06:11.050> capabilities<00:06:11.830> to<00:06:12.550> upload<00:06:12.910> it

anywhere but if you have 3g does that

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.520 
anywhere but if you have 3g does that
