 e 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.779
 indeed there are two kinds of video games 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.519
 those in which there are times of 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.199
 loading and those in which he has 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.520
 not it's time to load you the 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.930
 know what are these little moments of 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.519
 floating these little moments 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.079
 contemplatives that consent to us 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.640
 offer the game to make us wait 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.899
 while loading in the train the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.360
 data necessary for what we can 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.430
 start or continue your adventure 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.650
 these are rarely the most 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.629
 exciting game so if someone 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.860
 you then said my games he is naze 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.239
 me it's jam loading times 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.670
 biarritz type chart you would say 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.690
 but he's crazy and yet he can be 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.430
 fun to see that some 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.840
 developers are sometimes very well shot 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.609
 and have managed to create screens of 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.960
 loading that is remembered and which in 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.660
 even come to give the stamp to 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.520
 games for example the doors and the 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.020
 resident evil stairs 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.920
 it was not only animated 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.330
 recognize that a lot of games are 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.340
 then contented to put a picture of 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.259
 rotten but also it did not care when 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.520
 not bad the chips and it did not break 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.140
 never the atmosphere of the game 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.340
 quite the contrary to the very point 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.470
 to bring a kind of continuity 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.100
 fake to one action anyway 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.659
 relatively slow was a screen time 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.700
 could be perceived by the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.259
 player as a deliverance for a 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.849
 times the technical limits of the time 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.179
 was entirely ahead of the 

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:34.060
 player 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.800
 the enemies did not know how to cross the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.720
 loading screens you could not find 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.670
 that in no manual it was a rule 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.849
 absolutely implicit but with which 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.679
 instinctively the player would dial 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:46.899
 then the wind turned they finally 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.200
 learned and it was over with trickery of 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.330
 Sioux 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.649
 maybe someday will we even have the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.360
 right of enemies it's clever they 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.129
 will be able to kill us during 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.270
 loading time a lot of between 

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:56.739
 you knew their first time from 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.009
 loading with the appearance of the support 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:02.200
 CD on pc playstation saturn and have it 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.869
 tested and one stamps and impatient and 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.160
 fiery then in summer but know that 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.569
 we were not the first to 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.220
 suffer these little moments of 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.110
 frustrated and complain about it 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.090
 before us our elders had hardly been 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.379
 he was spared a more distant time 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.120
 still where he will get better as 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.560
 today launch his game before 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.440
 move to the toilets and this time 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.150
 it's the tape support time then 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.489
 the judge 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.140
 follows with tapes these tapes 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.390
 rudimentary magnetic can store 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.390
 hours of music videos and even 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.799
 video games and mehdi usual month i 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.810
 do not really understand how we can do 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.239
 keep all this information on 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.099
 simple tapes and well it's very simple 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.230
 since it is enough to measure the 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.750
 polarization of magnetic particles 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.569
 on a soft substrate and let's take 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.180
 the example of iron oxide or not in 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.769
 his cellars invade all good by and large the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.239
 cassettes it worked well to store 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.370
 small games for Commodore 64 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.049
 summer at 7 or mo5 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.549
 it was still necessary to take his evil 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.560
 in patience for sometimes more than five 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.940
 minutes and as many as five minutes sometimes 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.560
 may seem short 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.840
 is not it ladies so much five 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.840
 minutes watching this while listening to that 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.660
 and all that to play that some games 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.220
 still allowed us to play 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.160
 a mini game during the charging time 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.690
 black for example ghostbusters on 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.430
 commodore throw us a copy space 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.260
 invaders named an aude watch 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.850
 when we wait for this idea 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.160
 will be taken much later for example 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.690
 in the dbz games on ps2 but we lose 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.070
 a lot of the interest of a real mini game 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.200
 since strangely it is mini 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.090
 games without a stake nothing to count the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.770
 points no score to reach so no 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.670
 of reward strange example of no play 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.770
 but it's always better all these 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.630
 static screens we had this typing since 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.150
 of years is what you know that in 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.760
 average a player goes through his life if 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.110
 miller has the 10000 are put to both 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.700
 one hundred thousand hours of his life it is 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.320
 we do not know in front of screens 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.570
 loading as much as he could 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.220
 devote to read the figaro or to flatter 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.810
 his regular of his assiduities 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.310
 but the whole problem of the times of 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.720
 loading is that it lasts just enough 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.950
 a long time to get bored is 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.330
 far too little time to 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.690
 can embark on anything 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.690
 of constructive 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.459
 the first 50 percent is the most 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.790
 long I have something I look at the 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.050
 window 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.190
 the routing of bodies I have no 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.420
 window of the shot I look at the screen 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.370
 I had planned my shot I had made myself 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.359
 tea hot tea is too hot tea 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.440
 has not passed the first half 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.820
 I already have the impression that this is 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.660
 blocked but my cursor to be sure 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.150
 that it continues to advance 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.930
 I had to breathe in that way well I 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.790
 resume tea and mechanically 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.690
 always too hot I think of my part 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.770
 and I remember two three things 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.250
 that I had to settle before the next 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.180
 battle 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.290
 I think it's super important 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.640
 that I must not forget mail to his 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.870
 load I resume climb I remember 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.040
 that it is too hot and loading is 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.000
 finishes battle chanter is the one 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.590
 since what I had to do 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.580
 short when we have nothing to say and who 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.390
 pass nothing just say it very 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.669
 quickly for that has mouth 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.140
 and yet developers often have 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.000
 tried to trick us into proposing to 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.620
 sometimes wait for game tips 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.660
 sometimes small jokes of small 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.320
 quotes and often very nice 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.520
 artworks 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.600
 but nothing that makes you want 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.270
 loading is prolonged more than 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.130
 necessary then yes why not 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.310
 enjoy this time lost to try 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.450
 to re - enchant our lives would not it be 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.450
 only a few moments 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.690
 you know I always wanted to tell me that 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.690
 I do not know what I would do without you 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.580
 it's nice you're a bit like my bar 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.139
 of mana 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.389
 if you fail me I'm still in 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.240
 life but life loses all its magic you 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:30.410
 are a bit like you see the facts in 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.620
 zelda well it's a bit like in 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.070
 but it's good it's good pardon 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.389
 apparently it's not ready to 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.550
 stop by these stories of 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.930
 loading already some start to get 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.150
 complain about those of the ps vita who 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.430
 would sometimes exceed the 30 seconds going 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.960
 so we have to continue to do with the 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.350
 big problem being that as would say 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.479
 the other 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.800
 patience is a virtue that is acquired 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.800
 with patience
