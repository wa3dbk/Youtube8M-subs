00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.380

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.120
 already unify both pieces of the dress 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.820
 as you can see I met him here and 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.579
 now 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.790
 that was so let's talk about it for this 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.790
 side 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 and we are going to sew here to unify this 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 part the dress to the bottom and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.710
 then we will proceed to paste to sew 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.600
 our our velcro on the back in 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.409
 this top 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.360
 already stick the velcro with hot silicone 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.090
 in the back and now we're going with 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.500
 the next detail of this disguise 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.500
 to make the headband hat 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.930
 we are going to need these plastic pieces 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.300
 that come in the bottles 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.790
 and we are going to remove all these points and 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.670
 let's proceed to erase it with felt 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.380
 in black 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.080
 I have finished forming the part 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.960
 external headband put silicone vas 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.640
 pasting the felt or the fabric and now 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.340
 well I'm lining the inner part 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.130
 same with the hot silicone here and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.170
 You are putting the cloth together 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.840
 and once you have this finished 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.509
 you just go through with the scissors 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.459
 all the excesses now with the background 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.519
 interior of toilet paper or paper 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.010
 hygienic I will do it when much more 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.599
 thin that I'm going to stick with the help of 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.980
 the hot silicone already trimming and 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.319
 thin the cone I'm going to put it 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.970
 hot silicone here and I'm going to stick it 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.300
 this circle that I made in a cardboard 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.220
 bigger I'm going to take this circle 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.460
 here and I'm going to paste this in this way 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.010
 to make our hat 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.620
 Now I'm going to take another piece of cardboard 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.710
 I'm going to put hot silicone up to 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.590
 edge and I'm going to put it here to close the 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.090
 top of the hat and is now 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.610
 you just have to cut with the scissors 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.310
 the excess cardboard the hat is 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.760
 finished now with the help of paper 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.910
 newspaper in pieces wet with cola 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.190
 school or water or with paste we are going to 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.770
 proceed to cover our hat 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.770
 I show after the newspaper 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.780
 it has dried I have gone to paint color 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.640
 black now just what you have to 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.190
 to do is to choose where you want your 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.840
 hat if you want it here or want it 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.320
 on the side you put some silicone 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.810
 hot in two points and you put that on 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.880
 it will be everything 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.860
 this is the final result you should stay 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.069
 so you can see there is the hat 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.840
 on the side the dress in black and 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.060
 based on that same dress we are going to 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.340

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.250
