00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
of slightly ombre colors as well but

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.190 
of slightly ombre colors as well but
this<00:03:15.380> one<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:16.040> 1b<00:03:16.580> 30<00:03:17.000> which<00:03:17.360> is<00:03:17.390> just<00:03:17.780> an<00:03:17.959> all

this one is a 1b 30 which is just an all
black<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.950> then<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.280> has<00:03:19.520> really<00:03:20.270> cute

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660

chestnut<00:03:21.350> streaks<00:03:21.980> throughout<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.180> thought

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
chestnut streaks throughout it I thought

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.250 
chestnut streaks throughout it I thought
that<00:03:23.690> added<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.260> really<00:03:24.560> cute<00:03:25.070> touch<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:26.260> so

that added a really cute touch to it so

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.250 
that added a really cute touch to it so
it's<00:03:27.590> maybe<00:03:27.890> 22<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.880> 24<00:03:29.540> inches<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.230> back

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
it's maybe 22 to 24 inches in the back

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.760 
it's maybe 22 to 24 inches in the back
and<00:03:30.800> then<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.459> has<00:03:31.730> real<00:03:32.209> slight<00:03:32.810> layers<00:03:33.320> as
