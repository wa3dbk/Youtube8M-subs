00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 the greens 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.079
 the 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.749
 over there 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.769
 think it's a bit too 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.869
 that's what make the river district you are 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.110
 cameraman in the east of the city 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.110
 and therefore welfare work comes first 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.130
 eric feijten the 47-year-old as a cameraman has been traveling the world for years 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.550
 of the country after the war 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.710
 costs for bosnia the tsunami hectic in afghanistan 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.380
 together with and that is reporter Peter ter Velde and photographer could arise 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.000
 He made the documentary breeding in Help Afghanistan 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.990
 valkyrie detached from footage filmed by the soldiers themselves 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.820
 I meet facts in the museum airbase parts of which he is one of the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.240
 founders 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.240
 war as a child already fascinated by fifth 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.090
 after the vaccination is like crazy i'm a real arnhemmer 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.610
 and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.329
 so sees in this province would know 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.880
 is that that of course a lot happened in the second world war 6 4 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.090
 yes, that is also a bit for me with the spoon 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.470
 entered because 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.689
 thus my grandparents all like that all veterans 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.260
 who had landed with him and 44 at home 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.980
 and 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.410
 the year so I think the interest was a bit born and so 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.780
 maybe every day is a bit of a parallel, especially the profession we 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.550
 working hard at it 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.550
 saves a lot of scrap again yes exactly year yes 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.700
 and the story found it modern and that they often made the story more important 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.700
 then the object itself 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.239
 a day after a good first half year 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.239
 a 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.779
 when we were young 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.040
 the rumor sells the rankings 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.919
 of yellow 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.519
 it was a hell breeding 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.219
 an example for young female 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.219
 seen it up close with the boys 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.349
 that they 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.040
 look the title has fokking hell it is a cry that is used frequently 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.340
 Being in the studio was what we have collected in every moment 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.660
 that a bomb hit or happened in a sponge 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.039
 I heard someone so in the background of the population 100 watts 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.039
 and so the choice for the documentary title was made quickly 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.549
 but I do think that for a lot of boys that is a very difficult one 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.629
 time has been 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.769
 with the material that you have all been from the military 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.260
 having filmed it yourself is not crazy for a cameraman to be one 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.439
 make a documentary of what not all materials are fascinating 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.639
 it was very bad 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.200
 surprising considering that the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.310
 and what i wanted to give as an example is that if i can and i can get one 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.580
 can also handle young players in a friendly manner 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.290
 with that the camera started running with that you hear the light going on there 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.689
 yet it will behave differently than it does 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.889
 according to experts a new cloud 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.249
 until now a role has been looking for a while before it uniformly straightens 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.859
 it's a story 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.279
 What is special about it depends on what material they have collected 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:02.159
 have one of those from the boys 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.709
 is that it gives the total picture of the entire Afghanistan mission 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.709
 real pure raw reality 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.189
 but show it 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:38.689
 it worked 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.259
 9 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.990
 so there it is 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.990
 so you know it will be fun 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.180
 care so that's nice 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.050
 this was it 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.389
 write hahaha 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.389
 if that is not the case 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.770
 can bring in 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.099
 what kind of a can not do without a fight 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.479
 the family tree then a year ago of course it is you looking for ghost money it 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.719
 danger 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.659
 but tension what is well it is also a bit of tension of course it 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.990
 is not that I go there for the church 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.710
 but yes they think that the tension can sometimes be nice 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.919
 its a shame he can't take it anymore 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.339
 r 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.339
 well i think they do that one too 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.960
 that there are times when you have already realized that you are alive 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:04.369
 overtaking 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.759
 from
