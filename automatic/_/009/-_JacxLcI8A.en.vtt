00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:06.549 
and here yes and the masterminds works

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.360 
and here yes and the masterminds works
up<00:00:06.759> I<00:00:07.530> think<00:00:08.530> people<00:00:08.710> that<00:00:09.040> like<00:00:09.190> these

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
up I think people that like these

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.009 
up I think people that like these
systems<00:00:09.849> must<00:00:10.120> like<00:00:10.420> RV<00:00:10.809> is<00:00:10.990> to<00:00:12.780> these<00:00:13.780> like

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
systems must like RV is to these like

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.280 
systems must like RV is to these like
really<00:00:14.309> nice<00:00:15.309> these<00:00:16.030> this<00:00:16.360> is<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.660> six-pack

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
really nice these this is a six-pack

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.690 
really nice these this is a six-pack
premiere<00:00:17.620> for<00:00:17.860> someone<00:00:18.130> else<00:00:18.250> that's<00:00:18.490> your

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
premiere for someone else that's your

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.070 
premiere for someone else that's your
six-pack<00:00:19.060> nice<00:00:19.660> so<00:00:20.110> this<00:00:20.320> is<00:00:20.350> going<00:00:20.890> in<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.220> RV

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
six-pack nice so this is going in the RV

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.450 
six-pack nice so this is going in the RV
man<00:00:23.080> you<00:00:23.320> did<00:00:23.500> a<00:00:23.530> right<00:00:23.770> you<00:00:23.800> did<00:00:24.220> it<00:00:24.250> exactly

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
man you did a right you did it exactly

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
nothing in there that can rust this this

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.820 
nothing in there that can rust this this
little<00:00:37.300> time<00:00:37.810> consuming<00:00:38.140> part<00:00:38.860> of<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:40.830> thing

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
little time consuming part of the thing

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.390 
little time consuming part of the thing
i<00:00:42.720> endeavor<00:00:43.720> here<00:00:44.140> is<00:00:44.290> is<00:00:44.560> what<00:00:44.890> really<00:00:45.220> gets

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
i endeavor here is is what really gets

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.900 
i endeavor here is is what really gets
you<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:47.410> can<00:00:47.620> buy<00:00:47.800> all<00:00:48.040> the<00:00:48.220> parts<00:00:48.640> and

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
you see you can buy all the parts and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.850 
you see you can buy all the parts and
you<00:00:49.180> can<00:00:49.390> pile<00:00:49.810> them<00:00:50.020> in<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.230> box<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.710> they

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
you can pile them in a box and they

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.850 
you can pile them in a box and they
don't<00:00:51.040> cost<00:00:51.310> a<00:00:51.550> great<00:00:51.760> deal<00:00:52.470> probably<00:00:53.470> under<00:00:53.829> a

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
was like oh yeah he's here in Dallas and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.090 
was like oh yeah he's here in Dallas and
I'm<00:01:24.790> going<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.150> Houston<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:25.960> if<00:01:26.560> we<00:01:26.620> put<00:01:26.890> that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
I'm going to Houston so if we put that

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.730 
I'm going to Houston so if we put that
six-pack<00:01:27.580> in<00:01:27.820> there<00:01:27.970> man<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.210> it<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:29.080> haven't

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
six-pack in there man and it I haven't

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.680 
six-pack in there man and it I haven't
getting<00:01:29.950> seven<00:01:30.369> and<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.610> half<00:01:30.640> mile<00:01:31.150> again

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
getting seven and a half mile again

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.420 
getting seven and a half mile again
there<00:01:32.500> she<00:01:32.920> goes<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:35.470> when<00:01:35.650> they<00:01:35.830> when<00:01:36.280> they

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
there she goes but when they when they

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.460 
there she goes but when they when they
come<00:01:36.700> undone<00:01:37.150> like<00:01:37.479> this<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:38.020> start<00:01:38.260> wrapping

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
come undone like this and start wrapping

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.140 
come undone like this and start wrapping
up<00:01:38.799> there<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.100> little<00:01:39.340> bit<00:01:39.490> harder<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:39.880> work

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
up there a little bit harder to work

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.940 
up there a little bit harder to work
with

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.279 

well<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.909> you've<00:01:45.090> already<00:01:45.270> wound<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.140> one

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
well because you've already wound on one

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.709 
well because you've already wound on one
hour<00:01:46.500> these<00:01:47.369> things<00:01:47.700> start<00:01:47.969> bubbling<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
hour these things start bubbling the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.240 
hour these things start bubbling the
little<00:01:48.990> bitty<00:01:49.110> bubbles<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> hydrogen

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
little bitty bubbles are the hydrogen

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.580 
little bitty bubbles are the hydrogen
the<00:01:50.520> bigger<00:01:50.759> bubbles<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.299> oxygen<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.020> they

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the bigger bubbles are oxygen and they

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.120 
the bigger bubbles are oxygen and they
start<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> float<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.280> surface<00:01:54.140> they<00:01:55.140> push

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
start to float to the surface they push

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.090 
start to float to the surface they push
out<00:01:56.369> air<00:01:57.240> because<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.439> got<00:01:58.619> nowhere<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.039> go

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
out air because it's got nowhere to go

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.130 
out air because it's got nowhere to go
but<00:01:59.429> out<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.299> they<00:02:00.420> start<00:02:00.659> pushing<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
but out so they start pushing out the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.230 
but out so they start pushing out the
air<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:02.130> immediately<00:02:02.460> start<00:02:02.880> pushing

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
air he immediately start pushing

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.870 
air he immediately start pushing
everything<00:02:03.509> out<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.310> here

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
everything out of here and and then here

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
everything out of here and and then here
comes<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.390> hydrogen<00:02:06.929> here<00:02:07.170> comes<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.560> oxygen

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
comes the hydrogen here comes the oxygen

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.660 
comes the hydrogen here comes the oxygen
and<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.810> not<00:02:10.019> long<00:02:10.289> before<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.640> all

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and and it's not long before this is all

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.289 
and and it's not long before this is all
hydrogen<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:13.580> you're<00:02:14.580> taking<00:02:15.030> something

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
hydrogen here you're taking something

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.860 
hydrogen here you're taking something
that's<00:02:15.510> wasted<00:02:17.060> basically<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.239> me<00:02:18.450> if<00:02:18.660> your

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
that's wasted basically to me if your

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.440 
that's wasted basically to me if your
engines<00:02:19.349> running<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.890> your<00:02:20.450> your

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
engines running and your your

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.449 
engines running and your your
alternator's<00:02:22.230> pumping<00:02:22.680> out<00:02:22.829> energy<00:02:23.040> but

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
alternator's pumping out energy but

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.309 
alternator's pumping out energy but
you've<00:02:23.610> got<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> voltage<00:02:24.239> regulator<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.930> there

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
you've got a voltage regulator on there

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.339 
you've got a voltage regulator on there
because<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.390> don't<00:02:27.690> need<00:02:27.989> all

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
because you you really don't need all

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.770 
because you you really don't need all
that<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:29.250> charge<00:02:29.610> your<00:02:29.760> battery<00:02:30.150> after<00:02:30.360> you're

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
that to charge your battery after you're

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.330 
that to charge your battery after you're
driving<00:02:31.260> down<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.500> road<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.980> while<00:02:32.040> you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
driving down the road for a while you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.059 
driving down the road for a while you
really<00:02:32.610> don't<00:02:32.790> need<00:02:33.030> all<00:02:33.299> that<00:02:33.480> energy<00:02:34.069> when

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
really don't need all that energy when

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.610 
really don't need all that energy when
you<00:02:35.190> start<00:02:35.489> using<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.120> energy<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.810> you've

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
you start using that energy that you've

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.640 
you start using that energy that you've
been<00:02:37.799> wasting<00:02:38.370> all<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:39.180> time<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.319> purpose

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
been wasting all this time for a purpose

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.830 
been wasting all this time for a purpose
like<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:41.730> easy<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.150> make<00:02:42.480> so

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
like that and it's so easy to make so

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.600 
like that and it's so easy to make so
easy<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.260> separate<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.890> hydrogen<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.549> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
easy to separate the hydrogen and the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.610 
easy to separate the hydrogen and the
oxygen<00:02:44.670> as<00:02:45.420> if<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.720> touch<00:02:45.959> these<00:02:46.230> two<00:02:46.410> guys

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
oxygen as if I touch these two guys

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.539 
oxygen as if I touch these two guys
together<00:02:47.569> they're<00:02:48.569> grounded<00:02:48.930> together<00:02:49.549> and

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
together they're grounded together and

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:57.410 
together they're grounded together and
these<00:02:51.139> thing<00:02:52.139> and<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:55.670> but<00:02:56.670> if<00:02:56.819> I<00:02:56.940> touch<00:02:57.180> this

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
these thing and this but if I touch this

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.890 
these thing and this but if I touch this
to<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.989> may<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.440> work<00:02:58.549> see<00:02:59.549> until<00:03:00.450> we<00:03:00.660> get

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
to this it may not work see until we get

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.410 
to this it may not work see until we get
the<00:03:01.410> batteries<00:03:01.920> hooked<00:03:02.100> up<00:03:02.370> when<00:03:03.060> we<00:03:03.180> get<00:03:03.269> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
the batteries hooked up when we get the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.970 
the batteries hooked up when we get the
batteries<00:03:03.780> hooked<00:03:03.930> up<00:03:04.109> if<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.350> did<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.709> that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
batteries hooked up if I did like that

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.819 
batteries hooked up if I did like that
they<00:03:05.790> would<00:03:05.970> work<00:03:06.150> see<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.780> side<00:03:07.170> these<00:03:07.530> four

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
they would work see this side these four

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.270 
they would work see this side these four
cells<00:03:08.160> are<00:03:08.430> separate<00:03:09.209> from<00:03:09.239> those<00:03:09.600> for<00:03:10.280> both

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
cells are separate from those for both

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.729 
cells are separate from those for both
ground<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.019> relay<00:03:13.019> they<00:03:13.230> got<00:03:13.410> their<00:03:13.590> own

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
ground and relay they got their own

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.440 
ground and relay they got their own
these<00:03:14.040> got<00:03:14.340> their<00:03:14.489> own<00:03:14.579> set<00:03:14.819> of<00:03:14.850> grounds<00:03:15.299> in

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
these got their own set of grounds in

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.180 
these got their own set of grounds in
their<00:03:16.049> own<00:03:16.200> really<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.680> their<00:03:16.829> own<00:03:16.950> power

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
their own really in their own power

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.460 
their own really in their own power
these<00:03:17.760> have<00:03:18.030> their<00:03:18.209> own<00:03:18.239> power<00:03:18.600> ground<00:03:19.049> relay

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
these have their own power ground relay

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.000 
these have their own power ground relay
okay<00:03:20.450> 30<00:03:21.450> earth<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:21.959> place<00:03:22.230> green<00:03:22.799> earth

health<00:03:23.340> place<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.299> installed<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:26.060> created

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
health place that installed and created

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.530 
health place that installed and created
the<00:03:27.799> electrolyzers<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.049> is<00:03:31.230> really

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
the electrolyzers so this is really

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.449 
the electrolyzers so this is really
their<00:03:33.540> creation<00:03:34.519> but<00:03:35.519> my<00:03:35.730> baby<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
their creation but my baby the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.699 
their creation but my baby the
mothership<00:03:40.010> just<00:03:41.010> ready<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.880> roll<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:43.530> can

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
mothership just ready to roll you can

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.390 
mothership just ready to roll you can
see<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.919> bubbles

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
see the bubbles

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.600 
see the bubbles
oh<00:03:47.340> yeah<00:03:49.650> yeah<00:03:50.650> like<00:03:51.069> straight<00:03:51.340> out<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.519> the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
oh yeah yeah like straight out of the

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.809 
oh yeah yeah like straight out of the
x-files<00:03:52.140> hmm<00:03:53.140> i<00:03:53.319> think<00:03:53.950> i'm<00:03:54.280> going<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.579> put

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
x-files hmm i think i'm going to put

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.339 
x-files hmm i think i'm going to put
that<00:03:54.849> on<00:03:55.120> out<00:03:55.269> once<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.599> while<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.930> some<00:03:56.110> place

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
that on out once a while to some place

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.920 
that on out once a while to some place
in<00:03:56.680> i'm<00:03:57.549> not<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.849> video<00:03:58.090> tape<00:03:58.299> when<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.599> starts

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
in i'm not the video tape when it starts

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.190 
in i'm not the video tape when it starts
out<00:03:59.049> clear<00:03:59.409> how<00:04:00.099> fast<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.640> starts<00:04:00.909> to<00:04:01.030> bubble

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
out clear how fast it starts to bubble

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.300 
out clear how fast it starts to bubble
because<00:04:02.200> we<00:04:02.560> just<00:04:02.739> turn<00:04:03.010> this<00:04:03.129> on<00:04:03.370> like

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
because we just turn this on like

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.339 
because we just turn this on like
I<00:04:04.370> should<00:04:05.120> have<00:04:05.270> been<00:04:05.510> recording<00:04:06.080> home<00:04:06.230> we

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
I should have been recording home we

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.540 
I should have been recording home we
turned<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.709> RV

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
turned on the RV

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.520 
turned on the RV
should<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.180> run<00:04:08.360> inside<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:08.840> now<00:04:09.320> they're

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
should I run inside and now they're

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.480 
should I run inside and now they're
merchants<00:04:09.950> who<00:04:10.220> can't<00:04:10.520> see<00:04:10.760> their<00:04:11.060> own

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
merchants who can't see their own

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.670 
merchants who can't see their own
I<00:04:11.580> mean<00:04:11.970> they<00:04:12.060> were<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:12.330> this<00:04:13.370> 27

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
I mean they were like this 27

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.130 
I mean they were like this 27
now

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
now

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.090 
now
very<00:04:19.140> first<00:04:19.410> first<00:04:20.010> hybrid<00:04:20.660> RV<00:04:21.800> this<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.950> the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
very first first hybrid RV this is the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.040 
very first first hybrid RV this is the
coolest<00:04:23.310> thing<00:04:23.610> no<00:04:23.970> one<00:04:24.180> has<00:04:24.420> anything<00:04:24.780> like

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
coolest thing no one has anything like

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.280 
coolest thing no one has anything like
this<00:04:26.150> we're<00:04:27.150> rolling<00:04:27.300> with<00:04:27.600> hydrogen<00:04:28.110> now

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
this we're rolling with hydrogen now

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:54.720 
this we're rolling with hydrogen now
baby

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.090 

rather<00:04:55.730> go
