course she wanted me to fix them

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.690 
course she wanted me to fix them
the<00:00:30.599> last<00:00:30.810> ones<00:00:31.170> when<00:00:31.590> she<00:00:31.740> broke<00:00:31.949> him<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.579> took

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the last ones when she broke him we took

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.860 
the last ones when she broke him we took
him<00:00:32.820> back<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.090> where<00:00:33.210> she<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.660> glasses

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
him back to where she got the glasses

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.799 
him back to where she got the glasses
and<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:35.190> no<00:00:35.399> longer<00:00:35.430> could<00:00:36.210> get<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> frames

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
and they no longer could get the frames

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.270 
and they no longer could get the frames
for<00:00:37.110> those<00:00:37.260> glasses<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> lenses

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
for those glasses and the lenses

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.220 
for those glasses and the lenses
themselves<00:00:38.460> are<00:00:38.879> real<00:00:39.000> expensive<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.690> think

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
themselves are real expensive I think

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.560 
themselves are real expensive I think
that<00:00:40.350> these<00:00:40.469> glasses<00:00:41.129> cost<00:00:41.340> six<00:00:42.210> hundred<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that these glasses cost six hundred and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.590 
that these glasses cost six hundred and
seventy<00:00:42.899> dollars<00:00:42.930> or<00:00:43.379> something<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
seventy dollars or something like that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.860 
seventy dollars or something like that
so<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.930> ordered<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.829> new<00:00:47.250> set<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> actually<00:00:48.780> my

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
so I ordered a new set of actually my

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.650 
so I ordered a new set of actually my
daughter<00:00:49.020> ordered<00:00:49.379> them<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.710> me<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> new<00:00:50.190> frame

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
daughter ordered them for me a new frame

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.810 
daughter ordered them for me a new frame

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the temple broke just like this same

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.220 
the temple broke just like this same
broke<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> same<00:00:59.850> side<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.930> might<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
broke on the same side it might be a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.720 
broke on the same side it might be a
weakness<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> design<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.370> something<00:01:02.640> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
weakness in the design or something I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670 
weakness in the design or something I
don't<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.049> had<00:01:04.140> broken<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.500> this

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
don't know now if it had broken on this

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.420 
don't know now if it had broken on this
side<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:07.590> would've<00:01:07.740> been<00:01:07.799> okay<00:01:07.920> because<00:01:08.250> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
side it would've been okay because I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
side it would've been okay because I
could<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.700> taken<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.090> temple<00:01:09.600> off<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.930> put

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
could have taken this temple off and put

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.830 
could have taken this temple off and put
it<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.500> newer<00:01:10.979> frame<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> old

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840

left of it so we're going to use some of
the<00:01:31.950> white<00:01:32.130> stuff<00:01:34.070> unfortunately<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.280> had

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the white stuff unfortunately if I had

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.740 
the white stuff unfortunately if I had
gold<00:01:35.640> color<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.090> would<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.240> great<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.720> don't

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
gold color it would be great but I don't

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.690 
gold color it would be great but I don't
don't<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.829> any<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.400> I'm<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
don't have any of that so I'm going to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.920 
don't have any of that so I'm going to
use<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> generous<00:01:39.540> sized<00:01:39.780> piece<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:41.930> can

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
use a generous sized piece here you can

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.240 
use a generous sized piece here you can
see<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.320> they're<00:01:43.619> about<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.700> long

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
see that they're about that long

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.499 
see that they're about that long
it's<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.610> important<00:01:48.060> how<00:01:48.149> long<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it's not really important how long the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.730 
it's not really important how long the
piece<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.290> long<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.939> too<00:01:51.090> long

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
piece is as long as it can be too long

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.399 
piece is as long as it can be too long
you<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.189> beat<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.490> short<00:01:54.409> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
to get it on though

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.660 
to get it on though
and<00:02:04.720> then<00:02:05.080> we'll<00:02:05.350> put<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.590> back<00:02:05.620> together<00:02:05.890> with

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
and then we'll put it back together with

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.320 
and then we'll put it back together with
my<00:02:06.790> glasses<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:07.390> I<00:02:07.450> can<00:02:07.480> see<00:02:07.630> what<00:02:07.810> I'm<00:02:07.900> doing

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.390 
glasses like this to be a lens or hold
on<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:17.730> slide<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.880> together<00:02:19.290> now<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.320> have<00:02:20.740> fixed

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
on to slide it together now I have fixed

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.440 
on to slide it together now I have fixed
glasses<00:02:21.910> like<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.210> before<00:02:22.720> by<00:02:24.360> putting<00:02:25.360> a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
glasses like this before by putting a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.850 
glasses like this before by putting a
little<00:02:25.630> bit<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.810> superglue<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.440> there<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
little bit of superglue in there and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.260 
little bit of superglue in there and
gluing<00:02:27.100> them<00:02:27.160> together<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.790> lasts<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.240> a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
gluing them together that lasts for a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.190 
gluing them together that lasts for a
little<00:02:28.450> while<00:02:28.570> but<00:02:28.690> it's<00:02:28.840> not<00:02:28.960> going<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.110> be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
little while but it's not going to be

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.140 
little while but it's not going to be
anywhere<00:02:29.440> near<00:02:29.620> as<00:02:29.710> strong<00:02:29.920> as<00:02:30.070> this<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:31.030> now

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
anywhere near as strong as this so now

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.670 
anywhere near as strong as this so now
we'll<00:02:31.300> slide<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.690> heat<00:02:31.990> shrink<00:02:32.260> tubing<00:02:32.560> over

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
we'll slide this heat shrink tubing over

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.590 
we'll slide this heat shrink tubing over
it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
now slide it as far down as you can get

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:44.100 
now slide it as far down as you can get
it<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.220> go<00:02:37.709> snag<00:02:38.709> on<00:02:38.950> something<00:02:43.020> turn<00:02:44.020> it

you're ready to use the heat so for the
heat<00:03:25.950> I'm<00:03:26.190> using<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.940> heat<00:03:27.840> gun<00:03:29.300> hairdryer<00:03:30.300> if

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
heat I'm using a heat gun hairdryer if

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.020 
heat I'm using a heat gun hairdryer if
it's<00:03:31.170> really<00:03:31.410> powerful<00:03:31.830> one<00:03:31.890> might<00:03:32.400> be<00:03:32.430> enough

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
it's really powerful one might be enough

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.090 
it's really powerful one might be enough
to<00:03:33.060> do<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:34.410> course<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.680> can<00:03:34.800> do<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:34.980> with

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
to do this of course you can do it with

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.670 
to do this of course you can do it with
a<00:03:35.130> Bic<00:03:35.340> lighter<00:03:35.370> or<00:03:35.850> propane<00:03:36.240> torch<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:37.380> since

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
a Bic lighter or propane torch but since

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.130 
a Bic lighter or propane torch but since
this<00:03:37.860> is<00:03:37.920> most<00:03:38.760> classes<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.300> plastic<00:03:39.750> lenses

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
this is most classes that plastic lenses

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.170 
this is most classes that plastic lenses
it's<00:03:41.010> not<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> good<00:03:41.400> idea<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.730> use<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.850> flame

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
it's not a good idea to use a flame

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.690 
it's not a good idea to use a flame
because<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.570> could<00:03:42.750> damage<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.110> lens<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.709> the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
because you could damage the lens so the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.530 
because you could damage the lens so the
heat<00:03:44.880> gun<00:03:45.360> like<00:03:45.600> this<00:03:45.780> works<00:03:45.990> great<00:03:50.540> keep

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
heat gun like this works great keep

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.300 
heat gun like this works great keep
moving<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.020> heat<00:03:52.200> around<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:52.950> get<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.100> nice

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
moving the heat around so you get a nice

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:05.920 
moving the heat around so you get a nice
even<00:03:53.520> shrink

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.539 

okay<00:04:06.930> I've<00:04:07.349> set<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.769> heat<00:04:07.950> gun<00:04:08.129> down<00:04:08.340> where

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
okay I've set the heat gun down where

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.979 
okay I've set the heat gun down where
it's<00:04:08.670> not<00:04:08.760> going<00:04:08.879> to<00:04:08.970> melt<00:04:09.120> something<00:04:09.599> or

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
it's not going to melt something or

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.320 
it's not going to melt something or

catch anything on fire and let it cool
as<00:04:13.319> soon<00:04:13.500> as<00:04:13.590> it's<00:04:13.709> cool<00:04:13.890> it's<00:04:14.099> ready<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.340> use

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
as soon as it's cool it's ready to use

everybody there how to fix their glasses
and<00:04:27.660> she<00:04:28.380> suggested<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.979> make<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.160> little<00:04:29.340> video

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
and she suggested I make a little video

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:38.600 
and she suggested I make a little video
memory<00:04:31.199> card<00:04:31.470> full<00:04:37.070> all<00:04:38.070> right<00:04:38.190> well<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.400> ran

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
memory card full all right well I ran

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.730 
memory card full all right well I ran
out<00:04:38.760> of<00:04:38.789> memory<00:04:39.030> on<00:04:39.180> my<00:04:39.330> little<00:04:39.510> camera<00:04:39.810> on<00:04:40.110> the

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
out of memory on my little camera on the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.100 
out of memory on my little camera on the
one<00:04:40.889> on<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.130> side<00:04:41.370> here<00:04:41.639> but<00:04:42.510> that's<00:04:42.900> all

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
one on the side here but that's all

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.140 
one on the side here but that's all
there<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.949> it

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
there is to it

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.670 
there is to it
this<00:04:45.510> is<00:04:45.690> ready<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.990> go<00:04:46.139> and<00:04:46.350> that's<00:04:46.470> pretty

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
this is ready to go and that's pretty

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.260 
this is ready to go and that's pretty
strong<00:04:46.979> you<00:04:47.340> have<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.610> hard<00:04:47.789> time<00:04:47.910> getting<00:04:48.180> that

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
strong you have a hard time getting that

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.450 
strong you have a hard time getting that
off<00:04:48.479> of<00:04:48.750> there<00:04:48.900> it's<00:04:49.530> not<00:04:49.680> completely<00:04:50.070> cooled

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
off of there it's not completely cooled

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.520 
off of there it's not completely cooled
yet<00:04:50.669> so<00:04:50.850> I<00:04:50.910> can't<00:04:51.150> yank<00:04:51.389> on<00:04:51.539> it<00:04:51.570> but<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.289> did<00:04:52.500> a

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
yet so I can't yank on it but I did a

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.969 
yet so I can't yank on it but I did a
another<00:04:53.400> one<00:04:53.610> earlier<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.800> made<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.830> mistake

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
another one earlier and made a mistake

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.029 
another one earlier and made a mistake
on<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.430> video<00:04:56.729> too<00:04:57.410> on<00:04:58.410> that<00:04:58.620> one

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
on that video too on that one

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.320 
on that video too on that one
I<00:04:59.070> cut<00:04:59.789> a<00:04:59.820> second<00:05:00.300> piece<00:05:00.560> like<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:02.240> slid<00:05:03.240> it

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
I cut a second piece like this slid it

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.529 
I cut a second piece like this slid it
up<00:05:03.449> over<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.870> temple<00:05:04.580> want<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:06.030> double<00:05:06.389> this

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
up over the temple want to double this

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.540 
up over the temple want to double this
up<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:06.960> then<00:05:07.110> heat<00:05:07.620> shrunk<00:05:07.889> that<00:05:08.010> on<00:05:08.340> there

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
up and then heat shrunk that on there

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.730 
up and then heat shrunk that on there
and<00:05:08.700> I<00:05:09.389> have<00:05:09.570> some<00:05:09.900> footage<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.440> can<00:05:10.590> show

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
and I have some footage that I can show

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.110 
and I have some footage that I can show
you<00:05:10.800> if<00:05:10.979> where<00:05:11.099> I<00:05:11.130> try<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.370> take<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.729> apart

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
you if where I try to take that apart

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.980 
you if where I try to take that apart
that's<00:05:12.960> next<00:05:14.389> this<00:05:15.389> is<00:05:15.450> what<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.810> looks<00:05:15.930> like

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
that's next this is what it looks like

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.980 
that's next this is what it looks like
after<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.470> cooled<00:05:17.060> so<00:05:18.060> I'm<00:05:18.630> going<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.810> do<00:05:18.960> a

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
after it cooled so I'm going to do a

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.540 
after it cooled so I'm going to do a
little<00:05:19.200> testing<00:05:19.620> here<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.889> see<00:05:20.039> how<00:05:20.130> strong<00:05:20.370> it

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
little testing here to see how strong it

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.029 
little testing here to see how strong it
is<00:05:20.669> that<00:05:21.450> feels<00:05:21.840> really<00:05:22.410> strong

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
is that feels really strong

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.860 
is that feels really strong
I'm<00:05:23.520> putting<00:05:23.940> quite<00:05:24.090> a<00:05:24.120> bit<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.389> pressure<00:05:24.599> on

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
I'm putting quite a bit of pressure on

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.270 
I'm putting quite a bit of pressure on
there<00:05:26.870> if<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:28.020> do<00:05:28.080> too<00:05:28.470> much<00:05:28.620> it<00:05:28.830> probably<00:05:29.160> will

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
there if I do too much it probably will

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.379 
there if I do too much it probably will
feels<00:05:29.580> like<00:05:29.729> it's<00:05:29.849> going<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.030> break<00:05:30.210> right

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
feels like it's going to break right

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.180 
feels like it's going to break right
there<00:05:31.070> so<00:05:32.070> I<00:05:32.130> can<00:05:32.220> get<00:05:32.340> it<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.520> come<00:05:32.639> apart<00:05:34.190> that

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
there so I can get it to come apart that

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.420 
there so I can get it to come apart that
sucker<00:05:35.490> does<00:05:35.729> not<00:05:35.910> want<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.240> move<00:05:37.250> that<00:05:38.250> will

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
sucker does not want to move that will

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.659 
sucker does not want to move that will
last<00:05:39.289> probably<00:05:40.289> too<00:05:40.440> long<00:05:40.620> probably<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.490> one

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
last probably too long probably the one

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.580 
last probably too long probably the one
layer<00:05:41.910> is<00:05:42.090> going<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.300> be<00:05:42.389> enough<00:05:42.660> you<00:05:43.410> know<00:05:43.470> the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
layer is going to be enough you know the

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.350 
layer is going to be enough you know the
worst-case<00:05:43.950> scenario<00:05:43.979> is<00:05:44.430> if<00:05:44.789> the<00:05:44.940> one<00:05:45.120> layer

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
worst-case scenario is if the one layer

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.080 
worst-case scenario is if the one layer
isn't<00:05:45.750> enough<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.229> it<00:05:46.919> bends<00:05:47.190> too<00:05:47.460> much<00:05:47.639> do

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
isn't enough and it bends too much do

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.460 
isn't enough and it bends too much do
you<00:05:48.120> take<00:05:48.330> it<00:05:48.510> off<00:05:48.660> heat<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.050> up<00:05:49.139> a<00:05:49.229> little<00:05:49.349> bit

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
you take it off heat it up a little bit

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.990 
you take it off heat it up a little bit
take<00:05:49.650> it<00:05:49.800> off<00:05:49.950> and<00:05:50.130> put<00:05:50.190> a<00:05:50.310> new<00:05:50.430> piece<00:05:50.610> on<00:05:50.789> there

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
take it off and put a new piece on there

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.879 
take it off and put a new piece on there
double<00:05:51.450> it<00:05:51.539> up<00:05:54.110> okay<00:05:55.110> that's<00:05:55.320> all<00:05:55.500> for<00:05:55.650> today

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
double it up okay that's all for today

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.740 
double it up okay that's all for today
now<00:05:56.460> you<00:05:56.520> can<00:05:56.700> pick<00:05:56.849> your<00:05:57.000> own<00:05:57.060> glasses<00:05:57.360> in

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
now you can pick your own glasses in

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.710 
now you can pick your own glasses in
just<00:05:58.080> a<00:05:58.169> few<00:05:58.320> seconds
