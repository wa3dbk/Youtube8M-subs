small damage up 0.3 damage up but it

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.830 
small damage up 0.3 damage up but it
also<00:01:11.130> greatly<00:01:11.430> increases<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.000> chance<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.689> see

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
also greatly increases the chance to see

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
also greatly increases the chance to see
champion<00:01:13.290> enemies<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> goes<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.460> in

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
champion enemies it goes up to a one in

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.370 
champion enemies it goes up to a one in
three<00:01:14.760> chance<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.270> opposed<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> regular

one<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.920> 20<00:01:17.189> chance<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> lot

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
work and real quick I just want to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.870 
work and real quick I just want to
mention<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.409> socks<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> special<00:01:44.310> item<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
mention the socks is a special item and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.100 
mention the socks is a special item and
I'm<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.090> too<00:01:45.210> sure<00:01:45.360> why<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:45.659> none<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
I'm not too sure why because none of the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170 
I'm not too sure why because none of the
other<00:01:46.229> speed<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.860> special<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.060> does

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
other speed up so special this one does

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.910 
other speed up so special this one does
confer<00:01:48.509> spiked<00:01:49.020> resistance<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.770> don't

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
confer spiked resistance but I don't

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.139 
confer spiked resistance but I don't
think<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.220> enough<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.520> warrant<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.850> special

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
think that's enough to warrant a special

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.490 
think that's enough to warrant a special
anyway<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:51.899> gonna<00:01:51.990> go<00:01:52.170> kill<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> couple

taking absolutely no damage which i

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.720 
taking absolutely no damage which i
think<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.560> actually<00:02:10.739> really<00:02:11.400> cool<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.580> really

like<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.239> socks<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.540> think<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.750> could<00:02:12.900> stand<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200

book of despair and you'll see it's
doing<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.040> exact<00:04:31.370> same<00:04:31.669> amount<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.510> might

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
doing the exact same amount it might

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.730 
doing the exact same amount it might
look<00:04:32.840> like<00:04:32.900> more<00:04:33.139> they<00:04:33.260> just<00:04:33.440> cuz<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.620> was

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
look like more they just cuz I was

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.990 
look like more they just cuz I was
killing<00:04:33.949> to<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.190> once<00:04:34.370> but<00:04:34.550> watch<00:04:34.699> one<00:04:34.910> I<00:04:34.940> just

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
killing to it once but watch one I just

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.030 
killing to it once but watch one I just
kill<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.360> one<00:04:35.479> over<00:04:35.690> here<00:04:35.870> you'll<00:04:36.620> see<00:04:36.800> it

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
kill this one over here you'll see it

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.490 
kill this one over here you'll see it
kind<00:04:37.250> of<00:04:37.370> kills<00:04:38.180> enemies<00:04:38.600> at<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:38.960> exact<00:04:39.320> same

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
kind of kills enemies at the exact same

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.689 
kind of kills enemies at the exact same
rate<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:39.860> think<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.100> would<00:04:40.190> be<00:04:40.280> really<00:04:40.430> cool

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
rate and I think it would be really cool

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.150 
rate and I think it would be really cool
if<00:04:40.970> oh<00:04:41.419> this<00:04:42.139> could<00:04:42.320> be<00:04:42.380> tricky<00:04:42.650> if<00:04:42.889> that

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
if oh this could be tricky if that

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.800 
if oh this could be tricky if that
didn't<00:04:43.400> actually<00:04:43.520> happen<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:44.090> think<00:04:44.120> that<00:04:44.479> tier

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
didn't actually happen I think that tier

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.500 
didn't actually happen I think that tier
stat<00:04:45.050> upgrade<00:04:45.350> should<00:04:45.380> actually<00:04:45.800> cause<00:04:45.979> it<00:04:46.010> to

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
stat upgrade should actually cause it to

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.600 
stat upgrade should actually cause it to
the<00:04:47.510> damage<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.470> take<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.680> little<00:04:48.919> bit<00:04:49.160> faster

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
the damage to take a little bit faster

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.100 
the damage to take a little bit faster
oh<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:49.910> gotta<00:04:50.240> get<00:04:50.360> closer<00:04:50.600> for<00:04:50.720> this<00:04:50.930> guy<00:04:51.050> to

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
oh I gotta get closer for this guy to

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.330 
oh I gotta get closer for this guy to
pop<00:04:51.320> up<00:04:51.530> another<00:04:52.490> thing<00:04:52.760> is<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:54.830> affected

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
pop up another thing is it is affected

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.580 
pop up another thing is it is affected
by<00:04:55.460> damage<00:04:55.940> ups<00:04:56.180> but<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.930> tier<00:04:57.199> will<00:04:57.380> never

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
by damage ups but the tier will never

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.110 
by damage ups but the tier will never
get<00:04:57.800> any<00:04:58.010> bigger<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:58.520> it<00:04:58.580> won't<00:04:58.699> get<00:04:58.790> red<00:04:59.000> when

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
get any bigger and it won't get red when

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.090 
get any bigger and it won't get red when
it<00:04:59.270> passes<00:04:59.449> a<00:04:59.630> certain<00:04:59.870> damage<00:05:00.289> threshold<00:05:00.560> or

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
it passes a certain damage threshold or

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.000 
it passes a certain damage threshold or
anything<00:05:01.370> like<00:05:01.610> that<00:05:02.260> it<00:05:03.260> always<00:05:03.440> kind<00:05:03.710> of<00:05:03.830> it

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
anything like that it always kind of it

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.379 
anything like that it always kind of it
always<00:05:04.190> is<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.520> exact<00:05:04.760> same<00:05:04.910> size<00:05:05.120> but<00:05:05.270> it

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
always is the exact same size but it

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.960 
always is the exact same size but it
will<00:05:05.510> do<00:05:05.660> more<00:05:05.780> damage<00:05:05.990> in<00:05:06.289> fact<00:05:06.699> speaking<00:05:07.699> of

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
will do more damage in fact speaking of

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.370 
will do more damage in fact speaking of
doing<00:05:08.120> more<00:05:08.330> damage<00:05:08.510> I'm<00:05:08.840> going<00:05:09.169> to<00:05:09.260> give

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
doing more damage I'm going to give

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.020 
doing more damage I'm going to give
myself<00:05:09.560> another<00:05:10.010> item<00:05:10.250> right<00:05:10.520> now<00:05:10.669> there<00:05:10.880> is
