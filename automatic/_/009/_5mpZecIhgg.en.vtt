and<00:00:26.220> stuff<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.789> me<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.289> performs<00:00:28.289> perfectly

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
and stuff like me it performs perfectly

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.890 
and stuff like me it performs perfectly
and<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> great<00:00:29.849> all-around<00:00:30.119> processor<00:00:30.869> i

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and it's a great all-around processor i

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.749

have several friends that use it and
it's<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.360> they<00:00:33.899> say<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.440> great<00:00:34.710> processor

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340

put<00:01:10.860> an<00:01:10.950> SSD<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.640> build<00:01:11.850> mainly<00:01:12.180> because

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
put an SSD in this build mainly because

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.390 
put an SSD in this build mainly because
that<00:01:12.720> cost<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.229> extra<00:01:13.530> six<00:01:13.740> dollars<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that cost like an extra six dollars and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
that cost like an extra six dollars and
that<00:01:14.520> sacrificed<00:01:15.119> money<00:01:15.390> from<00:01:15.570> our<00:01:15.659> graphics

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that sacrificed money from our graphics

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.499 
that sacrificed money from our graphics
card<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.470> cpu<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.759> went<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> hard
